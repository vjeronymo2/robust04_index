			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THERE'S NO TOUGHER WAY FOR RAIDERS TO END YEAR  </P> <P> Baby, it's cold outside, highs predicted in the teens, wind-chill headed for  minus numbers, and let's hear a big Gotham welcome for our visitors from  Southern California.  </P> <P> What's the opposite of a day at the beach?  </P> <P> Welcome to the Raiders' Last Stand.  </P> <P> They're 6 1/2-point underdogs to the Giants today. Even if they pull the upset,  they need losses by Indianapolis and Cincinnati to reach the playoffs.  </P> <P> It's not Mission: Impossible, but it's close. Mort Oldshan of the Gold Sheet  figures the odds against the Raiders at 25-1.  </P> <P> The Raiders were here 11 weeks ago in Art Shell's debut, but that was on a  balmy October night against the Jets. Giants Stadium put up green bunting to  mask the Giants Blue of the stands. No camouflage was possible for the Jets  themselves, and the Raiders won, 14-7.  </P> <P> This is the big team in town, with season tickets handed down in wills,  guaranteed sellouts and fans braving the elements like entertainment-starved  Denver-ites.  </P> <P> A week ago, there were 72,142 in the stands and 4,944 no-shows on a subzero  wind-chill day, with the 1-14 Cowboys in town. The Giants won, 15-0, securing a  playoff berth for the first time since winning Super Bowl XXI in Pasadena.  </P> <P> They need to win to clinch the NFC East, so the Raiders get no break there,  either. A victory means a week off to the Giants, who need it.  </P> <P> Talk about your improbable champions . . .  </P> <P> Take away linebackers Lawrence Taylor and Carl Banks and quarterback Phil  Simms, and there aren't a lot of Giants left who were in the Rose Bowl on Jan.  25, 1987.  </P> <P> Gone are Harry Carson, Jim Burt, George Martin, Phil McConkey, Brad Benson,  Karl Nelson, Billy Ard and Chris Godfrey. Joe Morris and Mark Bavaro are  injured.  </P> <P> That's three members of their defensive front, five of their six offensive  linemen and their leading rusher.  </P> <P> This team is 11-4?  </P> <P> Leading rusher Ottis Anderson has averaged 3.1 yards a carry with his 949  yards.  </P> <P> If he reaches 1,000, he'll have the lowest average of any NFL back ever to gain  that many -- by a mile. The lowest to date is Morris' 3.5-yard average last  season.  </P> <P> Anderson is 32 and didn't have this many rushes, 302, in 1985 through '88  combined -- 260.  </P> <P> The Giants thought so little of Anderson before Morris was hurt in the  exhibition season, they exposed him to Plan B free agency and, when there were  no takers, re-signed him at a 50% pay cut.  </P> <P> The once-feared Giant defense has recorded 35 sacks, one more than the Raiders.  </P> <P> The Giants have allowed 45 sacks, five more than the Raiders.  </P> <P> Simms has 14 interceptions to go with his 14 touchdown passes.  </P> <P> The Giants have the flair of Coach Bill Parcells -- none -- but they're his  proudest achievement: They're rock-ribbed, conservative and effective.  </P> <P> Not for them those Ram niceties of winning pretty. The Giants maintain a  running game by flat-out insisting on it. They run on first and second downs  and let Simms deal with third-and-longs. If the crowd boos, well, the waiting  list isn't short on patrons who'd be grateful to see line plunges.  </P> <P> And they still have those linebackers . . .  </P> <P> The runt of the group is Gary Reasons: 6-feet-4, 235 pounds. He blew Bobby  Humphrey out of the sky on a highlight-film hit at the goal line that the  locals are calling 1989's version of the inspirational '86 Bavaro reception, on  which he ferried half the 49er defense downfield.  </P> <P> The others are more famous: Taylor, 6-3, 243; Banks, 6-5, 235, and Pepper  Johnson, 6-3, 248.  </P> <P> Their specialty is the goal-line stand. In the last three weeks, they've denied  each foe any points at all on a first-and-goal. Their percentage against the  fourth-down conversion is 23.5%, best in the league. Remember, these are mostly  fourth-and-ones.  </P> <P> "They've probably got the best front seven in football," Shell said. "They've  always had those outside linebackers. Pepper Johnson is having as good a year  as anybody.  </P> <P> "We go over their personnel as a coaching staff. After Terry Robiskie got done  talking about their outside linebackers, I said, 'I guess we can't run on them,  we might as well go home.' "  </P> <P> Shell is 7-4 and could have mailed this one in if his defensive coordinator had  been able to contain Dave Krieg. If the Raiders had won in Seattle, they'd  already be in the playoffs.  </P> <P> Shell, of course, is getting a lot of help from Al Davis, but some of it hasn't  been as helpful as they'd hoped.  </P> <P> Davis liked Zeph Lee, the former USC running back whom he switched to safety.  It took half the season before the defensive coaches could get Lee out and the  able Mike Harden in full time.  </P> <P> Lee was subsequently waived without announcement.  </P> <P> A Raider source said Davis expressly ordered Shell not to use Marcus Allen on a  goal-line dive in Seattle, as Shell had done against Phoenix the week before.  </P> <P> The source said Davis told Shell and Robiskie they shouldn't have done that,  either, despite the fact that Allen's dives converted a fourth-and-two and  produced the winning touchdown.  </P> <P> California Gothic, to the end.  </P> <P> Raider Notes  </P> <P> There was much woofing back and forth about the cold and the gusty winds of  Giants Stadium, but the Raiders will, indeed, have to run effectively against  the league's No. 5 unit against the rush. . . . Said Giant Coach Bill Parcells:  "This time of year, if you're not used to coming here, it's a little different  . . . (At) our practice (Wednesday), it was about 16 degrees. We were out there  2 1/2 hours."  </P> <P> Said Raider Coach Art Shell: "Hey, it's going to be cold. And I don't care what  anyone says, they're going to be cold, too. I don't care where you are, you  don't become accustomed to it. They're going to be just as cold as we are. . .  . I can remember, we went to Cleveland (for the 1980 Ice Bowl), and Dave Dalby  went out in just his T-shirt for early warm-ups, like he'd normally do. I  thought he was crazy. His mind-set was, 'I'm not going to let the conditions  bother me.' I wouldn't do that. I didn't think it was smart. Dave was a  different breed."  </P> <P> Add different breed: Bo Jackson was primed to hit 1,000 yards last week in his  10th game. A Raider source said Bo was talking about just what it would take --  156 yards. Indeed, Jackson again ran like a man possessed in the first half,  when he got 53 yards, before taking a shot to the ribs. After that, he  continued to play in obvious pain, winning some real respect. "He's got torn  rib cartilage," the Raider said. "He's hurt as badly as any running back we've  got. You've got to respect him. Last year, I didn't care if he came back here  or not." Jackson needs 87 yards to get his 1,000 now, and the Raiders need him  to get them.  </P> <P> Raider left guard John Gesek and left tackle Rory Graves, 1-2 on the team in  holding calls, will be matched against the Giants' right end Leonard Marshall,  who has nine sacks, and Lawrence Taylor, who has 13 1/2. Graves is listed as  doubtful with a sprained foot. If he can't go, journeyman Steve Wright will. .  . . Raider quarterback Steve Beuerlein, on the Giant rush: "Call me stupid, but  I don't worry about it. I have confidence in my line. . . . I'll take a few  hits. That's my game. I'll stand in there."  </P></p>

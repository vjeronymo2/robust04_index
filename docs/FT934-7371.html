			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Dixons under pressure SUGGESTIONS that Dixons' much vaunted deal to sell its loss-making US subsidiary Silo may have come unstuck knocked the shares, already under pressure following Amstrad's profits warning. Dixons firmly denied the US deal rumour to analysts and the shares rallied in late trading. They closed at 270p, after touching 266p, down 7 on the day. Turnover in the stock came to 4.4m. The Silo deal, in which Dixons agreed to sell the group to Fretter, another US retailer, in return for equity has underpinned the revival in the share price since it was disclosed in September. Although analysts said the details are taking longer to finalise than expected, all were dismissive of the speculation. Dixons was also said to be trying to play down the importance of its connections with Amstrad, arguing that the amount of trade with the electrical components group was shrinking. Amstrad shares have been among the market's best performers in the past couple of weeks as talk of imminent good trading news triggered exceptionally heavy buying interest in the traded options as well as the cash market. They dropped yesterday after the company shocked the market by issuing a profits warning only minutes before the annual meeting. The meeting was 'noisy and angry; there were a lot of upset shareholders', said one analyst who attended the gathering. Amstrad's statement warned that it was worried that sales and margins would not match last year's levels and that present City expectations of sales and profits for the current year were likely to be optimistic. The news devastated Amstrad's share price, which fell sharply from an early 54 1/2 p to end 10 3/4 down at 43p. Turnover was a hefty 16m shares.</p>

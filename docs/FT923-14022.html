			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, Ireland (9): Mood of realism - Treasury management FROM his spacious office on the top floor of one of Dublin's finest new buildings, Dr Michael Somers can look out over the city and wonder where on earth all the money has gone. As the head of the agency charged with managing Ireland's massive national debt, he is entitled more than most to ponder this as he juggles with billions of pounds of debt incurred in the high-spending 1980s, and seeks to cut the cloth to the style of the more responsible 1990s. Ireland has one of the highest per capita debt ratios in the EC, both in absolute and in relative terms. At the end of 1991 it stood at IPounds 25.4bn, or about IPounds 6,500 for every person in the country. The total debt swelled alarmingly in the early and mid-1980s as successive governments borrowed heavily to finance spending at home through deficit budgeting. Between 1982 and 1987 the debt more than doubled, from IPounds 11.7bn to IPounds 23.7 bn It wasn't until 1987 that politicians finally began to listen to what senior department of finance officials and independent economists had been saying for years: that such a level of borrowing was fast becoming unsustainable and a threat to the country's financial independence. Even the public began to appreciate that the enormity of the figures demanded immediate action. Dr Somers, chief executive of the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA), says that by 1987 the size of the debt had become a very real problem. He credits Mr Charles Haughey's government, which came to power after winning a general election that year, with bringing a new commitment to tackle the debt problem. One of the key elements in the government's new approach was the creation of the NTMA, a semi-state agency which was handed management of the debt portfolio from the department of finance. Dr Somers himself had been head of the debt management unit within the department for several years. In 1985 he had been appointed secretary of the department of defence, but was brought back into finance in 1987, when Fianna Fail returned to power, to take charge of the debt portfolio. 'We were losing staff hand over fist,' Dr Somers remembers. They were poached by stockbroking firms and banks in the private sector keen to avail themselves of the expertise they had developed in capital markets, and able to offer them much higher salaries than the public purse. An embargo on recruitment into the civil service also hindered their replacement. The government asked Citibank to review its debt management operations and suggest ways in which it could be made more efficient. AFTER toying with the idea of hiring specialist staff on contract or handing debt management operations over to a bank in the private sector, the government opted to establish the NTMA, and introduced legislation which saw the agency set up at the end of 1990. Its aims, he says, were to improve the maturity profile of the debt portfolio and to save money. Of the total debt of IPounds 25.4bn at the end of 1991, some IPounds 9bn is in foreign currencies. Of the Irish pound portion, about IRPounds 4.1bn is held by non-resident investors. For 1992, the cost of interest payments and the repayment of certain sinking funds is put at IPounds 2.4bn, and this does not include capital repayments. The maturity profile of the medium to long-term foreign currency debt shows loans of up to IRPounds 1.1bn repayable in 1995 and 1996, and from 1998 through to 2000. It is the NTMA's task, Dr Somers says, to refinance that maturity profile, pushing repayment dates out further by switching where appropriate into longer dated borrowings at cheaper rates. The foreign currency debt service ratio is expected to amount to 6.6 per cent in 1992. This compares with an average of 7.9 per cent for the period 1986/91. A key objective is to ensure that obligatory debt repayments in any one year are kept to a level that can be readily refinanced to avoid the risk that new money might not be forthcoming, or available only at exorbitant cost. With this in view, there is an ongoing programme to repay a proportion of loans several years before their final maturity and refinance them with loans of longer maturity. Of the foreign currency debt, some 32 per cent is denominated in Deutschmarks, 30 per cent in Swiss francs, 15 per cent in dollars, and the rest spread between ECU, yen, sterling and florins. About 63 per cent is fixed, with 37 per cent in floating rates. At the end of 1991 IPounds 6.2bn - 70 per cent - of the foreign debt had been redeemed early and replaced. The NTMA uses the Dublin bond market to service and redeem the government's domestic debt. It plays a crucial role in issuing and trading gilts on the market, where turnover in 1991 is estimated at IPounds 100bn. This year the NTNMA has to repay and refinance some IPounds 1.6bn in maturing gilts. It has designated four stocks as benchmark issues, with maturity dates in 1996, 2001, 2006 and 2012, with the objective of building up the amounts outstanding to around IPounds 1bn in each case. It also holds gilt auctions from time to time to supplement sales via the tap system. The government has set an exchequer borrowing requirement of IPounds 592m, or 2.1 per cent of GDP, for 1992. Last year the EBR reached 1.9 per cent of GDP compared to the budget target of 1.7 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PADRE FAN FAVORITE RETURNS;  </P> <P> FLANNERY CAUGHT WAVE AT END OF LAST SEASON  </P> <P> Tim Flannery won't give out the name of the place. If he gives out the name,  next thing he knows, somebody is rooting around up there in a boutonniere  passing out business cards and looking for building permits.  </P> <P> He will say it is in remote Santa Barbara County. And he will give a  translation.  </P> <P> "The Indians used to call it Gateway of Souls," he explained. "You get up  there, and you see why. The most beautiful coastline, the most unspoiled water.  . . . it's a world we don't live in anymore."  </P> <P> It is in this Gateway of Souls that Flannery recovers his every winter. He  leaves his job as a Padre infielder to spend a total of six weeks roaming the  10 1/2 miles of coastline, living in a tent. There is fishing during the day,  sitting by the fire and telling lies at night.  </P> <P> But more than all that, there is surfing. It is the earthly thing Flannery  loves more than anything but his family and blue-collar baseball. To hear his  good friend and former big-leaguer Gary Woods tell it, it is something in which  Flannery possesses magic.  </P> <P> "There's a spot up there, one of the most beautiful spots on the coast, where  Flannery loves to surf," Woods explained. "We call it Flann's Place, and every  night as the sun is going down, he wants to go there. Sometimes the wind is not  right, the water is not high, and it's worthless. But it doesn't matter to him.  He'll sit there on the edge of the water and wait and persevere. Sometimes for  as long as an hour, he will wait there.  </P> <P> "And then all of a sudden, things will change. The wind will turn around, the  waves will get big, and it will be some of the best surfing ever. It's like  Flann has the magical touch."  </P> <P> So it has happened for Flannery on the baseball field. He joined the Padre  organization in 1978 as a graduate of Anaheim High and Chapman College who was  too small, too slow and couldn't jump to save his shoelaces.  </P> <P> In the 12 years since, he has yet to be a full-time, full-season starter. He  has a .257 career average as a platoon player and bench jockey, including a  .159 career average against left-handed pitchers, better than only one big  leaguer in the past 14 years. He hasn't hit a homer since 1986 -- only two  other big-leaguers have gone without a home run in more at-bats. And a couple  of years ago, he suffered from a torn right ankle that still requires nightly  icings and will never get better.  </P> <P> Yet within the baseball world, he has waited and persevered and refused to  leave. And today, that tide has turned. In his 10th major league season, there  is no Padre who receives more standing ovations, more outward shows of respect  than Tim Flannery. There may be no Padre in the club's 20-year history who has  been more loved.  </P> <P> Fans love it that he still plays. He still gets dirty. He still yells at  opponents' pitchers and still slides on his nose.  </P> <P> Fans love it that, unlike bigger Padre stars of the past, they can always count  on him. He has hit more than .300 with runners on base in three of the past  four seasons. That includes .304 last year, when he scored eight of 10 runners  from third with fewer than two out.  </P> <P> "The fans look at Flannery and say, 'If he can succeed, anything is  attainable,' " Woods said. "They say, 'If he can play like this, than I can go  home and be successful pounding my nails.' "  </P> <P> Check it out April 3 at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. Flannery won't be in the  starting lineup -- he has never started an opener -- but amid the applause for  the Tony Gwynns and Jack Clarks, one ovation will stand out. If the past is any  indication, the cheers for the introduction of Flannery may last a minute and  seem like an hour.  </P> <P> And if the past is any indication, Flannery may cry.  </P> <P> "There have been tears in my eyes before, and I'm sure they will be there  again," Flannery said. "The fact that I have been accepted here, I don't take  that for granted. Not for one minute. Look at me, how can I take anything for  granted?"  </P> <P> With Tim Flannery having recently signed a one-year contract, and with top  young infielders sprouting from all levels of the Padre organization, one  question is sure to be asked of him all summer.  </P> <P> Is this his last?  </P> <P> "Hard for me to answer that," said Flannery, who will be 32 by the season's  end. "The way I've figured it, every summer has been my last summer."  </P> <P> But if he does retire?  </P> <P> "This much I promise you: I'm buying season tickets over the dugout and giving  our players hell," he said. "I've told guys on the team, when they hear some  beer-drinking loudmouth yelling at them to hustle, look up there. It's going to  be me."  </P> <P> That's OK, because most of them would listen. Even the most narrow-visioned of  them could not miss the war that Flannery won last year with hustle, a victory  over time and logic, one that ensured he would not be in those box seats this  season.  </P> <P> Flannery's long-term guaranteed contract was up at the end of 1988. The Padres  possessed an option, but as late as July 1 of last season, they weren't  inclined to pick it up. Popularity and clubhouse chemistry is nice, but at the  time, Flannery and his bad ankle had accounted for a .226 average and six RBIs.  For the first time in his career, he had been reduced to strictly a  pinch-hitting role, which he accepted by getting all of one hit in his first 15  pinch plate appearances.  </P> <P> His play-every-year-as-it-were-your-last line was no longer just a line.  </P> <P> "All of a sudden it was like, every at-bat was my last at-bat," Flannery said.  "I thought there was a real chance that I was gone."  </P> <P> As best he could, he returned to the surf. He called his surfing buddy Woods, a  Santa Barbara native whose nine-year big-league outfielding career -- including  stops in Toronto, Houston and with the Chicago Cubs -- ended in 1986. They  talked about their great winters together. And they talked about the problem.  </P> <P> "He called me and said he didn't know what to do," Woods recalled. "He told me  he thought his back was finally to the wall."  </P> <P> If his back wasn't precisely at the wall, Woods' advice pinned it there.  </P> <P> "I told him his problem was easy, that he had two choices," Woods said. "I told  him he could learn to pinch-hit well, regardless of the odds, or he could quit.  Simple as that. Do it or quit.  </P> <P> "I used the word 'quit' a lot. I knew that would get to him."  </P> <P> Did it ever. Flannery proceeded to hit .296 in July and .355 in August. In his  final 11 pinch appearances, he collected seven hits, including five consecutive  at one time, tying a club record. He wound up as the National League's  seventh-best pinch-hitter with a .308 average in 26 at-bats.  </P> <P> And that option year? It was picked up by the Padres in mid-September, ensuring  Flannery one more season at $400,000.  </P> <P> "He proved he is still an important member of this club," Manager Jack McKeon  said. "The opportunity was there, and he went after it and got it."  </P> <P> So what if $400,000 is not the major league average. Flannery has never made  the major league average. For once, he and his friends said, the money wasn't  the thing.  </P> <P> "He looks at last year like the most important thing he's done in his career,"  said Dave Smith, Houston reliever and another surfing buddy. "He did the same  thing he's had to do every spring -- make the team -- but did it during the  heat of the season. That's not easy."  </P> <P> Said Flannery: "I'm more proud of that than anything I've ever done  individually. They didn't just bring me back because people like me. Baseball  is a business, they wouldn't do that. I earned a spot. I earned this."  </P> <P> Not that Flannery thinks the fans would accept anything less. That's what he  likes about San Diego, and what he thinks some more ego-conscious players hate.  </P> <P> "Baseball players aren't that big of a deal to people in San Diego," Flannery  said. "All they want is an honest day's work from them. They work eight hours a  day, and they want the same attitude from you.  </P> <P> "Some players have it tough here because fans don't worship them. People don't  move to San Diego for the sports, they move because of the quality of life.  They have their heads screwed on straight, they know what's important.  Ballplayers aren't larger than life. Hard, honest work -- that's what's big."  </P> <P> That and surfing, at least to Flannery.  </P> <P> "If you ask me, that's a big part of Flannery's appeal," Woods said. "Like a  large part of his audience down there, he's not afraid to take on the water."  </P> <P> At dawn of an off-day last season, Randy Ready, Padre third baseman and novice  surfer, was preparing to enter the ocean when he thought he spotted a seal in  the dark water. Upon closer inspection, he was wrong.  </P> <P> "It was just Flannery," he recalled.  </P> <P> Ever since Flannery bought his first board at age 13, he has been sold. His  older brother, Greg, would drive him from Anaheim to the Leucadia beaches north  of San Diego, but only after he pulled weeds.  </P> <P> "My dad thought I was becoming a hippie, so he made me pull weeds every time I  surfed to make sure I stayed straight," Flannery said of his father, a preacher  at the First Christian Church of Anaheim.  </P> <P> Today, although his activities have been somewhat slowed by a  no-responsibility-for-surfing-accidents clause in his contract, Flannery still  looks and acts every bit the surfer. His blonde hair is thinning, but his tan  is still dark, and his voice still speaks in reverent tones about "The  landlord."  </P> <P> "You know, the great white shark," Flannery explains. "Out there, he's the  landlord."  </P> <P> Flannery doesn't surf under the Huntington Beach Pier at midnight anymore, but  "I still surf when necessary," he said.  </P> <P> This means whenever he is tense. Whenever he is worried about life's little  things. Whenever he wants to be reminded of both his good fortune and  fragility.  </P> <P> "Flann likes surfing because it can humble you," Smith said. "In a second, it  can humble you."  </P> <P> Said Flannery: "You have to approach surfing like you approach pinch-hitting --  you go all out and accept that fact that the result will be either outhouse or  castle. Either you'll be great or terrible. But at least you won't have  hesitated."  </P> <P> "Flann attacks the water," Ready said. "Some guys go out there to paddle around  and talk, but Flann works it hard."  </P> <P> Although Flannery has never been injured surfing, once off the San Clemente  coast he was taken under the water by a current for what he figures was a full  minute, for what he thought were his last moments on earth.  </P> <P> "When I finally came up, I got out of the water, put my board on my car, drove  away and didn't surf for three weeks," Flannery recalled. "But I came back."  </P> <P> Just as he always does. Just as he will keep doing for at least one more year.  </P> <P> "Tell you right now, if I retire, there will be no big deal made," Flannery  said with a laugh. "The fans don't owe me anything. Tell them I've had a great,  great, great time here. Tell them, hey, it's been fun, I'll see them in the  water."  </P> <P> Padre Notes  </P> <P> The Padres' Sunday workout, contrary to what may have been implied from  previous reports, is not open to the public. San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium will  still be undergoing preparations for Monday's opening night against San  Francisco. . . . Opening night starter Eric Show pitched his final spring  innings Wednesday, allowing the Angels two runs on five hits in five innings,  en route to an eventual 6-5 Padre victory. The only thing even mildly  disturbing was his four walks. In his 29 2/3 spring innings, he has walked 15,  just one less than his 16 strikeouts. This works out to 4.5 walks per nine  innings after he allowed just two walks per nine innings last season. "I'm not  worried about my control, you don't do what I did all of last season and then  just lose it," said Show, who finished his spring with a 3.95 ERA. "My stuff  has been good, and that's what's important. When you lose your stuff, it  becomes a lot more mysterious." Show said that after pitching three opening  days, this one won't have him quite so worried. "I might start thinking about  it, well, when I arrive at the ballpark," he said of Monday's 7:20 p.m. game  against the San Francisco Giants and Rick Reuschel. "I'll be excited but, you  know, I've done this before." . . . After the Padres took a 4-2 lead in the top  of sixth Wednesday following Show's departure, reliever Mark Grant promptly  blew that lead by allowing two runs in two innings. The Padres finally won it  for good with two runs in the eighth on back-to-back RBI doubles by Roberto  Alomar and Luis Salazar, who played center and right fields, his fourth and  fifth different positions in four days since joining the Padres from the  Detroit Tigers Sunday (shortstop, third base and left field were the other  three). . . . After Wednesday's game, the Padres departed Palm Springs for San  Diego, where they will play their sixth annual game against San Diego State  tonight at 7:05 at Jack Murphy. They will wind up their spring schedule with  weekend games in Las Vegas, against the Seattle Mariners (Friday) and the  Padres triple-A affiliate Las Vegas team (Saturday) . . . Catcher Benito  Santiago gave the Padres a bit of a scare Wednesday when his hand collided with  Wally Joyner's bat on a throw to second. But afterward, Santiago was lifting  weights in the clubhouse and smiling. "Everything is fine, everything this  spring has been fine," Santiago said. He probably will finish the spring as the  club's leading hitter. He went two for three Wednesday to improve his average  to .426. . . . There were a couple of firsts Wednesday -- Tony Gwynn struck out  for the first time this spring after 59 at-bats (against Angel rookie pitcher  Jim Abbott) while second baseman Alomar committed his first error of the  spring. The left side of the Padre infield, on the other hand, has committed  21. . . . Remember pitcher Mark Davis' two holes-in-one on golf courses this  spring? Wednesday morning, fewer than 24 hours after his latest ace, Davis shot  a 16 on one hole.  </P></p>

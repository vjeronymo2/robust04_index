There is an  important prerequisite in establishing the socialist market  economic system. That is to persistently uphold the predominant  role of the socialist public ownership system. In his report  delivered at the 14th National CPC Congress, Comrade Jiang Zemin  explicitly pointed out: "The socialist market economy is a  component part of the basic system of socialism. So far as the  ownership structure is concerned, for a long time to come we  should allow diverse sectors of the economy to develop side by  side. The public sector, which includes enterprises owned by  collectives, is to remain predominant, with the private sector,  which includes individually owned and foreign-owned enterprises,  as a supplement."    Right now, naturally very few people would openly oppose  the predominant role of the public ownership system. However,  there are also people who adopt various forms to covertly or  overtly express their different views on this issue. If we act  in accordance with these views, we would either make the  predominant role of the public ownership system totally vanish,  or change it into something that only exists in name but not in  essence. The so-called "theory of predominance" is one of these  views.    Those who advocate the "theory of predominance" have  said: To let the public ownership system play the predominant  role does not mean that the socialist public ownership system  must play a predominant role in quantity and in production value  in the national economy. The predominant role in terms of  "quantity" is a "burden and encumbrance" which should be  discarded and changed into a "predominant role of a guidance  nature." What is a "predominant role of a guidance nature"? That  is, it is only necessary to maintain the public ownership system  in a limited number of "non-competitive basic industries." It  share should be lowered to 10 to 20 percent. It should not  exceed a maximum share of 30 percent. The large portion of the  remaining industries must be left to the non-public economical  sector. It is said that by managing this limited number of  "non-competitive industries" well, it would be able to "guide"  the whole national economy to forge ahead. "Although it is small  in size, it functions efficiently." Therefore, it is called the  "theory of predominance." Can we agree with this kind of view?    Any thing or event, either a natural phenomenon or a  social phenomenon, must have a definite quantity to be its  carrier. Without a definite quantity, there will be no definite  quality. To have a definite quality, we must have definite  quantity. Quantitative changes of a thing have their limits. If  quantitative changes exceed their limits, the quality of the  thing or event will change. This thing will become something  else. Let us take water as an example. It is a transparent  liquid composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Under  standard atmospheric pressure, water will become ice when its  temperature reaches zero degree Centigrade. It will start to  boil and become steam, when its temperature reaches 100 degrees  Centigrade. That is to say that quantity and quality are  conditional and interchangeable. Both quantity and quality have  their own limits. "When quality reaches its limits, it becomes  quantity." "Pure quantitative changes may also become  qualitative changes."    Social phenomenon is of no exception. In a capitalist  society, there not only exists the capitalist ownership system,  there also exists the individual ownership system, the  capitalist cooperative system and so on. However, the main basic  means of production is in the hands of the bourgeoisie. A large  number of labor forces are commodities, and the capitalist  relations of production become the "light which illuminates  everywhere." This society is exactly the capitalist society. To  replace the capitalist system with the socialist system, the  most important sign is that the proletariat must seize the  political power and that workers hold the capitalists' means of  production in their own hands, and establish the system of  ownership of means of production. One of the basic special  features of socialism with Chinese characteristics is to make  the public ownership system of means of production the  predominant and the other economic sectors a supplement. Without  the predominant role of the public ownership system of means of  production, there will be no socialism with Chinese  characteristics. This is simple and sound reasoning. Naturally,  in the course of building socialism, it is difficult to define  the share of the public ownership system and the share of the  non-public ownership system in the different stages of  development of the productive forces. However, as far as the  whole country is concerned, if the share of the public ownership  system drops to the extent that it no longer plays the  predominant role, is not strong enough to restrain or decide the  development of the whole national economy, and its status as the  economic foundation of the socialist system is shaken, while the  share of the non-public ownership system rises to the extent  that it may greatly affect or even overpower the public  ownership system, can it still be said that the predominant role  of the public ownership system is being maintained? No matter  what kind of high-sounding names such as "guidance nature" or  "qualitative type" are bestowed upon the public ownership  system, the answer is self-evident.    It also makes people feel doubtful if it is said that  the public economic sector will be able to play a "guidance"  role if it is limited to control a small number of  "non-competitive basic industries." People realize that  according to labor sequence and degree of processing, industries  can be divided into infrastructural facilities, basic industries  and the processing industry. Once again the processing industry  can be divided into rough (primary) finishing and precision  (fine) finishing. Infrastructural facilities and basic  industries are important industrial sectors which play a basic  role in the development of the national economy. Without the  development of infrastructural facilities and basic industries,  the development of the processing industry and the entire  national economy is out of question. Particularly the energy  industry, the raw and semi-finished product industry and the  communications and transportation industries are bottlenecking  economic development. It was precisely for this reason that as  soon as we had the political power in our hands, we confiscated  the basic industries with the capital of imperialists and  Kuomintang bureaucrat-capitalists, and turned them into state  properties. During the 40 some years after the building of New  China, we have once again amassed a large amount of manpower and  material and financial resources, and invested hundreds of  billions of yuan to build and develop, batches after batches,  infrastructural facilities, basic industries and major  engineering projects which have laid a solid material foundation  for socialist construction and played a significant role in the  development of the national economy. However, as seen from the  entire national economy, infrastructural facilities and basic  industries only provide a part of the material foundation. It is  impossible to develop the national economy without a decent  processing industry in high technology even if there are  infrastructural facilities and basic industries, because these  facilities and industries are unable to provide the finished  products. People can neither eat nor wear them. Separating basic  industries from the processing industry is just like developing  the processing industry without basic industries. The national  economy will become a deformed lame duck. In addition, the  development of today's productive forces and science and  technology are, to a great extent, manifested in the processing  industry. We cannot develop basic industries if our technology  in the processing industry is backward. It is necessary to bring  into full play the predominant role of the public ownership  system not only in the development of infrastructural facilities  and basic industries, but also in the development of the major  processing industry. Let us ask this question: Would it work if  we let the public economic sector withdraw from all key  departments in machine building industry, electronics industry,  astronautics industry, chemical industry and other industries of  high technology and let the non-public economic sector fill in  its vacancies? It would not work even in the light and textile  industries, let alone the major industries mentioned before. The  development of light and textile industries directly affects  people's livelihood and the state accumulation. Right now the  overwhelming majority of state-run large and medium-sized  enterprises which account for a large portion of China's light  and textile industries are running well. Their varieties of  designs, colors, quality and even management are better than the  small enterprises of the non-public economic sector. In this  connection, the state-owned enterprises are playing an exemplary  and guiding role. The original management system of state-owned  enterprises are full of problems. It must be reformed; its  technology upgraded, and its structure readjusted. Other  economic sectors must also be allowed and encouraged to develop  themselves. However, is there any good reason why we should  bring about economic changes and replace the public economic  sector with the non-public economic sector? Right now, basic  industries account for approximately 28 percent of China's total  industrial output value, while the processing industry about 39  percent. If we change the public economic sector which account  for 39 percent of the output value into non-public economic  sector and if the public economic sector is only allowed to  develop "non-competitive" basic industries in accordance with  the views of those who advocate the "theory of predominance,"  what portion will be left over for the public economic sector to  develop? (What does it mean by "non-competitive" anyway? Under  the conditions of the market economy, what sector of the economy  is "non-competitive"?)    Important special features of infrastructural facilities  and basic industries are large investments, long construction  cycle, slow investment returns, high labor intensity for  workers, and small profits. These features are more conspicuous  in "non-competitive" basic industries. However, things are  reversed in the processing industry. Right now, many departments  in China's basic industries have yielded low economic results.  Several trades suffered losses continuously for many years.  Perhaps such losses can be attributed to the special features  mentioned before. Another reason for the losses is the  excessively low price which is even below the production cost.  The public ownership system cannot be blamed for the low price.  It is not caused by poor enterprise management. It is mainly  because of an unreasonable pricing structure. An enterprise has  no authority to fix the price. When the price is being  determined, it is necessary to take into consideration the needs  of the macro-economic control and the abilities of all sectors  to take the burden. In other words, these lines of business  offer lower prices and suffer losses, because they often take  the overall national economy into consideration, sacrifice their  own interests, shift a part of "economic results" to the private  enterprises, "Sino-foreign joint ventures, cooperative and  solely foreign-funded enterprises" and individually owned  enterprises which use infrastructural facilities and the  products of basic industries when they sell their products at  lower prices or even profit-free to the processing industry or  other departments. This kind of situation reflects the role of  state-run enterprises and the macro-economic control. However,  can we go on like this forever? What would be the result if we  continue acting in such a way? Why should we let the public  economic sector engage in trades that make small or almost no  profit or even suffer losses, while allowing the non-public  economic sector handle those trades which are able to sell their  products at higher prices, and reap larger profits with little  investments and a quicker turnover rate of capital funds? What  kind of role would the socialist public ownership system play?  Is there a need for us to let the state-run enterprises forever  take the blame of "operating with low economic efficiency" while  covertly shifting their large amount of profits to others?</p>

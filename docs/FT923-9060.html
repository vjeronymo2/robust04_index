			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Senate rejects mine claims moratorium THE US Senate has thrown out a proposal to place a one-year moratorium on federal land sales to mining companies and adopted a watered-down 'reform' measure criticised as a 'giveaway' to the industry. The mining industry hailed the vote as a victory. But Mr John Knebel, president of the American Mining Congress, said the industry, which has battled with environmentalists over land reclamation standards, was 'by no means finished with this saga.' Senator Dale Bumpers, a Democrat from Alabama, sought the moratorium to give congress more time to consider tougher reform legislation. The Bumpers reform Bill, which is still in committee, aims to change completely a century-old system under which anyone can explore US federal lands for as little as Dollars 2.50 an acre after discovery of a valuable mineral deposits. Senator Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, said a one-year moratorium would shut down mineral exploration. His proposal, which was passed, requires federal land to be sold at fair market value, but does not place a royalty on the Dollars 3.9bn worth of minerals that private concerns extract from federal lands every year. Also, it says land must be returned to the federal government if no minerals are extracted. Mr John Knebel, president of the American Mining Congress, the industry lobby, said the Senate took a 'proper step' to reform mining law without changing the its basic law structure.</p>

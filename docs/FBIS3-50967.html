			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas (Mexico), 10 Jan (EFE) --  The Mexican Armed Forces are preparing a large offensive against  the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) in Chiapas State  and have moved approximately 15,000 soldiers, 40 tanks, planes,  helicopters, and paratroopers to that southern area. The "final  offensive" to be launched by the military this week will have  the town of Guadalupe Tepeyac -- the only one still under rebel  control -- as its main objective, the Mexican media asserted  today, Monday.    Several Social Security employees have indicated that  approximately 200 rebels are holding approximately 100 Guadalupe  Tepeyac Hospital physicians and nurses hostage at those  installations. The hospital is 800 meters from the Guatemalan  border.    Unofficial reports also indicate that former Chiapas  Governor  General Absalon Castellanos could also be held in Guadalupe  Tepeyac. Castellanos was kidnapped by the rebels a day after the  conflict began, and the rebels announced that they intended to  subject him to a summary trial.    None of the reporters assigned to the area or the residents  of the cities negatively affected by the conflict have been able  to confirm reports on the Armed Forces offensive because the  roads that lead to the area have been closed by the Mexican Army.    There continues to be an important movement of troops at the  colonial city of San Cristobal de las Casas, the entrances to  which are guarded by tanks, and according to the media, large  numbers of soldiers are constantly arriving. Military  checkpoints in the Chiapas jungle and mountain regions have also  been reinforced. Not even the civilians who want to take  potable water, medicine, and food to relatives trapped in the  conflict area are allowed to pass. Local radio stations are  constantly broadcasting messages requesting help for the  besieged residents or reports that they are well so relatives in  other regions can be at ease.    On 1 January the EZLN took up arms against the Mexican  Government, declared war on the Armed Forces, and seized several  communities. Since then the confrontations have not stopped,  and according to unofficial reports, at least 200 are dead and  1,000 injured.    In its counteroffensive, the Mexican Army managed to push  the  rebels to the mountainous area surrounding San Cristobal de las  Casas and is currently searching for the guerrilla's general  headquarters, which is hidden in Lacandona jungle.    The last reported clash took place at the 31st Military Zone  garrison in Rancho Nuevo, 10 km from Ocosingo, yesterday,  Sunday. The National Defense Secretariat has not reported  casualties on either side.    On that same day the Army arrested Mexican priest Isidro  Guillermo Badillo Brana at the border between Chiapas and  Tabasco States. He is charged with commanding a group of rebels  and was transferred to the military installations in San  Cristobal de las Casas. The local church has demanded the  parish priest's immediate dismissal and announced that if it is  not done the church will ask for intervention by the National  Human Rights Commission (CNDH.)    According to the National Defense Secretariat, the 106  rebels  who have been arrested revealed important information regarding  the EZLN's organization, its ties with Central American rebel  groups, and the orientation of its leaders. The Attorney  General's Office reported in a communique that according to the  rebels' testimony, at least two of the EZLN leaders are  Guatemalans -- Commanders Marcos and Jesus -- and it is they  who headed the takeover of San Cristobal de las Casas.    The Judicial Police and the Army have begun to search for  both leaders, who apparently participated in the Rancho Nuevo  clash at the beginning of the hostilities when five soldiers  were killed.</p>

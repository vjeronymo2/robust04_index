			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS ORDER MUSEUM MERGER STUDY;  </P> <P> POLITICS: THE PLAN WOULD HAVE THE MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY TAKE OVER THE  ARBORETA AND BOTANIC GARDENS. OPPOSITION IS DEVELOPING TO THE PROPOSAL.  </P> <P> The Board of Supervisors on Tuesday ordered a 30-day feasibility study of a  proposal to merge the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History with the  Arboreta and Botanic Gardens department, but there were strong indications of  quickly escalating opposition to the plan.  </P> <P> The board, acting on a motion by Supervisor Mike Antonovich -- whose 5th  District includes the county's two largest arboretum facilities -- unanimously  ordered the Citizens Economy and Efficiency Commission to study the merger  proposal. The commission was created a decade ago to review possible  consolidations of county departments.  </P> <P> Even the decision to approve the preliminary study, however, produced  indications among the board that there is uncertainty over how the merger,  which has been strongly advocated by the natural history museum, would play out  politically. The stiffening of discontent was reminiscent of development of  opposition three years ago to an unsuccessful proposal by the natural history  museum to take over the privately-owned Southwest Museum in Mount Washington.  </P> <P> In a statement released after the board vote Tuesday morning, the California  Arboretum Foundation -- the largest of five separate private agencies that  raise funds for the arboreta -- denounced the merger proposal as a "land grab."  "To have this occur while the county is reported to be supportive of Earth Day  seems ironic and incongruous," said Alice Frost Thomas, president of the  foundation.  </P> <P> Supervisor Ed Edelman told the board he was aware of developing opposition to  the merger from among the private arboretum support groups. "They are," said  Edelman, "very much concerned about any consolidation that will take from them  their independence."  </P> <P> On the other hand, Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, whose district includes the main  natural history museum in Exposition Park and its satellite George C. Page  Museum at the La Brea Tar Pits, demanded that the natural history museum retain  supremacy in any merged natural science facilities complex.  </P> <P> "I won't want to have the Museum of Natural History play second fiddle to  flowers," Hahn declared.  </P> <P> The development of a political controversy over the plan prompted Supervisor  Pete Schabarum, chairman of the board, to emphasize that approval of the  feasibility study does not constitute endorsement of the museum merger. "Nobody  should get excited," Schabarum emphasized. "We are just taking a look-see."  </P> <P> Craig Black, director of the natural history museum, declined through a  spokeswoman to comment.  </P> <P> Under the merger proposal -- disclosed 10 days ago by The Times following  several weeks of consideration of the plan by the office of county Chief  Administrative Officer Richard Dixon -- the natural history and Page museums  would take over the Arboreta and Botanic Gardens. The department includes the  State and County Arboretum in Arcadia, Descanso Gardens in La  Canada-Flintridge, the South Coast Botanic Gardens in Palos Verdes and the  Virginia Robinson Estate in Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> The six facilities that would make up the combined agency together have a  current fiscal year budget of nearly $20 million. They have a combined total of  nearly 400 employees and hosted nearly 2 million visitors last year. Merging  the two primary entities would constitute one of the largest consolidations of  natural science museum facilities ever undertaken in the United States.  </P> <P> The merged entity -- whose name has not yet been determined -- would also  provide newly constructed facilities for the privately held Western Foundation  of Vertebrate Zoology, one of the nation's most significant collections of  ornithological materials. The foundation, originally organized by Ed N.  Harrison, president of the natural history museum's county-appointed board of  governors, has been searching for a new structure for several years.  </P> <P> In recent years, the foundation has tried and failed to find accommodations on  the UCLA campus and at Greystone Mansion in Beverly Hills. In January of this  year, Western Foundation officials visited Descanso Gardens to identify  potential sites for a new headquarters building with between 20,000 and 40,000  sq. ft. of space.  </P> <P> The merger plan appeared to be developing into a test of wills between the Los  Angeles County Museum of Natural History Foundation, the private group that  financially supports the museum and is legal owner of some of its collections,  and the California Arboretum Foundation and the four other arboretum  fund-raising groups.  </P> <P> "We are unalterably opposed to such use of land that is supposedly dedicated to  environmental purposes," said the arboretum foundation's Thomas. She said the  boards of the five fund-raising groups held an emergency meeting last week and  met on Monday afternoon with Dixon to express their discontent.  </P> <P> Thomas charged that Francis Ching, who retired as director of the Arboreta and  Botanic Gardens April 1, was forced out after he refused to support the plan to  build a new headquarters structure for the Western Foundation of Vertebrate  Zoology at Descanso Gardens.  </P> <P> Ching said of his departure "I think that now I can see why I was given gentle  persuasion to leave at this time." He said Dixon urged him to accept early  retirement last month, telling him he believed Ching could not muster three  votes necessary on the Board of Supervisors to resist forced ouster.  </P> <P> "There was really no choice," Ching said. He said he was encouraged to leave  because of his opposition to the Western Foundation relocation, as well as his  resistence to a plan first proposed a year ago to relocate the natural history  museum's botany department to the arboretum and disband the independent  research staff of the Arboreta and Botanic Gardens.  </P> <P> The arboretum foundation said it had demanded Ching's temporary reinstatement  as head of the arboreta and the immediate beginning of a nationwide search for  a new director. The arboreta department is currently headed by Leon Arnold, an  interim appointment.  </P> <P> "These facilities are intended to be green space. It's not open space  (available for) building. It is a living laboratory," Thomas said. "Our  missions are totally different from the mission of the natural history museum."  </P></p>

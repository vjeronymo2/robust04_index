			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] London, Sanaa, Aden -- A south Yemen military source  has said that the fighting with northern forces in Zinjibar,  Mudiyah, and Lawdar in Abyan Governorate was settled at midday  yesterday. And that troops of the al-'Amaliqah Brigade -- who  were wearing civilian clothes -- fled, returning to their camp  after they had deployed on two axes: One in Zinjibar (capital of  Abyan) to cut off the road to Aden, and one in Lawdar to cut off  the road to the governorates of Hadhramaut and Shabwah    President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, secretary general of the  (northern) General People's Congress [GPC] -- has issued his  orders to Defense Minister Staff Brigadier General Haytham Qasim  Tahir (a northerner) to return the al-Wahdah Brigade to  Hadhramaut from Abyan. He told him in a message sent to him in  Aden: "I oblige you to comply in order to pave the way and  create favorable conditions for starting the implementation of  the Pledge and Accord Document and to protect unity and  democracy and spare the nation sedition and infighting."    The president blamed the defense minister and southern  officials for the military movements, instructing the defense  minister not to mobilize any force except after the approval of  "the chief of staff (a northerner) and the supreme commander of  the Armed Forces (the president)." A GPC source accused the  Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] of violating the rules of military  movements and the military committee's decisions, namely by  continuing to move the 30th Brigade from Shabwah to Abyan. But  the defense minister considered the military committee's  decision unilateral and decided to complete the process of  moving the brigade.    Although there are no confirmed figures about the number of  victims, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT's information indicates that 700 to  800 have been killed or wounded. The information attributes  these high figures to the nature of the guerrilla warfare  dominating the operations and the sniper method used in the  streets. Sources said that a force wearing civilian clothes  comprising about three brigades from the militias belonging to  the Yemeni Reform Grouping arrived in the area from the north  and from al-Maraqishah camp to participate in the operations.    While southern sources said that they had arrested an  Algerian extremist among these, they pointed out that their  participation in the operations and the al-'Amaliqah troops'  wearing of civilian clothes was designed to drive a wedge  between the southern al-Wahdah Brigade and the people of the  governorates, who are known for their support for former  President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad. On the grounds that the  al-Wahdah Brigade -- which comprises northern elements from the  former National Front elements -- carried out reprisal  operations in the wake of the 13 January 1986 incidents and  prevented the occurrence of rapprochement between 'Ali Nasir and  the present YSP leadership.    The sources added that a large-scale deployment has taken  place over the past two days in the northern border  governorates, including Ta'izz, al-Bayda', and Ma'rib, and also  Ibb Governorate, which is situated in the region but considered  to be belong to the YSP by virtue of its support for the  National front in the period before unity.    Air traffic was banned over the al-'Amaliqah Brigade camp  all  day yesterday. Eyewitnesses said that the camp opened fire with  light weapons at 0700 hrs on a southern Mig aircraft which had  flown over it in a "provocative manner." But it failed to hit  it because of the speed of the aircraft and the lack of  high-capability antiaircraft weapons. But southern sources said  that the aircraft which was fired on was an Ethiopian civilian  plane.    Sources said that Colonel Muhammad Salah, Yemeni deputy  chief  of staff and head of the military committee, arrived in  al-'Amaliqah camp yesterday for the second time in three days in  a new attempt to contain the confrontation.</p>

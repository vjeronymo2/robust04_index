He described the talks he had in Kazakhstan as fruitful and  mutually useful not only for Kazakh-American relations, but for  strengthening regional and international security, too.    Gore said that the signing of a framework agreement on  dismantling intercontinental ballistic missiles silo launchers  in Kazakhstan proved the desire of both sides to develop  mutually equitable relations. Moreover, an agreement was  reached on bilateral cooperation in liquidating the consequences  of accidents and establishing an intergovernmental communication  line. It is worth noting that the Kazakh parliament ratified  the nuclear weapons Non-Proliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear  state on the day of the Kazakh-American negotiations.    An important step was made towards expanding economic  relations. For instance, the sides have signed a protocol on the  exchange of ratification instruments of an agreement to  encourage and mutually protect capital investments. An  agreement on cooperation in science and technology was ratified  for the time being. According to Gore, it will be signed during  Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev's visit to the United  States on February 14, 1994.    The sides have discussed the possibility of cooperating in  the exploitation of the Baykonur cosmodrome, protecting the  environment in regions adjoining the Aral sea and the former  Semipalatinsk nuclear testing ground. Gore said that the United  States was ready to render Kazakhstan concrete assistance in  organising the regional management of water resources.    The sides also had a frank exchange of views on the  situation  in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The views of  the two sides were very close or identical.</p>

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / International Company News: Hoogovens to cut 15% of jobs at steel plant HOOGOVENS, the Dutch steel and aluminium group, is to shed more than 15 per cent of the workforce at its main steel production site in the Netherlands as part of a Fl 300m (Dollars 182m) cost-cutting programme to return the company to profitability in 1993. The measures would produce 'several hundred million guilders' of extraordinary charges in Hoogovens's 1992 accounts but should bring about a return to profitability next year, even if the company faces the poor market conditions that helped tip its results into the red so far in 1992, the company said. By the end of next year, Hoogovens expected to have cut 2,300 jobs at its plant in Ijmuiden on the Dutch North Sea coast, reducing the integrated steel plant's overall workforce to 11,500 people. The job cuts would be concentrated in non-production departments. The Hoogovens group employed a total of 26,875 people in 1991. Approximately 1,000 of the job losses will represent compulsory redundancies, the first in Hoogovens's 74-year history. Yesterday's announcement comes on top of an existing streamlining operation aimed at cutting 2,500 jobs through natural wastage between 1990 and 1995. Hoogovens, the seventh-largest steel producer in Europe, blamed the latest measures on the drop in prices for steel products, which it attributed to the low dollar, increased steel capacity in western Europe, higher imports from eastern Europe and indirect government aid to competitor steel works in other parts of Europe. Sales of eastern European steel in western Europe are often the result of dumping prices, it said. Hoogovens posted a Fl 49m net loss in the 1992 first half and has predicted that results in the second half would be considerably lower than they were in the first six months of the year.</p>

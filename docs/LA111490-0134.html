			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TENSION IS BUILDING IN MIGHTY DIVISION II;  </P> <P> PREP FOOTBALL: COUNTY'S THREE YOUNG GUNS CHALLENGE UNBEATEN GLENDALE IN  SECTION'S STRONGEST BRACKET.  </P> <P> When sizing up the Southern Section Division II football playoffs, it's easy to  envision a movie marquee reading: Young Guns III vs. The Predator.  </P> <P> The guns are quarterbacks Rob Johnson (El Toro), Tony Solliday (Capistrano  Valley) and Tim Snowden (Mission Viejo) of the South Coast League.  </P> <P> Johnson passed for 2,207 yards and Solliday had 1,961, but Snowden led Mission  Viejo to victories over both teams and the league title.  </P> <P> The predator is running back Pathon Rucker of Glendale (10-0). The junior is  the state's top scorer with 192 points and has gained 1,760 yards.  </P> <P> For added suspense, there's the presence of two-time defending Division III  champion Paramount, which was been moved up. Paramount has won 18 consecutive  games and is 35-2 in the past three years.  </P> <P> All of this adds up to the strongest of the section's 10 divisions, with eight  teams capable of winning the title. And the winner will be . . .  </P> <P> "Paramount," El Toro Coach Bob Johnson said. "They've got a big-time running  attack, speedy receivers, and they're the returning champs. But then, they  could get beat by Muir in the second round.  </P> <P> "I saw Muir last week, and they're for real. You have to respect Muir, because  at any time they can explode. They could win it all or lose in the first  round."  </P> <P> Paramount Coach Ken Sutch said more than eight teams are capable of winning the  division but likes his team's chances whenever it plays at home.  </P> <P> "We haven't lost a home game in four years," he said. "I'm sure the natural  thing will be for everyone to shoot at us. But that's a nice position to be  in."  </P> <P> Running backs Tony Neal and Demondre Smith are the backbone of a Paramount's  offense. Neal has rushed for 1,138 yards and scored 12 touchdowns.  </P> <P> "Most people think of us as a run-oriented team, but our quarterback (Steve  Lopez) has thrown for 18 touchdowns," Sutch said.  </P> <P> Coach Don Shoemaker, who led Glendale to its first playoff appearance since  1985, said the past playoff success of South Coast schools commands respect in  the revamped division.  </P> <P> "Those schools should have gone into Division I," Shoemaker said. "They can  play with anybody, including Fontana and Eisenhower. I think any of those three  schools have the offense and defense to win the division."  </P> <P> Glendale has been somewhat overlooked despite being seeded fourth. Rucker  rushed for 200 or more yards in four games and reached 100 against every  opponent except Muir. Glendale's defense has allowed only 81 points.  </P> <P> "People tend to point to Muir in our league, even though we beat them (23-8),"  Shoemaker said. "They have more college athletes than any team in the CIF  (Southern Section). But if they have a weakness, it's that you can play  ground-control, running football against them."  </P> <P> Few coaches gave members of the Marmonte and Channel leagues much chance to win  the title. Thousand Oaks was an exception, having averaged 31.4 points per game  behind the rushing of Cory Bowen (1,217 yards). Quarterback Todd Preston of  league rival Westlake has thrown for 2,223 yards and 19 touchdowns.  </P> <P> </P> <P> DIVISION II  </P> <P> Defending Co-Champions -- Muir, Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> First-Round Schedule: Friday, 7:30 p.m. -- Rio Mesa (6-4) at Paramount (10-0);  Westlake (8-1-1) vs. Muir (7-3) at Pasadena City College; Lynwood (5-5) at  Thousand Oaks (7-1-2); Camarillo (7-3) at Glendale (10-0); Capistrano Valley  (8-2) at Ventura (7-2-1); Downey (7-3) vs. Royal (8-1-1) at Moorpark College;  Arcadia (5-5) vs. Mission Viejo (9-1) at Capistrano Valley High School.  Saturday, 7:30 p.m. -- El Toro (9-1) vs. Buena (5-5) at Ventura High School.  </P> <P> Top Teams -- Paramount, Mission Viejo, Glendale and El Toro.  </P> <P> Dark Horse: Muir. The Mustangs have more Division I college talent than any  team in the section.  </P> <P> Best Draw: Mission Viejo. The Diablos play host to mediocre Arcadia in the  first round, then meet the winner of Downey-Royal in the second.  </P> <P> Worst Draw: Paramount. Top-seeded team will probably meet defending co-champion  Muir in the second round.  </P> <P> Key Players: Leon Neal and Demondre White, RBs, Paramount; Beau LeBreton, DE,  and Marcellus Chrishon, RB, Mission Viejo; Pathon Rucker, RB, Glendale; Rob  Johnson, QB, El Toro; Cory Bowen, RB, Thousand Oaks; Todd Preston, QB,  Westlake; Sedrick Thomas, QB, Muir; David Poltl, WR, Capistrano Valley.  </P> <P> Noteworthy: Paramount, two-time defending Division III champion, has won 18 in  a row and is 35-2 over the past three years; El Toro, Mission Viejo, Capistrano  Valley, Paramount, Muir and Thousand Oaks all played overtime games in either  Division II or III semifinals last year; Glendale's Rucker is the state's  leading scorer with 192 points.  </P></p>

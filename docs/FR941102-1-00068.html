			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A witness for NCI testified in support of the CMPC multiple  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> component pricing proposal with one primary modification. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NCI proposal would calculate a ``residual fluid price'', instead of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an other solids price. This proposal is discussed further under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Issue 3b below in this decision. Kraft testified and submitted a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> brief in support of the NCI proposal for multiple component  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pricing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A witness for the Trade Association of Proprietary Plants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (TAPP) and Farmers Union Milk Marketing Cooperative (FUMMC)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testified in support of the TAPP proposal, a variation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CMPC proposal that would price both butterfat and protein on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> differential basis, rather than on a per pound basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The five north central Federal milk orders included in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proceeding should be amended to include multiple component  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pricing. On the basis of the record of this proceeding, multiple  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> component pricing would entail pricing milk on the basis of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pounds of butterfat, protein and other nonfat solids contained in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the milk, with a somatic cell adjustment to the hundredweight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price paid to producers. The record indicates that a large  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percentage of the producers pooled under these orders are already  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible for or receive some form of multiple component pricing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and that many of these component pricing plans use protein as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pricing component.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The record also shows that the diverse component pricing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs that currently exist promote disorderly and inefficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marketing conditions in the procurement of milk supplies by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competing handlers. The different programs establish non-uniform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bases of payments to producers. The adoption of multiple  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> component pricing will allow the Orders to recognize the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional value of milk with a higher-than-average solids  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> content.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the five orders included in this proceeding, the vast  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> majority of the milk pooled is utilized in manufactured products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total solids in the milk used for manufacturing are the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> primary determinants of product yield. In addition, it is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solids in fluid milk that give it its nutritional value and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taste. In both types of products, the current pricing system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used in the five orders does not properly recognize the value of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonfat milk solids, nor encourage producers to increase the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantity of nonfat milk solids in the milk they produce.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of the shift in value in recent years from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> butterfat portion of milk to the skim portion, most of the value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of milk is determined on a volume basis without any consideration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the value of the skim components. Adoption of the multiple  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> component pricing plan recommended in this decision will enable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the market to reflect the value of the skim components in milk to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> producers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to butterfat, protein is clearly the most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate component of milk on which payment should be based.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most of the milk pooled under these five orders is used for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturing, and 86% of the milk used in manufacturing is used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to produce cheese. Because protein is a main determinant of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cheese yield, and it is cheese that determines the profitability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for most of the dairy industry in the 5-market area, the milk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pricing system should recognize the value of the protein  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> component of milk as it is used in the manufacture of cheese.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Record evidence clearly shows that protein has a higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demand than other components of milk because of its functional,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nutritional and economic value in the marketplace. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functional characteristics of protein allow it to form the matrix  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the production of cheese and yogurt. Protein is also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> important to the air formation in the manufacture of certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products and provides some required nutrients in the human diet.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Milk containing a higher percentage of protein will result in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater yields of most manufactured products than milk with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lower protein test. Additionally, handlers receiving milk that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results in greater volumes of finished products such as cheese  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and cottage cheese than an equivalent volume of milk testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lower in protein should be required to pay more for the higher- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing milk. At the same time, the dairy farmer producing milk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that yields greater amounts of finished products deserves to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paid more for it than a dairy farmer producing the same volume of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> milk that results in less product yield. Thus, sending an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic signal to dairy farmers will encourage them to maximize  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the production of those components which have the greatest demand  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the marketplace.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to analysis of the record, proponents are correct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that attribution of all of the skim value of the M-W price to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protein would result in an overstatement of the value of protein  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used in cheese and most other uses. In order to maintain fairly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uniform prices between orders for milk used in manufactured  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products, it is necessary to assign the residual value of the M-W  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price minus the butterfat and protein values to either other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonfat solids or a fluid carrier price. The discussion of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residual component may be found in Issue 3b below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

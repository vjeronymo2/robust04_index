			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / People: Bodies politic Richard Powell has been appointed president of the STORAGE AND HANDLING EQUIPMENT DISTRIBUTORS' ASSOCIATION. ***** Elizabeth Taylor has been appointed chairman of the ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE AND RISK MANAGERS IN INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE. ***** Tony Hardiman has been appointed chairman of the NATIONAL CAVITY INSULATION ASSOCIATION. ***** John Lee, operations director of ALLGOOD HARDWARE, has been elected president of the GUILD OF ARCHITECTURAL IRONMONGERS. ***** Gordon Edington, chairman of Lynton, has been elected chair of the PUBLIC ART DEVELOPMENT TRUST. ***** John Harries, Andrew Kennedy, David Knowles and Eva Lauermann have been appointed fellows of the KING'S FUND COLLEGE. ***** Christopher Stewart-Smith, chairman of Healthcall and a past chairman of the London Chamber of Commerce, has been elected president of the BRITISH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE. ***** Sir Edwin Nixon, deputy chairman of National Westminster Bank, has been elected chairman of the council of LEICESTER UNIVERSITY for a three-year period. ***** Ray Cadman, chairman of C&amp;C Bedding &amp; Upholstery, has been elected president of the NATIONAL BED FEDERATION. ***** Brian Calder. md of Gonzalez Byass (UK), has been elected chairman of the SHERRY SHIPPERS COMMITTEE. ***** Michael Whelan, formerly a partner of Pannell Kerr Forster, has been appointed chief executive of The PARKINSON'S DISEASE SOCIETY. ***** Archie Hutchison, former deputy group chief executive of the Littlewoods Organisation, has been elected president of the EUROPEAN MAIL ORDER TRADERS' ORGANISATION. ***** Ford's reputation as a recruiting ground for Britain's corporate treasurers has been strengthened by GRAND METROPOLITAN's decision to poach Nick Rose, treasurer, Ford of Britain, to be its new group treasurer. The 34-year-old Rose, who joined Ford after leaving Oxford, replaces Mike McCann who died some months ago. Although McCann joined GrandMet after a short stint as Trafalgar House's group treasurer, he had also spent the bulk of his career on Ford's financial side, including a stint as treasurer of Ford's UK arm. Rose, who will be responsible for managing GrandMet's liquidity, debt and exchange rate exposure, reports to David Defty one of GrandMet's two deputy finance directors. Rose says that the big difference between his old job and his new one is that GrandMet has a lot of debt and his respon-sibilities will cover the world, whereas at Ford, he was restricted to the UK. With annual turnover of Pounds 8.7bn and pre-tax profits of Pounds 963m, GrandMet is Britain's tenth biggest company. ***** GKN, one of Britain's biggest engineering companies, is injecting some fresh blood into its top management team. It has hired Marcus Beresford, managing director of Siemens Plessey Controls, to head its industrial services business. Beresford, 50, will be one of three managing directors sitting on the GKN board and replaces John Jessop, 54, who retires at the end of the year in order to pursue his personal interests. Up to now GKN has recruited its executive directors from within the group, although finance director Brian Walsh was recruited from outside the group in 1987. Beresford, 50, joined Smiths Industries in 1963 and by 1978 had become managing director of its automotive group. In 1983 he moved to Lucas as director and general manager Lucas Electronics and Systems, a joint venture between Lucas and Smiths Industries. Two years later he joined Plessey as managing director of Plessey Controls. Beresford takes over from Jessop on November 1.</p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A STRONG initial opening petered out in a dull afternoon session in stock index futures, with volume once again low, writes Joel Kibazo. The June contract on the FT-SE started the session strongly at a premium of 47 to the underlying cash market. But a shopping spree by independent traders early in the session led to a squeeze by 9am, sending June climbing to reach 2,697, which proved to be the high of the day. A bout of profit-taking thereafter caused June to relinquish earlier gains. With little in the way of participation from the large institutions, independent traders' attempts to drive June higher in mid-afternoon met with little interest, and it was undermined further by a weak opening on Wall Street. June closed at 2,649, down 19 on the previous session and about 17 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 22. Turnover at 5,453 lots was poor. The day in traded options was characterised by large trades in the April expiry stock options. Total volume reached 41,547, with the FT-SE option recording 7,596 contracts. BP was the top traded stock option at 3,363 lots and was followed by Marks and Spencer at 2,898 contracts.</p>

			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> WEEKENDER: PARKS OFFER 'SAFETY AND A SUPER TIME' FOR CHILDREN ON HALLOWEEN.  </P> <P> All dressed up and nowhere to go for Halloween?  </P> <P> Concerned parents looking for alternatives to the trick-or-treat street scene  for their children can chose from a wide range of activities at South Bay  parks.  </P> <P> Starting as early as today, parks are setting up their own twilight zones of  ghosts, goblins, witches and other out-of-this-world creatures for kids of  various ages. Young-at-heart parents are welcome to join the fun.  </P> <P> Participating parks will also sell sodas, hot dogs, pizzas and other fare. And,  of course, sweet treats are part of the goody packages that will be given to  the kids.  </P> <P> Fun but safe is the name of the game, park officials said as they set up  carnivals, haunted houses, game booths and costume parades.  </P> <P> In Inglewood, said Rhonda McIntosh of Rogers Park, the push is "to keep the  kids off the streets."  </P> <P> "We want them to know there's more to life than just hanging out," McIntosh  said. "They can come to the park and join in the activities that we have."  </P> <P> Rogers Park, 400 W. Beach Ave., has scheduled two dances for area students.  Today, from 3 to 6 p.m., for 50 cents, fifth- and sixth-graders can groove to  the music at a costume dance in the senior citizen auditorium.  </P> <P> From 7 to 10 p.m., students from Inglewood's La Tijera, Parent, Warren Lane,  Crozier and Monroe junior high schools can show off their garb and fancy  footsteps at the park's annual Junior High School Halloween Dance in the main  gymnasium. Admission is $1.  </P> <P> In Manhattan Beach, on Saturday, Manhattan Heights Park, at 1600 Manhattan  Beach Blvd., promises a day of fun-filled horrors for children ages 6 to 12.  Prizes will be awarded for the most original, attractive, scariest and funniest  costumes. Admission is free.  </P> <P> Highlighting the festivities will be the haunted house, which is a must-see,  said recreation supervisor Idris Al-Oboudi.  </P> <P> The theme of the house is a secret, Al-Oboudi said. "We're keeping the lid on  it, but it's pretty scary. It does not border on anything that is torturous . .  . just kinda funky and freaky."  </P> <P> The park has also built a "fun house" for children 5 and under, who can be  initiated into the world of fright by "putting their hands on Jell-O and  spaghetti in the dark," Al-Oboudi said. "Everything in this house is friendly."  </P> <P> After the weekend's activities, there will be more events on Halloween.  </P> <P> In Inglewood, from 6 to 9 p.m., preschoolers to sixth-graders can brave the  Rogers Park haunted house before or after they play in the carnival of fun and  games or march in the costume parade. Admission is 50 cents.  </P> <P> In Lawndale, the Rotary Club is throwing a Halloween youth party at Alondra  Park, 3850 Manhattan Beach Blvd. for children 13 and under. County Supervisor  Kenneth Hahn has turned over his field office for the party, which starts at 6  p.m. and features games, a costume contest, hot dogs and soft drinks.  </P> <P> To encourage children to go home afterward rather than trick-or-treat  door-to-door, the Rotary Club will try a twist on a traditional lottery.  </P> <P> After the party ends at 8:30 p.m., the Rotary Club will give the children 30  minutes to get home, and then draw names and phone the winners. The children  must be at home to win the prizes. A 10-speed bicycle will be given to the  first child who answers at his home phone no later than 9 p.m. Other prizes  will include a basketball, a football and boxed games.  </P> <P> "We're trying to prevent the kids from going door-to-door," said Craig Burris,  the club's director for community services. "With the major prizes, they'll  have an incentive to get home at an early time."  </P> <P> In San Pedro, Peck Park, 560 N. Western Ave., will host a carnival and costume  parade featuring face painting by an artist from a Hollywood makeup studio.  </P> <P> "Fun, that's what Halloween is," said Phil Orland, director of Peck Park  Community Center.  </P> <P> He said children of all ages should know that city parks are there for them to  enjoy, and that on a holiday such as Halloween, "enjoyment, fun, safety, and a  super time" can be had by all.  </P> <P> Additional scheduled events at other parks and city facilities include:  </P> <P> SUNDAY:  </P> <P> Frank D. Parent School, 5354 W. 64th St., Inglewood, 419-2545.  </P> <P> WEDNESDAY:  </P> <P> Wilson Park, 2200 Crenshaw Blvd., Torrance, 618-2930.  </P> <P> Scott Park, 23410 Catskill Ave., Carson, 830-8310.  </P> <P> Del Amo Park, 703 E.

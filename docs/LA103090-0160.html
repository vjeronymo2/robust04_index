			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS;  </P> <P> DEVELOPER'S MAILING BACKS 4 CANDIDATES  </P> <P> A Thousand Oaks developer is spending $20,020 to back four City Council  candidates.  </P> <P> Businessman Don Mallas spent the money to distribute and mail a publication,  the Thousand Oaks Clarion, to registered voters. The publication encourages  citizens to vote for Patricia Halfhill, Bob Hughes, Michael Markey and Elois  Zeanah on Nov. 6.  </P> <P> The four candidates have promised to put environmental and growth issues at the  top of their platforms and to oppose a city plan to build a new government  center at the Jungleland site.  </P> <P> The endorsements came as nine contenders entered the last week of campaigning  in a race centered on the effect of growth on the city of Thousand Oaks.  </P> <P> There are three open seats on the City Council. Councilman Tony Lamb has chosen  not to seek reelection.  </P> <P> Candidate Ray Grams criticized Halfhill, Hughes and Markey for each accepting  $500 contributions from the developer while pledging to take a tough stance on  growth.  </P> <P> "If he's spending so much money, it looks to me like he's trying to buy three  council seats," Grams said.  </P> <P> Markey denied that the developer's contribution would have an effect on his  campaign.  </P> <P> "I'm not for sale," Markey said. "That's not going to sway my vote in any  direction for anybody. I represent the entire community."  </P> <P> The other candidates could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Candidates are spending substantially more on average than others have in past  years to run for office, according to statements filed last week with the city  clerk.  </P> <P> Markey, a Compton police detective from Newbury Park, has raised the largest  campaign fund of the candidates. His fund of $10,555 is almost all out of his  own pocket, he said.  </P> <P> Two incumbents running to retain their seats, Alex Fiore and Lawrence Horner,  and two other candidates also raised substantial amounts of money for their  campaigns. Fiore reported $7,368, while Horner raised $4,048.  </P> <P> City Planning Commissioner Judy Lazar has raised $7,322.  </P> <P> Zeanah, who heads the Conejo League of Homeowners, reported $6,454. She also  received $1,000 late last week from Patagonia Inc., a Ventura clothing company  that has supported slow-growth candidates.  </P> <P> Robert O'Brien, a former city building director, has raised $4,378.  </P> <P> Halfhill, an investigator for attorneys, reported raising $2,576. Hughes, a  former radio station director, raised $1,940.  </P> <P> Grams said he did not file an itemized contribution report because he does not  expect to raise more than $1,000 in his campaign.

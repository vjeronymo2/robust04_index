			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Books: Three big questions THE ORIGIN OF THE UNIVERSE by John D. Barrow Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 9.99, 150 pages THE ORIGIN OF HUMANKIND by Richard Leakey Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 9.99, 171 pages THE LAST THREE MINUTES by Paul Davies Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 9.99, 162 pages Popular science books, like crime novels, must get read mainly by people who follow the genre. In the wake of Stephen Hawking's one great success, there are so many pop-science books in print that if they were read more widely the problems of public understanding, which preoccupy scientists and science ministers alike, would quickly be over. Here are the first three of a new Anglo-American series, styled Science Masters, plainly intended to be read by non-habitues. Three Big Questions are tackled in short, readable books by authors who have all answered them before. Twenty odd more titles are promised by the turn of the millennium. So how do the first three fare? Take Barrow and Davies first. Both do a neat job in the small space prescribed - the putative reader obviously has a short attention span. John Barrow has a slightly easier time, as he is merely concerned with the beginning of everything, while Davies has to address the end but must consider the beginning as well to explain how we might get there. The big crunch may be implicit in the big bang. As this implies, both books cover the range of ideas, occasionally well-attested, often speculative, frequently bizarre, of contemporary cosmology. Here be black holes, wormholes, baby universes, stardust and dark matter. These are all explained as clearly as they can be, in simple English, though some very basic physics is assumed. These stories are about science as intellectual entertainment, rather than scientific literacy. They will not do anything for your ability to cope with modern living but they will ensure that your eschatology is seriously up to date. The most important property of the universe, of course, is that it harbours beings who can ponder where it came from. The origin of the local variety of such beings is Richard Leakey's concern, and his book is the most appealing of the three. A simpler story, with less way-out concepts, but a compelling one, well-told. Leakey is especially good on the fact that the evolution of the genus Homo is both a scientific study and an origin myth. He is well aware how images of the human past are coloured by prevailing cultural prejudice, and is clear about the necessary limitations of the historical sciences. No experiments here: the anthropologist is condemned to interpreting fragments of a long, complex story, imposing order on scattered collections of preserved bones which constantly tantalise the scientist who wants to see the whole picture. Leakey is candid about holding a minority view on many key questions, like dating the origin of language - old and slow he reckons, while most of his colleagues think it was rapid and recent, perhaps as recently as 35,000 years ago. This commitment, to continuity with our forebears rather than a clean break, makes his arguments seem a little sharper than Barrow or Davies. Against the trend of some recent popular science books, he is also honest about the fact that some of the big questions may remain forever mysterious. 'How can we know what happened to our ancestors' level of consciousness during the past 2.5 million years?', he asks; 'The harsh reality anthropologists face is that these questions may be unanswerable'. Barrow also hints at similar limitations, suggesting that analogies for many physical theories seem to fall to hand too readily. He suspects that it is only when there is a theory which can be described in mathematical language, but which has no obvious meaning outside it, that we are getting close to physical reality. As he puts it, taking up the crux of Hawking's book, 'One can read the sentence 'Time becomes another dimension of space', understand what all the words mean, but still not possess any real understanding of what is being conveyed'. Just so. This is another reason why Leakey's book has the edge on reader satisfaction, and why it may be unwise to launch this series with two books about the outer reaches of physics. Then again, they might inspire readers who will go on to fashion new answers to the Big Questions.</p>

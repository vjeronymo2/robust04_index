			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / International Company News: British Gas pays Dollars 52m for US stake BRITISH Gas has paid Dollars 52m for a one-third stake in Natural Gas Clearinghouse, the largest independent gas marketing company in the US. LG&amp;E, another resources company, has also acquired a one-third share in the marketing company. The remaining one-third will continue to be held by NGC's management. The move marks British Gas' first venture into the US gas industry where prices are currently at all-time lows. 'It will give us a first-hand insight into gas trading in the US and allow us to see how it could fit into our business in future,' an official said. British Gas is also believed to be interested in purchasing a 41 per cent stake in Home Oil, the Canadian oil producer, which is being sold by the Reichmann Brothers. This would complement the company's other gas interests in Canada. Natural Gas Clearinghouse is based in Houston and operates eight gas plants and 1,400 miles of gas pipelines.</p>

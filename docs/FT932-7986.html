			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Plan to seize BR assets abandoned THE GOVERNMENT yesterday abandoned its controversial plan to seize a portion of British Rail's pension fund assets after privatisation in the face of opposition from trustees, employees and the Conservative party's own backbenchers. Instead, the roughly Pounds 8.5bn in pension fund assets will be used to create a joint industry scheme in which all current employees may participate as long as they remain in the rail industry. A portion of those assets will be set aside in a separate pool to pay benefits to present and deferred pensioners. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, insisted yesterday that the decision was not a U-turn. 'There can be no question of a U-turn as this is a decision being taken for the first time,' he said. The move should not be viewed as a blueprint for the future of the pension schemes of other soon-to-be-privatised industries, he added. 'This plan is particular to the railway industry.' Trustees of the Rail Pension Scheme had been pressing hard for the government to back down on its 'Option Two' outlined in the white paper on rail privatisation. The government had proposed seizing a portion of the pension scheme's assets in exchange for a promise to pay index-linked pensions indefinitely. 'This is largely what the trustees were looking for, but there are still some safeguards we are seeking,' said one trustee. In particular, the trustees want assurances that ministerial powers over the pension scheme may not be used to weaken the benefit structure in future years nor to shift the cost-sharing in a way that forces members to increase their proportion of contributions. Answering questions at a news conference, Mr MacGregor said the new owners of the privatised British Rail companies would have representation on the Joint Industry Scheme board of trustees but not have the power either to wind up the scheme nor to weaken its benefits without the consent of parliament. It is envisaged that the JIS will have a trustee company consisting of employees and representatives of the new owners of British Rail. The new employers also will be required to establish pension schemes for members with benefits as good as those now available to British Rail employees. The government has promised that there will be no early-leaver penalties for involuntary breaks in employment - a move which should protect those who are made redundant by one company but re-employed by another. In establishing the pool for current and deferred pensioners, of whom there are roughly 150,000, a period will be allowed for the scheme to sell much of its illiquid assets such as agricultural land, venture capital investments and artworks.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>   [Text] Chisinau February 1 TASS -- The Dniester authorities  will thwart the elections to the Moldovan parliament on its  territory, Valeri Litskay, state secretary of the unrecognised  Dniester republic, told ITAR-TASS on Tuesday.    If the Moldovan leadership sends mobile polling stations and  foreign observers to the Dniester region, they will be barred by  armed patrols which are stationed on bridges across the Dniester  in compliance with the state of emergency proclaimed in the  Dniester region.    Incidentally, the Dniester parliament adopted a decision on  Tuesday to hold elections to local bodies of self-rule next  April.    Within the next two months, a special commission is to  submit  a new concept of local self-rule to the Dniester parliament in  connection with the new political and economic situation in the  region. Several local lawmakers suggested that a referendum on  the Dniester republic's future should be held along with the  elections.    Moldovan Deputy Parliament Speaker Viktor Pushkash described  these actions of Tiraspol authorities as "anticonstitutional and  contravening international laws". According to the deputy  speaker, many voters on the Dniester west bank wish to  participate in the elections, which is corroborated by letters  coming to Chisinau and telephone calls.    "However, armed patrols stationed by the Tiraspol leaders on  all roads turned the territory into a reservation of a kind,"  Pushkash stressed. "I'm sure," he continued, "that the Dniester  leaders will raise difficulties for those who will want to vote  and try to prevent people from going to the right bank.    "Despite an opposition from the Tiraspol leaders, we meet  and  will meet our voters in left-bank districts and will try to  provide them will a chance to vote on the election day."</p>

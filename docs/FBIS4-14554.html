			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Panorama" program] </F>   [Excerpts] [Announcer] A briefing was given today in the  Kremlin by the Russian president's press secretary Vyacheslav  Kostikov. Among the journalists attending was our commentator  Yuriy Simenov, who is now with us in the studio. What have you  to tell us, Yuriy Aleksandrovich?    [Simenov] [Passage omitted] We journalists were told that  the  president's work schedule for April was packed solid, which says  much about his capacity for work, but the essence of this  apparently is that April will be a kind of example of a tactical  change in the political climate in Russia.    [Announcer] What does that mean?    [Simenov] In the main this means that the president and his  administration will head toward cooperation with all  constructive political forces -- including those of the  opposition -- with all parties and parliamentary factions and  the leaders of the chambers. Among other things, the latest  meeting between the president and the speaker of the State Duma  has taken place.    Among other things, the president presented him with the  draft agreement on civic peace and accord -- that very document  being talked about so much today.    [Announcer] As you know, an alternative draft agreement on  civic peace and accord signed by our opposition figures has been  published in the press. Lapshin, Glazev...    [Simenov, interrupting] Questions were also put about this,  too. They said that the opposition is effectively outstripping  the situation, officially. You know, in so far as the degree of  responsibility which the opposition bears is a lot less, the  attitude was quietly negative, so to speak. At any rate, that  draft, which was prepared by a large group of experts and  representatives of various parties and political sections will  clearly be at the base of public discussion. That draft  document is about seven and a half pages long. It is being  handed around now for all the main political forces and figures  to familiarize themselves with it and, on the whole, it is  already open for discussion. It is no secret that it may be  published in the press in the next few days. As for signing it,  if we take into account possible amendments, it is possible that  this will be somewhere like the end of April. The draft  document is aimed at being in operation for about two years --  until the next presidential elections, it seems. As to the  monitoring of its implementation, there are plans to found a  conciliation commission for the period.    [Announcer] Who will be in the conciliation commission?    [Simenov] The representatives who sign it. At the first  stage, representatives of roughly 25 parties, factions, and all  the political forces and others.    [Announcer] And that quite obviously includes the hardline  opposition?    [Simenov] Whoever wants to sign it. It is an open document.  Specialists on international law know what that means.    Now for the second important point -- presidential  elections.  In the opinion of the press secretary, a number of newspapers  have been in a hurry to forecast that Boris Yeltsin will decline  to take part in the coming presidentials. Well, we were told  that time and the course of events will show that they should  not be in a hurry. If the opinion of society and the voters  will be inclined toward the president putting his candidature  forward again, then the possibility cannot be ruled out. It  will be determined by his duty and responsibility to the voters.  As to other candidates -- Rutskoy and Zhirinovskiy were asked  about, among others... [pauses] there was a very sharp reaction  on the part of the press secreatry. I wiil quote him without  any commentary: He said that Russia deserved better than to  have people voting for political hooligans and foul-mouths.  That is how he put it. Tough talk.    The next point is that I asked Vyacheslav Kostikov on the  Russian president's attitude to Nazarbayev's proposal regarding  the creation of a new Eurasian Union. The answer given was  rather surprising. Yes, it had been talked about. This was  confirmed, but Boris Yeltsin is for the time being showing a  restrained interest in this. He will study it, taking into  account the opinions of other CIS leaders. This will certainly  be discussed on 15 April at the summit in Moscow. He is against  hasty decisions in this matter. Perhaps the idea of a new Union  and the idea at the basis of the CIS may be combined at some  stage.    The next important point is about the passions raging about  the recent decision by the government on customs duties. The  opinion of the president, as heard from the lips of his press  secretary, is that in principle the pluses from taxing certain  goods being imported into Russia were well balanced, but the  possible minuses were badly thought out. We know about the  minuses and about the views of the mayors of the big cities.    This roughly means that the policy of some sort of balanced,  moderate protectionism in relation to Russian entrepreneurs and  industry will continue. The idea is correct, but specific  measures will, clearly, be corrected. However, there is no  friction whatsoever on this issue between the presidential  administration and the government. Everything is being sorted  out quietly. [passage omitted]</p>

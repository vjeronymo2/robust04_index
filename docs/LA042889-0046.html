			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST IMPRESSIONS: INDIGO: A LITTLE PLACE WITH MUCH TO OFFER  </P> <P> What this town needs -- almost anyone will tell you -- is more good  neighborhood restaurants. Well, another one has just been added to the ranks.  Indigo, 8222 1/2 W. 3rd St., Los Angeles, (213) 653-0140, is a pretty, crowded  little place at times where people wander in off the street to eat pizza and  pasta and eclectic appetizers. It's not a big deal sort of restaurant, but the  food is sophisticated and most dishes are below $10. And it's already so  popular that when the heaters in the little patio went out a couple of nights  ago quite a crowd gathered to wait for inside tables.  </P> <P> Once seated they munched on vegetarian "potstickers," skewered chicken with  peanut sauce, crunchy breaded calamari and pizzas topped with just about  anything you can think of. They ate big bowls of pasta and garlicky marinated  skirt steak. And they topped it all off with desserts such as espresso creme  brulee. While they waited for their food they talked to their neighbors -- the  tables are really very close together -- and what a lot of them seemed to be  saying was how nice it is to have a little restaurant like this move in around  the corner.RUTH REICHL  </P></p>

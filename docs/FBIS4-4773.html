			<p>BFN     [Text] Pusan, April 4 (YONHAP) -- A nationwide group of  university student activists has decided that improving  relations between North Korea and the United States, rather than  putting pressure on Pyongyang, holds the key to breaking the  nuclear impasse.    The decision was made at a meeting of the Korea Federation  of  University Student Unions (Hanchongnyon), called to set a course  of action for unification and other political "struggles" this  year.    Hanchongnyon, led by its Chairman Kim Hyon-chun of Pusan  University, said that the North has adopted a flexible and firm  strategy and "efficiently destroyed a scheme by the United  States and imperialists to isolate North Korea despite adverse  international conditions against it since announcing its  intention to leave the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty."    "It appears that North Korea could get a firm reply from the  United States for the improvement of relations (with Washington)  and receive (U.S.) assistance including light-water nuclear  reactors," it said. "Such a resolution (of the nuclear problem)  means normalization of U.S.-North Korean ties," it said.    Hanchongnyon's statement is being read as an indication that  leftist student activists intend to adopt the "anti-U.S.,  pro-North Korean policy" of past student movements despite the  recent threat of war by Pyongyang.</p>

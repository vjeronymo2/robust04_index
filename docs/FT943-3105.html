			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / International Company News: US pension funds expand abroad US pension funds have further expanded their investments in non-domestic securities in the first half of 1994, allocating Dollars 22bn to mandates to be invest-ed outside the US, a rise of 9 per cent from the end of 1993. InterSec Research Corporation, a US-based investment consulting firm, said that 80 per cent of the cash is invested in non-US equities, with the remainder in fixed interest. Cash flow into equities in the first half of 1994 totalled Dollars 17bn, some Dollars 5bn more than in the same period a year ago. However, it was Dollars 5bn below the cash flow which poured into foreign equities in the second half of 1993. The move abroad is part of a trend which became visible by the end of 1993 when it was calculated that the value of US pension funds' assets abroad rose by 69 per cent to Dollars 260bn from Dollars 156bn at the end of 1992. As of June 1994, US pension fund assets invested abroad totalled Dollars 284bn. InterSec calculated that some 7 per cent of US pension assets were invested abroad at the end of last year, compared with 5 per cent a year earlier. US pension funds historically have been reluctant to invest outside the country. Five years ago, only 3 per cent of their assets were non-US. Of the funds invested outside the US in 1994, Dollars 20bn represents net new cash allocated to the sector while only Dollars 2bn represents an increase in assets under management.</p>

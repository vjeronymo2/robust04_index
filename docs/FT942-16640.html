			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of Switzerland (7): Times are tough - Tourism Times are tough in Switzerland's important tourism business. Bed-nights, a key index of the industry, have been on a downward trend for four years. And that followed a decade of near stagnation. Last year, for example, the number of bed-nights sold fell three per cent to 33.2m, and there is no sign of an upturn. The Swiss National Tourist Organisation (SNTO), the national promotion body, expects another two per cent decline this year. This is bad news for the country's third largest industry after machinery and chemicals, and for the roughly 350,000 people who make their living from it. Hotel closures have become a relatively frequent and distressing phenomenon and unemployment in the sector is rising rapidly. The reasons for the decline are now fairly well rehearsed. Recently, the recession in western Europe, not least in Switzerland itself, has been a key factor. Last year, the fall in domestic visitors to Swiss hostelries at 3.9 per cent was greater than the decline in foreign visitors. The devaluation of some European currencies against the Swiss franc was obviously another factor. The number of bed-nights taken up by Italians tumbled by nearly a quarter last year. But industry leaders agree that more than short term cyclical factors are at work. Even the weather plays a significant role. Warmer and shorter winters have hurt those areas that offer winter sport holidays. The association of ski lift operators reported recently that their season shrank from 120 days in 1970 to 110 days in 1991. More important, Switzerland has clearly lost ground in the past decade to Austria which offers tourists the same sort of 'products'. A recent survey among Germans, for example, revealed that Austria was clearly preferred to Switzerland as a holiday destination. There is much debate about why this is so, but a lot of it is put down to intangible factors - such as the tendency of Swiss hotels to hire more immigrants, thus undermining the Swiss ambience. The SNTO itself has come in for a lot of criticism for becoming lethargic and bureaucratic in the face of an emerging crisis. Last year, the federal government, which underwrites most of the SNTO's costs, finally took radical action to shake it up. It hired Nicolas Hayek, best known as the head of the Swatch-making watch group SMH, to examine the SNTO and produce recommendations to make it more effective. In October, Hayek produced his report, recommending substantial cuts in SNTO overheads, with the savings together with larger contributions from members to be redirected to a more professional and more focused promotional effort. He accepted that Switzerland had to stick with its aim to provide exclusivity and quality mainly to the professional and leisure classes. For one thing, it has the experience and facilities that appeal to these people. For another, the Swiss franc is likely to remain strong, preventing the country from competing with others on price alone. But he said the country's image abroad had become rather dowdy. Like the Swiss watch industry a decade ago, it needed to be polished and made more joyful. Mr Walter Leu, SNTO director general, says the SNTO staff has already been cut by a fifth and a new president is expected to be appointed shortly. Foreign outposts have been shuffled to reflect changing market potential. The San Francisco office has been folded into the one in Los Angeles, Buenos Aires and Sydney offices have been closed, and new ones have been opened in Berlin and Hong Kong. Mr Leu says he is now working on getting the organisation's 500 members to provide more funds. At the moment, the organisation operates with annual revenue of SFr36.7m of which the Government provides SFr32.6m. He would like to see members' contributions rising to about SFr15m and ultimately even more. 'It is our ambition not to depend heavily on government,' he says, pointing out that it is the members who ultimately benefit from the organisation's efforts. Industry leaders across the country have welcomed what they consider to be the long overdue shakeup at the SNTO. But being Swiss, they will probably want to see some results before digging into their pockets to increase their support to it.</p>

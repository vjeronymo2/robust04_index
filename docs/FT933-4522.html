			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: China lifts official price CHINA, WHERE high inflation and rapidly rising incomes have spawned a gold fever, has almost doubled the state purchasing price of the precious metal to stimulate production and combat smuggling. The official China Gold News said the state purchasing price of gold had been raised to Yn96 (Dollars 16.8) a gramme from Yn51.2 as from September 1. It was the second price increase this year and the biggest rise ever. The price had been raised from Yn48 on May 20. An official of the China National Gold Corporation said the increase was aimed at bringing China's domestic price closer to world levels, increasing domestic production and discouraging sales to the non-official market. Asked what national output would be in 1993, he said that remained a state secret. Rapidly rising incomes and inflation running at nearly 20 per cent in major cities have caused a gold fever, making China the world's biggest importer of gold last year, according to trade estimates.</p>

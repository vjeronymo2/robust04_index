			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By station reporters Zhang Shouwen and Zhang Xueling, and </F> correspondent Yan Xingao]    [Text] The song and dance ensemble of the political  department of the Tibetan Regional People's Armed Police Corps  [TRPAPC] put on a cultural and art performance at the Tibetan  People's Hall on the evening of 7 June. Chen Kuiyuan, Raidi,  Guo Jinlong, Zi Cheng, Puqung, Zheng Ying, Gyamco, Baima Duoji,  Zhou Qishun -- leaders of the regional party committee, regional  people's congress, regional people's government, and regional  committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference; TRPAPC Political Commissar Zhang Zhu and Commander  Tan Huasheng; as well as responsible comrades from the regional  party committee propaganda department, the regional cultural  department, and judicial, procuratorial, and public security  organs, took time off their busy schedule to watch the  performance. Other TRPAPC leaders and more than 1,000 armed  police officers and men stationed in Lhasa also watched the show.    The brilliant performance featured dances entitled: Emotions  of Parting, Ode to the Snow Lotus, On the Tea Delivery Path, and  Footsteps to the Police Camp, and other programs reflecting the  highland-based armed police officers and men's sensational  fighting spirit in taking a foothold on the borderland and  safeguarding Tibet's stability; their heroism in fearlessly  taking on dangers when fighting enemies; and harmonious  relations between the police and the people. In addition,  traditional folk cultural and art programs such as Sausage or  Shoe, Lovers Under the Moon, (Arxie), and A True Man of Flesh  and Blood, expressing the Tibetan nation's spiritual aspects,  natural conditions and social customs, and working life were  performed. Revolutionary songs such as Chairman Mao Zedong  Sends People Here and popular army songs such as Telling You My  Innermost Thoughts and Feelings, Devote My Deep Love to the  Great Party, Song of Praise for the Heroes, and The Long Great  Wall, added a passionate atmosphere to the performance. These  cultural and art programs were put together by the TRPAPC  political department's song and dance ensemble after two months  of rehearsal which formally began on 21 April.    After the show, Chen Kuiyuan, Raidi, Guo Jinlong, and other  regional leaders walked onto the stage and cordially shook hands  with all performers and stage workers, and extended their  congratulations.</p>

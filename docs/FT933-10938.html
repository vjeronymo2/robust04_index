			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Travel: Where the quiet inlets lap the green hills - Peter Marsh finds a cure for his worries beside the Kingsbridge estuary in south Devon BRITAIN is governed by charmless incompetents; you are seriously worried by the Pounds 50bn budget deficit; Ted Dexter is more annoying each day. A cure for all these concerns is to sit outside the Old Stable Kiosk in south Devon and gaze at one of the most tranquil scenes in England. You get to the Old Stable by taking a five-minute ferry ride across the mouth of the Kingsbridge estuary from the pretty town of Salcombe. A short walk from the landing stage is a small shed-like building next to a grassy hillock overlooking the water. Inside this ancient structure, converted into a cafe, are two elderly women with pinafores who will smilingly serve you a cup of coffee or an ice cream. Additionally, to take home for supper later, you can help yourself to locally grown potatoes and tomatoes, leaving the money in a jar. From your wooden bench on the hillock, you take in the small, white houses of Salcombe climbing up the hill on the other side of the water. There is the great expanse of the estuary itself, its various inlets pushing back like the protrusions of a star fish into the green background of gently rolling hills. Ahead of you is a mass of sailing boats, gently cutting to and fro across the inlet, and over to your right the famous Salcombe lifeboat, its proud yellow and blue hull at rest above the bobbing waves. Further away, towards the open sea of the English Channel to your left, the undulations of the land on the other side of the estuary are somewhat craggier, with perhaps the faintest hint of mist blowing in. Below where you are sitting is a small beach. It is difficult to tell from here, but its sand has just the right clingy consistency to make quite grand castles, or even miniature cathedrals. Small figures race about. It is a blissful spot. I must have sat there 20 times and each time leaving is more difficult. The main point of going to the South Hams area of Devon is to visit places like this. The area is exceptionally beautiful. Perhaps because it is some way from the main tourist towns and has few big hotels, it has not been spoilt by visitors. It is apparent from the restrictive nature of local planning rules that the planning officers of South Hams District Council want to keep things this way. I have never met them, but assume they are tough-minded individuals who would sooner die than allow the merest hint of mass tourism to sully their region. The best way to appreciate South Hams is to rent a cottage or house for a short spell. The tourist office at Kingsbridge, the main town of the region, keeps a useful list. It is from Kingsbridge, too, that you can take boat trips on the estuary that dominates the area. Contact the River Maid ferry company for details. Many of the special places in the area offer a similar combination of rolling hills, sky and water to that found at the Old Stable. A few miles to the north-west of Salcombe is the coastal village of Thurlestone, which boasts one of the most scenic golf courses in England. You do not have to be a member of Thurlestone golf club to follow the cliff-top path snaking round the course overlooking the sea. If you can, go there on a rough, grey day when the waves are battering the rocks and the sea looks like frothed milk. Slightly to the north of Thurlestone, connected by a sandbar to the small village of Bigbury-on-Sea and isolated at high tide, is a grass-covered hunk of rock known as Burgh Island. It is a haven for sea birds; there are virtually no buildings apart from a highly-regarded hotel. Burgh Island exerts a powerful and memorable fascination. Studied at length at different times of the day through binoculars, the island's contours and colours seem to change depending on the position of the sun, the volume of cloud and the spray of the sea. Watching these slow changes over a period of hours is little short of dramatic. There is one other place worth mentioning: from the village of Aveton Gifford walk along the tidal road that takes you next to the lonely, glorious River Avon in the direction of the sea. Watch out for bird life and also the incoming tide. A cap of mine blew off in this spot some years ago. It is probably still there, rotting in the mud and the reeds. I cannot think of a better resting place.</p>

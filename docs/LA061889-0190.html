			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> D.C. IS THE PLACE TO BE WHEN IT COMES TO PADDLING  </P> <P> It wasn't easy, but Cathy Hearn was doing her best to explain to a puzzled  newcomer how she manages to stay among the top whitewater kayakers in the  world, even though she's moved from the suburbs of Washington to rural  Connecticut.  </P> <P> "Look," she finally said in gentle exasperation, "D.C. is the center of the  paddling universe, okay? But it isn't the paddling universe."  </P> <P> Or maybe you didn't know that here among the monuments in shining marble, the  stately boulevards, the oppressive summer heat and the mile-high stacks of  bureaucratic paper, a world-class sporting dynasty lurks.  </P> <P> If you didn't, you'll find out over this weekend and next as the cream of  international whitewater racing competes in the first world paddling  championships ever held in the United States.  </P> <P> Six hundred slalom and wildwater canoeists and kayakers from 25 nations are now  convened at the rumbling Savage River, a Potomac tributary in Western Maryland,  for racing that begins Saturday. Few among them failed to make a stop in  Washington along the way to pay tribute to some of the best in the game.  </P> <P> It's been 10 years now since Hearn, 31, her brother Davey, 30, and suburban  Washington neighbors Jon Lugbill and Bob Robison rocked the whitewater world  with a dazzling display of boating virtuosity at the 1979 worlds in Jonquiere,  Quebec.  </P> <P> When it was over, Americans were uncontested champions of the paddling world.  Lugbill, Davey Hearn and Robison swept the top three places in slalom canoe, an  event no American ever had won before, and Cathy Hearn took three of the four  gold medals in women's kayak, which no American had won before, either.  </P> <P> In the decade since, Americans in general and Washingtonians in particular have  set the pace in the fast-changing sport of whitewater slalom, which in 1992  rejoins the Olympics for the first time in 20 years.  </P> <P> Since 1979, for example, Lugbill and Davey Hearn have finished one-two in every  slalom canoe championship, Lugbill taking four of the five golds in such  far-flung places as Bourg St. Maurice, France; Bala, Wales; and Merano, Italy,  to become the top slalom canoeist of all time.  </P> <P> Meantime, lured by U.S. successes, top racers from England, Australia, France,  Italy, New Zealand and elsewhere have migrated to train for weeks and months  with Washington's elite on a Potomac River practice course just below Little  Falls, not 10 miles from the White House.  </P> <P> Now come the worlds as partial reward. "The International Canoe Federation let  us know they would look favorably on an American bid after we did so well again  in 1983," said U.S. slalom team coach Bill Endicott.  </P> <P> To understand the origins of Washington's whitewater phenomenon, it helps to  know a bit about the nation's capital, its remarkable river and the highly  motivated people it attracts.  </P> <P> Endicott, for example, moved to town in the mid-1970s, fresh from a graduate  degree at Harvard, with an ambition to fix some of the nation's social ills. He  worked a while as a congressman's aide, then on the prestigious Democratic  Study Group.  </P> <P> But as an ex-whitewater paddler and Harvard oarsman, he couldn't help noticing  the beautiful river cascading through his adopted city. Before long, he was out  playing on Potomac whitewater.  </P> <P> There he ran into Lugbill, the Hearns and a host of other local youngsters, all  fired up about racing after Silver Spring, Md.'s Jamie McEwan won a bronze  medal in slalom canoe in the 1972 Olympics, the only previous Olympics ever to  feature the arcane sport. When the youngsters asked Endicott to coach them, he  agreed.  </P> <P> Within a few years, Endicott had quit his career to devote full time to  coaching, living off a modest trust fund and spending mornings and evenings  hounding his charges up and down the Potomac with a stopwatch.  </P> <P> "Bill wound up the perfect coach," said Cathy Hearn. "He provided organization,  objectivity and helped the overall attitude of the group, but he didn't try to  tell us what to do.  </P> <P> "But the most valuable thing," she said, "was that he was a tireless, fanatical  worker. Here was this volunteer killing himself for us. What were we going to  do in return for him? The feeling was, we'd better deliver."  </P> <P> And they did. In 1977, Robison, then 15, was fourth in slalom canoe at the  world championships in Spittall, Austria. The Washington-based, two-man canoe  team of Steve and Mike Garvis also took fourth and Cathy Hearn won a bronze  medal in the women's kayak team race.  </P> <P> That should have been fair warning to the world, but no one, not even the  Americans, was prepared for the 1979 tour de force, which signaled the start of  U.S. domination in a sport practically no one in the nation had even competed  in before 1957.  </P> <P> By 1981, decked canoes designed by Lugbill, Robison and Davey Hearn were the  standard for the world, as they are today, and slalom paddling and  boat-handling techniques the trio devised were miles ahead of anyone else's, as  they also remain.  </P> <P> "I was 18 years old when I won the world championship for the first time," said  Lugbill, shaking his head in wonder during a lunch-hour break from his job as  Potomac River water quality analyst for the metropolitan Washington Council of  Governments. "That's amazing."  </P> <P> Far more remarkable is the fact he remains world champion a decade later, with  no one on the horizon except perennial Washington, D.C., rival Hearn and recent  Washington transplant Jed Prentice even remotely likely to overtake him.  </P> <P> Washingtonians have redefined whitewater slalom canoeing. To understand how  requires a little background on the sport itself.  </P> <P> Whitewater river-running underwent a sea change in the early 1960s with the  advent of fiberglass boats. Before then, runs through rapids were hair-raising  affairs in heavy, open, aluminum or wooden boats or folding, canvas-covered  kayaks that needed patching after every run.  </P> <P> Plastic provided a light, durable, cheap, easily repairable alternative.  Suddenly, rampaging rivers that had been the province of daredevils and fools  were approachable by the masses.  </P> <P> A busy racing schedule evolved, with races following two forms. Slalom  competitors ran 600-yard courses through 25 gates strung in the toughest  places, with penalties if they touched the gatepoles; wildwater racers went  five miles or so in a straight shot downriver with no gates, like downhill ski  racers.  </P> <P> Both disciplines flowered in Europe, where world whitewater championships had  been held since 1949, but developed more slowly in the United States.  </P> <P> McEwan's charge to Olympic bronze in 1972 changed that. "We were out on a  geological expedition that summer," said Cathy Hearn, "and when we heard the  news on the radio, I remember saying, 'That's for me.' "  </P> <P> Washington, with the largest canoe club in the nation, the 2,000-member Canoe  Cruisers Association, was just the place for the movement to take hold. And the  new interest in paddling corresponded to a time of dramatically improving river  quality as President Lyndon B. Johnson's mid-1960s pledge to make the Potomac  swimmable began taking effect.  </P> <P> The young Hearns found themselves increasingly headed to the river, where they  bumped into Lugbill and his brother Ron; Robison; the Garvises; Lecky and Fritz  Haller; Chris, Mike and Mark McCormick and a host of other would-be world  beaters.  </P> <P> In the rebellious days of the early '70s, "Our attitude was whatever had been  done in the past, we weren't going to do," said Lugbill. "Anything that was  status quo we changed."  </P> <P> Lugbill and Robison became known for their frenetic paddling style, directly  contrary to European traditions of smoothness and technique. The pair were  comical figures on the river, crashing and flipping and running out of control.  </P> <P> Meantime, Lugbill, Robison and Davey Hearn spent their spare time rubbishing  old boat designs in an effort to shape a better hull. Conventional slalom  canoes were too big, they decided, so they sawed a smaller kayak in half,  expanded it to make it legal canoe size, and laid up a decked canoe in its  shape.  </P> <P> The youngsters discovered that the sleeker, smaller boat made it possible to  sneak under slalom gates sideways. That was much faster, and as they perfected  techniques, Robison accidentally invented the quick "pivot turn" now favored by  all slalom racers.  </P> <P> Robison demonstrated his pivot to slack-jawed European competitors at the 1979  worlds. For them, the American nightmare had begun, and old-school European  slalom canoeists haven't fully recovered yet.  </P> <P> To be sure, Europeans will win their share of medals on the Savage. The U.S.  grip has slackened as the best American paddlers aged. Cathy Hearn is a long  shot, at best, to win a medal this year; after several bouts of shoulder  trouble, she's only the second-best U.S. women's kayaker behind Dartmouth  graduate Dana Chladek, who moved to Washington to train two years ago. David  Hearn at 30 is beginning to suffer aches and pains.  </P> <P> The British have a stranglehold on men's and women's slalom kayak events, with  three-time gold medalist Richard Fox a near lock in the men's division and  countrymate Liz Sharman the favorite on the women's side.  </P> <P> Americans never have dominated wildwater competition, which remains largely the  province of Eastern Europeans, and in fact the United States has not taken  overall national honors at the worlds since 1981, although it's been a strong  second each year.  </P> <P> But there will be special advantages for the Americans in having the event in  their own backyard, while Soviets, Czechs, Aussies, French and New Zealanders  wrestle with the cultural and social discombobulations the Americans long have  endured overseas.  </P> <P> But the voyage to Maryland's most rural county, with just 25,000 inhabitants  and millions of trees, should be pleasant enough for foreigners. They'll enjoy  the best whitewater racing stretch in the east.  </P> <P> At night, the visitors may gaze upon a starlit summer sky, its brilliance  undiminished by urban haze. And on the way home, they can always stop in  Washington for a last glimpse of the paddling universe from the other side.  </P> <P> From the center, looking out.  </P></p>

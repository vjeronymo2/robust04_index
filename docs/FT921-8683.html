			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Conservative Names urge probe of alleged malpractice THE POLITICAL controversy surrounding the Lloyd's of London insurance market this week has highlighted the position of Conservative MPs who are also Names. A few Conservative MPs, who themselves could face heavy losses as a result of their membership of syndicates specialising in loss-making catastrophe reinsurance business, have been at the forefront of the controversy and have pressed the government to look into allegations of malpractice by market insiders at Lloyd's. More than 40 Conservative MPs - out of a total of 366 - are Names at Lloyd's. Many, including Mr John Wakeham, the energy secretary, joined Lloyd's in the 1970s when the low costs and profitability of the market made it an attractive investment. At a time of high marginal tax rates the ability to offset insurance losses against tax was also seen as a benefit. Even in the past three years - as asbestosis, pollution and catastrophe claims have pushed Lloyd's into the red - many MPs have still made money out of Lloyd's. Some, though, may be hard hit. For example, Mr Paul Marland, MP for Gloucester West who joined the market in 1987, is a member of a number of syndicates managed by Rose Thomson Young and Gooda Walker, which will produce some of the worst results in the market in 1988, 1989 and 1990. Mr Marland is one of 3,000 Gooda Names to have received cash calls. Last month the Gooda Walker syndicates announced a cash call of Pounds 101m. MPs from the south of England have also been pressed by Names among their constituents who are angry about the way the market's recent losses appear to have been concentrated among a minority of Names in the market. In these circumstances Tory backbenchers have been receptive to allegations from Names about malpractices by insiders at Lloyd's. Many MPs argue that the evidence presented by discontented Names shows that the self-regulation introduced by the 1982 Lloyd's Act is no longer adequate. Tory MPs are reluctant to side openly with Labour MPs who have consistently called for more independent regulation of the Lloyd's market, but they are keen to press for action. Mr David Tredinnick, Tory MP for Bosworth, who like Mr Marland is also a member of catastrophe re-insurance syndicates, said: 'There is a feeling that self-regulation may not have been as successful as was first thought. This is a classic opportunity for self-regulation to prove itself.' Mr Tredinnick said he had suffered 'some losses', but his concern was for the future of the market. Mr Roger Knapman, MP for Stroud, said the current regime was not satisfactory and that self-regulation was something Lloyd's must take 'very seriously.' Mr Knapman, who joined Lloyd's in 1978 and was a member of 10 Lloyd's syndicates last year, said the market should 'deal very seriously' with anyone who did not maintain the highest standards. They must realise that Names are their 'bread and butter' and 'stand behind them,' he added. However, there was a danger that reform would bring 'suffocating layers of regulation' which would make the market uncompetitive. Mr Knapman said of his own financial exposure: 'I do not expect good news.' As well as Mr Marland and Mr Tredinnick, two other MPs have been members of catastrophe re-insurance syndicates in recent years. Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, was a member of 255 in 1990, but he stopped underwriting last year. Mr Gerald Bowden, MP for Dulwich, was a member of the Gooda Walker syndicates 298 and 299 in 1989. According to Lloyd's Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, were members of Lloyd's last year. Other members included Mr Edward Heath, the former prime minister; Mr Archie Hamilton, the armed forces minister; Mr Alan Howarth, a junior education minister; Mr Peter Lloyd, a junior Home Office minister; Sir Nicholas Lyell, the solicitor-general; Mr Richard Needham, a junior Northern Ireland minister; and Mr Timothy Renton, the arts minister. Other Tory MPs who were members include Mr Robert Adley (Christchurch), Mr Rupert Allason (Torbay), Mr James Arbuthnot (Wanstead and Woodford), Mr David Ashby (Leicestershire NW), Mr Spencer Batiste (Elmet), Mr Henry Bellingham (Norfolk NW), Sir Peter Blaker (Blackpool South), Sir Nicholas Bonsor (Upminster), Mr Robert Boscawen (Somerset &amp; Frome), Mr Kenneth Carlisle (Lincoln), Mr Winston Churchill (Davyhulme), Mr David Evennett (Erith &amp; Crayford), Sir John Farr (Harborough), Sir Norman Fowler (Sutton Coldfield), Mr Ralph Howell (Norfolk N), Sir Anthony Meyer (Clywd), Mr John Moore (Croydon C), Sir Charles Morrison (Devizes), Mr Graham Riddick (Colne Valley), Mr Jonathan Sayeed (Bristol E), Sir William Shelton (Streatham), Mr Anthony Steen (S Hams), Mr Neil Thorne (Ilford S), Mr John Townend (Bridlington), Mr Peter Viggers (Gosport), Sir John Wheeler (Westminster N), and Mr Jerry Wiggin (Weston-super-Mare).</p>

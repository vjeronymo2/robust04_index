			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / People: M W Marshall Mike Knowles (right), who started his City career as a foreign exchange dealer with the Bank of Tokyo nearly 30 years ago, has come out of semi-retirement to take on the chairmanship of M W Marshall, one of the world's biggest foreign exchange brokers. Knowles, 50, has been assoc-iated with Marshalls since 1965 but retired shortly after the Pounds 175m management buy-out from British &amp; Commonwealth in February 1989. Although he is no longer involved in the day-to-day management of Marshalls, he has remained a director of Marshalls Finance, the holding company for the management buy-out. He says that he was invited to return full-time to Marshalls after it was decided to split Chris Kelson's role as chairman and chief executive. Knowles says that the buy-out has gone 'very well' and the decision to split Kelson's dual function was merely a reflection of current trends in corp-orate governance. Kelson remains chief executive and Tony Porter, head of Marshall's European division, has been appointed managing director.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Shanayev] </F>   [Text] Vladikavkaz June 5 TASS -- In recent days, the  situation has become relatively stable in the part of North  Ossetia where state of emergency rule was extended for another  two months, from May 31 to July 31. According to military  sources, no conflicts on ethnic grounds broke out in the zone  over the past twenty-four hours. Russian peacekeeping troops,  in close coordination with local law-enforcement bodies, are  overseeing the state of emergency rule.    Officials of federal ministries and agencies continue  working  in the region, a spokesman for the North Ossetian president and  government told TASS on Sunday. They examine the situation in  the conflict zone and address issues of housing, communications,  economic facilities in North Ossetia's Prigorodny District, the  hotbed of the armed conflict.    North Ossetian mass media gave on Sunday wide comments on  the  statement by the republic's President Akhsarbek Galazov, saying  the North Ossetian leadership is ready to comply with the  Russian president's decree on the return of refugees to places  of their permanent residence. However, the problem of refugees  should be solved in complex, on the basis of documents signed in  Kislovodsk. The final word is to be said here by commissions of  conciliation.</p>

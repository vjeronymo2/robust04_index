			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Halifax finds increase in house prices House prices last year rose in every region of the UK except three, a survey by Halifax building society, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, indicated yesterday. The figures comparing the final three months of last year with the last quarter of 1992 showed that prices rose across much of southern and eastern England, some of the areas worst affected by the recession. Prices rose most sharply last year in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The only regions where prices declined further were in greater London where prices fell 0.6 per cent and the north of England where prices fell 0.1 per cent. House prices in the West Midlands were static. All other regions showed an increase in annual prices since the end of 1992 in spite of falls in many regions during the final three months of last year, said the society. Halifax said yesterday: 'Across the UK as a whole the picture is reasonably flat with prices rising on average by 1.2 per cent between December 1992 and December last year.' The society expects average prices to rise by 5 per cent over the next 12 months. It added that the gap between house prices in the north and south of the country had narrowed considerably during the recession. Prices in greater London were now only 1.4 times those in Yorkshire and Humberside compared with 2.8 times in 1988, the building society added. Meanwhile Nationwide, Britain's second largest building society, said that house prices in the final three months of last year were 2.9 per cent higher than during the final quarter of 1992.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         DOWNWARD TREND IN LONDON  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Avg price       % rise (fall)     % rise (fall)                           Q4 1993          on Q4 1992        on Q3 1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- N Ireland             Pounds 39,756          6.4              (-1.3) North                 Pounds 51,738        (-0.1)             (-1.2) W Midlands            Pounds 61,680            0              (-0.5) North-west            Pounds 56,133          1.4              (-0.7) Wales                 Pounds 52,366          0.9              (-2.2) Yorks &amp; Hmbside       Pounds 52,436          1.9              (-2.4) S-East                Pounds 76,219          3.5              (-0.6) Scotland              Pounds 57,091          5.1                1.3 S-West                Pounds 61,448          1.0              (-1.3) E Midlands            Pounds 54,483          2.7              (-1.1) E Anglia              Pounds 58,827          1.5              (-0.4) Gtr London            Pounds 76,408        (-0.6)             (-1.0)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Halifax Building Society  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

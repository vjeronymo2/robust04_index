			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Sun Alliance in South Korean link SUN ALLIANCE, the UK's biggest insurer, has announced a co-operation agreement with the Lucky Insurance Company of South Korea, a part of the industrial and commercial conglomerate, Lucky Goldstar. Lucky is one of the largest non-life companies in Korea with total assets of over Pounds 290m. Sun Alliance will establish a representative office in Seoul, reinsure a portion of Lucky's local business and insure some of its overseas subsidiaries. The two companies will also exchange technical and market information. Sun Alliance is interested in the long-term prospects of sales in the rapidly growing South Korean life insurance market. Contact with Lucky was made via Wm McGee, a US underwriting agency, owned by Sun Alliance, which handles Lucky's US business. The deal is the third announced by Sun Alliance in the Far east in the last six months. Last December it established a new general insurance subsidiary in Indonesia in association with leading local business interests. In January it increased its share of the New Zealand market by buying a local subsidiary of the Guardian Royal Exchange. Sun Alliance also has a co-operation agreement with the Japanese company, Taisho.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["ban"-attributed report: "Kanther Calls For Tougher Laws"] </F>   [Text] Bonn, 16 May -- Interior Minister Manfred Kanther  (Christian Democratic Union) stated on Monday [16 May] that the  "1994 law on the fight against crime," drafted by the coalition,  contains measures against criminals like those who are  responsible for the riots in Magdeburg. Kanther condemned the  attacks by racist skinheads on foreigners last week. They are a  "shame" for the country. However, the interior minister  refrained from criticizing the work of the police in Magdeburg  on Monday. President Richard von Weizsaecker stated during the  weekend that he does not understand why the criminals who were  detained in Magdeburg were released again immediately.    Kanther pointed out that the draft of the coalition on  internal security is designed to accelerate legal proceedings  with conclusive evidence. According to domestic-policy experts  among the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union  [CDU/CSU] and the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], the  so-called summary proceedings will be used both in the fight  against violent crime and for the "extension of the reason for  detention because of the danger of recurrence." Kanther  announced that the law on custody will be more effective in the  future. The legal rules on incitement to hatred and violence  against segments of the population and on instigation of racial  hatred will be expanded. The use of Nazi symbols will be  punishable. The law on bodily injury will be tightened. The  first and third reading of the draft law will take place at the  Bundestag on Friday. In a speech at the Konrad Adenauer  Foundation in St. Augustin near Bonn, Kanther described internal  security as a precondition for freedom and internal peace.  There is no easy solution in the fight against crime, he  emphasized. New forms of crime must be combated with additional  legal rules. Kanther regretted the fact the package of the  coalition does not include the CDU/CSU demand for the permission  to tap private residences in the fight against organized crime.  "I regret that, but I hope that the coalition partner will one  day see the need for this measure." Kanther stated that the  government and the coalition are making efforts to adopt a new  law on the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation and to amend  the law on the Federal Border Police before the end of the  legislative period. The cabinet approved the draft last week.  However, there are doubts among the coalition that there will  be enough time before the Bundestag elections to comprehensively  amend the legal basis of the Federal Office of Criminal  Investigation.    Kanther announced that the "preconditions for practical  cooperation among the security authorities" should be improved  during the German presidency of the European Union in the second  half of 1994. Europe's integration must not have the effect  "that borders fall for the criminals but continue to exist for  the investigating authorities," Kanther pointed out. If border  controls are eliminated, compensatory measures must be adopted.  Otherwise there is the danger that "new obstacles" are being  created at the borders of the national states. Cooperation with  the police in the East European states must be improved. It  must primarily be designed to enhance the fight against  organized crime, drug trafficking, and car thefts. Smugglers of  refugees are to be treated in the same way as drug dealers  because "they are driving other people into misery because of  pure greed for profit," Kanther stressed.</p>

We all recall the Chernobyl tragedy  and other similar accidents.    Now a new concept has been submitted to the European  Organization for Nuclear Research -- generation of electricity  at a nuclear power station linked with a particle accelerator.  The new reactor will be operating in a subcritical mode which  rules out the occurrence of a chain reaction. The electricity  will be supplied from particle accelerators. According to  experts the new power generation technique will be competitive  since it does not require new technological development while at  the same time providing an ecologically relatively clean,  inexhaustible, and reliable source of energy.

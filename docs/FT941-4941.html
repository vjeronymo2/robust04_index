			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Sporting Bentley design unveiled Rolls-Royce Motor Cars yesterday surprised the Geneva motor show by unveiling a concept study for a 'smaller' Bentley convertible and coupe. The model, if it is put into production, could come close to doubling production volumes by the end of the decade. The Concept Java 'could set the scene for the next generation of sporting Bentleys', the company said. Mr Peter Ward, chief executive of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, said the company would test the concept and customer views 'for at least one more year'. Development of the car would take four or five years, meaning that production could start by the end of the 1990s. 'If we do it, we would aim to have it in the market before the year 2000,' said Mr Ward. He said the car could sell for Pounds 90,000 to Pounds 100,000, bringing it into direct competition with luxury sports cars such as the Mercedes-Benz 600 SL. Current Rolls-Royce and Bentley models cost from Pounds 97,000 to Pounds 175,000. Mr Ward said research indicated that Bentley could sell 1,500 to 2,000 cars a year in this market worldwide. The Java has been developed in a collaboration between Rolls-Royce's design team and the Warwick-based Design Research Associates headed by Mr Roy Axe, former chief designer of Rover. Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, a subsidiary of Vickers, the UK engineering and defence group, has only recently returned to break-even after suffering heavy losses in 1991 and 1992. The technology for Java's 3.5-litre engine has been developed by Cosworth Engineering, another Vickers subsidiary. A theoretical top speed of 170mph would be electronically limited to 155mph.</p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Perry is approved as next defence secretary The Senate Armed Services Committee yesterday unanimously approved the nomination of Mr William Perry as next secretary of defence. Its chairman, Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, predicted confirmation by the full Senate within 24 hours. Mr Perry, previously deputy secretary, struck all the right notes in his hearings and was gently treated by Senators. He said he would back US field commanders, promote internal reorganisation and seek more defence funds if necessary (he estimated a current five-year budget gap of Dollars 20bn, less than the Dollars 50bn pointed to by Mr Les Aspin, outgoing secretary). He promised to be a full player in the Clinton administration's often criticised foreign and security team, expressing strong concern about North Korea's attempt to acquire nuclear capability.</p>

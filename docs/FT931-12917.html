			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Scotts water industry plans unpopular MR IAN LANG, the Scottish secretary, is being urged to ignore widespread opposition to the idea of privatising the water and sewerage industry in Scotland and floating the industry as one or more companies on the Stock Exchange. Bell Lawrie White, the Edinburgh stockbroker, says the supposedly soft option of franchising the management of the Scottish water industry to private-sector companies would be just as unpopular as outright privatisation, while being more complex and costly. Political opposition to privatising the Scottish water industry has intensified, with Strathclyde regional council saying it will put the government's plans for the industry to a referendum of its 1.7m voters, once they are finalised. Bell Lawrie White was responding to a Scottish Office consultation paper detailing options for the Scottish water and sewerage industries. Unlike their counterparts in England and Wales, the Scottish industries are still in the public sector. The government says change is necessary because local government is being reorganised and private-sector finance is desirable to help fund the industry's heavy investment needs. Water privatisation in any form is rejected not only by the opposition parties but by some Conservatives. Recently the Scottish landowners' federation said it opposed the private ownership of water. Bell Lawrie White says creating one to three public limited companies embracing the water industry and floating them on the Stock Exchange would be seen by the public as a Scottish solution and would build on the successful privatisation of the Scottish electricity companies. The option of franchising water, under which the assets would be owned by a new company limited by guarantee which franchised their operation to a private company, would be unpopular because most potential franchisees would be English or French rather than Scottish companies.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Miloje Drobnjak from Bijelo Polje] </F>   [Text] A rally is taking place in Bijelo Polje, addressed  by members of the delegation of the Russian state Duma, led by  Aleksandar Vengerovskiy, deputy chairman of the Russian lower  house, who is also the deputy president of the Liberal  Democratic Party of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. Several thousand  citizens of Bijelo Polje are attending the rally in the rain.    Russia lost its historical allies under Gorbachev. We are  therefore here to mend that, to tell you that we will never  desert you and forget you, (Vengerovskiy) said. He further said  that the Balkans is the Russian zone of interest and influence,  and that no Turkish or NATO presence will be allowed here. He  added: Your enemies are our enemies. No new world order will  be established so long as it is aimed against the nation that is  fighting for its freedom, as is the case with the Serbian people.    Vengerovskiy further said: We are here to help you. We want  to socialize and trade with you. Russia will again be the  market for your products. Russia is today swamped with poor  quality goods from Turkey and Syria, but we can remember with  fondness your good quality clothes, shoes, and foodstuffs.    To shouts from the audience of "Russia, Serbia!,"  Vengerovskiy said that the Mediterranean Sea is a Slav sea, and  that Russian ships, not U.S. ones, would sail in it. Other  members of the delegation of the Russian state Duma addressed  the rally, as did the leaders of the Serbian National Renewal,  who organized the visit by the Russian parliamentarians.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Goran Persson, Social Democratic </F> Party finance policy spokesman, by Sigrid Leijonhufvud in  Stockholm; date not given: "Persson Sees Light at End of Tunnel"]    [Text] The Social Democrats have begun preparations for the  transfer of power that they are hoping and fighting for in an  election campaign that for all practical purposes has already  begun.    In an interview that lasted a couple of hours and was  interrupted by an intriguing minor riot in the ranks, we were  told by the shadow government's minister of finance, 45-year-old  Goran Persson, that he was working under high pressure on an  emergency program for Sweden. There are parallels with the  emergency program that, under the title "Future for Sweden," was  worked out by a task force headed by current party Chairman  Ingvar Carlsson in 1981. It has not been decided whether the new  program will be made public during the election campaign.    But in any case, it will be the basis for a "running start"  by the Social Democrats if they win the election.  <H5>  Program Under Discussion </H5>   The crisis is far from over even though, figuratively  speaking, Goran Persson can see light at the end of the tunnel.    But now a more short-term program with the same title as the  one in 1981 -- "Future for Sweden" -- is under discussion. It  has been only a few days since Persson, along with Ingvar  Carlsson and party secretary Mona Sahlin, presented the Social  Democratic Party's shadow budget.    We asked: "Are you pleased with the reaction?"    He answered: "Yes, I am."    Persson is such a good shadow minister that not a shadow of  doubt crossed his face.    He said with a satisfied grin: "The criticism we are getting  from the nonsocialist side is awfully sour. That is partly  because we have gotten a grip on savings and are showing  responsibility for state finances and partly because we, too,  have a program against unemployment."    In his budget alternative, Persson came up with a balance  for  fiscal 1994-95 that is just over 5 billion kronor better than  the government's proposal even though spending increases total  22 billion kronor. The equation was solved largely by the  assumption that 90,000 new jobs will produce more tax revenues  and reduce expenditures by 15.8 billion kronor.    "Is that voodoo economics?"    "No," he answered. "I don't let that criticism bother me.  There is a very strong connection between higher unemployment  and a deterioration in state finances. If the connection is so  obvious in that direction, then the same thing applies in the  other direction."    Persson also remarked that there has been hardly any  criticism of his proposals regarding taxes on capital and  stockholders.    According to the party's tax bill, reintroducing double  taxation -- Persson does not like the expression -- will mean  3.9 billion kronor in higher taxes from the households concerned  and 1.6 billion from firms in fiscal 1994-95 alone.    He said: "We have noticed the silence on that subject.  Naturally, we are going to step up our criticism of the  government regarding taxes on capital, an area where we see that  we are in a very strong position."    The government's tax reductions, combined with unemployment,  are going to be the Social Democratic Party's big issue in the  election campaign. Persson makes no secret of that fact.    We asked: "What about internal criticism?"    He answered: "I have tried to use the kind of language that  Social Democrats will recognize. It consists of combining an  austere message with arguments regarding an income distribution  policy while always emphasizing the fight against unemployment.  It has been very well received."  <H5>  "People's Home" Preferred Over "Welfare State" </H5>   With that in mind, Persson has very deliberately used the  expression "people's home," which he feels is better than the  "somewhat bloated" expression "welfare state."    We asked: "What about the proposal to reduce the parents'  insurance benefit?" (The same card that the government was going  to play the next day.)    He answered: "Things have gone very well there, too. It is  not popular, but on the other hand...."    "Does this increase confidence in your policy?"    "Yes. It is a matter, you know, of showing that we must  effect savings, and if we do so, people are going to feel it.  But when we make these proposals, which are touchy ones, we also  include the line of reasoning about taxing stockholders. The two  issues go together."    We asked: "Does this mean that there is no criticism worth  taking seriously?"    He answered: "I want to be clear and say that it is going to  be very hard and difficult work reducing unemployment. On that  subject we probably need more open discussion of the problems.  But it is a subject on which we have not gotten much reaction  yet."    "Do you mean that the line of reasoning is not fully  developed in your bill?"    "Yes, it is a bigger job than many people think -- except  for  the unemployed, of course, who naturally understand the whole  thing in their own way. In other words, I would like to see more  problemizing on the whole subject. I miss that contribution to  the debate."    We asked: "But how will it be possible, using measures  adopted by the Riksdag at its spring session, to make a big  impact on employment and the national budget so quickly?"    He answered: "We cannot swear to the last billion kronor or  the last 10,000 jobs or the phasing-in of the program in one  fiscal year. But it is still an accurate way of describing the  process."    We said: "In his guest editorial in DAGENS NYHETER, Carl  Bildt criticized you on a number of points."    Persson replied: "I haven't actually read it."    But he explained the absence from the Social Democratic bill  of a section on the EU [European Union] by saying that his party  does not disagree with the government when it comes to the  importance of joining the EU.    We asked: "So what happened to your talk about the spiral of  depression in earlier bills?"    He replied: "It was an obvious danger as recently as last  fall, when the economic fraternity was split on that point. The  question was whether Finland's path would become our path. If  so, should we say that we did not believe it would? No, it is  better to be cautious. Fortunately, private consumption had  bottomed out at the time. The spiral did not continue downward,  but we still have a dual economy, with one part growing like mad  while the other is declining."    We asked: "Is the fact that private consumption is rising  slightly the reason why you are not again proposing a drop in  VAT [value-added tax]?"    Persson answered: "Yes, but there are also technical  reasons.  Reducing VAT for seven months is not meaningful, and we said  right from the start that the lower rates should not continue  past the end of 1994."  <H5>  Questioned About Deletion </H5>   At that point the interview was interrupted: Social  Democratic members of the Riksdag's Communications Committee  wanted to know why they had not been consulted before Persson,  in completing the bill, deleted 1.7 billion kronor in planned  highway spending from the package for the coming fiscal year.    After the interruption, he explained: "That was the last  thing I did Sunday [24 January] night."    In his criticism, Bildt pointed out that the Social  Democrats  were including 1.5 billion kronor in the budget as the proceeds  from selling off the venture capital firms Atle and Bure, but  had left out the several billion kronor that would not be  collected because they wanted to halt the privatization of  Assidoman.    Persson said generously: "I can accept that criticism if  Bildt will promise not to sell off Assidoman." But he agrees  that what is involved is naturally not savings but an injection  of cash into the budget.    "But notice that we are also including one-time effects in  the other direction, and they are much bigger than this one," he  says, drawing attention to, among other things, the proposal on  direct write-offs, which is expected to cost the Treasury 5  billion kronor during fiscal 1994-95.    Work on the shadow budget began in November after the  government presented its autumn bill. Based on the opinions of  10 or so forecasting institutes and his own economic staff in  the Riksdag Building, Persson attempted to evaluate the  situation as it would look in January.    About 20 November, he presented his analysis to about 10  Social Democratic economists from universities, banks, and union  organizations.    Social Democrats from the Riksdag's Finance Committee also  attended.    Persson told them: "Early in December, I will approach the  main Riksdag group and give them my opinion. I will say it means  that the budget work ahead of us is going to be very troublesome  but that our focus should be on investment. But I also want room  for reform -- something that will provide encouragement. So I  put in an extra 50 million kronor for culture and another 100  million kronor for adult education. But the whole thing must  result in a budget proposal in which the balance will not be  worse than that in the government's proposal."    To remind the committee members that it was necessary to  effect savings, Persson wrote them a letter in the middle of  December. We asked: "What did it say?"    He replied: "During the Christmas break, you must come up  with a bunch of savings that we can decide on when we return in  January."    We asked: "Did they come up with savings or revenue  enhancements?"    He answered: "Both. We call it savings, but they often  involve tax increases."    Just before Christmas, Persson met with economists from the  TCO [Central Organization of Salaried Employees], who were  shocked by his prediction that the government would forecast a  2.4-percent growth rate for 1994. (Persson is more than a little  proud that his prediction, made in November, was right on the  mark.) The TCO was expecting a growth rate of 1 percent this  year.    Then the government's budget was presented on 10 January.    "But what surprised me when I read the budget was that the  government had not been able to come up with a savings package.  That was a weak spot. I had been thinking that they would be  able to save something."  <H5>  Few Billion Kronor in Savings Proposal </H5>   Aside from the tax increases already adopted at the fall  session of the Riksdag, the government had only a few billion  kronor in its savings proposal for 1994-95. The savings  concerned dental care and medicines plus what Persson calls Ian  Wachtmeister savings on the allowance for families with more  than one child, the press subsidy, and the subsidy for home  language instruction.    "Those last items were nothing more than political  provocations."    The message to the committees, however, was that they should  accept anything in the way of savings that the government had  proposed. What came next was a real tussle over the budget -- a  foretaste of what may be in store. Except when priority areas  were involved, Persson sat in his office and, with Ingvar  Carlsson's consent, knocked down every bright spending proposal  by the committee members.    "They sat there, one by one, in the same chair you are  sitting in," he told me with a smile that made me feel like I  was sitting in a catapult.    The undermining of parents' insurance, which was included in  the savings package that Sten Andersson was never able to push  through last spring, was taken care of by Mona Sahlin with the  help of other combative women members of the Riksdag.    The proposal came from Persson's staff, but it was  unacceptable to the group until Sahlin and several others hit  upon a compromise that called for pushing the effective date  back from 1 July to the start of 1995.    Before the budget debate in the Riksdag on 10 January, it  was  decided in consultation with Ingvar Carlsson that Goran Persson  would make an "all-out attack."    "It is possible in that way to expose one's flank and be  attacked in return if one does not protect oneself. But I knew  that we had savings and a better balance than the government  even if the matter of parents' insurance had not been settled."    After 10 January, the temperature at Social Democratic  headquarters rose several degrees. The budget tussle and new  calculations every five minutes resulted in the drastic cut of  1.7 billion kronor from the communications budget on the night  of 23 January.    We asked: "In previous proposals, the Social Democrats  strongly emphasized the reform proposal that called for removing  sickness and industrial injury insurance from the budget and  then eventually increasing it by 45 billion kronor. Is that no  longer included?"    "Our position is the same as before. The change in position  that may be noted is that we are now putting even more emphasis  on the dangers involved in the budget deficit and the national  debt."    We said: "Excluding the proposal for direct write-offs,  which  will be in effect for only one year, the tax burden on the firms  will increase under your proposal."    He answered: "No, we are not going to increase the tax  burden  on companies. We just need time, since it is difficult for  technical reasons to roll back some of the government's reforms.  Here it is also important to say that we are not going to cancel  the tax reduction for self-employed individuals which was  introduced last fall and which is being financed by taxes on  foreign travel expenses and a slight increase in employers  contributions."    We asked: "You may benefit businesses, but the businessmen  will not be allowed to get rich. Isn't that a dilemma?"    Persson said: "You are talking like a nonsocialist  propagandist. We lowered the corporation tax and the tax on  dividends radically as part of the tax reform. Isn't it  reasonable to see how that works first? If the reduced tax on  capital leads to a big inflow of venture capital, it will mean  that during its term of office, the government will have lowered  the tax on capital by 25 billion kronor without creating all  that many jobs."  <H5>  Can Solve the Problem </H5>   Persson does not see any lack of venture capital in the  stock  market, but he admits that the problem exists for smaller firms.    "We have always been open to dialogue with the business  community, and we can solve this problem, too. But it requires  that we have some kind of social contract in which everyone must  be involved and help carry the burden," says Persson. He claims  that he has no objection at all to businessmen getting rich,  provided that their wealth is linked to production and that they  build up something.    "On the other hand, we find it very hard to see the point in  the present situation, in which a small number of people are  building private fortunes with the help of tax subsidies. The  danger here is that we will have a rerun of the 1980's!"    That warning comes from Goran Persson, who is unlikely to be  thinking of the same rerun that Carl Bildt has already starting  warning us of.  <H5>  Bio Data </H5>    -  Hans Goran Persson, 44, is a member of the Riksdag.

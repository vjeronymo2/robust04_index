			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Observer: Mile high club KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is experiencing an unusual industrial hiccup - an unexpected cabin crew shortage because of stewardess pregnancies. Apparently the pregnancy rate among flight attendants this year has jumped 31 per cent - to 275 - from the usual figure of about 210 pregnancies annually among the airline's 4,400 stewardesses. Don't panic. KLM says no flights will be cancelled because of the staff shortage; a recruitment effort is under way.</p>

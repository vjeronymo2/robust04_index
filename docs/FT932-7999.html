			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Danes rewarded with stimulus package THE DANISH government yesterday brushed aside violent demonstrations sparked by Tuesday's referendum result endorsing the European Community's Maastricht treaty, and as a reward for the Yes vote announced a programme to stimulate economic growth and employment. The riots in an inner city district of Copenhagen left 11 demonstrators wounded by police gunfire and 26 policemen injured. They were said by officials to have been the worst peacetime disturbances in Denmark. The government blamed a small fringe group of militant squatters, know as BZers. Little damage was done to property, the main targets being the windows of several bank branches and a few damaged cars. Yesterday the area returned quickly to normal, but local residents were braced in case of further disturbances last night. The government insisted the attacks did not represent the feelings of the vast majority of No voters. Condemning the riots as an isolated incident, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the Social Democratic prime minister, told parliament the government would slash marginal income tax rates to bring them closer into line with the rest of the EC and bring forward state investment plans to push up growth in gross domestic product from under 1 per cent this year to almost 3.5 per cent in 1994. Mr Rasmussen said the signal from Danish voters was that Europe's political leaders must close the gap that had opened between them and their electorates over Maastricht by adopting pragmatic policies which tackled problems such as unemployment, which have a direct impact on the everyday lives of European citizens. 'We have to be more engaged', he said. At the same time, Denmark's central bank cut the official discount rate to 8.25 per cent from 9.25 per cent and commercial banks announced similar reductions in their lending and deposit rates, which had been held artificially high because of uncertainty over the Maastricht vote. Business reaction was positive. The Copenhagen stock market, which had risen strongly in expectation of a Yes vote, put on a further 2.30 points to close at 303.89. The tax cuts aim to galvanise other EC member states to rally behind a beefed-up economic growth package ahead of next month's EC summit in Copenhagen. The Danish presidency of the EC, working with the European Commission, wants member states to consider fresh measures to stimulate growth, mainly through shifting to capital spending, making the labour market more flexible, and other fiscal incentives to create jobs. The 'growth package' and the unemployment crisis in the EC are top of the agenda at a two-day meeting of EC finance ministers in Kolding, Denmark, which starts tomorrow. Mr Rasmussen said the government's economic package would 'break the curve of rising unemployment', bringing the jobless rate down from 12 per cent at present to about 11 per cent in 1994. Called 'New Course for Better Times', the package will reduce marginal income tax rates from next year to a band of 38-58 per cent, compared with 52-68 per cent at present. The tax cuts will eventually be financed by 'green' taxes on petrol, electricity, heating, water consumption and, among other things, plastic bags. But there will be a strong stimulus to private spending next year because the full impact of the green taxes will not take effect immediately. The boost from tax cuts in 1994 will be equal to about 0.5 per cent of GDP, or about DKr5bn (Pounds 526m), and should produce growth in real private consumption next year of 4.3 per cent. An accompanying upgrade of training programmes is designed to improve the skills of the workforce. Rasmussen quick to reward voters, Page 2 Editorial Comment, Page 19</p>

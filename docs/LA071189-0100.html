			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CUOMO TALKS ABOUT 1992 POSSIBILITIES  </P> <P> New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, reopening a door that he had closed last year,  said Monday that as a public servant he is "obliged to be open to the  possibility" of running for President.  </P> <P> "Of course you have to be open," said Cuomo in an appearance before the New  York State Broadcasters Assn.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Cuomo, a Democrat, said all such talk about his political future  was speculative. Cuomo was widely expected to run for President in 1988, but he  decided against it.  </P> <P> Cuomo has said that he expects to run for reelection as governor next year. In  his speech Monday he reiterated that he doesn't believe a person can run for  President while serving as governor.  </P> <P> Cuomo also said, as he did in 1987, that the Democratic Party would be able to  find excellent candidates for the presidency in 1992 without turning to him.  </P> <P> "I'll think about it . . . but I won't think too much," he said jokingly.  </P></p>

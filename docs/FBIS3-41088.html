The narcotic was discovered in special  compartments of a transformer stored in the packing department  of a well-known freight shipping company.    In making the foregoing announcement, the Office of the  Attorney General of the Republic added that the consignees of  the drugs would soon be arrested. It is believed that this will  have ramifications on the country's northern border, because the  alkaloid presumably was to be sent to a construction firm with  headquarters in that area. It was intended for subsequent  shipment to the United States for sale and consumption. [passage  omitted]</p>

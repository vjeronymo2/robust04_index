			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SIMI VALLEY;  </P> <P> COUNCIL REJECTS PLAN NEAR CIVIC CENTER  </P> <P> The Simi Valley City Council has rejected a plan for a commercial and  residential development on 38 acres across the street from the Civic Center.  </P> <P> After a public hearing, during which several residents spoke against the  project, the council voted 5 to 0 Monday night to uphold the Planning  Commission's recommendation to deny the draft plan.  </P> <P> The Irvine-based Lusk Co. wants to build 51 single-family houses, 41  townhouses, and 226,000 square feet of commercial and office space at the  southwest corner of Tapo Canyon Road and Alamo Street.  </P> <P> However, council members said they were not satisfied with the design of the  commercial portion of the planned development, which they said should have a  unique quality because of its proximity to the Civic Center.  </P> <P> Officials said the current proposal resembles a strip mall and is inconsistent  with the city's General Plan, which calls for a "courtyard theme."  </P> <P> "I'd like to see a little more imagination put into it," Councilman Glen McAdoo  said of the design. "It just doesn't satisfy what I was looking for in an area  that's very different, very unique."  </P> <P> Peter Lauener, project manager for Lusk Co., said he was disappointed with the  council's decision because his company has worked closely with neighborhood  groups and a city committee to come up with the plan.  </P> <P> He said the company has been working on the project for three years.  </P> <P> City officials sided with residents who objected to traffic from the commercial  portion emptying onto a residential street. They said the commercial and  residential areas should be separate.  </P> <P> Assistant City Manager Jay Corey said the Lusk Co. will have to redesign the  Civic Center Plaza and make a new presentation to the Planning Commission  before going back to the council.

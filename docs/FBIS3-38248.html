Germany worries about the stability of its central  European neighbours; Britain worries about the health of the  Atlantic alliance; Mediterranean countries worry about their  Arab neighbours, especially Algeria. All those worries are  legitimate, and should be addressed by the EU's [European  Union's] common foreign and security policy. The last,  especially, should be taken more seriously in northern Europe  than it has been so far.    Two years ago the Algerian army intervened to forestall the  election victory of the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS]. It  proposed to smash the violent hard core of the opposition while  introducing economic reforms to restore hope to those who had  joined it out of despair. That strategy has not worked. In  fact, the economic side of it has not even been tried. The bold  economic reforms launched between 1989 and 1991 have been  reversed, making impossible any deal with the IMF and Algeria's  other creditors on the country's $25 billion foreign debt, which  will absorb 100 per cent of its export revenue this year.    Politically, Islamic militants denied power through the  ballot box have turned to violence. Repression, accompanied by  human rights violations, has further radicalised the opposition,  and even secular parties boycotted the "national consensus  conference" held by the regime this week, since the exclusion of  the FIS deprived it of credibility. The country is sliding into  civil war.    These developments threaten Europe on several levels. Civil  war invariably produces large flows of refugees, many of whom in  this case would be bound to cross the Mediterranean. Their  arrival would exacerbate racial tensions. The war could spread  to north African communities in Europe. Islamic militants, if  they lose, might resort to terrorism not only against Europeans  in Algeria but against targets in Europe itself. If they win  after a long and bitter struggle, Europe would face a prickly  and hostile neighbour within easy missile range. Either way, an  Algeria racked by civil war and deprived of much of its  Westernised middle class would not attract foreign investment  and would be likely to stagnate economically. Europe could face  more and more poor and angry people on its very doorstep.    Only a genuine dialogue between the army and the FIS offers  any hope of a peaceful solution. The EU should use its good  offices to help bring this about. By promising economic aid and  increased market access for a peaceful, democratic Algeria, it  could offer an incentive to both sides to negotiate, and  reassurance to those in the country who fear that an Islamic  victory would mean isolation from Europe and wholesale  suppression of human rights. Continued support for the status  quo can only store up worse trouble for the future.</p>

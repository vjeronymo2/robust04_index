			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / International Company News: Interest in Turkish food sector rises CORN PRODUCTS, the US group which owns the Knorr brand name, has bought out its local Turkish partner in the latest move by foreign companies to move into Turkey's food and beverage industry. The US company paid Dollars 5.5m for 40 per cent of Besan, owned by Koc Holding group, Turkey's largest industrial company. Koc is disposing of a number of interests to focus on core activities like motor and consumer electronics. Bankers say there is a growing foreign interest in the Turkish food and beverage market, notably the manufacturing, retail and distribution sides. Unilever recently acquired control of the Komili edible oils group after a fierce battle for market share. Cargill of the US purchased Yanikoy, a local glucose manufacturer. In food retailing, Koc has established two outlets in Istanbul with Prisunic, the French food stores company. Carrefour, the French hypermarket group, is also considering investment in Turkey. Turkey's privatisation agency offered in November to sell its 93 per cent share in Gima, the state-owned chain of food stores.</p>

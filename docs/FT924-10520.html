			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / General Motors - The Embattled Giant: European operations offer a beacon of hope WHEN GM looks for light in its darkest hour it is the corporation's European operations that offer a beacon of hope. GM Europe is the proof that the world's largest industrial corporation can successfully transform a chronic loss-maker into a record profit earner. After seven years in which it ran up total net losses of Dollars 2.2bn and made a tiny net profit in only one year, 1982, GM Europe finally climbed back into profit in 1987 and has never looked back since. In the five years from 1987 to 1991 it has racked up total net profits of Dollars 8.5bn. Last year it was clearly the most profitable of the big six volume car makers in Europe. It raised the net profits of its core Opel/Vauxhall car and light commercial vehicle operations to a record Dollars 1.96bn, despite the launch costs for its new generation Astra small family car, GM's best-selling car in Europe. Admittedly, the return to profit in Europe has occurred during years in which west European new car sales have also risen to record levels, but GM has still clearly out-performed its European rivals financially. Its record profits have also been achieved, while the profits of many of its competitors in Europe have been sliding, and its arch rival, Ford of Europe, has seen peak profits of Dollars 1.6bn in 1988 melt away to a record loss last year of Dollars 961m. Ironically, Mr Robert Stempel, the man forced out of the GM chairmanship this week, and Mr Jack Smith, GM president since April's boardroom coup, were both instrumental in the gradual transformation of the European business. Mr Stempel led GM's European car operations from 1980 to 1982 as chairman of Adam Opel, the group's German subsidiary. The European operation was still deep in loss, but GM laid the foundations in this period for its recovery with heavy investment in its first range of small cars in Europe, the Opel Corsa/Vauxhall Nova, including the building of an assembly plant in Spain. It was Mr Smith who brought GM Europe into profit, however, and left an indelible mark on the operations in a period of less than two-and-a-half years from early 1986. He is credited with driving down costs, transforming GM Europe components purchasing with global sourcing, introducing innovative labour reforms and streamlining the product development process, while also pushing forward programmes for vital image cars, such as the Opel/ Vauxhall Calibra coupe. Some of the key senior executives from the successful European management team have since risen quickly through GM's turmoil elsewhere in the world, most notably Mr Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, whom Mr Smith promoted last April to head GM worldwide purchasing. A vital ingredient in Opel/Vauxhall's success has been the development of a highly competitive product range, and Mr Wayne Cherry, GM Europe's head of design for much of the past decade, has also been promoted back to the US as design vice-president. Rivals have drawn on GM Europe too in the search for management talent, most notably Chrysler which earlier this year poached Mr Robert Eaton, GM Europe president for the past four years, to succeed the legendary Mr Lee Iacocca as Chrysler chairman. From a market share of only 8.2 per cent in 1981 GM is capturing more than 12 per cent of west European new car sales. In a decade it has moved from a poor last place among the big six volume car makers to number two behind the Volkswagen group of Germany, having pushed ahead of Fiat of Italy in the first nine months this year. It has taken control of Saab Automobile in Sweden, in an attempt to add a second, up-market marque in Europe. GM Europe has also expanded aggressively into east Europe. This year it has opened an engine and small assembly plant in Hungary, a new car assembly plant in eastern Germany and is negotiating a deal with FSO in Poland. The task facing Mr Louis Hughes, the 43-year-old president of GM Europe, is to hold on to the impressive gains of the past decade, as the west European new car market moves into reverse. It is a formidable challenge with GM planning to increase its capacity in Europe by 25 per cent from 1990 to 1995, largely through three-shift operations and increased productivity at existing operations, but also through the new plants in east Europe. With a new management team he must seek to ensure the financial mayhem in Detroit does not bite too deeply into his plans for Europe, where new product programmes are needed for areas such as mini cars, multi-purpose vehicles and light commercial vehicles.</p>

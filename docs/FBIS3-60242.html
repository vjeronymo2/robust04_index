This is intended to comply with the eco-labelling policy and at  the same time to practise the principle of sustainable  development.    Mohamed Hasan, chairman of the Business Council for  Sustainable Development (MUIPB), addressed a meeting on  enforcing the eco- efficiency program in current industrial  development in Jakarta on 23 November. [passage omitted]    Professor Dr. Otto Sumarwoto, executive director of MUIPB,  said an industry must improve its production efficiency and  comply with enviromental regulations as required by the society.    The environmental expert from the Bandung-based University  of  Pajajaran said that lately the government has been encouraging  industrialists to advocate the principles of environmental  protection by adopting environmental regulations and making  structural changes in their production processes. However,  members of the international community who are consumers should  also boycott goods whose production processes produce  environmentally harmful waste. [passage omitted]    According to Otto, basically, the eco-efficiency program is  an effort to urge industries to use efficient raw materials that  will reduce pollution output. In this way, the industries are  minimizing the environmental impact. In view of this, the  eco-efficiency program not only requires industries to abide by  the people's demand for environmental protection, it also  provides the industries with competitiveness and increases their  profits over the long term.

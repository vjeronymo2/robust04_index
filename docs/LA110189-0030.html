			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'ISRAEL DIVIDED ONCE AGAIN'  </P> <P> The answer to "Israel Divided" may rest with Israel's president, Chaim Herzog.  Mainline American Jewish organizations should press him to intervene in  bringing about the necessary peace negotiations. The longer they are delayed by  Shamir's tactics, not only will Israel suffer, but support for the Jewish state  will be fragmentized.  </P> <P> Herzog's views, made public in the Oct. 1 Opinion piece by Tad Szulc, were that  the situation had reached a point where he (Herzog) had to " 'step over the  line' of presidential prerogatives to protect the national interests." And as  Szulc notes, Israel's president has the background, temperament and public  trust to bring the peace process -- which Herzog insists is "irreversible" --  into being.  </P> <P> Yet, at a subsequent meeting at which the Los Angeles Israeli consul general  was the speaker, his response to a question as to the powers of the Israeli  president, in light of Szulc's article, was surprising.  </P> <P> He had read the article, but questioned its authenticity as he had yet to see  an "official" transcript, and from his personal knowledge of Chaim Herzog, he  doubted the president would inject himself into the current Israeli political  stalemate.  </P> <P> The Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations, while staying clear  of Israel's "politics," however, can inject itself. Peace and American  interests in the region are issues that are the agenda of all its constituents  and their respective memberships. It remains central to Israel's future as a  nation and link to Jewish life in the United States and elsewhere.  </P> <P> HYMAN H. HAVES  </P> <P> Pacific Palisades  </P></p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: James Dickie doubles as margins improve Acquisitions and reorganisation in the previous period underpinned a strong full-year performance at James Dickie, the engineering components manufacturer. On turnover ahead 31 per cent to Pounds 21.7m, pre-tax profits for the 12 months to August 31 doubled from Pounds 678,000 to Pounds 1.35m. The shares rose 11p to 166p. Mr Hugh Jack, chairman, said the company also benefited from increased volumes at its main customers. Margins improved despite continuing difficulties in passing on costs. The order book was well ahead on a year-on-year basis: 'Management is investigating ways of overcoming capacity constraints which we may come up against later in the year if our order book continues to grow further,' he said. A proposed final dividend of 2.5p brings the total to 3.5p (2p), covered 4.4 times by earnings of 15.3p (8.4p) per share. The company intends to move from the USM to the Official List.</p>

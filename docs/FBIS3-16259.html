He also said that the peace process was over and laid the  entire blame for this on Georgia.    On March 10, the Georgian parliament charged Abkhazia's  Council of Ministers with the task of performing the Abkhazian  parliament's functions pending early parliamentary elections,  and granted the Council of Ministers the status of a temporarily  discharged body.    The Georgian parliament's resolution says that all legal  acts  passed by the Abkhazian separatists shall be considered invalid.</p>

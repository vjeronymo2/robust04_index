			<p>BFN     [Text] [Correspondent] The prime ministers of Poland and  the Czech Republic, Waldemar Pawlak and Vaclav Klaus, have had a  meeting in the Czocha castle, near Lesna, Jelenia Gora province.  They discussed, among other things, our efforts to join the  European Union and Polish-Czech economic relations. The venue  and the date of the meeting were agreed upon by the heads of  both governments in Prague in January at the Visegrad Group  summit in which President Bill Clinton took part. Pawlak and  Klaus decided then that they would hold meetings at least once a  year.    [Begin Pawlak recording] The number of direct meetings  between representatives of the Polish and the Czech side  manifests clearly that we attach great significance to our  mutual relations. [end recording]    [Correspondent] The talks concerned, among other things,  efforts that are being made by both states to enter the European  Union. Poland has already submitted its application for  membership in the union. The Czech Republic has so far  refrained from making this decision.    [Begin Klaus recording, in Czech with superimposed Polish  translation] I wish Poland to be ready as soon as possible to  become a full member of the European Union. We have no  intention of competing with you in this respect. The Czech  Republic has also been doing everything to enter the union. [end  recording]    [Correspondent] The prime ministers have also talked about  large investment projects for the power and fuel industries.  The Czech Republic is interested in using Polish ports and  pipelines leading through our country. The prime ministers also  discussed the situation of the Polish minority in the Czech  Republic and the Czech minority in Poland.</p>

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Environmentalists win in BC mine battle BOWING TO strong pressure from North American environmentalists, the British Columbia government has barred further development of the Windy Craggy copper and gold deposit in the scenic north-west corner of the province. The area, in the watershed of the Tatshenshini River 60 km east of the Alaska panhandle, will be set aside for an 8.5m hectare wilderness park, straddling the US-Canada border. The government said yesterday that it will 'fairly' compensate Geddes Resources, which has so far spent CDollars 50m on exploration and development, and holders of other mineral claims in the area. Windy Craggy, widely thought to contain North America's richest undeveloped copper reserves, has become a focal point of the clash between resource industries and environmentalists. Development of the site, which is estimated to contain about 2.7m tonnes of copper, has been stalled for four years by environmental disputes. The chief executives of five Vancouver-based mining companies warned last week that a decision to turn the area into park land would have a negative impact on investor confidence in the province. Besides the rich metal content of the deposit, the mining industry has pointed to the job-creation potential of a new mine. Environmentalists on the other hand, have argued that a mine would do incalculable damage to rivers and wildlife in one of the most pristine parts of the continent. The Clinton administration has suggested creating a protected wildlife area straddling BC and Alaska. Royal Oak Mines of Vancouver this year bought a 39 per cent stake in Geddes, reasoning that its CDollars 10m (Pounds 5.3m) investment would be more than covered by compensation if the project was blocked.  -------------------------------------       LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  -------------------------------------        (As at Monday's close) tonnes  ------------------------------------- Aluminium   +8,400 to 1,877,325 Copper      +6,750 to   456,125 Lead           -50 to   258,925 Nickel      -2,130 to    88,362 Zinc        +2,950 to   680,625 Tin            -95 to    20,105  -------------------------------------</p>

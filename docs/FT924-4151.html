			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of Management Buy-outs (1): Proving their worth - Recession has seen the buy-out gain widespread acceptance as a way of restructuring businesses. But times are tougher for backers as deals fall in value and more effort is required to put them together MANAGEMENT buy-outs have had a good recession. They have proved their worth as a means of restructuring companies and almost redeemed the mistakes of the 1988-89 boom. Nothing, it appears, succeeds quite like a buy-out in motivating managers and in revitalising tired businesses. Few corporate boards will now reject the idea of selling a non-core or under-performing business to management as an alternative to a sale a corporate buyer. ICI, BP and Hanson have all disposed of parts of their operations by means of a buy-out in recent months. Some idea of the scale of activity in the UK can be gained from the fact that there were more buy-outs in 1991 than acquisitions of independent companies. Total buy-out activity over the past decade has amounted to nearly 4,200 deals worth more than Pounds 26bn at current prices, according to Nottingham University's Centre for Management Buy-Out Research. Buy-out transactions have declined throughout Europe over the past two years from the feverish levels of 1988-89. But they still accounted for 55 per cent of all UK venture capital investments by value last year and for 35 per cent of European venture capital spending. That is the good news. But life has grown tougher for the organisations which arrange and finance buy-outs. They are having to devote more effort to putting deals together and, with less debt finance available to gear up the equity, face the prospect of lower returns in the next few years. The size of deals and hence the return for the effort involved has also fallen. The largest buy-out completed by the end of November was the Pounds 140m purchase of Gaymer Group Europe - owner of the Olde English cider, Babycham and Sanatogen Tonic Wine brands - from Allied-Lyons. Compare this with the late 1980s when every year set a new record: MFI valued at Pounds 718m in 1987, Reedpack worth Pounds 805m in 1988 and Gateway at Pounds 2.37bn in 1989. The number of large buy-outs - those worth more than Pounds 50m - is closely linked to the economic cycle because the bigger deals are more dependent on the willingness of the banks to provide debt finance, according to a recent study by London Business School. But investment in smaller transactions - valued at less than Pounds 25m - remains fairly constant throughout the economic cycle because these deals usually have lower levels of gearing, the researchers found. Overall, 1992 seems set to mark a slight recovery in the UK buy-out sector after two years of decline. Forty four large deals (each valued at Pounds 10m or more) worth a total of Pounds 1.47bn were completed in the first nine months of the year. This compares with the same number of deals, although with a total value of Pounds 1.88bn, completed in the whole of 1991, according to accountants KPMG Peat Marwick. Buy-out fund managers believe there will a sharp increase in the number of deals completed in the final three months of the year. 'There are more signs of life in the market,' says Mr Hugh Mumford, managing director of Electra. 'Financially stretched companies which deferred a decision to dispose of parts of their business now realise they have to sell.' Several vendors are under pressure to complete disposals by the end of the year so that they can include the sale price in the 1992 accounts, says another buy-out specialist. This pressure to complete a sale has meant that many vendors have become more realistic about the price they can expect. Some deal-makers remain concerned about price levels however. This is one reason Morgan Grenfell Development Capital has not completed a large deal in the past year, according to Mr Robert Smith, chief executive. Deal activity is only one measure of the buy-out sector's success, however. Realisations are just as crucial to its health. MFI, seen by many as bell-wether of the buy-out industry, finally achieved a public listing, at a valuation of Pounds 669m, in July but in general 'exit' options have narrowed. After a brief opening of the listing 'window' in the immediate aftermath of the Conservative's election victory in April the stock market has not looked kindly on flotations. The Unlisted Securities Market and even the small end of the main stock market lack liquidity and are less attractive to company boards, while corporate purchasers have had less time to look for acquisitions as they wrestle with their own problems. 'We have been hanging on longer to our buy-out investments than in boom times,' says Mr Stephen Curran, chief executive of Candover Investments. 'Returns will come down over the next few years,' forecasts Mr Mumford. 'Big returns were made from leverage in the 1980s. To achieve results in future the venture capital community will have to become more creative.' A few years ago venture capitalists saw a profitable market in taking public companies private again once the gloss of a public listing wore off. But these deals have proved difficult. The institutions are reluctant to see the diversity of their listed company portfolios reduced and frequently suspect managers of misusing inside information on the business. The banks are often reluctant to finance such deals because of problems in securing their lending and it is frequently difficult to suggest a plausible 'exit' strategy when the buy-out is removing the most obvious exit of all. After six 'going private' deals in 1991, only one deal - of Continuous Stationery, the Prontaprint franchise group - has been done this year. In October Mr Alan Sugar, founder of Amstrad, the consumer electronics group, announced plans to take his company private but ran into criticism over the price he was offering for the shares and the amount of information provided on his future plans for the company. Buy-out fund managers believe the number of companies going private will be restricted to businesses still dominated by a strong founding entrepreneur but, as Amstrad illustrates, even these deals are not trouble-free. Public-to-private deals may be difficult to do but the privatisation of public sector organisations continues apace. Local councils, bus operators and port authorities have been selling parts of their operations while the proposed privatisation of British Coal opens up further opportunities. British venture groups have played a leading role in spreading equity financing techniques throughout Europe but some British groups are now more cautious about doing deals there. Eastern Europe appears to offer great opportunities as state industries are privatised. However UK groups are wary. 'A huge amount of work needs to be done on the physical, legal and accounting infrastructure in eastern Europe,' says Mr Michael Smith, managing director of Citicorp Venture Capital. In spite of this Citicorp has backed deals in Hungary and has been more active than most in financing buy-outs in continental Europe. Throughout continental Europe, buy-out activity declined by an estimated 15 per cent in 1991 with just 354 deals being completed, according to the Centre for Management Buy-Out Research. The total value of deals rose slightly however, from Pounds 4bn to Pounds 4.2bn. The buy-out has gained widespread acceptance as a means of restructuring overstretched businesses and inefficient national economies. Even if nothing else emerges UK funds will have a job to do arranging more sensible financial structures for the over-borrowed buy-outs of the late 1980s. But their main challenge will be to continue to give investors the high levels of return they have come to expect. Many UK pension funds and other institutions are reviewing their commitment to unquoted investments as an asset class. The buy-out specialists will have their work cut out to meet their expectations.</p>

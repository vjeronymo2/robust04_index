			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Wetherspoon jumps to Pounds 4.2m JD WETHERSPOON, the Lon-don pub chain which was floated last October, celebrated its first anniversary by reporting a doubling in profits, excluding the effect of property disposals. Pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 4.17m in the year to July 31, compared with Pounds 2.08m last time. However, under FRS 3, last year's figure was reduced to Pounds 926,000, reflecting a write-down caused by the sale of six pubs before the group's flotation. Sales expanded 44 per cent to Pounds 30.8m. Mr Tim Martin, chairman, said the 44 pubs in the group at the time of flotation had performed well in a difficult trading environment. The group had opened a further 23 pubs between then and the end of July, which had all exceeded budgets and were trading profitably after finance charges since opening. He said: 'Although bar sales were down 1 per cent on a like-for-like basis, catering - which accounts for 12 per cent of turnover - increased sales by 27 per cent, being particularly strong in recently opened venues.' Mr Martin said the group's all-day menu, which offered food from 11am to 10pm, had proved a great success. The creation of smoke-free areas in the group's pubs, averaging about a third of each venue, had also been well received. The group will open 20 more pubs in the current year. Mr Martin said the huge success of a pub opened in Croydon had encouraged the group to look for good provincial sites. It had recently acquired a pub in Norwich, had planning permission for a new outlet in Reading and was interested in expanding into the Midlands. Earnings per share were 14.7p, a rise of 18.5 per cent on the pro-forma figure in the prospectus. Under FRS 3, the comparative figure is 5.8p. A proposed final dividend of 3.6p gives a total of 5.4p (2.4p). COMMENT JD Wetherspoon's shares, unchanged yesterday at 341p, have more than doubled since last year's flotation at 160p. That partly reflects enthusiasm for the group's strong marketing skills, and partly the market's growing support for small companies. The confidence and success with which Mr Martin has introduced features such as no-smoking areas suggest that he retains a close grip on which his customers want. Analysts like the company, but are divided as to whether the shares have risen far enough for the time being. Forecast earnings of Pounds 5.8m put the shares on a prospective multiple of 18, a healthy premium to the market. They may not race ahead in the short term, but on a longer view should reflect the group's strong growth prospects.</p>

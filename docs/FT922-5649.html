			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Government Bonds: Benchmark Government Bonds Belgium, Denmark and Spain: Between April 30 and May 20 bond yields for these markets supplied to the Financial Times and published here were calculated on a semi-annual basis, rather than the annual basis which is the local standard. Bond yields for this period recalculated on an annual basis can be obtained by application to: Garry Hayes, Financial Times, 1 Southwark Bridge, London, SE1 9HL. The yield basis used in this table for the Italian government bond market was changed from semi-annual to annual on May 20, to reflect the method more commonly used in the market. For comparison purposes, yields for Italian government bonds before May 20, recalculated on the same annual basis, can be obtained by application to the same address.</p>

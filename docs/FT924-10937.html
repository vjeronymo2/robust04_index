			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / International Company News: Placer Dome seeks understanding PLACER DOME, the Canadian mining group, expects next week to emerge with a new understanding about its gold operations in Papua New Guinea. Mr Peter Crossgrove, its new vice-chairman, has agreed to travel to PNG for a meeting on November 5 with Mr Paias Wingti, the recently-elected prime minister. Shares in companies with big PNG interests have fallen following comments by Mr Wingti indicating his government wishes to renegotiate some natural resource contracts. PD's 75.7 per cent-owned Australian subsidiary, Placer Pacific, has a stake in two of PNG's newest gold mines: 30 per cent of Porgera, one of the lowest-cost in the world, which is expected to produce more than 1.4m troy ounces this year, and 80 per cent of Misima, scheduled to produce 300,000 ounces. Mr Crossgrove, in London yesterday, said he hoped 'to settle all the issues to everybody's satisfaction', at the meeting at Mr Wingti's home, when the future of mining in PNG would top the agenda. He pointed out that PD had been operating in PNG since 1938 and that the Porgera mining agreement was considered a model for future projects there. Mr Crossgrove is widely expected to be appointed PD's chairman after a successor to Mr Tony Petrina, who resigned recently as president, is named.</p>

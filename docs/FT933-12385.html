			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / High Court halts British Coal move to divert pension surplus BRITISH COAL'S plan to use its Pounds 481m half share of a staff pension fund surplus to help finance redundancies was blocked by the High Court yesterday. Mr Justice Vinelott ruled that British Coal would have to pay funds into the scheme to cover enhanced pensions for redundant workers and could not rely on a portion of the scheme's surplus to cover its obligations instead. In April the fund's trustees took legal advice that British Coal's plans to withhold payment were barred by the scheme's rules. Both parties sought a court ruling and two scheme members joined the case, arguing that employers did not have the right to extract surpluses for their own benefit. The judge said the scheme forbade the employer from extracting cash from the scheme for its own use. Failure to make an agreed payment to cover a specific expense amounted to a cash withdrawal, he said. But he stopped short of suggesting that employers were generally forbidden from altering scheme rules for their own benefit. Ms Angela Dimsdale-Gill, of solicitors Lovell White Durant which represented the trustees, said the court specifically rejected one argument in the case which could have set limits on employers' ability to extract surpluses from schemes in other cases. That argument, put by two scheme members, said it would be a violation of an employer's fiduciary duty as a trustee to alter scheme rules for his own benefit. Ms Gill said the judge had drawn a distinction between a private trust and a public trust fund, such as a pension scheme. Pension schemes were commercial trusts and had to take commercial considerations into account, he said. British Coal had agreed to pay the Pounds 481m into the scheme in staged payments, and in April would have been required to make a Pounds 100m contribution for the current year. However, at the urging of government ministers it argued that because it is entitled to use half of the existing surplus for its own benefit, its portion of the surplus should be used to cover its contribution instead. The surplus totalled more than Pounds 1bn at the scheme's last actuarial valuation three years ago. A 1990 amendment to the scheme's rules said surpluses should be split equally to benefit members and the employer. British Coal has been enjoying its share of the surplus in the form of a contributions holiday. The six-figure legal costs will be paid from the pension fund.</p>

			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Calls grow for action on insider dealing SOME OF the UK's largest fund managers yesterday backed calls for a fresh crackdown on insider dealing, following a letter to the Financial Times from a senior fund manager which called for a 'radical review' of the area. The expressions of concern came as the Treasury began to circulate privately the latest draft of its insider dealing legislation, which was amended in response to City fears that the law would interfere with the way financial markets in the UK operate. In his letter published in yesterday's edition of the Financial Times, Mr Paul Myners, chairman of Gartmore, criticised the stock exchange for being 'superficial' in its investigations, adding: 'I'm concerned that theft is taking place, doing a great deal of damage to confidence in our financial institutions.' Other fund managers yesterday backed his criticisms. 'There appears to be a lot of price volatility, some of which later appears to have been justified,' said Mr David Rough, investment director at Legal and General, the insurance company. Small and medium-sized companies appeared to be particularly prone to suspicious price movements, he said. Many fund mangers claimed that they had either been offered price-sensitive information by brokers or company managers, or knew of others who had received it. 'It is a subject which is cropping up with a lot of fund managers,' said one shareholder, adding that the matter has been discussed periodically at meetings of the investment committee of the Association of British Insurers. 'The problem is we can't rely on a self-regulatory body like the stock exchange to police its own members,' complained another. However, investment banks and stockbrokers generally claimed yesterday that insider dealing had become less of a problem than in the past. 'I would have thought that it would have been largely cleaned up 10 years ago,' said Mr Christopher Reeves, vice chairman of Merrill Lynch International. It would be 'absolutely extraordinary' if insider dealing was still rife in large financial institutions, he added. The stock exchange defended its record of investigating suspected insider dealing, but added that investigators needed more powers, and that a central body should be set up to take on insider dealing investigations being handled by a number of different agencies. However, the Treasury denied that the present investigation and prosecution arrangements needed to be changed. It said that the nature of insider dealing meant that it would always remain a difficult offence to prosecute. An official said: 'The central difficulty with pursuing insider dealers is establishing that someone actually possessed inside information. It's easy to have the suspicion.' The letter from Mr Myners followed a sharp fall in the share price of Tiphook, the transport rental group, ahead of a profits warning a week ago. The stock exchange is understood to have started monitoring all trading in Tiphook's shares some days before the company issued its profit warning a week last Thursday. Tiphook approached its financial adviser, UBS, on the preceding Friday to say it wanted to make a statement about trading and other issues, including the sale of some trailers. The statement was not issued until Thursday, apparently because Tiphook did not conclude the trailer sale until Wednesday. Details, Page 10</p>

			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Top Cuban ideologue dismissed over scandal CUBA'S Communist party has broken its official silence on the sacking three weeks ago of Mr Carlos Aldana, the party's ideology and foreign relations chief, saying he was dismissed because of a financial scandal, writes Canute James. The party said Mr Aldana, who was also responsible for culture, science and sports, had accepted favours from a company director who had earlier been arrested for the evasion of taxes and customs duties and for violating the country's strict foreign currency regulations. The statement is an apparent attempt to end speculation that Mr Aldana, an adviser to President Fidel Castro and one of the architects of government policy, had been dismissed because he had argued for a moderation of economic policies, including a more tolerant attitude to private enterprise in some sectors.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava May 30 (CTK) -- Most Slovaks (around 21  percent) would vote for former Premier Vladimir Meciar's HZDS  (Movement for a Democratic Slovakia), a poll conducted by the  independent Focus agency in May revealed.    Then HZDS is followed by the Democratic Left Party (SDL)  with  12 percent, the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) with 7  percent, Slovak Workers' Party (SSD, 7 percent) and Premier  Jozef Moravcik's Democratic Union of Slovakia (DEUS, 6 percent).    The rest of the parties would not cross the five-percent  barrier necessary for entering the parliament.    These results somewhat differ from those obtained by the  Slovak Statistical Office, according to which the HZDS would  receive 27 percent, the SDL 16 percent, the KDH 11 percent, the  SSD three percent and the DEUS five percent.</p>

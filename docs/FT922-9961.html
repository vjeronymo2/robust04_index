			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Fulcrum Trust raising funds and seeking to extend life FULCRUM Investment Trust is asking shareholders to approve a Pounds 12.9m rights issue and to extend its life to 1999. The split capital trust currently has two classes of shares: income and capital. The directors propose an underwritten rights issue of income shares on the basis of 5-for-2 at 57p. In addition, it is planned to create a new class of capital - zero dividend preference shares - which will have first claim on the assets. Just over 8.6m of these shares will be placed with existing capital shareholders having the right of clawback on a 7-for-13 basis. The zeros, which are being placed at 103p, will be entitled to receive 208p on the new winding-up date in 1999. This is equivalent to a redemption yield of 10.8 per cent. There will be a reduction in the net dividend on the income shares from 9.2p to 8.37p and the redemption value of each share will fall from 40p to 0.1p. However, if the trust can achieve dividend growth of 5 per cent a year, the gross redemption yield on the shares will be 13 per cent. Shareholders must approve the proposals at an extraordinary meeting on May 26. The directors have received undertakings to vote in favour from 63.8 per cent of income and 36 per cent of capital holders; in aggregate, this represents 49.9 per cent of the total votes. The directors are required to convene an EGM to wind up the company at some point between January 1 1991 and December 31 1994. The trust is accordingly making an alternative cash offer, equivalent to the current redemption values of the two classes of capital; namely 40p per income and 10.75p per capital share. These compare with Friday's closing prices of 65p and 11.5p respectively.</p>

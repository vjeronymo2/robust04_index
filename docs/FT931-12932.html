			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading THE DERIVATIVES sector had one of its best days in the last few months with turnover rising sharply, after the cut in interest rates took dealers by surprise, writes Joel Kibazo. In stock index futures, traders had expected a run-of-the-mill session when the March contract on the FT-SE started trading at 2,785. Having retreated to 2,782 in early selling, March surged forward after the announcement of the reduction in rates. Within minutes of the news the contract was trading at 2,830, although a dealer pointed out that there was a lack of liquidity initially. However, turnover began to be generated when leading US houses moved in as big buyers, and most of the selling was done by independent traders. March ended at 2,860, up 88 from Monday's close and around 29 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 9. Turnover at 21,024 lots was 160 per cent above January's average total. Heavy trading was also seen on the traded options side, where the average daily volume for the last month jumped by 130 per cent to 53,586 contracts from Tuesday's total of 21,384 lots. The FT-SE 100 option had 20,820 lots traded. The rest of the sector was also busy. Asda was the most active stock option, with 3,638 contracts transacted as talk of a rights issue did the rounds. It was followed by Trafalgar House at 2,292, and GEC at 2,035.</p>

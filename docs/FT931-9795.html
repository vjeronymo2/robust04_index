			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Brooke Tool makes disposal BROOKE TOOL Engineering (Holdings) yesterday announced a further step in its programme of selling loss-making businesses with the disposal of Cardinal Broach to management for Pounds 2.35m cash. At the same time, the company reported a sharp increase in pre-tax losses, from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 3.14m, for the 12 months to September 30. Turnover was lower at Pounds 18.9m (Pounds 25.3m). Losses per share increased to 7.3p (3.3p) and the final dividend is omitted. Last year only a 0.25p interim was paid. Exceptional charges of Pounds 1.24m (Pounds 811,000) included a Pounds 503,000 loss attributable to Cardinal Broach, which makes broaching tools and machines. The 1991 figures included an extraordinary loss of Pounds 403,000 which has been restated as an exceptional item in line with new accounting standards. Mr Bernard Friend, chairman, said that the exceptionals covered measures to reduce the cost base and eliminate loss-making activities. They included redundancy payments and losses on disposals. A number of loss-makers were sold during the year, realising about Pounds 1.4m. Cardinal Broach represents the group's last connection with the design and manufacture of capital equipment. Mr John Dashper, chief executive, said the sale would allow the group to redirect resources into its remaining businesses in domestic and export markets - which are showing signs of improvement. It would also reduce group borrowings. Mr Friend said that poor trading and redundancy costs had kept borrowings at too high a level. Interest charges for the year took Pounds 811,000 (Pounds 968,000). The first quarter of the current year had not shown any significant change in trading, but there were more recent signs of improvement. Order books were stronger than at this time last year, particularly in continental Europe and North America.</p>

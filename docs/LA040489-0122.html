			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Due to incorrect information provided by the Los Angeles Unified School  District, a story in Monday's editions mistakenly reported that a May 30  walkout by teachers would come two weeks before the end of the school year. In  fact, the last day of class for most students is June 25. The last day for  teachers is June 26.  </P></p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (4): Party fights for Ataturk shares - Profile, Isbank Turkey's founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, must be turning in his grave as politicians and bureaucrats squabble over the shares in Turkiye Is Bankasi that were left in his will, writes John Murray Brown. Ataturk's holding in the country's largest commercial bank is today the subject of a rumbling legal battle between the Turkish treasury and his old party, the People's Republican Party, (CHP). Isbank has a unique place in the Turkish banking hierarchy. It was a pioneer in many of Turkey's key industries, a role which made it seem more like a Japanese or German bank than an institution from the Anglo-Saxon world. Isbank was a partner with Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch conglomerate, and had shares in the Cukurova power utility, which it sold at a handsome profit to the Uzan family. It is now selling many of these stakes to meet capital standards. Isbank's curious share structure means the bank is neither state-owned nor truly in the private sector. Its largest shareholder until recently was its pension fund, with close to 40 per cent of the stock. The Treasury owned 12 per cent, while around 29 per cent represented what was known as the Ataturk shares. But when Ataturk died, entailing his holding to the CHP, he can hardly have envisaged that all political parties would be outlawed in the wake of the military coup in 1980. The current dispute surfaced when the ban was lifted. It was decided to revive the CHP. However, at Isbank's annual general meeting, the board ruled that the CHP was entitled not to 29 per cent, but to just 2 per cent of the bank. The logic is that during the period of the ban, it was the presidential secretariat which had held the shares. Dividends were distributed to the Turkish Literature and History Society, another condition of Ataturk's will. However, the capital increases - a common practice in Turkey where inflation is close to 70 per cent - were met out of the treasury coffers. The CHP thus found its holding dramatically diluted. The party, not unnaturally, is now claiming title to its original stake in full, even if it means paying for the capital contributions. It argues that, while it was banned, it was not exactly in a position to participate in the capital increases. The CHP has some public support. And if there is some reservation over the general philosophy of privatisation, there is likely to be specific resistance to the idea of selling off Ataturk's shares in Isbank, as the government is planning. The twist in the tail is that the government now says it plans to sell the 12 per cent it does own while the court case with the CHP continues. This would allow the pension fund to buy the shares and become the majority owners of the bank. This may prove far more of a threat to the current management of the bank than any arcane legal argument about who owns the Ataturk shares.</p>

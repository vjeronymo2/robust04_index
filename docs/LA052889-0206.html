			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POLICE HOMELESS SWEEP  </P> <P> At the May meeting of the Orange County Homeless Initiatives Task Force, two  representatives of the homeless in Santa Ana told the members that, during a  recent sweep, Santa Ana police officers seized the medicine of a homeless  woman, suffering from epilepsy. One hour later the victim of this confiscation  suffered an epileptic seizure.  </P> <P> This allegation was heard by about 40 members of the task force, who represent  city and volunteer organizations throughout Orange County.  </P> <P> I think you will agree with us that this matter should be investigated by Santa  Ana immediately, and the results of the investigation should be published.  </P> <P> Besides blackening the name of Santa Ana before the whole of Orange County, the  cruelty and possible illegality of such sweeps should be apparent to even the  most hardhearted citizen of your city. We have been assured that these sweeps  are in violation of a court order in an existing lawsuit.  </P> <P> Surely Santa Ana does not consider this to be a reasonable answer to the  national crisis of homelessness.  </P> <P> SYLVIA EASTON  </P> <P> Chairwoman of Irvine Task Force  </P> <P> for the Homeless  </P></p>

			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Observer: Lingua banker Scisne Latine? While the answer is 'probably not' these days, surviving students of the Roman tongue will be glad to know that Glasgow University has decided to retain the use of Latin in official ceremonies. But to help those unblessed by a classical education, one of the staff has produced the following glossary of certain key phrases: Quod erat demonstrandum - The students were protesting. Ex gratia - Service-charge not included. Cogito ergo sum - I think you've added it up wrongly. Ad infinitum - Extra-long commercial. Et in arcadia ego - I lunched in the shopping mall. The staff member responsible, by the way, is not from Glasgow's classics department. He is John Espiner, of Barclays Bank, working on secondment in the university's planning office.</p>

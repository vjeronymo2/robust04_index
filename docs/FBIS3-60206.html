Delivering the inaugural address General Bilal said the  symposium is the outcome of positive cooperation between  anti-narcotics authorities in the kingdom and France.    He praised the efforts exerted by the Saudi Government to  provide security and stability for both citizens and residents.    He reviewed agreements signed by the kingdom in the field of  combating narcotics and stressed that Saudi Arabia has enacted  several extremely deterrent regulations to curb drug smuggling  or trafficking.    He said the kingdom has also gone a long way in  international  and regional cooperation to combat narcotics.    The acting director of the anti-narcotics department and  supervisor of the symposium Brigadier General Darwish Bin  Ibrahim Faqiha [spelling as received] said the symposium was  held in line with the directives of Interior Minister Prince  Nayif Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz who is extremely keen on fighting  narcotics in the Arab world in general and the kingdom in  particular.    He said the kingdom exerts intensive efforts to combat  narcotics on the basis of a number of concepts foremost among  which is the commitment to Islam and original Arab traditions.    He said the kingdom is among the least affected countries by  the narcotics problem because of the Saudi Government's keeness  on the security and safety of the citizens and the homeland.    He stressed that the kingdom has never had one incident of  growing, producing or making illegal drugs of any kind and that  the death penalty has been applied to deter drug traffickers,  smugglers and carriers.    He added that out of his conviction that drug addicts are  sick persons who need medical and psychological treatment,  Prince Nayif has ordered that addicts be treated as such and  three specialized hospitals have been established for this  purpose in Riyadh, Jeddah and Dammam.    He said the anti-narcotics department, in collaboration with  the national anti-narcotics committee chaired by the President  of Youth Welfare Prince Faysal Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, implements a  comprehensive strategy on preventive awareness against illegal  drug abuse.    The head of the French central anti-narcotics bureau  delivered a speech in which he pointed to the importance of  Saudi-French anti-narcotics cooperation and expressed hope that  this cooperation would continue.    Saudi and French officials and experts are participating in  the four-day symposium.    The inaugural session was attended by the French ambassador  to the kingdom and several Saudi officials.</p>

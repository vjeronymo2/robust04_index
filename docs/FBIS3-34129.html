Dr. Zakariya al-Agha stressed that the Palestinians are able  to manage the Gaza Strip's affairs less than 48 hours after the  Israeli forces withdraw from there.    Al-Agha pointed out that most Palestinian civil agencies,  especially the police, education, and health are now in place  and that specialized Palestinian cadres from within and abroad  will run these agencies upon the withdrawal of Israeli forces.    Al-Agha condemned remarks attributed to an Israeli military  commander and published in an Israeli newspaper to the effect  that the Israeli forces will not be able to withdraw before 13  April. Al-Agha said: Despite the fact that I am not a military  man, I believe that the Israeli forces can withdraw within one  month. They have now about two-and-a half-months until that  date and they can implement withdrawal during this period  without any obstacles.    Al-Agha expressed his displeasure over a possible delay in  the withdrawal date, because exceeding the date set for this  purpose will represent a grave and unsound indication by the  Israelis, who now have adequate time for withdrawing.    Al-Agha denied rumors on the existence of differences within  Fatah in the Gaza Strip. He said that Fatah is gaining strength  daily and is becoming more cohesive and resolute and that its  members are aware of their current historic responsibility.    Al-Agha expressed his complete pleasure at the democratic  dialogue conducted by the engineers from Fatah and Hamas  [Islamic Resistance Movement] which resulted in forming a joint  board of management, because this epitomizes the Palestinian  people's spirit of cooperation, democracy, and great  responsibility.    He added: This is a living example that it is possible to  form a Palestinian government from among the Palestinian forces  participating in the arena. He emphasized that the Palestinian  leadership calls on every Palestinian to join the coming  authority.    Al-Agha underscored the need to hold elections at their  scheduled date so that the people will choose their  representatives in a democratic and fair manner in the first  Palestinian national authority in the Palestinian people's  history.</p>

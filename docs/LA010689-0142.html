			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'WE HAD SEX; THAT'S NORMAL,' SAYS MAN OF 3 ALLEGED RAPES  </P> <P> A Fountain Valley businessman charged with raping three women and sexually  assaulting two others told jurors Thursday that most of these women found him  attractive and that he could not resist their interest in him.  </P> <P> Thomas Panichas, who faces 19 sexual assault counts, denied raping or  assaulting any of the women, but admitted having sexual contact with most of  them.  </P> <P> "We had sex; that's normal," Panichas testified.  </P> <P> Panichas was arrested a year ago after a Las Vegas woman alleged that he had  lured her to Orange County on the pretense of a job interview with his cellular  telephone company, and then raped her at her hotel room in Irvine.  </P> <P> She testified that when she tried to close her eyes during the assault,  Panichas forced her eyelids open.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Claims She Made Overtures  </P> <P> Panichas told a different story on the witness stand Thursday in Santa Ana  Superior Court. He said the woman, whom he had met only once before, made  overtures to him in the car even before they reached her hotel room. After  mutual-consent sex in the room, Panichas said, "she laid back on the pillows  exhausted, but with a happy look on her face."  </P> <P> Panichas also said that several of the women told him their personal problems  and that he became more friendly with them because he felt sorry for them.  </P> <P> But Deputy Dist. Atty. Marv Stern pointed out to Panichas that all five women  who testified against him had known him for only a few hours.  </P> <P> "What is there about you, Mr. Panichas, that makes these women want to pour out  their troubles to you?" Stern asked.  </P> <P> "I'm just a nice guy," Panichas answered.  </P> <P> Panichas, 32, who lives in Costa Mesa, said that in one case he did feel guilty  about having sex with one of the alleged victims, because he had been married  only about 4 months and was trying to make his marriage work.  </P> <P> But Stern pointed out that Panichas had sex with another one of the alleged  victims at a time when he was engaged. Panichas explained that when he walked  into his office, the woman -- whom he was interviewing for a job with his  company -- stood at a desk with her blouse off.  </P> <P> Didn't his engagement give him second thoughts about having sex with this  woman, the skeptical prosecutor asked?  </P> <P> </P> <P> No 'Second Thoughts'  </P> <P> "With what I saw in front of me -- her figure -- I didn't have second thoughts  at all," Panichas answered.  </P> <P> Four other women had reported attacks by Panichas, but he was never arrested.  Law enforcement officials say that in each case, there was a problem obtaining  necessary information, or cooperation, to bring Panichas to trial.  </P> <P> The alleged victims were all blonde and all in their early 20s.  </P> <P> Stern pointed out Thursday that Panichas had told several of these women that  he was a highly successful businessman. He showed two of them a portfolio that  had a 1988 projected gross income for his cellular telephone company of  $190,000. Yet law enforcement officials say Panichas' records showed that he  had sold only a handful of cellular telephones, and had written more than  $40,000 in bad checks to creditors.  </P> <P> Panichas explained Thursday that the bad checks were written only because of a  temporary cash-flow problem, and that a loan he expected from a benefactor  which would get his business back on track had been thwarted by his arrest.  </P> <P> Panichas, a tall man with wavy gray-black hair and wearing a wide-lapel suit,  purple tie and maroon handkerchief in his breast pocket, could face more than  40 years in prison if convicted on all counts. He remains in custody at the  Orange County Jail in lieu of $200,000 bail.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Complained to Judge  </P> <P> At one point during cross-examination Thursday, Panichas complained to Judge  David H. Brickner that Stern was not letting him tell his story and kept  cutting off his answers. Stern pressed him why someone heading a corporation  potentially worth $190,000 would sit for 4 hours at a gas station waiting for  the cashier to get off work just to interview her for a receptionist job. The  cashier is one of two women who claim Panichas sexually assaulted her.  </P> <P> One of the women who claims Panichas raped her was a friend of a woman whom  Panichas had just fired as a receptionist. Panichas admitted that he drove the  woman home after firing her. When Stern asked whether Panichas had done that  just to get a chance to see the friend, Panichas retorted: "That's the craziest  statement I have ever heard."  </P></p>

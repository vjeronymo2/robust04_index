			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Lottery may win overseas players The National Lottery, due to be launched next week, could gain international players next year. Mr Peter Davis, director-general of the Office of the National Lottery (Oflot) said yesterday he would consider allowing non-UK residents to take out a subscription to the game. When tickets go on sale next Monday players will be able to choose numbers for up to eight weeks ahead. At some stage participants will be able to take out a six-month subscription to the lottery so that the same number can be entered into the weekly Pounds 2m jackpot draw once the subscriber's cheque has been cleared. At the moment only those with a UK address and bank account will be accepted as subscribers. Mr Davis said he was prepared to extend the subscription rules as long as he could carry out his regulatory duty to look after the interests of all players. Camelot, the consortium operating the lottery, said yesterday it would be interested in the possibility of international sales after the launch period. The main possibilities are areas with British connections such as Hong Kong, Cyprus or South Africa. Oflot has had requests from potential players in a number of countries including Australia. Business in the European Union is unlikely. The European Court recently upheld the right of the UK to prosecute German citizens for selling German lottery tickets in Britain. The court held that lotteries were a matter for national jurisdiction. In the US considerable limits are placed on lottery sales. Tickets cannot be posted across state boundaries, although they can be sent by courier. National Lottery tickets will be available at Pounds 1 each.</p>

			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEW SPRAYING STARTS FOR ORIENTAL FRUIT  FLIES  </P> <P> Three Oriental fruit flies have been trapped in West Covina, the second finding  of the fruit-destroying pest in Los Angeles County within the last few weeks.  </P> <P> Agricultural officials this week began applying an insecticide to fences, trees  and utility poles in a 13-square-mile area bounded by Valley Boulevard on the  south, Citrus Avenue and Pierre Road on the east, Vine Avenue on the north and  Walnut Avenue on the west. The area includes portions of La Puente, Walnut and  West Covina.  </P> <P> The fly was successfully eradicated by the same measures last year after being  detected in four different parts of the county, said E. Leon Spaugy, Los  Angeles County's agricultural commissioner.  </P> <P> Additional traps have been placed with daily inspections to determine how  widespread the infestation might be. Two Oriental fruit flies also were found  June 22 and June 24 in Hawthorne and Lawndale.  </P></p>

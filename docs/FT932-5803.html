			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Business and the Environment: Business council still on course Where is the Business Council for Sustainable Development now? The Geneva-based club of the chief executives of 48 blue-chip multinational companies was formed three years ago to contribute a business viewpoint to last summer's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. This appeared in the form of a highly publicised book, Changing Course. But since then, little has been heard of the BCSD or of Stephan Schmidheiny, the Swiss businessman who was its prime mover. Was it just a flash in the pan? Apparently not. After Rio, the Council decided to embark on a second phase extending to 1995 to explore some of the policy issues raised by Changing Course, particularly in the financial field. According to Hugh Faulkner, the BCSD's Canadian executive director, the Council is setting up task forces to look at three issues: the internalisation of environmental costs, the role of the capital markets in promoting sustainable development and the situation in emerging markets. The BCSD hopes to come up with recommendations for action in these areas over the next year or two. The Council is also looking at ways to stimulate business involvement in third world countries. It wants to promote joint ventures in the supply of municipal services such as water and waste management and find ways round obstacles to investment in natural resource projects such as pulp and paper. Meanwhile, the composition of the Council has changed. Some members, such as Lodewijk van Wachem, senior managing director of Royal Dutch Shell, said they were only committed up to Rio and have dropped out. But others have joined, including Edzard Reuter, chairman of Daimler-Benz, Roy Vagelos, chairman of Merck, and James Wolfensohn, the Wall Street investment banker. Council membership is now 41, but Faulkner says interest is such that he expects it to rise to 60 before long. As for Changing Course, the book has sold 100,000 copies and has been translated into seven languages. It will be updated for 1995 to assess the progress made since Rio.</p>

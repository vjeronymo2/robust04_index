			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Markets: And then the weather turned gloomy, too - Wall Street AFTER a long and mostly rewarding ride, equity investors have unhitched their cart from the bond market bandwagon, at least for now. It was a wise move, because the road had become decidedly bumpy this week. All summer, stock prices have been following bonds higher on the simple premise that higher bond prices mean lower interest rates. Lower rates stimulate economic growth and spur investors to switch their money out of low-yielding short-term assets into other potentially more rewarding investments, like equities. On Tuesday, however, equity investors stopped paying attention to what bond prices were doing. On that day (the first trading day of the holiday-shortened week), bond prices soared, yet stocks dropped sharply. The same happened on Wednesday. Over the two days, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost more than 50 points, yet the benchmark 30-year bond climbed more than a point, pushing the yield down to a record low of 5.87 per cent. On Thursday, the bond market suddenly slammed on the brakes and shifted into reverse as rumours surfaced that Congress was considering re-imposing a withholding tax on foreign investors' holdings of US government securities. Although insiders on Capitol Hill in Washington later insisted it was highly unlikely that such a tax would ever be passed, the story was enough to send the 30-year bond plummeting by more than a point. The losses erased almost all of the week's gains and sent the yield back close to 6 per cent. The stock markets, however, ignored this apparent setback and share prices ended Thursday unchanged. The pattern was repeated yesterday when unexpectedly good news on inflation  -the producer prices index plunged 0.6 per cent in August - breathed new life into bonds, sending the 30-year up more than a point and the yield back down to 5.88 per cent. Stocks appeared unperturbed by the bond market's yo-yo-ing and by midday yesterday were trading marginally above Thursday's closing values. The temporary de-coupling of the stock and bond markets is a reflection of the fact that equity investors, already nervous about the extent and pace of the stock markets' recent gains, have been growing equally apprehensive about the extraordinary performance of Treasury securities. Of the two summer rallies, the bond market's arguably looks the more overdone. A small, but growing, band of Wall Street analysts seems to think so. It is warning that a substantial correction in fixed-income prices could be around the corner, especially if economic growth later this year picks up pace faster than anticipated. As one strategist put it this week: 'The drop in interest rates was telling us we're heading into a recession. But if you look at most economists' predictions, no one is looking for less than 2.5 per cent growth in GDP.' Seasonal factors may also have played a part in the stock markets' poor performance this week. It escaped nobody's notice that New York's weather - which had been hot, dry and bright all summer, right up to and including Monday's Labor Day holiday (which marks the official end of summer for all Americans) - turned cool and damp on Tuesday. Like the weather, stock market sentiment traditionally turns gloomy as autumn approaches. Investors have long memories and know that autumn - and October, particularly - can be the season of nasty surprises. Although this wariness may be steeped more in superstition than fact, there are some solid reasons for investors to tread carefully over the coming months. The political environment will liven up soon, with President Clinton facing tough battles on two important fronts: his plan for reforming the country's health-care system and the fight for the North American Free Trade Agreement. Both battles will be followed closely by financial markets. The third-quarter reporting season is also on the horizon, and investors are not sure what to expect. Second-quarter results were not bad - but nor were they that good. Although there have not been too many profits warnings from companies recently, there is a feeling that the string of disappointingly weak economic statistics released over the past few months could show up in lower-than-expected earnings. One area of the economy where Wall Street is confidently predicting a good third quarter is the commercial banking industry. After a strong run early in the year, bank stocks were overlooked by investors in the summer rally. This week, however, banks suddenly returned to favour as several analysts selected the sector for attention and predicted healthy third-quarter earnings.  --------------------------------- Monday        Closed Tuesday       3607.10  -  26.83 Wednesday     3588.93  -  18.17 Thursday      3589.49  +  00.56 Friday        3621.63  +  32.14  ---------------------------------</p>

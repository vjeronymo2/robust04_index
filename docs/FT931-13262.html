			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Ashdown calls for change to monarchy MR PADDY Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday joined prominent members of Labour's front bench in arguing for a fundamental overhaul of the workings of the monarchy. His remarks will stir fresh debate on the opposition benches at a time when the Labour leadership has been trying to play down the issue for fear of alienating royalist voters. A straw poll of 100 Labour MPs in The Sunday Telegraph yesterday showed almost a quarter want a republic, 32 per cent a monarchy along Dutch or Scandinavian lines and only 14 per cent back the royal family continuing unchanged. Meanwhile, Dr John Habgood, the archbishop of York, said the religious make-up of the country had changed so much that the Church of England must debate the privileged position it held with the monarchy. On the BBC Heart of the Matter programme he said he believed the coronation oath, in which the sovereign pledges to uphold the Church of England, would have to be revised when a new king or queen ascended the throne. Mr Ashdown said on the BBC's Breakfast With Frost programme he believed it unlikely that Britain would opt for a 'bicycling monarchy' as witnessed elsewhere in northern Europe. But Mr Ashdown added: 'We could strip away some of the pomp and circumstance of the monarchy, bring it closer to the reality of life in Britain. 'I hazard a guess that that's a view held, for instance, by Prince Charles and perhaps her majesty herself.' Arguing that Britain looked increasingly out of date and also advocating the case for the disestablishment of the Church of England, he added that the royal family could easily perform its constitutional role by functioning on a more modest scale. The Liberal Democrat leader's comments add to the difficulties of Mr John Smith, who has intentionally sought to avoid entering into the controversy over the royal family's future. The Labour leader had been planning to make a speech on constitutional reform early next month, but has now postponed it.</p>

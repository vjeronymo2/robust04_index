			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Domestic problems mar Clinton's return Images of war cemeteries, military bands and proud old veterans have surrounded President Bill Clinton for the last week, but they have done little to change the landscape that awaited him on his return from Europe to Washington. The problems of Haiti, North Korea and Bosnia festered still, while on the domestic front neither opinion polls nor election results offered the president much comfort. In a Gallup poll conducted for CNN and USA Today, only 49 per cent of those questioned found Mr Clinton honest and trustworthy, although 78 per cent thought him 'a nice guy.' Meanwhile, candidates from Mr Clinton's own Democratic party continued to distance themselves from him, and even the Democratic National Committee's political director acknowledged that 'there are clearly some areas of the country where it's not going to benefit a candidate to associate himself with Bill Clinton' - a remark swiftly repudiated by the White House. By general consensus, Mr Clinton struck just the right tone in his various D-Day commemoration speeches, successfully soothing the niggling feeling that his seat at these ceremonies would have been more appropriately filled by former President George Bush, himself a second world war veteran. However, his visit to Oxford, to the despair of some of his political advisers, then presented a target few American journalists could resist. 'The student who came here avoiding military service and protesting a war returned as president praising military service and avoiding the protesters,' quipped Mr Brit Hume, correspondent of the ABC television network. The net effect on Mr Clinton's position is probably neutral as he approaches three crucial weeks before the July 4 congressional recess. Next week, the president is expected to unveil his proposals for 'ending welfare as we know it,' a plan built around limiting benefits from the Aid to Families with Dependent Children programme, the cornerstone of the US social safety net, to two years. But the ambitious reform programme, despite considerable support from both parties in Congress, is probably stalled until next year, at the earliest, as it must take second place on the legislative agenda to health care reform Health care reform is making only slow progress, and Mr Clinton faces a decision on how soon to involve himself in the struggle. Until now, the White House has left the Congress to fight over the details, but the president's own weight will be needed to push reform through. The battle of health care has not been made any easier by the indictment of Congressman Dan Rostenkowski, formerly chairman of the ways and means committee, on charges of fraud and embezzlement. Mr Rostenkowski was due to be arraigned in court yesterday, and was expected to plead not guilty. Mr Clinton's own legal travails, meanwhile, have not gone away during his trip to Europe. In the next few weeks he will have to respond to the charges of sexual harassment filed against him by a former Arkansas state employee. Congressional hearings on his investment in the Whitewater property venture are also expected to begin next month, although the Republicans and the Democrats continue to wrangle about their scope.</p>

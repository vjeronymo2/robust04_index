			<p>BFN     [Text] After a meeting to discuss UN Secretary General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali's report, the political council of the Free  Democrats Movement issued a statement saying that the report  offers a unique opportunity to our side to bring negotiations  back to the substance of the Cyprus issue and to ask for  measures, if the Turkish side refuses to do so. The Free  Democrats say that for this reason, the only option for our side  is to accept the UN secretary general's third alternative, which  provides for the end of talks on the confidence-building  measures and a return to discussions on the basis of a set of  concepts and Butrus-Ghali's map.    The political council has learned that the UN secretary  general's report reveals the extent of the unacceptable  concessions made by our side. It adds, however, that one can  see a significant and positive point made in the report--the  lack of political will by the Turkish side for a solution to the  Cyprus issue.</p>

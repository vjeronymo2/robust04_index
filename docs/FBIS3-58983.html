According to Foreign Minister Kooijmans, it is unfair  that the EU negotiator is now being used as the scapegoat for  the international failure to achieve a peace settlement in the  former Yugoslavia.    Kooijmans affirmed on Friday [21 January] that the action  plan has failed. The member states must, therefore, ask  themselves whether or not to further pursue the present path.  The EU should not be considering whether or not to send Lord  Owen home, but rather a change in his mandate. As to the nature  of the change he envisages, he is not prepared to say at  present. The motion by the European Parliament, which demanded  Lord Owen's departure, was received poorly in The Hague on  Friday. At a press conference in The Hague, UN Secretary  General Butrus-Ghali praised the wonderful work by Owen and  Stoltenberg. He said he would continue to support them as their  work required patience, political will, and stamina.    The four largest groups in the Second Chamber see the  replacement of Owen as being of little value, as it does not  bring an end to the conflict any nearer. They agree with  Kooijmans that the real problem is not Owen, but the impotence  of the international community.</p>

			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Tory funds crisis forces Major to host dinners for donors The crisis in the Conservative party's finances has forced Mr John Major to drop a self-imposed ban on entertaining elite groups of past and potential donors at 10 Downing Street. After a warning from treasurers that the party has virtually no money to fight next year's European and local elections, Mr Major is hosting a series of dinners at Downing Street for wealthy corporate and individual contributors. Two dinners - with Lord Hanson heading the guest list at the first - have already been held. Several others are planned as Conservative Central Office attempts to persuade large companies and wealthy individuals to fund next spring's local and European election campaigns. The occasions have been kept a close secret because of acute sensitivity about the party's finances in the wake of the political row over donations from Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman. At the height of the row over Mr Nadir's contributions to the party, Mr Major said he had broken with Lady Thatcher's practice of holding regular fund-raising events at Number 10. A group of prominent Asian businessmen sympathetic to the party was invited to Downing Street before the last election. But the prime minister subsequently told the party's treasurers that he felt uncomfortable with Lady Thatcher's policy of entertaining leading supporters. It is understood he reversed that decision in September after a warning from two of the party treasurers - Mr Charles Hambro and Sir Philip Harris - that such events were vital to their drive to raise money to finance next year's election campaigns. The Conservatives' performance in the local and European polls will be crucial to Mr Major's long-term future. But despite an improvement in the party's day-to-day financial position, there are fears that it will be 'outspent' in the 1994 elections. Faced with a Pounds 15.3m overdraft, the party is reliant on large 'one-off' donations from wealthy benefactors to finance the election campaigns. It has already scaled back plans for poster and newspaper advertising. Mr Hambro and Sir Philip act as hosts for the Downing Street events, which are funded by the party in accordance with Whitehall rules. Both were unavailable for comment yesterday. Conservative Central Office said: 'We do not comment on donations and we do not comment on private meetings.' Lord Hanson, one of the Conservatives' biggest benefactors, confirmed that he had attended a dinner at Number 10 but declined to comment further. Senior officials said there was no direct discussion of contributions during the dinners which are billed as an opportunity for guests to put their views across directly to the prime minister. But guests will be contacted later by party treasurers as part of the fundraising drive. Most of the guests are senior executives drawn from the party's main corporate donors. The most prominent among those are United Biscuits, Taylor Woodrow, Glaxo, P&amp;O, Forte, Allied-Lyons and Rothman International.</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Few emerge unscathed from Astra fall-out - The findings of the DTI investigation into the failed munitions group THE BIGGEST revelation to emerge from the Department of Trade and Industry report into Astra Holdings, the collapsed munitions group, is that its existence as a publicly quoted company was based on a lie. A falsified invoice in 1986 allowed Astra to meet a profits forecast that in turn allowed it to reverse into the publicly quoted Sumner group. This gave Astra its foothold on the 1980s acquisition path that led to its fateful purchase of PRB, the Belgian munitions company and a footnote in history as a supplier to Iraq's 'supergun' project. The cast of characters caught up in Astra's rapid rise and fall were quick to clutch at this new information yesterday. If, as appeared, Astra directors were prepared to perpetrate a fraud from day one, normal City and accounting regulations would never have prevented them, one close observer said. But the fact remains that few of the cast emerged unscathed from the investigation. The Stock Exchange, auditor Stoy Hayward, Astra's financial adviser PaineWebber, Mr Gerald James, Astra chairman, Mr Christopher Gumbley, managing director, and other directors are all criticised. After three years of research, the report describes how Astra was transformed from a small southern England fireworks manufacturer into a multinational munitions company. It shows how the 'disastrous' 1989 acquisition of PRB - culminating in a complete write-off of the investment in March 1990 - may have been a necessary fig leaf to cover up Astra's underlying cash flow problems. And it reveals a string of sloppy accounting controls, rash management decisions and deliberately misleading statements from at least one Astra director, Mr John Anderson. Stoy Hayward, Astra's auditor, pointed out some of the risks of the PRB transaction. But the report criticises the exchange for allowing the circular concerning the Pounds 20.8m acquisition and the accompanying Pounds 36m rights issue to be issued without the normal 5.15 letter that confirms the health of a company's working capital. This should have been provided by PaineWebber. The report implies that Astra may not have been saved from collapse had it not made the PRB acquisition. But at least shareholders, who had financed most of the group's apparent growth, would have been saved from pitching the last Pounds 36m into the pot. Stoy Hayward in particular is criticised over Astra's cash flow situation ahead of the acquisition. The firm knew Astra would only have enough working capital if it effected its proposed asset sales by the summer of 1990. But, the DTI says, Stoy Hayward did not explore how realistic was the disposal programme. 'Stoy Hayward did not do so, but simply accepted that the proposed asset disposal programme could and would enable the group to raise sufficient cash by the summer of 1990.' Stoy Hayward said yesterday that it had been willing to discuss the working capital letter at if it had been asked to. Also criticised in the main section of the DTI report is PaineWebber, which acted as financial adviser to Astra and brought the PRB acquisition to Mr James. PaineWebber's initial draft of the chairman's statement to shareholders at the time of the PRB rights issue 'was manifestly inadequate. 'PaineWebber wholly failed to take any steps towards the production and signing of the paragraph 5.15 letter,' which concerned the working capital situation. The omission was 'inexcusable,' the DTI said. PaineWebber also should not have allowed Astra to say that the board 'advised by PaineWebber' considered the rights issue and the PRB acquisition to be in the interests of Astra and its shareholders. The DTI accepted that PaineWebber had not intended the use of its name to be misleading. The DTI is perhaps most revealing about Astra's arrival on the public scene. In 1985 Hichens Harrison, Astra's stockbroker, raised Pounds 611,000 through a share placing to expand the equity base and provide working capital for the expansion of 'military, marine and commercial pyrotechnics.' The placing and the subsequent reverse takeover of Sumner were based on Astra's profit forecast of Pounds 300,000 for the year ending March 1986. In fact Astra reported Pounds 340,024 of profit. But the DTI said Pounds 240,000 of that arose from a false invoice allegedly created by Mr James and Mr Anderson. The report said Mr Anderson and perhaps other individuals 'subsequently provided funds of their own . . . for the settlement of the invoice.' Mr Anderson, denied all knowledge of the false invoice. But the DTI said his evidence was 'throughout untruthful and that he was deliberately intending to mislead us.' The investigators said they were 'unable to make any finding as to whether Mr James was involved in the creation and/or subsequent settlement of the invoice.' He did however know about it, but was unprepared to tell the DTI. The DTI says of the auditors at the time that 'there is no evidence at all to suggest that Stoy Hayward either were, or should reasonably have been aware of the fact that the invoice was a false one.' Some of the DTI's most damning conclusions are reserved for accounting issues, comments that underline the laxity of some public company reporting. The inspectors said Astra's 1988 and 1989 published accounts gave little indication of the importance of acquisitions to profit growth. In fact Walters Group and Gilgore, acquired in 1988, contributed more than 100 per cent of Astra's recorded pre-tax profits. The next year the acquired British Manufacture and Research Company also made more than 100 per cent of group profit. 'Without the two acquisitions the Astra group would have reported losses for each of those two years,' the report said. The accounts gave no indication of this. The report adds that Stoy Hayward was also partly responsible for the fact that Astra's 1987 accounts did not show a true and fair view. And it says Stoy Hayward shared responsibility with Mr James and Mr James Miller (former finance director) for failing to disclose Astra's default under a multi-currency facility agreement during 1989. In a statement yesterday, Mr Adrian Martin, Stoy Hayward's managing partner, rejected these two DTI conclusions. The two points relating to 1987 and 1989 accounts 'were concerned with interpretational or judgmental conclusions drawn at the time.'</p>

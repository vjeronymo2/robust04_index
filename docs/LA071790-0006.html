			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHRISTIAN SCIENCE PARENTS  </P> <P> What a tragedy for the Twitchells, the Christian Scientist couple convicted of  relying too heavily on faith in God to relieve the afflictions of their son  ("Christian Scientists Convicted in Death," July 5 and "Parents Placed on  Probation in Son's Death," July 7). They lost their son and their faith is  severely challenged by that loss. Adding insult to considerable injury, they  are prosecuted for neglect.  </P> <P> What an ironic tragedy for a largely "Christian," self-proclaimed "scientific"  society that has forgotten the centrality of faith to its own survival. It is  not very Christian to throw stones at those who petition God for help. It is  not very scientific to discount the value of faith for the successful response  of the immune system to physical trauma and disease -- ask Norman Cousins of  the UCLA medical community.  </P> <P> I remember a society that used to print "In God We Trust" on every coin and  dollar. At one time, we probably meant it.  </P> <P> How do we contrast this motto with what we see in the courtrooms? Couples who  pray for spiritual intervention get thrown in jail, those who rely on fertility  drugs and medical guidance can successfully sue for millions when only three of  their septuplets survive.  </P> <P> Medicine is no exact science. For every breakthrough in our understanding of  the mechanics of life, there is created a vast gulf of unanswered questions --  it is as convoluted a system of beliefs as any religion.  </P> <P> Medicine needs faith in the unknown to work. Medicine without faith is as  ill-advised as a society without religious freedom.  </P> <P> Jetta Bernier of the Massachusetts Committee for Children and Youth sees this  prosecution as a victory for children stating, "No individual should have to  suffer and die because of the religious beliefs of another."  </P> <P> Beliefs are one thing, faith is another. Children's interests are not served by  society's hounding of individuals who trust too strongly in God. Society should  be convicted for neglect of its own motto.  </P> <P> C. SCOTT MILLER  </P> <P> Culver City  </P></p>

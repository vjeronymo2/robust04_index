			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGHLIGHTS OF SHEVARDNADZE STATEMENT  </P> <P> The following are excerpts from Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.  Shevardnadze's resignation speech Thursday:  </P> <P>  Yesterday there were speeches by certain comrades . . . who raised the issue  of adopting a special declaration forbidding the country's leadership and its  president from sending troops to the Persian Gulf zone. . . . These . . .  statements exhausted my patience. . . .  </P> <P> No fewer than 10 times I had to make statements, both inside and outside of the  country, clarifying the Soviet attitudes and policies in this conflict. It is a  serious, sensible, well-thought-out policy. . . . We have friendly relations  with the Iraqi state. . . . These relations remain in force, but we have no  moral right to put up with the aggression against and annexation of a small,  defenseless country. (To do so) we would have to renege on all that has been  done by all of us, by the entire country and people in establishing the  principles of new political thinking. . . .  </P> <P> I (have) repeatedly clarified that the Soviet leadership has no plans (to send  troops to the Persian Gulf). . . . But now they charge that the foreign  minister has such a plan, the plan for disembarking troops in the gulf zone. I  explained and stated there are no such plans; they are non-existent, quite  simply. And no one is going to send there even a single serviceman, a uniformed  representative of the U.S.S.R. armed forces. This was stated many times, but  again some people find it necessary to raise the issue. . . .  </P> <P> I said it and I now publicly confirm the fact that should the interests of  Soviet citizens suffer . . . no matter where it happens, be it Iraq or any  other country, the Soviet government . . . will protect its citizens and their  interests. . . .  </P> <P> I want to raise another issue. Is it accidental that two members of Parliament  made a statement that the minister of interior has been removed and now the  time has come to settle accounts with the foreign minister? . . . Are these  boys in colonel's epaulets really so brave that they feel they may make such  statements addressed to . . . members of the government? . . .  </P> <P> Allow me to say a few words about personal dignity. . . . Many think that . . .  members of the government, the president or anyone, have been hired, (that)  they are serfs and can be treated in whatever way. I think this is  impermissible. . . . Just read the press. . . . And what's most surprising. . .  , who stands behind these comrades, and what is all this? Why (is) no one  rejecting the charge (and saying) there are no plans? Perhaps there are such  plans, after all?  </P> <P> In this connection I recall the party congress. . . . During the congress we  witnessed a . . . pitched battle between the reformers and reactionaries. I  will not say now conservatives. I respect conservatives; they have their own  views, acceptable for the society. Precisely, reactionaries. And this battle  was won by the . . . progressive delegates of the congress, and they did so  with dignity.  </P> <P> I recall now how my name was put on the voting list without my consent and  without asking me. And in secret ballot I received 800 votes against me. . . .  Was this an accident or a trend? Was it the unacceptable policy pursued by the  foreign minister, or the personality of the minister, at issue? . . . I think  all this is not accidental.  </P> <P> . . . I recall now the Supreme Soviet session. . . . The serious issue of the  GDR (East German) treaties was put on the agenda. . . . By a coincidence, I was  away at the time. My deputies were summoned, and they found themselves in (an)  absolutely ridiculous situation. The whole thing just flopped.  </P> <P> And I had to take the floor during the next week. And what happened? The same  people, who are the authors of today's statements, made serious accusations  against the foreign minister, of unilateral concessions, incompetence,  illiteracy, etc. There was not a single speaker to object to the chairman of  the session, to say this was dishonest, that this was not the correct way of  doing it, that this was not how it is done in civilized states.  </P> <P> I feel very strongly about it. They sank to personal insults, but I absorbed  even that. Comrades, this is hounding. . . . Take, for instance, the Pamyat  publications. What expressions they use! Down with the Gorbachev clique! They  throw in my name and some others. Who are they, the so-called "reformers"? I  have been shaken, comrades, by the events of the first day of our Congress (the  Congress of People's Deputies, meeting this week). A mere push of the button  decided the fate of not only the president, but the very policy of perestroika  and democratization.  </P> <P> Is it normal? Let me say openly, comrade democrats -- and I use this word in  the broadest sense here -- you have fled. All reformers have taken to the  hills. A dictatorship is advancing. I am saying this with full responsibility.  No one knows what kind of dictatorship it will be, who will personify it, what  kind of dictator he will be and what kind of regime it will become.  </P> <P> . . . I am resigning.  </P> <P> . . . Let this be my contribution, my protest against the advance of  dictatorship. I express my deep gratitude to Mikhail S. Gorbachev. I am his  friend. I am his co-thinker. I have always supported him and will continue to  support the ideas of restructuring, renovation, democracy, democratization  until the end of my days.  </P> <P> We have done great things in the international arena, but I believe this is my  duty as a man and a citizen, as a Communist. I cannot put up with the events  which are happening in my country, and with the tribulations that lie in store  for my people. I still believe, I believe that dictatorship will be repulsed,  that the future belongs to democracy and freedom!  </P></p>

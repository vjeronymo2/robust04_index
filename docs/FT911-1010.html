			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Plan to stop English rivers drying up A PRIORITY programme to save some of England's most attractive rivers from drying up was launched yesterday by the National Rivers Authority, the water industry's environmental regulator, Richard Evans writes. Over-exploitation by industry, landowners and water companies, together with a succession of dry winters and hot summers, has led to unacceptably low flow levels in some of the country's best fishing rivers. The NRA said yesterday there were no 'quick fix' solutions, and the cost of reversing the decline might reach Pounds 20m. Among the 20 targeted rives are the Darent, Pang, Wey and Ver in the Thames region; the upper Waveney, the Hiz and Slea in East Anglia; the Wharfe in Yorkshire; and the Piddle in Wessex.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Pak Chong-hyon from Paris] </F>   [Text] As an International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]  inspection team's visit to Pyongyang has been delayed, the North  Korean Embassy in Vienna reported on 26 April: "If an IAEA  inspection team does not arrive in Pyongyang by 28 April, the  deadline for witnessing the replacement of fuel rods, we will  have no choice but to remove the seals and replace the fuel  rods." In this way, North Korea strongly hinted that it would  proceed with the replacement at all costs.    Yun Ho-chin, a counselor at the North Korean Embassy in  Vienna, said over the telephone: "We proposed that the  inspection team observe the fuel rod replacement, and the IAEA  presented eight preconditions." He also said: "These  conditions were presented to ask us to abide by the Nuclear  Safeguards Accord. Therefore, we cannot accept them."</p>

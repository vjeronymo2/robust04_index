			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Business: ex cathedra Our Polish Pope would really do very nicely as a contemporary European polit-ician. He is at the ext-reme centre of debate, uncompromisingly anti-communist but possessed of a clear aversion to purist economic liberalism. Social democrats and social market economists who lightly carry consciences no larger than those of the writers of party political advertisements may extract much of what they wish from John Paul II's latest encyclical, published yesterday. It is full of irresistible sound-bites. 'The free market is the most efficient instrument for utilising resources and effectively responding to needs,' he acknowledges, adding, a few strokes of the pen later, that 'there are many human needs which find no place on the market'. Most of us know both these propositions and almost everyone - I exclude the wackiest of our liberal economists - accepts them both. You could call these sentiments banal. Yet it is instructive that the Pope should endorse them, as he does in a hundred different ways, in his 30,000-word essay. For yesterday's encyclical, Centesimus Annus, has been published to mark the 100th anniversary of Rerum Novarum, Pope Leo XIII's celebrated attack on Marxism and revolutionary socialism. Mr Karol Wojtyla, as he would be known were he in secular politics, has seen his native land throw off a communist dictatorship 'by means of peaceful protest, using only the weapons of truth and justice'. He has no truck with Marxism; to label him a socialist in fancy vestments would be a travesty. Yet he is no Reaganite, no Thatcherite, no proponent of the market as an end in itself. The closest fit, unsurprisingly, would be with Europe's Christian Democratic parties, with a touch of the social democrat thrown in. When the German and Italian Christian democrats drew up their party programmes afresh after 1945 it was to Rerum Novarum that they turned for inspiration. They might move just a twitch leftwards if their programmes were based on Centesimus Annus today, but you would hardly notice the difference. British Tories could not stomach the Christian Democratic acknowledgement of trade unions as social partners. But then Britain is an ex-Catholic country. It does not understand the continental mentality. 'The Church acknowledges the legitimate role of profit as an indication that a business is functioning well,' states the Pope. 'But profitability is not the only indicator of a firm's condition. It is possible for the financial accounts to be in order and yet for the people - who make up the firm's most valuable asset - to be humiliated and their dignity offended.' You will see what I mean. This apparent muddle is no accident. The Pontiff is regarded by his followers as infallible on matters of doctrine and Christian principle The Pope criticises 'consumerism' - as he ought, starting from where he does but he does not claim infallibility when it comes to social and economic analysis. He is refreshingly modest about that aspect of his encyclical. It does not offer a specific political philosophy; it does warn against what he sees as present dangers. As I read him, the greatest of those is probably alienation - the gradual withering-away of faith and the consequent evolution of a wholly secular society devoid of religion and therefore of moral roots. This is happening at a chillingly rapid pace in the west although at least some of the young in newly-liberated eastern Europe are rediscovering the faith professed by their parents before the communists took over. The Pope is highly critical of western 'consumerism' and selfish economic behaviour, as he should be. His job, after all, is to affirm the dignity, the transcendental nature, of the human being (not just of 'man', Mr Wojtyla); hence his belief that 'the social message of the Gospel must not be considered a theory, but above all else a basis and a motivation for action'. This is where we get into such concepts, difficult for the British mind to take in, as 'solidarity', which is not merely the name of a Polish trade union, and 'subsidiarity', which you will be glad to hear is a story into which I do not wish to go this morning. Human beings are responsible for one another - hence 'solidarity' - which means that the wealthy countries of the west are morally bound to assist those in the Third World, not to mention those in the 'Fourth World,' the lowest echelons of capitalist society itself. It is all of a piece. The encyclical recognises that the capitalist method of organisation, will create the most wealth. It therefore embraces private property, enterprise, the rule of law, and the other necessary ingredients of a functioning free market. But it does not wish this powerful mechanism to be 'unbridled', any more than did Leo XIII. It therefore advocates using the wealth to uphold the dignity of the individual - although it is sniffy about the large welfare state, which spawns bureaucracies, and suspicious of state ownership of industries except for the briefest moment in emergencies. Its preferred methodology is private charity, the work of voluntary organisations, support of local communities, encouragement of the church. Some people might protest that this is a confusing mish-mash, that it does not set out in unequivocal terms what the individual should seek from her or his political leaders. Others might read all sorts of internecine Church nuances into it, or mock the Vatican's publicists, who are selling this encyclical as hard as they can. Not a Catholic myself, I prefer to take the Pope's words at face value. Religious intolerance can be murderous, as we know from contemporary events in the Middle East, but the absence of all religion, as envisaged by the late Mr John Lennon, is a terrifying prospect. It would return humanity to the jungle, armed to the teeth. We all need the Pope, and his encyclicals. If there were no such thing it would be necessary to invent him.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jamal Khashuqji: "Belhadj Attacks Zeroual and </F> Accuses Him of `Falsifying and Distorting Facts'"]    [Excerpts] London -- The Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] has  distributed the text of a letter sent by Cheikh Ali Belhadj from  his prison in Blida to President Liamine Zeroual accusing him of  breaking an agreement and of "distortion of facts,  falsification, and fabrication." He was replying to a statement  made by Zeroual over two months ago charging that FIS did not  honor its promise to stop the violence. [passage omitted]    An informed Algerian source has told AL-HAYAH that the  Algerian crisis "has reached a security and political climax,"  and that the number of people killed in the ranks of the  Islamists and government forces "has reached 100 daily, and the  poor channels of contact and dialogue which raised some hopes  over the past six months have been closed."    The same source spoke of a meeting held between a former  Algerian official, Islamist leaderships interested in Algerian  affairs, and the FIS leadership abroad. He said that the  meeting concluded that "the invisible [Algerian] leadership  which toppled President Bendjedid and revoked the elections won  by the FIS is the very same leadership which brought Zeroual to  power, and that the escalation of violence against FIS  supporters is done with the knowledge of that leadership and in  accordance with its plans." The Algerian official disclosed to  the FIS leadership "details of armed groups manipulated by  security organs headed by Major General Mohamed Lemari who is  continuing his work despite the recent changes in the Algerian  Army." The source downplayed the French role which he described  as "existent but not serious. Algeria is not Gabon and many  things take place without Paris' approval." He emphasized that  the all-out confrontation, the large-scale security operations,  the summary executions, and reprisals against families of the  mujahidin "all take place in accordance with a decision by the  real command within the Army." [passage omitted]    Sources close to the FIS say that it is currently trying to  unite its military ranks and intensify its political campaign.  At the beginning of the current month it announced the  formation of the Military Committee for the West [al-lajnah  al-'askariyah lilgharb] and described that move as a  "structuring of the FIS' military wing." This is the first time  FIS has admitted the existence of its military wing. "It seems  to be trying to block the way for the independent groups,  especially the armed Islamic groups trying to inherit FIS'  leading position in Algeria on the grounds that the FIS is a  political party and has no military activity."

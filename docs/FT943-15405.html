			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / UK Company News: CLT/Chiltern Radio Daily Mail and General Trust and European Media Associates together now hold 29.99 per cent of Chiltern Radio, the north of England and home counties broadcaster, as a result of EMA's purchase in the market of 97,176 shares. The board of Chiltern - which is the subject of an offer from Luxembourg-based CLT, one of Europe's largest private broadcasters - said it continued to believe that the terms of the CLT offer were fair and reasonable. However, the directors stressed that DMGT has stated it had no intention of accepting the CLT offer and press reports had indicated that Capital Radio - which owns 20 per cent of Chiltern - held the same view. It should also be noted, they said, that GWR Group - in which Capital and DMGT each had a 17 per cent interest - had acquired a 2.25 per cent holding in Chiltern. As a result, directors said they thought it unlikely that the CLT offer would be capable of being declared unconditional at its first closing date yesterday. CLT later said it had decided to extend its offer until 3pm on July 22.</p>

In accordance with the required procedures, Siemiatkowski's  candidacy should be presented to the prime minister by the chief  of the Defense Ministry [MON] Piotr Kolodziejczyk. Negotiations  concerning a "reflection of the coalition arrangement in MON's  civilian section" lasted several months, with some long breaks.  All signs are that Minister Kolodziejczyk, who seemed to be  unshaken in his conviction in the beginning and who was accused  by the chairman of the Sejm National Defense Commission, Jerzy  Szmajdzinski (SLD), of "speaking not with his own voice but with  the Belweder's" regarding the coalition minister, changed his  mind after all. It seems that Kolodziejczyk, who, until  recently, categorically opposed "attempts aimed at placing a  political commissioner in the ministry," has come to appreciate  (under the coalition's pressure because he recently met  Aleksander Kwasniewski, among others) the need to establish the  post of under secretary of state, who would relieve him of the  need to contact the parliament and would also be in charge of  the military justice system. Last week, Siemiatkowski also met  the MON chief.    We found out from circles close to the General Staff, which  is the main commanding organ of the Armed Forces of the Polish  Republic, that the Army's leadership cadre tends to take a  distanced position on the skills of the new deputy defense  minister, who so far has had little to do with the Army, except  for his membership in the Sejm National Defense Commission.  During a recent interview for our newspaper, General Tadeusz  Wilecki, who is the chief of the General Staff, emphasized his  disapproval of "attempts to adapt MON structures to specific  people."</p>

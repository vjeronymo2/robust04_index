			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Leading Article: Jubilee Line IT IS now more than a year since work was due to start on the Pounds 1.8bn extension of the Jubilee Line to London's Docklands. The delay has been caused by the government's insistence that the developers of Canary Wharf should contribute Pounds 100m towards the project before work begins. Ever since the collapse of Olympia &amp; York, the company that built Canary Wharf, the wrangling has continued over who should pick up the bill. Suddenly, however, the skies appear to have cleared. The Luxembourg-based European Investment Bank has announced that it is prepared to put up Pounds 98m towards the line's construction costs under its remit to stimulate economic growth in the European Community. A 15-year loan will be provided to whichever private sector body takes over Canary Wharf from the administrators. That body will hand over the money to the government, and then attempt to service its debt to the EIB out of profits from Canary Wharf. The structure of the deal suits the government since it will enable ministers to claim that the private sector will still be responsible for the required contribution. But the claim will ring hollow: the EIB, after all, is a non-profit making public sector institution wholly owned by EC member states. Implicit in the triple A borrowing status that the EIB enjoys when borrowing on the international capital markets is that it customarily lends to public sector projects underwritten by governments. While none of the parties will divulge who is guaranteeing the loan for the Jubilee Line, it is highly improbable that the EIB would have lent to a project as risky as Canary Wharf without the comfort of a government guarantee. The question then is why the government did not save everyone a lot of bother and a year's delay by putting up the money in the first place.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The deputy task force commander in charge of  administration, Group Captain George Ayitey, has said the war  situation in the conflict areas of the Northern Region is over  and warned that anybody found taking the law into his or her own  hands will be prosecuted. He said the task force is going  strictly according to the terms of the state of emergency and  that any person who takes up arms against his or her neighbor  will be charged with murder. Group Capt. Ayitey was addressing  a delegation of the Anglican Church in Tamale who donated food  and other items valued at 13.1 million cedis to the task force  to assist in resettling the displaced persons.

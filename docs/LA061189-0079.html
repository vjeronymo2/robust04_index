			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STEVEN DIETZ: A PLAYWRIGHT, SINK OR SWIM;  </P> <P> HIS 'TEN NOVEMBER' CENTERS ON 1975 SHIP DISAPPEARANCE  </P> <P> Steven Dietz is rarely without an opinion. He's also rarely without some  project in hand -- usually writing a play or directing one, very often his own.  </P> <P> Despite about 20 theater pieces to his name, that name still rings few bells  outside theatrical circles. The blond and boyish 31-year-old, who looks as if  he's spent the last 10 years racking up innings on some college baseball team,  has instead spent them forging and staging scripts on the less visible resident  theater circuit. Sports activity has been confined to friendly softball games  with fellow playwrights.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, Dietz also may be remembered as the author of "Foolin' Around  With Infinity," favorably received at the Los Angeles Theatre Center in 1987.  On Friday, he returns as author and director of "Ten November," a piece  inspired by the mysterious sinking of an ore carrier, the Edmund Fitzgerald, on  Lake Superior in 1975.  </P> <P> His partner in the venture is Eric Peltoniemi, a Finnish songwriter for the  theater in the Twin Cities who contributed music and lyrics for several songs  that form the play's key lyrical backdrop. The LATC production will be the  first one mounted outside the Great Lakes region.  </P> <P> Dietz and Peltoniemi were introduced to each other and commissioned to come up  with a piece by the Actors Theatre of St. Paul.  </P> <P> Though the two were happy to work together, they had a devil of a time coming  up with a project. On the day they needed to deliver an idea for one, Dietz  heard Gordon Lightfoot's song about the Edmund Fitzgerald.  </P> <P> "I noted it at the bottom of my legal pad," he said in a recent conversation at  The Times. "So after we'd talked through all the other possibilities I said,  'Well, something that seems completely impossible to me, and therefore,  naturally appealing, is to do something about the sinking of the Edmund  Fitzgerald.' Eric's eyes lit up and I knew we had something.  </P> <P> "It turned out that Eric's from Minnesota's North Shore. I, of course, knew  nothing. I mean, I'm a landlocked Colorado boy. But it seemed completely  impossible to try and convey (the idea of) a boat larger than most of downtown  disappearing in a lake that has 6,000 ships at the bottom of it. So I started  researching it like mad."  </P> <P> The story of the Fitzgerald is made eerie by the fact that while the boat's  wreckage was found, they never recovered any of the 29 men who made up its  crew.  </P> <P> "In the history of Lake Superior, no body has ever washed up on its shores,"  Dietz explained. "They didn't come up with the technology to go to the bottom  of it until 15 years after they had the technology to go to the moon. I was  seduced by this at once. My nautical voyeurism took over."  </P> <P> When Dietz had first heard the Lightfoot song, he thought it referred to some  ancient maritime disaster. "To realize that it happened the week after Squeaky  Fromme shot at Gerald Ford and when the Pet Rocks were out, placed it in an  amazing context.  </P> <P> "It's also the most recent tragedy on the Great Lakes. The last 15 minutes of  the voyage itself, because the ship had lost radio contact, are of necessity  fiction. We made the decision not to try and impersonate any of these 29 men,  because we know them only as a group, and they disappeared -- were taken -- as  a group."  </P> <P> "Ten November" has nine male actors, three female singers and a couple of  musicians. As the piece developed, the women became increasingly important.  </P> <P> "The play turned out to be more our response to their loss, in terms of the  music and the singers who function as a sort of environment -- people who not  only convey the story, but go off on other tangents, regarding loss in general,  the myth of invincibility."  </P> <P> And there was another resonance: "The Challenger tragedy happened while we were  writing this. It was a lightning rod."  </P> <P> The Denver-born Dietz lays no claim to an early education in theater,  describing himself as "a railroader's kid" whose dad was a conductor and  brakeman on the old Colorado and Southern Railroad.  </P> <P> "We had the Bible, the World Book Encyclopedia and a Perry Como record. I saw  my first theater in high school and didn't have any inkling how to attempt it  until I went to college (the University of Northern Colorado in Greeley)."  </P> <P> What drew him to the theater?  </P> <P> "Obsessive curiosity. I liked writing -- bad poetry, song lyrics, stuff like  that. But primarily I was fascinated by people and situations. Piano tuners,  restaurant critics, chimney sweeps, weather men. I have no interest in writing  a play in which the architect comes home and makes a martini for his wife."  </P> <P> The morning after graduation, Dietz took off driving randomly around the  country vaguely thinking he would like to direct plays. He stopped in  Louisville, Washington, New York -- and Minneapolis.  </P> <P> "I had a friend there," he explained. It was March and when the fan belt on his  car broke in the middle of a snowstorm, Dietz walked up to an old church to use  the telephone.  </P> <P> "I thought it was a church," he said. "This huge man came up to me when I was  on the phone and handed me some literature. It was Tom Dunn (of New  Dramatists).  </P> <P> "He said, 'We work on new plays here, we have actors and directors, these are  our writers.' I drove back to Denver, got my stuff and moved up there."  </P> <P> That was nine years ago. Dietz is now the artistic director of the Midwest  Playwrights Lab, for which the Playwrights' Center is an umbrella organization.  </P> <P> "It's been a wonderful breeding ground for me and others. It's also my  touchdown, the place to return to. I'm still in the honeymoon phase with this  business. There's so much I want to do and it gets worse on planes. That's when  all the lists start coming out of me, the plays I have to write.  </P> <P> "I got on the map directing new plays, and I was lucky enough to link up with  writers like John Olive (Dietz directed the premiere of Olive's "The Voice of  the Prairie"), Kevin Kling and John Klein. I feel a huge responsibility to this  strange alchemy (known as) making plays in this culture, because it has  nurtured and enabled me to do my own work."  </P> <P> But what Dietz began to note in the dramaturg-playwright relationship after a  while was that "for the sake of fairness, passion was being lost. For the sake  of logic, which has never been the theater's strong suit, amazing voices were  being rendered quiet or normal or mediocre."  </P> <P> He became a proselytizer for fairer practices.  </P> <P> "It's important to respect the notion of mentors, to make stabs at stealing the  magic of writers you admire early on," he extrapolated. "If you're in  Minnesota, you write your August Wilson play, your Lee Blessing play, and you  don't do it as well as they do. It's part of your apprenticeship.  </P> <P> "Lee Blessing plays first base on our softball team. August Wilson used to play  third base. Now he's never around. I love to tell the story about how, when  August won the Pulitzer and Lee was the runner-up, everybody wanted to be in  the infield. It had to be the place to be -- right?  </P> <P> "Finding writers that you admire is an important stage. Beyond that, it's  important to make yourself the primary mover and shaker of your own work. You  have to fit into certain niches -- deal with finances, with new play programs  -- but, ultimately, they don't have to live with what arrives on the page and  you do. You have to wake up happy with it the next morning. You have to learn  to fight for it."  </P> <P> One way to do that, Dietz says, is to direct your own plays.  </P> <P> "A lot of playwrights can't, certainly," he acknowledged, "but if doing that  will enable them to carry out what's in their heart, it's something they have  to try. The medieval notion that playwrights should not direct their own work  has to, if not be abolished, at least be questioned. I was lucky. I had a  resume and a background and I had already directed for most of the theaters  that I had to talk into letting me stage my own plays."  </P> <P> The other alternative, he says, is to work with compatible directors.  </P> <P> "My buddy David Goldstein directed the premiere of 'God's Country' in Seattle  and it's sort of the same thing with Richard E.T. White (who staged the  premiere of "Ten November" at Chicago's Wisdom Bridge). They were directors who  knew another director was in the room. I didn't step on their toes, but they  respected my input."  </P> <P> Dietz insists that he never directs any of his own pieces early in the process  without an aggressive dramaturg or assistant director, "someone who's hard on  me. I want buddies who understand my goals but will hold my feet to the fire.  </P> <P> "The writers who seem to have been successful are the ones who attempted to do  a lot. Everyone else is trying to make it smaller -- and I don't mean cast  size. I mean ideas. The issue gets blurry when it comes to specific agendas.  All my three- and four-character plays went nowhere. Some of them had up to 15  staged readings. I began to think of them as the plays that could never be  memorized. Perennial finalists.  </P> <P> "Then I started writing 10- and 12-character plays with music and strange  monologues and facts and -- go figure. Those are the plays I've been making my  living on. I think that at some point I started going beyond my mentors and  tried reinventing the theater. I'm not saying any of us are succeeding, but I'm  drawn to those (of us) who are attempting it. That's our job."  </P> <P> Among those mentors Dietz lists John Guare, Samuel Beckett and "the boys,  Shepard and Mamet, probably just for the energy of it. As for my frustrated  journalistic impulses, certainly that mentor is Emily Mann. She was very  supportive when I worked with her in the Twin Cities. And then I have the  writers whose work I direct who teach me enormously: Kevin Kling, Jaime Meyer,  John Klein."  </P> <P> At 31, Dietz has five plays "on the circuit" ("More Fun Than Bowling," "Foolin'  Around With Infinity," "Ten November," "God's Country," and "Painting It Red").  All five are about to be published by Samuel French. "That cracks me up," Dietz  says with a grin. "It saves a lot of copying."  </P> <P> When not rehearsing "Ten November," he's working on a new piece with Peltoniemi  called "Happenstance," which opens at Seattle's A Contemporary Theatre this  summer. And the Denver Center Theatre Company has an eye on "God's Country,"  fittingly a play about the murder of Denver radio announcer Alan Berg by white  supremacists.  </P> <P> But Minneapolis is home base. "The key thing there is the work," he said, "not  the hype of the work. It's a springboard in the sense that some of us have had  our plays done locally and seen them go on to national theaters, but the  springboard is (contained) within the realm of improving the theatrical art  form. It's not about dabbling.  </P> <P> "We have an organization in the Playwrights Center that exists solely to allow  writers to work at their craft. A producing theater can seldom afford the  luxury to do that on such an ongoing basis. I can finish 'God's Country,' on a  Wednesday night, make a call and say I need 10 Equity actors Saturday to read  it and boom -- they're there. I hear it a couple days after it's written with  some of the best actors in the Twin Cities.  </P> <P> "Sure, at times we might wish for greater visibility," he conceded. "We wrestle  with that. But there is also the sense that, when you work in theater in the  Twin Cities you're in it for the long haul."  </P> <P> Does film attract him?  </P> <P> "I've been offered some things, which I've sort of turned down. I'm still madly  in love with the theater and right now it would be foolish of me to not pursue  it. Film, to me, is like New York productions. If you shoot for it, it's  unbelievably elusive. You can only do your work.  </P> <P> "And if that sort of gravy gets dumped on your plate later on -- well, that's  all right too."  </P></p>

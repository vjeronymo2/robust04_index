The NATO  member-states allocate 40 percent [as received] of their  military spending for armament, while the funds allocated to the  Bulgarian Army will be just enough for the payment of salaries,  subsistence and some supply services, he pointed out. If that  amount passes the vote, parliament must take political  responsibility for the liquidation of the Bulgarian Army, Mr.  Rusan Georgiev, chairman of the Independent Trade Unions in the  Army, told yesterday's news conference. In Maj. Gen. Maznev's  view, the trade unions should also assist the efforts for the  allocation of a larger amount to the Army.    Army units commanders are to propose measures for making  their activities more efficient and for optimizing their  structures. A commission is set up to help solve the problems  of Defence Ministry financing. It is chaired by Mr. Vladimir  Penchev, deputy minister of defence in charge of financial and  foreign exchange affairs. The commission is expected to submit  its estimates for the Army's draft budget and for the most  efficient utilization of all internal reserves by March 15,  Captain Tsvyatko Donchev, head of the Defence Ministry Press  Centre, said at today's news briefing.    No losses will be reported by the military repair works for  the 1993 fiscal year, the output sold is 3.7 percent up from  1992 at comparable prices, Gen. Maznev said. Local customers  owe the military repair works some 192 million leva (about $5.2  million) and foreign customers in Russia, Iraq and Libya are  indebted to them for another $15.5 millions. According to  General Maznev, the Defence Ministry's allocation for equipment  repair will not be enough to put into operation all damaged  aircraft, armoured machines and automobiles, nor will it be  enough to secure orders for the works.    The military plants do not rely only on the Defence  Ministry's orders, Major General Dragomir Ivanov, defence  industry chief at the Defence Ministry, specified at the news  briefing. At present, civilian products accounts for 23 percent  of the defence industry total output, it is planned to increase  their share to 32 percent in 1994. The share of military  products will be 54.3 percent, Maj. Gen. Ivanov said. A  contract has been already signed with a foreign customer,  another two contracts are awaiting signing. Gen. Ivanov  believes that despite the meager funds which the Defence  Ministry allocates to the military industry in its draft budget,  external orders will help the military industry enterprises cope  with the situation for the time being. A variety of civilian  products made by the military plants are already exported to  Italy and Germany, it is worked jointly with the Kirov Works at  St. Petersburg and the U.S. Curtis, Gen. Ivanov said.</p>

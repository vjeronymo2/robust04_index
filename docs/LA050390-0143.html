			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LEARNING THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY;  </P> <P> CLASSES: THOUSANDS OF YOUNGSTERS SPEND HALF-DAYS ON SATURDAYS LEARNING THE  CUSTOMS IN COUNTRIES THAT THEIR FAMILIES HAVE LEFT BEHIND.  </P> <P> Ten-year-old Albert Kuo would rather spend Saturday mornings watching cartoons  or flying his kite with friends from Serrania Avenue Elementary School in  Woodland Hills. Instead, he is drawing Chinese characters, speaking Mandarin  and perfecting a mean game of Ping-Pong at the Chinese School held at James  Monroe High School in Sepulveda, where he is known as Kuo Chun-Yu.  </P> <P> He is one of thousands of youngsters in the San Fernando Valley who take part  in half-day Saturday classes that teach the customs in countries that their  families have left behind.  </P> <P> On any given Saturday, students might be preparing for the Chinese dragon boat  festival, celebrating the Korean New Year of Sulnal, making meals for a Jewish  Seder or folding paper for Japanese origami. These nonprofit classes meet on  public school campuses and focus on language, history, dance and the art of  ethnic communities.  </P> <P> Programs are as diverse as the Valley populace. Social clubs and ethnic  churches offer information about classes for children who are African,  Armenian, Dutch, Filipino, French, Greek, Hebrew, Iranian, Irish, Nicaraguan,  Palestinian, Russian, Salvadoran, Thai, Vietnamese and many others. Classes  cost $5 to $10 each day.  </P> <P> "This keeps some kind of cultural identity so our heritage is not lost," said  Sue W. Fan, principal for the 240 children who attend the Chinese School  sponsored by the San Fernando Valley Chinese Cultural Assn. in Northridge. "It  gives a better self-image to know their origin."  </P> <P> Young children often rebel against a sixth day of school, which requires a good  share of homework. Even Fan's two children complain about Chinese School. She  reminds them that in China or Taiwan they would be required to go to a sixth  day of school.  </P> <P> "It makes my mom happy, but I'd like to be out with my friends playing video  games," said Fan's son, Kevin, 9.  </P> <P> So teachers try to make the cultural classes fun with crafts, contests,  performances and sports. Some students get credit for high school language  classes by coming to Saturday schools.  </P> <P> "I used to think 'what a dud' when I first came here, but now it's typically  weird because I want to learn more," said Luice Hwang, 16, who grew up as a  Valley girl but who, unlike most of her classmates at Van Nuys High School, can  speak and write Chinese. "I know one of the most difficult languages in the  world. I can't wait to go to Taiwan someday."  </P> <P> The classes also help Hwang understand her parents' strict moral upbringing.  "Like when they give me a curfew or say that I can't have a boyfriend until I'm  78," she joked.  </P> <P> "This makes good communication with parents because so many times parents don't  speak so good English," said In-Sook Cho, principal of the Korean Institute of  Southern California, which has 160 students at Parkman Junior High School each  Saturday in Woodland Hills. "We have two handicaps with our children --  different generation and different culture -- and these classes help make an  understanding from both sides."  </P> <P> Cho's school offers specialties such as tae kwon do, abacus and Korean  traditional dance. Girls in the dance classes wear long dresses -- called  han-bok -- in pink, yellow, green and blue silk with gold lace.  </P> <P> After practicing the fan dance with two pink feathered fans and the silk dress  her grandmother made in Korea, Jeannie Kim, 11, explained how the dance uses  traditional Korean steps.  </P> <P> "The music doesn't have much of a beat," Kim said about the steady droning of  Korean music. "I'd much rather be listening to Bobby Brown, the New Kids on the  Block or Milli Vanilli."  </P> <P> Teachers' salaries barely cover gas money at the Korean School, Cho said, but  the educators command respect that teachers in public schools might not get.  </P> <P> "Respect and good attitude make a good student," said Cho, who added that  students in Korea are told not to step on a teacher's shadow.  </P> <P> Parkman Junior High School Principal Andrew Anderson welcomes schools such as  the Korean Institute to his campus. His school enrollment is only 14% Asian,  but he knows that many academic awards at the end of the year will go to that  community because of its intense ethnic training.  </P> <P> "They have no more ability than any other student, they just enjoy learning,"  Anderson said. "Sometimes they grumble about spending four hours Saturday  morning in school, but it is good to preserve traditions. And, it is good for  the whole community because we all learn from them."  </P> <P> Students rarely learn about their culture in school, said Principal Gabriel  Injejikian, whose Ferrahian High School in Encino is one of five Armenian  schools between Canoga Park and Glendale that offer after-school language  classes. "Armenian is just not taught very much in public school," he said.  </P> <P> Learning a different language -- even if read backward or up and down -- helps  children learn more languages if they want to do so, said Nili Ziv of Valley  Beth Shalom, a Hebrew school in Encino.  </P> <P> "These are Americans who want to transmit to their children their history and  it makes the children more open and tolerant of other cultures," Ziv said.  </P> <P> The San Fernando Valley Japanese Language Institute in Pacoima, probably the  Valley's oldest part-time ethnic school, has been operating 65 years. Most of  the 120 children who attend the classes at the Japanese American Community  Center have parents who were born in Japan, institute President Nobuko  Jonokuchi said.  </P> <P> "We teach reigi, polite discipline, and try to encourage students to  concentrate on math and science," Jonokuchi said. "Children who know Japanese  can ask their parents for help in their public school homework, too."  </P> <P> The Saturday schools offer immediate practical applications, such as a recent  computer class demonstrating software using Chinese characters, Chinese  Cultural Assn. President Steve Yang said. His school also teaches kung fu and  flute, and reminds families of traditions such as dabbing rice wine to the  forehead of children to ward off bad luck and eating a tamale-like dish with  rice wrapped in bamboo leaves.  </P> <P> But most of the time, the classes have simpler applications.  </P> <P> "These schools are nice because now my children can write to their  grandparents," Yang said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> 65 FIRMS ASK TO USE BANNED CHEMICALS  </P> <P> After receiving requests from about 65 companies for temporary exemptions from  the city's ban on most uses of an ozone-depleting chemical, the Irvine City  Council will consider turning the exemption process over to the city manager.  </P> <P> All requests for exemptions to the ban on chlorofluorocarbons now must be  approved by the City Council.  </P> <P> The city's law on chlorofluorocarbons and other ozone-depleting substances went  into effect July 1. The council has voted twice, including this week, to grant  55 temporary exemptions to companies that use small amounts of the chemicals,  military contractors, firms with no feasible alternatives and companies using  the chemicals for health-related products.  </P> <P> "It's certainly been less controversial than expected, and City Council  approval so far has been routine," said Michael S. Brown, Irvine's  environmental program administrator.  </P> <P> At the council's July 24 meeting, Brown will recommend the exemption process be  run administratively by the city manager to avoid bogging down the City Council  with routine paper work.  </P> <P> If approved, the change would require that requests for exemptions be  advertised so the public can have a chance to comment on them before a decision  is made, Brown said. The council also will retain the right to take back its  approval authority at any time.  </P> <P> Under the ban, companies can apply for exemptions lasting one or more years.  But firms must show that they are looking for alternatives or are in the  process of phasing out the chemicals, Brown said. TOM McQUEENEY  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> NEW PILOT LICENSE RULES GO INTO EFFECT  </P> <P> New regulations designed to make it easier and less expensive to learn to fly  went into effect over the objections of federal air safety regulators and the  Air Line Pilots Assn. The new rules permit the issuance of a so-called  recreational pilot's license after only 30 hours of flight instruction,  compared to the 40 required for a regular license. A recreational license will  permit pilots to fly only within 50 miles of the airport where they learned to  fly. They may fly only in the daytime and in clear weather and may not use  airports with traffic control towers. John Lauber, a member of the National  Transportation Safety Board, said the board has long opposed the new license.  "I do wonder how they can adequately enforce the many restrictions that have  been put on," Lauber said.  </P></p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Letter: Reforms to boost confidence in audit should be acknowledged Sir, John Roques, in his article 'Two sides of a single coin should draw together' (December 3), makes one good point and a number of poor ones. He is absolutely right to point out that corporate failure does not equate with audit failure. However, I find it particularly worrying that Mr Roques is unwilling to acknowledge recent far-reaching reforms in the profession, intended to boost confidence in the audit and in the regulatory process. Mr Roques could have mentioned the institute's recent strengthening of ethical guidance for auditors, moves to greater openness, and the overhauling of the disciplinary processes. In a true and fair view he would have acknowledged that, with the new audit regulation system introduced by parliament only just over a year old, it is far too early to reach any sensible judgment on its effectiveness, let alone its organisational location. More surprising, in the current debate on auditing, Mr Roques failed to mention the Auditing Practices Board's consultative paper, 'The Future Development of Auditing', which addresses many of the most contentious issues of the day. The APB may be funded by the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies, but it is now an independently minded and forward-thinking body, with a number of non-accountant members. The latest APB paper is intended to promote public debate and this institute will be taking a major role in considering and commenting on the very important matters raised by the APB on very difficult issues. I am not persuaded that the APB, which was only established last year and is already doing good work, would be more effective if its reporting line were changed merely in some pursuit of improved liaison. In short, many of the 'problems' in the existing set-up that Mr Roques calls on as evidence to support his argument have already been resolved or are not, in fact, problems at all.

			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Serbs halt UN relief convoys UN OFFICIALS said relief convoys headed for two besieged Bosnian Moslem towns were held up at the last moment yesterday by Serb authorities in Banja Luka, contrary to earlier UN reports, Reuter reports from Sarajevo. Mr Ray Wilkinson, a spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), had said earlier the convoy had left the north Bosnian town of Banja Luka, but he said Serb authorities halted the convoy despite giving verbal permission previously. 'We didn't get final approval,' Mr Wilkinson said. 'We got every signature except one.' He said the convoy would stay in the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Banja Luka for the night, and was hoping to try again today. The two convoys were carrying 250 tonnes of aid for the Moslem towns of Maglaj and Tesanj, which have been cut off from food deliveries by road since June. The UN estimates nearly 150,000 people are trapped in the Maglaj pocket in northern Bosnia, where Serb and Croat forces have encircled Moslem troops. The convoy left Zagreb for the Maglaj area after lengthy negotiations between UNHCR officials and Serb authorities. This would be the first UN aid convoy into the Maglaj pocket since June 1. The last UN convoy into the area was shelled outside Maglaj and three relief workers were killed. The Maglaj region, where hundreds of people were reported to have been killed in repeated bombardments during the five-month joint Serb-Croat siege, was shelled again on Saturday, according to Sarajevo radio.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chang Weimin: "Saudis Hope To Develop Oil Jointly"] </F>   [Text] Proposals by the visiting Saudi Arabian oil  minister are expected to turn into co-operative projects.    Hisham Nazir, Saudi Arabia's Minister of Petroleum and  Mineral Resources, suggested joint development of China's oil.    Nazir, on his first trip to China, discussed petroleum  exploration, development and processing with high-ranking  Chinese officials.    According to the China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), which  arranged the visit, Nazir made the proposals to President Jiang  Zemin, CNPC president Wang Tao and Sheng Huaren, president of  the China Petrochemical Corp.    An oil delegation from Saudi Arabia is expected to visit  China later to explore further possibilities.    The delegates are expected to visit petroleum processing  projects in Lianyungang in Jiangsu Province and Dagang in  Tianjin, at which time specific details will be discussed, a  CNPC official said.    Nazir said Saudi Arabia hopes to set up refineries in China  to help meet China's domestic needs.    With the refineries, Saudi Arabia would ensure China a  stable, long-term supply of crude oil, he said.    Saudi Arabia expects to set up the same type of  joint-venture  refineries it has in the United States, South Korea and the  Philippines, Nazir said.    Economic and trade ties between the two nations can be  developed, since their economies are complementary, he said,  adding that Saudi Arabia wants to tap the China market.    Saudi Arabia, a leading oil producer, would also be able to  help supply the crude needed for China's development, Nazir said.    He said he hopes Jiang Zemin will support his proposals and  help forge agreements as soon as possible.    Jiang said China will carefully consider the Saudi oil  minister's proposals and support any deals that promote  bilateral co-operation.    China has considerable undeveloped oil reserves. Despite its  large output, domestic supply cannot meet the country's soaring  demand.    China produced 142 million tons of crude oil last year. It  also imported, officially, 15 million tons of crude oil and 20  million tons of oil products, although sources say the figures  are probably low.    Experts say that imports will probably increase since the  country is planning for 9 per cent economic growth over the next  seven years.</p>

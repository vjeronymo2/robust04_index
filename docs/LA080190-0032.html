			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> UB40 Members Deported: Five musicians and two technicians from the British pop  band UB40 arrested on suspicion of possessing marijuana will be deported from  the Indian Ocean islands of Seychelles, police said Tuesday. Authorities said  there was enough evidence to charge the seven, but they had decided to deport  them instead. UB40 gave a concert Saturday and their performance was described  by the islands' only newspaper, the Seychelles Nation, as a technical fiasco.  ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOREIGN PLANTS ON RISE IN MEXICO;  </P> <P> NUMBER OF MAQUILADORAS INCREASED RECORD 45% IN '88  </P> <P> Boosted by the low cost of labor and heightened competitive pressures in the  United States, the number of foreign-owned manufacturing plants called  maquiladoras operating in the Tijuana region grew by 45% in 1988, the largest  single-year increase ever, a Mexican official said Monday.  </P> <P> The rapid expansion of maquiladoras, now Mexico's second-leading generator of  foreign currency after oil, is an indication of the plants' importance to the  Mexican economy as a generator of jobs and foreign exchange. The rapid rate of  increase, which shows little sign of abating, came despite growing concerns  about the area's overburdened power, water and transportation systems.  </P> <P> Maquiladoras are foreign-operated plants where goods destined mainly for the  U.S. market are manufactured or assembled with low cost Mexican labor.  Favorable U.S. import laws instituted in 1965 mean U.S. manufacturers using the  plants pay duty only on the value added to their products in Mexico.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 52,957 Workers  </P> <P> Total maquiladoras operating in Tijuana, Tecate and Ensenada totaled 579 as of  Dec. 31, up 45% from the 400 in operation a year ago, said Jose Luis Ascolani,  the Baja California delegate of the federal Secretary of Commerce and  Industrial Development, the agency responsible for approving maquiladora  permits.  </P> <P> Total employees numbered 52,957, up 44% from the 36,672 employed at  maquiladoras a year ago. Another 15,000 workers are thought to be employed at  "shelter" plants that foreign firms use on a contract basis for assembly or  manufacturing tasks.  </P> <P> In the Tijuana region alone, maquiladoras are now bringing in $23 million  monthly to the regional economy, nearly twice the dollar amount two years ago,  Ascolani said.  </P> <P> The year saw the arrival of several more giant Japanese consumer electronics  manufacturers in Tijuana, including Pioneer Speakers, Casio Computer, Canon,  Kyocera and Scripto Tokai. The Japanese firms see maquiladoras as an essential  means of competing in the U.S. market, said James Reid, a executive vice  president of Iget Corp., a U.S. subsidiary of Mitsui &amp; Co. that assists  Japanese firms considering plants in Baja California.  </P> <P> American manufacturers, who operate more than 90% of the maquiladoras, also  increased their presence. Among the notable newcomer was box manufacturer  Container Corp. of America. Tony Ramirez, a vice president of Made in Mexico, a  Chula Vista company that helps U.S. companies considering a move to Mexico,  said U.S. furniture and cabinet manufacturers opened the most Baja plants in  1988. Southern California furniture makers have been under strong pressure from  air pollution authorities to reduce some pollutants produced by their painting  facilities.  </P> <P> "The growth in 1988 was much higher than anyone anticipated," Ramirez said.  "But we're seeing the same old problems crop up, specifically a strong burden  on the availability of power. It's taking a long time (for maquiladoras) to get  hooked up because of high demand."  </P> <P> Sean Doyle, a broker with Coldwell Banker commercial real estate in San Diego  who tracks the Tijuana real estate market, said there was a slowdown of  interest by U.S. firms in maquiladoras in mid-1988 because of the political  uncertainty after the election of Mexico's president. But demand picked up by  year-end and continues strong.  </P> <P> Doyle expects about 2 million square feet of industrial buildings to be leased  or bought by foreign firms in Tijuana in 1989, up from about 1.5 million square  feet in 1988.  </P> <P> Ascolani said the Mexican federal government will make greater efforts in 1989  to improve the strained infrastructure but said the government will lean on the  developers of industrial parks and their tenants to help fund the improvements.  Ascolani said he expects the number of maquiladora permits in 1989 to equal  those of 1988.  </P> <P> Total maquiladoras in Mexico totaled about 1,500 at year-end, up from 1,250 at  the end of 1987, Ascolani said.  </P></p>

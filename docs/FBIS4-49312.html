			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 5 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- At a news  conference this afternoon, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu  Jianmin urged the U.S. Government to "act cautiously and make a  wise decision on the issue of most-favored-nation [MFN] status."    Wu Jianmin made those remarks when answering a relevant  question raised by a reporter.    When asked by a reporter if China is worried about the  United  States' partial abolition of MFN treatment, involving -- for  example -- sanctions against state-owned enterprises, Wu Jianmin  reiterated that the awarding of the MFN status to each other by  China and the United States is a reciprocal, mutually beneficial  arrangement and a basis for normal trade interaction between the  two countries. He pointed out: "Any move made by the U.S. side  to sabotage this basis will cause serious consequences."</p>

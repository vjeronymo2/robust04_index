			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'EVIDENCE' GUILTY OF RETRYING OLD PLOTS  </P> <P> Something seems to have gone dead inside "Physical Evidence" (citywide). It's a  cold, bright, thick movie without any life or passion. Yet passion, both moral  and romantic, is its subject. It's a thriller about a lawyer (Theresa Russell)  defending a brutal ex-cop accused of murder (Burt Reynolds), and the story  plays up their class and cultural differences, the corrupt society around them,  the byzantine quirks and crannies of jurisprudence.  </P> <P> How did it go so flat and empty? Director Michael Crichton and writer Bill  Phillips seem to be frantically recycling bits and scraps of every recent  upscale thriller-romance, pushing all the buttons in a doomed attempt to make  something, anything, light up the scoreboard.  </P> <P> The parts seem interchangeable. There's a sexy lawyer battling battling public  prejudices in a tangled legal system. (Isn't that "The Accused"?) There are  backstage finaglings at a sensational trial ("The Verdict," "Suspect");  three-cornered romance with undercurrents of murder and obsession ("Fatal  Attraction"); a disgraced cop trying to clear his name ("Witness"). Phillips  and Crichton are like a pair who walk into a casino and try to win by playing  every game in the house. Everything in "Physical Evidence" has an antecedent;  there's scarcely a moment that seems real or honest.  </P> <P> The most obvious influence of all is "Jagged Edge," the 1985 hit by "Evidence"  producer Martin Ransohoff -- whose son Steve is credited here with part of the  original story.  </P> <P> Original?  </P> <P> The movie begins with a preposterous set-piece: A hapless would-be suicide  tries to hang himself from a bridge over Boston Harbor. When he discovers a  corpse in the girders, the two get tangled up in the rope and fall, dangling  over water. The scene is staged with such a bouncy rhythm, it's obviously  intended to tickle and shock. But why would a suicide victim pick a huge,  well-travelled bridge to hang himself from? Isn't that a bit like like walking  out on a skyscraper ledge and slitting your wrists?  </P> <P> It's best not to ask questions like that about "Physical Evidence"; you'll  never stop. Halfway through the trial, lawyer Jenny Hudson calls a witness, a  gangster's wife (Kay Lenz), who's going to give Reynolds' Joe Paris an alibi,  by admitting they were together, alone -- until the nasty prosecutor (Ned  Beatty) brings her murderous gangster husband into the courtroom, intimidating  her into silence. Did this woman believe her spouse wouldn't find out about her  confession unless he actually heard it in the courtroom?  </P> <P> So it goes. Michael Crichton is a writer-director whose movies, even at their  best, seem a little disengaged and remote. They revolve around gimmickry,  scientific extrapolation, clockwork robberies, robots -- and they're usually  weak on character. Here, working with a story that's an illogical patchwork of  other movies, his style seems even more remote; empty of physical beauty,  though John Alonzo shot it; devoid of humanity, despite a fine cast. Only when  the movie focuses on its plethora of sleazy villains, a Crichton specialty,  does it come briefly alive. The sleaze sweepstakes is won, hands down, by  Angelo Rizacos as a cotton-mouthed contract killer and snitch.  </P> <P> But, even though everything in "Physical Evidence" seems to collapse, star Burt  Reynolds doesn't. Reynolds has had such bad luck with his projects recently,  that critics sometimes react as if his movies were high-wire acts. Will he make  it? Will he fall?  </P> <P> But the emptiness of "Physical Evidence" doesn't muffle Reynolds. He exudes  dark, glowering authority and plays against his own charm. It's a nice  performance -- along with Rizacos' Tony Sklar, Larry Reynolds as the trial  judge and Laurie Paton as a lewd receptionist. It's not enough.  </P> <P> Reynolds' Paris can't save "Physical Evidence" because the movie is built  around Russell's Jenny: a role that doesn't have the range of her Nicolas Roeg  films. It leaves her stuck in legal absurdity, erupting in soft-minded yuppie  spats with her jealous screen roommate Ted McGinley.  </P> <P> "Physical Evidence" is a thriller that doesn't thrill, a romance that doesn't  ignite, a mystery that doesn't mystify and barely makes sense. Like the corpse  and the suicide in the movie's opening scene, this movie leaves us dangling  over dark water, supposedly in Death's embrace but feeling silly.  </P></p>

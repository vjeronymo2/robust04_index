At today's meeting, the government confirmed the position  that the exchange of special envoys must be carried out before  the third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks is held.  It has decided to call on the North side to make efforts to  expedite the process of initiating exchange of special envoys  during tomorrow's contact in Panmunjom.    During tomorrow's contact, if there is no final agreement  between the North and South, and see only a negative attitude of  the North side, the government will officially ask the United  States to postpone the third round of U.S.-North Korean  high-level talks.    The government has decided that if the International Atomic  Energy Agency's inspection in North Korea which ended on 15  March, does not produce sufficient resuslt, the government is  considering to resume the Team Spirit exercise.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, June 20 (CTK) -- A visit by Chairman of  the Russian Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) Vladimir Zhirinovskiy  to Slovakia, which was to have taken place this weekend, was  postponed indefinitely, one of Zhirinovskiy's private hosts  lawyer Jozef Lauko told CTK today.    "As we have been informed by the LDP leadership,  Zhirinovskiy's visit will not take place due to foreign and  internal political developments in Russia," Lauko said citing a  fax he had received from Andrei Losev, head of the office of the  LDP deputies' group in the State Duma, the low chamber of the  Russian parliament. He said, however, he was convinced that  Zhirinovskiy would in the long run come to Bratislava on a  suitable date.    Zhirinovskiy and four other members of the leadership of the  ultra-nationalist LDP were to have come to Slovakia for a  four-day visit on June 25. Zhirinovskiy already planned to  visit Slovakia already in May but the visit was canceled due to  a corruption scandal which erupted in the Russian parliament  then.</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (7): Way to lift technology burdens - Facilities Management Information technology (IT) is meant to be a tool that enables a company to carry out its primary mission. The difficulty is that IT often threatens to dominate budgets. The defence of the IT professional  - that you just cannot get by without persistent technology expenditure - annoys company accountants. A prudent business should be able to keep every cost under control. If vital services, from car fleets to office cleaning, can be contracted-out to third parties, why not IT? Facilities management (FM) is the practice of hiving off computer services to an outside supplier while the customer gets on with his prime business. FM appears in guises such as systems integration, outsourcing and third party maintenance (TPM). In 1992, the worldwide market for all such services was estimated at Dollars 46.5bn, and predicted to grow to Dollars 108bn by 1997. Some sectors are waking up to the potential for FM in a dramatic fashion. In the telecoms realm, the European market for outsourced networks is estimated at Dollars 11.7bn by 1997. Saturn Global Networks (SGN), a specialist outsourcer for corporates needing dedicated international datacomms, has just arrived in London, offering an FM service on the much-vaunted information super-highway. SGN takes over responsibility for tying up the intricate nodes that translate data at the customer's end. The material is then fit to be flashed down the line and across the globe. Each node costs around Dollars 75,000 to install, but SGN's customers are not primarily concerned about cost. They want someone else to handle the bits and bytes while they concentrate on their real business. FM offers to solve headaches by taking over the burden of technology. A recent Dataquest survey of 500 senior European IT executives found that gaining expertise and knowledge was regarded as the prime benefit of FM. But when it came to choosing an FM supplier, the ability to deliver a solution on time was the most significant factor. The automated teller machine (ATM) is an indispensible part of retail banking. Yet the Co-op Bank has elected to hand over its entire ATM network to IBM in a Pounds 13.2m five-year contract. Mick Firth, director of retail banking services at the Co-op, says cost is not a significant factor in this radical move. He adds: 'We reviewed our distribution strategy. We wanted increased functions, flexibility and the ability to guarantee quality of service to the end user.' The Co-op decided on a massive expansion of the ATM network, from 110 machines to a potential 500. It started out with its own ATM network, and could have pursued this strategy on its own. Mr Firth locates the real value of FM for his bank: 'We've avoided an extra investment, and we've freed resources we can use for managing our branches.' There are two rules to getting FM right, he says: one is to obtain a watertight contract stipulating the level of service. The other is to create a firm partnership with the FM supplier. 'The whole thing has worked very successfully,' he notes. 'The handover took place in 20 days over February and March.' IBM is managing the entire operation, including cash replenishment. Co-op customers will not see teams of programmers stuffing notes into the back of their cash dispenser. But Securicor and Security Express staff will top up the ATMs under contract to IBM. The FM business continues to grow. Traditionally the computer industry has generated huge profits from manufacturing hardware. This is the 'metal-bashing' side of the business - and makers of large computers have suffered the same fate as other smokestack industries. Profits have plummeted as smaller, more powerful systems brought down the price of computing. The main suppliers have fled from their dependency on hardware and are frantically diversifying into the lucrative world of FM. Bull has placed its FM marketing drive under the umbrella of a new company, Athesa. Local government, with its finances under relentless scrutiny, is a key target. With 60 dedicated staff, Athesa will arrive on the customer's doorstep as a specialist FM house. But the parent company will supply personnel as soon as they are needed. Bass Taverns is spending Pounds 3.9m (Dollars 5.7m) with Unisys in a three-year outsourcing deal. Unisys will develop the software that runs Bass' retailing system. With 2,500 pubs to support, this operation is the lifeblood of Bass. Writing and maintaining a customer's software has thrown up yet another IT acronym: Applications Management (AM). Computer services group Hoskyns claims AM to be the next big thing. But when Hoskyns commissioned a survey of senior IT managers last year, 35 per cent still cited cost-containment as their prime concern. It takes more than some snappy initials to blow away the balance sheet blues. Contracting-out to an FM supplier may not guarantee reduced spending, but it should keep the lid on.</p>

			<p>930526 FT  26 MAY 93 / GE and Hitachi plan gas turbine General Electric of the US and Hitachi of Japan are to work together to produce a medium-sized gas turbine, designed for utility, industrial and co-generation applications in the 70MW-110MW range worldwide, Andrew Baxter writes. The deal is an important extension of the long-standing relationship between the two companies. Hitachi, which is a member of GE's network of gas turbine business associates, will participate in the scaling-down of GE's 159MW 7FA turbine to create the new machine, the 6FA.</p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Technology: Sudden death of a runaway bull - The Taurus project was blighted by misjudgment, mismanagement and neglect It was a form of collective madness. The City's biggest computer project, Taurus, cost hundreds of millions of pounds and kept computer departments in the financial industry busy for years. But just a week after it was killed off, no one in the City can think of any good reasons why it was being built at all. 'It was a case of widespread myopia,' says one senior banker with a close involvement in the Taurus project. 'We should have stood back more and taken a broader look,' says Patrick Mitford-Slade, chairman of the committee that devised the system. A London Stock Exchange executive close to the project adds that the 'uncritical acceptance of received wisdom' throughout the securities industry meant that, once started, the project acquired a life of its own. Last week, the illusion was shattered. Peter Rawlins, the exchange's chief executive, called a halt to the project which was meant to automate the ownership and transfer of shareholdings. He paid for the exchange's mismanagement of Taurus with his job; but the ramifications of the failure extend well beyond the badly battered and demoralised exchange. At issue, say executives inside and outside the exchange, is how the City reaches agreement on industry-wide issues. The short-term self-interest of particular groups helped to turn the Taurus project into a technologist's nightmare. Where is the leadership in the City to prevent the same thing happening again? Extensive interviews with people close to the Taurus project reveal a sequence of misjudgment, mismanagement and neglect. No one was in overall charge of a project which was set to overturn the legal and regulatory foundations of the stock market, as well as its technological base. Most of the people closely associated with the system's conception admit to fundamental errors of judgment. The full extent of the problems became clear to the stock exchange's board only last week - five years after the project started in earnest and more than a decade since it was first proposed. Taurus (which stands for the Transfer and Automated Registration of Uncertificated Stock) was conceived in the early 1980s, though it was the settlements crisis of 1987 that provided the real impetus to the system. The idea of a 'dematerialised' settlement system - in which share certificates were to be scrapped, and share transfers handled by book entry on computer - grew out of the exchange's successful Talisman project. In 1979, this batch-processing system had automated the settlement process between stock jobbers (the precursors of today's marketmakers). By 1981, the exchange proposed extending the idea to the market as a whole. But its idea - a central computer to maintain all records of shareholdings - was rejected by the registrars who are paid to maintain share registers for listed companies, and who would have been put out of business by the development. 'It didn't occur to us that what we should have done is go to the Bank of England and say that there were too many conflicting interests for us to handle,' says a senior exchange executive from that time. 'That was the basic failure.' This failure was to return to haunt the exchange six years later. By 1987, the sharp increase in the number of share transactions, due largely to the increase in trading by private investors of the new privatisation stocks, had clogged up brokers' back offices, leading to a settlements crisis. The banks which had taken over many of the City's leading stockbroking firms a year before were appalled by what they found; to an industry accustomed to mass processing of routine financial transactions, the mess in the securities industry was shocking. The exchange's response was to rekindle the idea of a central computer - only to run into the same objections from the registrars. It was at this stage that the Bank of England stepped in to try to promote an industry-wide solution. Pen Kent, a Bank associate director, backed the formation of the Siscot committee. Its brief was to hammer out a compromise which left no particular interest group in the securities industry worse off than before. The idea was fatally flawed. War broke out on the Siscot committee as rival interest groups fought their corners. A number of concessions were made, all of which turned Taurus into a highly complex system. 'This system wasn't designed to meet multiple objectives - it was simply trying to avoid clashing interests,' is the conclusion of one member of the industry-wide Taurus monitoring group, set up in 1991 to review the project. To complicate matters, the Department of Trade and Industry then imposed constraints on the system which added to the technical problems that were to follow. The key decisions were: Siscot turned away from the idea of a central computer at the insistence of Alex Tweedie, then director of Barclays global securities services division and a member of the committee. The exchange also cooled to the idea, calculating that it would cost Pounds 60m to build such a large database. It would have required working close to the limits of the database technology of the time, although systems experts reject suggestions that it was outside the competence of the exchange's technical teams. They point out that airlines and the big banks have extensive experience of systems of this size. Instead, Siscot proposed a series of distributed databases, linked together by a communications network, with the exchange acting as a 'hub'. Market intermediaries and service providers would then become 'Taurus Account Controllers', each maintaining its own portion of the stock market. Distributing databases, even today, is a complex task for experienced systems integrators. The exchange, without experience, was proposing to build a distributed database across 400 separate sites with a different combination of hardware and software at each site. For many listed companies, concerned in the late 1980s that they might be the next victim in the UK's frenzied takeover boom, this posed a problem: if records of their shareholders were scattered across a number of databases, how could they tell who was buying their shares? The result was an arrangement for companies to be able to search throughout the system, adding to the complexity. Private client stockbrokers argued that the nominee accounts in which all shareholdings would be held would prevent private shareholders from benefiting from the 'perks' that go with some shareholdings and from receiving information from the companies they owned and voting at annual meetings. The result was a concession that investors would still be able to have their names on a company's share register, rather than simply being pooled together with others in a nominee account. This 'name on register' concept was also backed by listed companies and the DTI. John Redwood, then minister for City affairs at the DTI, pushed for the highest possible levels of investor protection from Taurus. This would have included a Pounds 100m compensation fund - which the securities industry could not find insurance backing for - and a hacker-proof communication system. Full encryption (security coding) was added, increasing the cost and adding hugely to the complexity of construction and testing. The result was a system as secure as the government's Cheltenham communications centre: 'Totally unnecessary,' a consultant sniffed. By this stage, the project was ballooning out of control and no one was in overall charge. This became clear during 1991, as the project became bogged down in protracted talks between the exchange and the DTI over the legal regulations that were to provide the framework for Taurus. 'It was a re-engineering of the legal and processing environment of share transactions between all parties in the industry. No one was managing this market project - the exchange was only concerned with getting its own system working,' says a member of the Taurus monitoring group. While the project was spiralling out of control, problems began to gather at its heart, in the exchange's central computer development. The malaise and constantly changing objectives in the project as a whole meant the exchange was trying to build its core computer system on sand. Just how weak the foundations were only became clear to the exchange's senior management in the past six weeks. 'There were no redeeming features,' one computer specialist said, pointing out that the exchange had broken virtually every rule of computer project management during the five-year span of the project. The errors which helped to consign Taurus to the scrapheap included: The lack of an underlying architecture or logical design. Discussions with a wide range of people involved in the project have revealed that the exchange never completed a full design for its computer system - even though it started industry-wide testing of some parts at the start of this year. The core part of the system was never built and was only scheduled for completion in the summer of this year - at the end, rather than the beginning, of the development. A number of core functions, such as overnight reconciliation of shareholdings and the internal control procedures needed to ensure that the entire network could operate effectively, had been labelled 'non-functioning requirements' and were not due to be built until later this year. Building a complex computer system requires a firm foundation in the shape of an underlying design which sets out how and why the various elements of the system are expected to work together. There was no such overall design for Taurus; new elements were added on an apparently ad hoc basis. 'There was no operating architecture,' says one person close to the project. 'John (Watson) made no bones about it. He'd done it deliberately.' Driven by a sense of urgency, and pressure from the securities industry, the project team was striving first to complete the parts of the system that communicated with brokers and others in the City. A big error, in retrospect, was the decision to use as the heart of the new software a computer package developed by Vista Concepts of New York. The Vista product, a high-priced global custody system, is the market leader in its field and has an excellent reputation. There are simple rules for using computer packages, however, just as there are for buying ready-made suits. Essentially, if extensive alterations are needed, it is better to go bespoke. Up to 70 per cent of the Vista package was being rewritten by separate teams working at the exchange in London and in New York. Communication was poor: 'The London team never knew what they were getting from New York until it arrived,' an exchange computer engineer said. The problems were compounded by the constant redefining of the project requirements. The exchange paid Pounds 1m for the Vista package. Revisions to it were projected to cost a further Pounds 4m, but by the end the software had cost Pounds 14m and had still not been completed. Vista was hired on a 'time and materials' contract rather than a fixed-price basis - an arrangement now attacked by several exchange board members. A second error was to attempt to shackle the modern, on-line, all-singing, all-dancing Vista package to the 14-year-old Talisman software, used by the exchange to clear bargains: 'You have to be careful with systems of that age. Much of the software is unique or obsolete and will not tolerate interference,' according to one expert. Lack of effective project management. 'Whenever part of Taurus was late,' a systems engineer recalled thoughtfully, 'it was always going to be delayed by three months. Never a few days, never a week, always three months. It was as if nobody really knew, but three months seemed enough time to put things right.' Large computer projects do not run themselves, anymore than buildings are erected without architectural drawings and instructions. Taurus was built nominally using a government rule-book or methodology called SSADM, which specifies the steps that should be followed in the design of large computer systems. It has been tried and tested on hundreds of computer projects. Following the procedures in SSADM gives a project a good chance of success. Yet it is clear that the Taurus team flouted the SSADM rules with abandon. One expert said with horror: 'They were still specifying the operational requirements of the system when they began testing - a cardinal sin.' It was not entirely the fault of the Taurus team. The nature of the compromise solution hammered out in the early stages meant all the participants felt they had a right to demand changes, regardless of the project schedule. No quality control. Computer systems engineers have their work checked by independent consultants to ensure methodologies are being followed and quality standards adhered to. Nobody seems to have overseen Taurus. Why was the project allowed to run on for so long with no one in overall control? The reason lies partly in the turmoil in the exchange in the past three years, and partly in the failure by the securities industry at large to take a firmer grip on the project. The heads of computer departments across the City were deeply embroiled in Taurus - and many moaned continually about the project - but few, if any, ever called for a big rethink. 'Nobody was brave enough to stand up and say, this doesn't make sense,' says a member of the Taurus monitoring group. Among those with responsibility for overseeing the project were: The exchange's settlements board, led by Rod Margree, an executive from Barclays. Margree was brought in on secondment in early 1990 after Rawlins told John Quinton, then chairman of Barclays, that the banks should become more involved. This was because dematerialisation under Taurus was intended as the first step towards two other important objectives, both of which needed the closer involvement of the banking industry - rolling settlement (when all transactions are settled a set number of days after they take place) and 'delivery versus payment' (or DVP - the exchange of shares for cash, which requires the integration of stock and cash clearing systems). The settlements board was disbanded by Rawlins in 1992, along with the other independent management boards he had set up in 1990, and Margree left the exchange in August 1992. The Taurus monitoring group, under Ian Cormack, head of the financial institutions group at Citibank. Cormack's group included people with extensive experience of technology projects in the securities industry, including Mike Jones of Capel Cure Myers and Rab Harley of Kleinwort Benson. The monitoring group met for just one and a half hours a month, too little time to get deeply involved in such a complex project. The group expressed its concerns in recent months to Watson and his project team. One member recalls: 'They (the project team) said it couldn't be done in the timescales  -they didn't say it hadn't even been started.' A committee of the stock exchange board, known as the Taurus Review Committee. Chaired by Peter Minchin of Lloyds Stockbrokers, the committee included John Kemp-Welch, joint senior partner of Cazenove, and Miles Rivett-Carnac, who was this week appointed chairman of Baring Securities. 'The committee was only as good as the information it received,' one of its members said. 'The non-executive board members could not delve into the furthest corners of a project like this.' A series of management consultancy firms pored over the project, though none expressed serious reservations until recently. Touche Ross had been brought in as a monitor for the project at the outset and helped to produce the cost estimates used to justify the project. Its role was ended by Rawlins in 1990, who decided that the job done by the external monitors could equally well be done by the exchange's management. Coopers &amp; Lybrand supplied 18 staff on secondment to the project, led by Watson. In the summer of 1991, when the concern of senior exchange management was first aroused, a Coopers' consultant was asked to complete a review of the project. His advice: that Taurus could still be completed, with some management changes. Senior partner Brandon Gough was also involved in discussions with the exchange at that time - although Coopers now says that it never had any direct involvement in the project, but was simply supplying consultants to work under exchange supervision. In the spring of 1990, Coopers made Watson a partner. Stewart Senior, another Coopers consultant, was brought in to run the technical side of the project at the start of this year. He advised the series of tests under way should be suspended until the core of the exchange's computer system was completed, a process which would take at least 15 months. It was this information that finally persuaded Rawlins to end the project. Ernst &amp; Young was appointed to report to the DTI (and, later, the Treasury) when the project was completed, to enable the government to allow officially the system to go 'live'. It is thought to have had reservations about the project for some time, though these were first expressed to the exchange only in mid-February. Concerns were first reported by an outside consultancy firm last autumn, when Andersen Consulting - which would eventually have been required to run the settlements system - was asked to review the project. It was this review that revealed that there was no overall architecture for the Taurus system. The exchange's senior management failed to take firm control of the project. Between early 1990 - when he set up the settlement board - and the summer of 1991, Rawlins appears to have taken no interest in Taurus, which was to cost his organisation Pounds 75m. A member of the monitoring group recalls: 'There were times when Peter seemed very half-hearted about the whole project.' When he finally took a closer involvement, 18 months ago, Rawlins reviewed the project and decided to go ahead, rather than scrap it at that stage. When the recriminations have died down, the City will still be left with the same problem it faced in the early 1980s: how to build a modern stock market settlement system. For at least two reasons, the answer could be easier to find this time around. First, the trauma of Taurus is likely to make the various interest groups in the City more conciliatory on the future development. However, the sound of axes being ground is already being heard again in the City: custodians and registrars arguing against a central registry, listed companies pushing for greater visibility in their share registers, and private client brokers saying that small investors should not suffer. Second, the need for a system as complex as Taurus has disappeared. The back offices of banks and securities houses have been overhauled in recent years (much of the cost was incurred to prepare for Taurus), and market settlement now runs far more efficiently. More private clients' shares are held in nominees, reducing paperwork. Also, share trading volumes have not risen inexorably, making a second settlement crisis a distant fear. The next push, say custodians, institutional investors and brokers, should be towards rolling settlement and DVP. However, the City must still find a new way to reach consensus on important projects which are for the good of the financial industry as a whole. Rawlins will not comment on the history of Taurus. But, looking forward, he says: 'There is a real City management problem here. It could happen again and will happen again.'</p>

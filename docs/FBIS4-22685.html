			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with His Eminence Ioann, Metropolitan of St. </F> Petersburg and Ladoga, by Aleksandr Prokhanov, editor in chief  of the newspaper ZAVTRA; place and date not given: "Metropolitan  Ioann: `Russia Is the Footstool at the Throne of God'"]    [Text] [Prokhanov] Your Eminence, like every other person  who is disturbed by the crime of last October, my attitude  toward what happened is constantly changing. I was involved in  it indirectly, my friends suffered. At first I felt the  disaster, the tragedy, in my heart. And during the first two  days after the gunfire, the firing from the tanks, and the  burial of the victims I experienced terror, human terror. And  then this terror was replaced by sadness, apathy, depression. It  seemed that something great had been lost, that this bloodshed  would not pass without leaving its mark on our history of long  suffering. But as time passed and I increasingly came to accept  what had been done, my depression began to be replaced by a  strange sense of light. There appeared to be hope that these  sacrifices, these deaths were not simply bloody absurdity. There  is some providential, Russian Orthodox point in all this.    The martyrs, some of them to their faith, some of them to  the  homeland, some to the people, did not die in vain. Their death  expiates the vileness, the filth, the swinishness, the thievery,  the disintegration. The October events were a light-producing  explosion...for example, my comrade Stanislav Terekhov, the  first to be taken, was beaten up terribly and thrown into an  artillery enclosure. He said that there he decided to become a  Christian. And this is a representative of the Red military  organization, the Union of Officers. Moreover, there, in jail,  he decided he wanted to get married in the church.    It seems to me that this is related to a spiritual  transformation and I would like to hear your opinion: Am I  right? How is one to feel about all this? What is the spiritual  meaning of the recent events?    [Ioann] I think Terekhov's example is very telling. The  Union  of Officers, as far as I know, has cooperated with a number of  Orthodox brotherhoods in Moscow and St. Petersburg. And it was  suggested that Terekhov become a Christian long ago, since he  has always been very respectful toward Orthodoxy. But,  apparently, something kept him from it, something was standing  in his way. And, being an honest person, he probably did not  want to take these steps just to please others. Some internal  shift was necessary. Thank God if it occurred after the events  of "Black October."    Even the ancient Greek philosophy included the concept of  "catharsis"--purging through tragedy. And the teachings of the  Orthodox Church tell us that any moral improvement is possible  only through grief. A person pays for his spiritual growth  through hardship encountered on his path, patience, and the  ability to endure pain which is found only in the experienced  and wise. Disaster deprives a person of a sense of external  well-being and forces him to change his spiritual condition. And  the first step on the path of Christian improvement is  recognition of one's lack of well-being. Shock, spiritual  disturbance.    When this happens, a person begins to feel that something is  wrong in his life, that something is missing. And if at this  time he fearlessly asks himself the most unpleasant, "accursed"  questions--he will inevitably come to the Church, he will come  to a religious experience of the world, to the understanding  that a full-value existence is impossible without God. "I rebuke  and punish all whom I love," said the Lord. The main thing is  for the punishment not to be in vain, so that after spiritual  vision will follow repentance from sins and a change in life.    Now about what happened in October. In the first place,  nothing supernatural or surprising occurred. All of Russian  history is catastrophic. Cataclysm after cataclysm, catastrophe  after catastrophe. The Russian people, carrying through the  centuries the Orthodox idea of the embodiment of the truths of  the faith, the ideals of justice and mercy, into surrounding  life, are endlessly "squeezing" through those circumstances that  stand in their way. In an imperfect world evil fights very  effectively against good. And when various theological  principles are being realized in life they inevitably encounter  the most stubborn resistance.    From this viewpoint there is nothing surprising about the  October events. They are just another obstacle on the path to  Russian revival. But at the same time they are an extremely  serious warning. If we do not draw the necessary conclusions, if  we are not able to break the negative tendencies in the life of  Russian society, if we are not able to make ourselves return to  the historic path of development and restore the connection of  time that has been broken since the 1917 revolution, then the  blood in October will have been shed in vain.    It seems to me that the outcome of these events is not a  defeat of the people but a kind of victory, because it was very  difficult to assume that after the incredible ordeals the  Russian people have been through during this century, after the  desecration of the past eight years of "perestroyka," there  would so many people in Moscow who would come to the White  House. Because there were very many of them.    And this is in spite of the fact that on the opposing side  were strength and power and a many-century tradition of  obedience, which is so inherent in the Russian personality. In  spite of the fact that the opposing side had the media, the  leaders of the opposition were not so attractive to the mass  consciousness. The people went "for the idea." This,  incidentally, escapes the attention of many analysts.    On the opposing side everything is clear. They went there  for  the benefits, "for the power." There everything is  psychologically comfortable. But here there is nothing but  discomfort. There was not even a common leader, not even a  common banner. But the people came. This means that the charge  of spiritual energy in society is indeed considerably greater  than it seems.    [Prokhanov] After this disaster, when the crisis in Russia  had become even deeper and more terrible, when society was even  more divided, the powers that be came up with a number of plans  to consolidate the level of victory that had been reached and to  stop the slide into ultimate chaos, civil strife and  disobedience, and a general Russian catastrophe. Among all these  political and cultural-ideological plans, I am taken by one that  is still not being openly discussed, but they are beginning to  whisper about it in the back rooms and political clubs. They are  beginning to speak about restoring the monarchy. The monarchist  plan is being considered from various angles, and its various  contours are coming to the surface. For example, one suggests  transforming the current president into a patron, into a regent  of the young Cesarevich, who will be crowned for Tsardom and  become the Russian ruler. Another plan suggests direct election  of a Tsar involving a convocation of the synod--all-Russian,  including all classes...and this is surprising!    When I was a young man it seemed impossible even to think  about the revival of Orthodoxy. But my friend who was later  ordained into the holy orders said even then: "Everything is in  God's hands. A miracle is possible. On these ruins on which we  are now standing (we were standing on the ruins of the New  Jerusalem Monastery), believe me, even in our lifetime the  cloister will be restored. And perhaps we will become brothers  in this cloister...."    I did not believe him and spoke ironically. But indeed--the  miracles happened! And not only in Church life. The restoration  of the monarchy was not being discussed in Russia at all 20  years ago. It was a daydream, the wish of a tiny group of  extreme monarchists who could be found in certain Orthodox  circles. There were none at all in secular life. And now the  daydream has almost become a real political aspiration which  could even be achieved this summer.    But here is what I would like to hear from you. I understand  that the Orthodox Church consciousness perceives Russian state  institutions in the monarchist form which is traditional for  Russia: an Orthodox monarchy. Not a truncated, constitutional  one, but an autocratic one that is linked to a mystical  anointing of the Tsar, one that is consecrated by the Church and  Christ. But could it not happen that today's planners imbue the  monarchy with an essentially atheistic context. The more so  since the classes that at one time developed, brought forth, and  provided for the actualization of the monarchy no longer exist.  We do not have the aristocracy through which the monarchy made  its mark in society, was nourished by its juices, nor do we have  the nobility by which it was supported through military  institutions.    How can the monarchy be restored in our postindustrial  society? Will this great cause not turn into a profanation, a  sham, a discreditation of the very idea? Is this not a  mechanical, premature action and is there no craftiness included  in this plan? Will we not be brought some foreign Tsar in a  snuff box? I am convinced that the Church is far from  indifferent to these issues....    [Ioann] In the first place, one must say that over many  centuries the basic creative principles of Russian life have  been defined by the remarkable phrase "orthodoxy, autocracy, and  nationality." Officially, it was suggested by Count Uvarov at  the beginning of the 19th century but in reality it has defined  all Russian life since the age of the reign of Ivan III, the  moment when the centralized Russian Orthodox state was formed.    We must keep in mind that this phrase is not the product of  any arbitrary human contrivance but a statement of an objective  fact--the fact that a harmoniously constructed society must  contain in its basis three most important elements: spiritual,  state, and national. The spiritual element is Holy Orthodoxy.  The state-organizing element is autocracy, and an autocracy may  be regarded at three different levels, and all three of them are  quite justified.    First. It is possible to regard it as a particular political  mechanism whereby the supreme power in the state, which is in no  way limited, belongs to the monarch. This is a mechanical way of  looking at it, but a correct one.    Second. One can regard autocracy as a state structure  whereby  the fullness of power, which determines the state of affairs in  the country, belongs to its internal state institutions.    From this viewpoint Russia today is not an autocratic  country  because it is half controlled from abroad. Nor was Russia an  autocratic country when it was under Tatar-Mongol power, since  the Khan's Baskaks were stationed in Saray and there the Russian  prince received the edict to reign from the great Khan. Today it  is quite possible to draw a kind of analogy between these two  epochs.    Then there is a third level of the understanding of an  autocracy. It is mainly inherent in the Russian soul and it is  the Church, the spiritual level. In this case autocracy is  regarded as a moral-religious condition of society, the  collective national spirit. When people recognize that they want  to live not under the power of Ivan, Petr, or Sidor, not under  the power of any "legal" systems created by the weak and corrupt  human understanding, but they want to build their life according  to God's law, that higher law of justice, love, and mercy which  is given to man in Revelations.    And then the people, voluntarily accepting the "yoke and  burden" of Christ and the Gospels, will crown the entire state  structure with the figure of the anointed sovereign of God--the  Russian Orthodox Tsar. All three levels of understanding and  laws are admissible. But we, of course, are necessarily  attracted most by the spiritual-mystical level.    The last element of Uvarov's triad is nationality. He  suggests the existence of a concrete collective bearer of  religious-moral ideals. And so the Orthodox spiritual  foundation, the state form of power, and the people as the  collective bearer of the moral ideal--such is the universal  formula for a harmonious social structure. And we will never get  away from it. We can try to falsify it, emasculate it, to pin  the "Black 100" label on it and declare it obsolete, out of  date, and unfeasible--but in vain. Any society, beginning with  Ancient Egypt headed by the Pharaohs and ending with the modern  cosmopolitan American society with its "ethnic melting pot,"  lives according to these three fundamental laws.    The entire question, of course, is which spiritual and  religious principles lie at their basis. Today in the West,  unfortunately, these are blatantly theomachistic, anti-Christian  principles. As for modern Russia, first of all one must say that  the monarchy cannot be established from above, just as a person  cannot be ordered to "be a believer." The people must grow into  this condition. And there are a number of signs from which it is  possible to judge that the processes of such spiritual growth  are going on. For what we are observing in Rus today is a  miracle.    By all human measures, according to all rational  calculations, this should have been a spiritual desert long ago,  everything should have been burned and destroyed. We have been  suffocated, poisoned, and mortified for almost an entire  century! I think that the backroom architects who planned these  terrible scenarios for Russia thought that the Russian people  would never regain their viability, in any case not within the  fairly long amount of time it would take to set in motion new  mechanisms of destruction which would on a new level incinerate  and remold the reviving spiritual energy of the Russian people.    But "man supposes while God disposes." It has been no time  at  all since 1985--eight years, and since the time of the first  shock (August '91)--three years. But the changes are taking  place rapidly, especially, of course, in the world views of  those elite groups of the population that determine the  condition of society to a considerable degree. And this speed  makes it possible for the plans you are discussing to exist.    I have already had occasion to hear about them from various  parties. As of today there is no real possibility of revival  within the framework of the existing political structure of  those spiritual ideals which would make it possible to give  Russian statehood a monarchic form. You cannot put a suit on a  dog and pass it off as a gentleman. And cosmetic, superficial  changes in this situation will resolve nothing.    But if the changes are deeper, they will set mechanisms in  motion in the people's soul and energies will awaken which  nobody will be able to influence. The ideas of Orthodox  statehood are so deep and so ingrained in the mystical essence  of the elemental national spirit that if anybody were to really  decide to play with these issues, I am more than certain that he  would end up with a quite unpredictable result.    As for specific issues related to various names, we must be  fully aware that the house of the Romanovs is extremely  disjointed as of today. And, say, the attitude toward the best  known representatives of this house in Russia--Mariya  Vladimirovna, Leonida Georgiyevna, and the "heir" Georgiy are  extremely diverse. For example, the association of the house of  Romanovs flatly refuses to recognize their grand ducal status.  So any attempts today to resolve this problem through any kind  of force of will are doomed to failure. One would have to be  extremely naive not to understand the objectives pursued by  present-day propagandists of this kind of false "restoration."    And speaking about a synod, the fact is that a real synod  must follow Church canons and Russian national traditions. And  if we look at the history of Russian synods we will discover  that they have a number of features that make it extremely  difficult to perform any kind of political manipulations with  them. People today who try to use the synod idea for their own  purposes would be forced either to pass off some unauthorized  assemblage as a synod or else encounter insurmountable  difficulties.    I think it is now time to set certain "pre-synod" mechanisms  in motion in Russia. We must contribute in all ways to the  creation of various public forms of self-organization which  could then become support points in preparing for the Assembly  of the Land. And then sooner or later this process would reach  its logical conclusion. But a real synod would occur when it  actually unites the Russian people, when its result is  all-national, nationwide solidarity around the single high ideal  that enables Rus to rise up to its full height and the  people--to recall their ancient historical roots and recognize  their ultimate religious-moral calling.    And when the people, having recognized this, freely say:  "Oh,  Lord, we recognize your commandments as our laws, our  obligations, our mission, and our duty and we will act and build  our personal and state life in accordance with them"--then this  will be a synod and it could elect a monarch.    [Prokhanov] It does not have to be a Romanov?    [Ioann] Of course not. The fact is that the "legal  jurisdiction" of the synod is unlimited because it expresses the  opinion of all the Russian land in keeping with the moral and  religious norms and rests on the unshakable foundation of the  all-beneficent and all-perfect law of God.    [Prokhanov] Modern political scientists use the term "social  psychology." In analytical centers and groups there are social  psychologists who investigate the social psychological  background in which various measures are to occur. Of course  this is a precise, refined specialty which uses research  methodology. The professionals manage to understand the  condition of people's minds over horizontal and vertical cross  sections over the entire area of Russia. But modern society has  very inadequate instruments for understanding the spiritual  condition of the people.    It was thought that in an atheistic society this "sensorium"  would be culture. The artist, the writer "fulfilled the duty" of  a spiritual guide. And he tried as hard as he could to fill this  role, partially replacing the clergyman--the person who was  supposed to professionally understand the very problem of the  spirit. Otherwise how could one perceive the spiritual condition  of the human being or the society while denying the existence of  a soul as such and not understanding those processes, the  sinusoid along which the soul moves from birth, from the  rapturous entry into life through the fall into sin, through the  attempts to avoid or exculpate sin, through the spiritual  achievement....    And now today when the Church, for which, of course, it is  also very difficult, is nonetheless increasing its influence,  its power, its luminescence, you are accepting many people--both  Orthodox and non-Orthodox--as a spiritual leader, as a person  filled with radiant knowledge, as a spiritual guide who has a  theological view of present-day Russia. It is no wonder people  are drawn to you. I would like to ask you yourself: Is there now  a word, a formula, an idea that could help Russians to unite,  join together, surmount the schism, the growing hostility, and  prevent a catastrophic upheaval? And if the time for the  monarchic idea has not yet come, on what basis is it now  possible to unite the nation?    [Ioann] In the first place, it seems to me that we are on  the  threshold of a catastrophic upheaval. One of the most important  results of the October events is the substantiated conclusion  that civil war in Russia is almost impossible today. It would be  very difficult to start it. You spoke about social  psychologists. But in Russia all the social technologies  launched for purposes of its destruction, which have been  repeatedly tested, calculated, and substantiated in a gigantic  many-century experiment, have failed. None of them has produced  the expected result. They have been realized almost fully--by 80  or 90 percent. But this "almost" has always canceled out the  final result.    Academician Shafarevich once noted that the concept  "Russophobia" is justified in both of its meanings. There is  hatred for Russians and there is fear of them. Where does this  fear come from? The fact is that those masonic mechanisms that  work beautifully throughout the rest of the world do not work  here in Russia. After all, they have been tested repeatedly by  the world underground! Everyone seemed to be counting on them,  but in Russia--they do not work. And this happens because social  psychology and rationalistic science in general are not capable  of carrying out in Russia those tasks that have been set by her  destroyers.    Every science has its own area of application. In order to  understand Russia, in order to function intelligently here, it  is necessary to have an understanding of laws of a spiritual  nature, a complete and clear knowledge of which is preserved  only by the Orthodox Church. Throughout two millennia it has  stored not only the truths revealed from above concerning God,  but also concerning man and the harmonious social structure of  our earthly existence.    As for the unification of the people, it seems to me that it  has already occurred to a considerable degree. The very fact of  your question is evidence of this. Today everyone is looking for  something to unite us. And this search in and of itself is that  powerful unifying principle which in time will consolidate all  of us, all Russian people, around the age-old spiritual ideals  of Holy Rus.    In recent years a very considerable event has occurred in  the  life of Russia. There has been a recognition of the fact that we  are living wrongly, and that in order to correct this--so that  we will begin to live in keeping with our theological calling--a  certain breakthrough must be made. And the fact that this  question is now rising to its full height in the Russian  national consciousness is a very powerful unifying factor.    But we must not hurry things. Take, for example, the power  in  the state. During the past year its slogans have changed  radically. Before our eyes the regime has evolved in the  direction of national interests, in the direction of searching  for a unique form of statehood. This is no accident. Many people  are now saying that the people "up above" are simply afraid of  losing power and this is why they are building on patriotic  slogans. Let us assume that this is true.    But that is not the point. Life itself is forcing the  authorities to move in the necessary direction. And all of  Russia's enemies are afraid of this. They know that if given a  chance to develop peacefully if only for 10 years--the  many-century, gigantic impetus of national collectivism and  great-power statehood in various forms will inevitably lead  Russia onto the main path of revival of Holy Rus. After all the  historical catastrophes, Russia has always been restored in a  new capacity, even more powerful and glorious.    [Prokhanov] I, who am not really a Church person, a secular,  everyday person, who has occasion to communicate with people of  the Church, know the idea that the life of the Church is  essentially a spiritual metaphor of the life of Jesus Christ in  all of its manifestations: From the birth, the flight to Egypt,  the fast, the entry of the Lord into Jerusalem, and the  confession--to the cup at Gethsemane, to handing him over to  those who would destroy him, to the agony on the cross and death  on Golgotha, to the placement in the grave and--the resurrection.    Since the Russian people are the bearers of the Christian  idea, their fate throughout history has also been to a certain  degree a metaphor for the life of Christ. That being the case,  various periods in Russian life are like icons in the  iconostasis of the life of Jesus. It is quite obvious that the  terrible slaughter and persecution of the Church after the 1917  revolution were its agony on the cross. And the Church's quiet,  the speechlessness that prevailed after this on our earth  reminds one of the death of the Savior and his three-day  departure from the world.    And then something new began, like an awakening. I do not  know if Christ arose in this sense, whether the angel pushed  aside the gravestone, but it is clear that a new period began.  Which icon from Christ's life do we have now, in your opinion,  which stage of His life is Russian society, the Russian people,  the Russian spirit experiencing now?    [Ioann] Here we must keep in mind that such analogies must  be  drawn with extreme caution and reverence because, unfortunately,  even the well-intentioned part of society, going back to its  Church roots and not having sufficient Church experience,  sometimes goes too far in its desire to penetrate into the  spiritual mysteries of Orthodoxy. One must be gradual, fearful,  and reverent when approaching the holy and be clearly aware that  ultimately at the foundation of being lies God's mystery,  unknowable and rationally inexpressible.    "This mystery is great," the Holy Scripture teaches us. It  can be perceived within the framework of a profoundly intimate,  personal religious experience, when the human heart encounters  God, and this personal meeting gives a person a certain  understanding that "the ear does not hear, the eye does not see,  and the heart does ache" in the ordinary earthly life.    The history of the Russian people and the parallels you have  drawn with evangelical events, of course, are correct, taking  into account all the conditions I mentioned. The crucifixion of  Rus in this comparison is "superimposed" on the crucifixion of  Christ and the Savior's subsequent entry into public service.  The hardships experienced by Rus throughout its turbulent  history evoke clear associations with the sorrows, oppression,  and persecution experienced by the Savior during His life on  earth. A comparison is suggested between his sufferings on  Golgotha and what our people and our country have had to endure  in the 20th century. And it is quite possible that we are now  standing on the threshold of Resurrection.    But in order for a miracle to occur we need the power of  faith. If we are able to preserve and increase this power within  ourselves, then the many prophecies about the Resurrection of  Holy Rus will come true...let me speak about the concrete  conditions for the Resurrection: Until the Church pervades  society, the Russian Resurrection will not occur fully. Until  the intelligentsia overcomes its innate illness--intellectual  pride--until it recognizes the primary, saving significance of  strict Church forms of spiritual life, the revival will not  occur.    Modernism and liberalism are fatal in the area of the  religious world view. The divine truth does not require  "updating" or augmentation. From mankind it requires only  efforts to perceive it, to join with it. Until this happens, we  will not resurrect Holy Rus. But today we are still too strongly  afflicted with pride and self-will, which, incidentally, also  led Russia to the revolution 80 years ago. And to this day we  think: We have stumbled, and we can put ourselves  aright--without God's help. No, we cannot put ourselves aright!  And until we recognize this our domestic rod and staff of  sorrows sent by the Lord will persecute us, being the instrument  of the all-beneficent divinity who is concerned about our  spiritual enlightenment.    [Prokhanov] According to Christian teaching, the end of  history is coming, the Terrible Judgment, the end of this  sin-filled era. But until the Terrible Judgment occurs, mankind,  as before, will be concerned about the fate of his homeland, the  condition of resources, institutions, war, schools, roads, and  the condition of our minds. People think about geopolitics and  interrelations with our neighbors, and all of our hopes are  bound up in the well-being of our homeland. Many people  understand today that the style and character of life that are  associated with modern earthly civilization have exhausted  themselves. This civilization is coming to its end--smoothly in  some places, and in some places terrifyingly and  catastrophically.    Is a new situation coming to earth, a new way of life which  people are trying to anticipate, to figure out, and some are  even trying to build it. Some speak about a certain ecological  civilization where every creature, and every plant will live in  harmony; others discuss a sensory civilization where striving  for material goods will recede into the background and the  mechanism for religious, philosophical, and rational  consciousness will come into play. Still others have in mind a  new, super-integrated earth with rational utilization of the  remnants of the earth's wealth, the kind of neosocialism, the  kind of worldwide phalanx that will make it possible to maintain  universal order.    Which is the true one for Russia? Perhaps the image of the  17th century when it was prepared to be transformed into a  single monastery, or Russia at the turn of the 20th century,  when our realm began to acquire the features of earthly,  material well-being?    How would you like to see our homeland?    [Ioann] In order to answer this question we must first solve  the well-known human puzzle: What is the meaning of life? Any  ideal of social structure, any form of harmonious coexistence of  people on earth is possible only when people live thoughtfully,  understanding the purpose of their existence, and build their  life in keeping with this.    The Church gives a completely clear and direct answer to  this. Of course it has nothing to do with any kind of "sensory  civilization." It is simple but very difficult to perceive for  modern humankind, which is excessively caught up in and bogged  down by the passions of vainglory and pride. The meaning and  purpose of human life is to return to ourselves that initial  heavenly combination of purity and holiness, when the human  heart was inaccessible to evil and sin, the condition Adam and  Eve were in after the creation, in Eden. The main thing is to  return to ourselves that invaluable treasure of lost  communication with God. One of the greatest Orthodox saints, the  holy Augustine, once said: "The Lord created us for himself and  the human heart will not be at rest until it unites with Him."    Look: Mankind is constantly striving; fighting wars and  changing boundaries, destroying and creating again, pushing it  knows not where. This unquenchable thirst for feverish activity,  the thirst for new things ensues from the fact that the sacred  heart is empty. The human heart was created as a valuable vessel  for receiving the gifts of the Holy Spirit. After the fall it  was deprived of them, and now it is fatally ill.    So the Church is the hospital for the soul. And a society  will be built well when it does everything possible to make sure  that this hospital is able to treat the human soul most  effectively, calmly, and peacefully.    Russian history knows how the state, social, and economic  life of the country and the people must be constructed in order  to accomplish this. Thus, for example, in Russia it is  impossible to build a healthy economy on the philosophical  foundation of a "consumer society." This is unthinkable. The  Holy Scripture teaches us: "Seek first the kingdom of God and  its truth and the rest shall be given unto you" (Matt. 7:33).    It is impossible to build the economic life of Russia based  on the capitalist principle of unlimited reproduction of goods  and services. This is absurd. The Lord said: "What good does it  do man if he acquires the whole earth but his soul is in pain?"  (Matt. 8:36). The philosophical basis for our life must be  different from what it is today.    All the external riches in this world given to man by God  are  concentrated and available for use; there is nothing prejudicial  or illegal in them. But we must not use them to defile ourselves  and those around us but, relying on the beneficent properties of  this world with which the Lord generously imbued it, help our  soul to restore itself to its initial condition of divine purity.    When people say that the conservatism of the Church could  throw society back 200-300 years, that is stupid. It is  impossible to go back 10 years, not to mention 300. But to  restore in society that ancient spiritual tradition with which  Russia lived for a thousand years is absolutely necessary.  Religion presupposes a link between man and God. And just as the  separate human individual has his duty to God, so the collective  individual of the Russian people has its particular duty to Him.    It was advantageous to God in His infinite wisdom to entrust  the truth of faith to be preserved and protected by various  peoples. First it was entrusted to the people of Israel, but  they did not keep these truths, they were not worthy of their  high calling, and after the terrible crime of deicide they were  rejected, expelled from holy service.    Then this mission was turned over to another people, the  "people of God"--the Christians, who initially were concentrated  in the great-power state body of the Roman Empire.    But in the 12th century when Rome introduced inadmissible  dogmatic innovations and fell away from the universal fullness  of Orthodoxy, its mission was also taken away and turned over to  Byzantium (the second Rome). It performed it for several  centuries, but in the 15th century as a result of the most  powerful military and political pressure it was unable to  maintain the proper purity and decided to unite with the  Catholics, that is, it allowed a distortion of the divine faith.    Then the duty of the keeper of the Truth went to the Russian  Orthodox state, to the Russian people, understood as a  collective spiritual community. We must constantly be aware of  our responsibility for our mission, following it in everything,  and build our lives in keeping with our religious duty. Only  then will we be able to restore the Russia God needs, which will  become a kind of precious shrine, keeping inviolable and pure  the ideals of mercy and love, justice and truth, generosity and  benevolence.    [Prokhanov] I recall that in my youth I was captivated by  patriarch Nikon, and in our circles there were "Old Believers"  whose idol was archpriest Avvakum. I was Orthodox, a specialist  in public law, and a Nikonian, and I frequently visited New  Jerusalem, and all of a sudden it dawned on me: Nikon was  waiting for the Second Coming of Christ, he wanted to transform  Russia into a place where the New Jerusalem could exist. He  thought the Second Coming would occur in Russia. Apparently the  majority of Russian people believed and expected that Christ  would come to Rus, that there would be a Russian Second Coming.  And in order to invite Christ to this place, the New Jerusalem  was created, where on the suburban Moscow landscape, among the  suburban Moscow woods, on the Istra River a place with the name  of the holy places would be created. There were the Jordan,  Bethlehem, Golgotha, and Favor....    I was struck by the grand scale of this plan. In essence it  was as though Nikon had changed the coordinates of the earth,  trying thus to change the cosmic coordinates, shifting the  meaning and center of history to Moscow.    If I have understood you correctly, the ideal of the future  Russia should amount to preparing through Russia a place for the  arrival of God, making it agreeable to Christ, and in this sense  somehow making the image of the homeland more like the New  Jerusalem, to the extent that this is possible in the  terrestrial hypostasis....    [Ioann] Not at all, Nikon did not have that kind of pride.  The building of the New Jerusalem was simply a "material"  embodiment of the spiritual fact that Russia recognizes and  accepts its religious mission. But the Second Coming should  never be discussed too simplistically. This event must be  awaited in reverential fear and spiritual trembling.    While the Savior came first "in the form of a slave" in  order  to serve the people, His Second Coming will be "in power and  glory" in order to judge us according to our deeds. And nobody  will have to ask: "Where is the Christ?" All will be able to see  Him, "A bolt of lighting flashing from the East to the West."    When the Orthodox ascetics asked how they would know the  Antichrist, they frequently received the following answer:  "Sons, if you hear that Christ has arrived somewhere, you will  know that it is the Antichrist" because when the Lord actually  comes everyone will understand instantly because this will be  the coming of the Lord and Master of the Universe, the creator  of all that is, who is infinite in his accomplishments and his  wisdom.    As for spiritual images, everything here is fairly clear and  simple: Russia as the universal repository and defender of Holy  Orthodoxy is the "footstool of the throne of the Lord." This  understanding has matured in Russian religious self-awareness  over many centuries and it was formulated most clearly right  before the revolution by our great saint, the all-Russian man of  righteousness and prayer Father Ioann Kronshtadskiy. "To be born  a Russian," he said, "is the gift of a certain mission. For in  the Church there are no nationalities, 'there are no Greeks or  Jews'; it distinguishes people only according to their missions.  There is the Tsarist mission, there is the patriarchal mission,  there is the monastic mission, there is the secular mission."    So the Russian mission, at once sacrificial and heroic,  lofty  and humble, human and universal, is to be until the end of time  an obstacle on the path of the evil that is pressing for earthly  power, to stand until death defending divine truths in the  sacred objects of the faith.    As long as we remember this, Holy Rus will live,  unconquerable and a source of terror for our enemies and God's!  And for our faithfulness to our duty and the work we do the Lord  will grant his warriors a great and eternal recompense, all the  blessings of which cannot be accommodated by our present  pathetic human imagination.</p>

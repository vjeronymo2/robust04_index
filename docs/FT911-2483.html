			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / International Company News: Christiania Bank suffers loss CHRISTIANIA, Norway's second biggest bank, yesterday unveiled a first-quarter net loss of NKr279m (Dollars 40.9m),compared with a net profit of NKr260m in the same period last year. The s etback stemmed mainly from lower net interest income, which fell to NKr724m from NKr853m, and higher loan loss provisions which more than doubled to NKr610m from NKr267m in the first quarter of 1990. Group operating profit, before credit losses, fell to NKr351m in the quarter from NKr546m. Mr Sverre Walter Rostoft, president, admitted the result is weak but said that the bank had started 1991 better than it had ended 1990. One bright spot was an increase in non-interest income which rose NKr496m from NKr468m last year, mainly due to an increase to NKr108m in gains on foreign exchange trading from NKr68m last year. Profits on securities trading rose slightly to NKr110m from NKr107m. Costs rose to NKr887m in the quarter from NKr790m last year mainly due to restructuring. The bank forecast that expenses in 1991 will be lower than in 1990 when they reached NKr3.9bn. Mr Rostoft said the bank's old headquarters is for sale which could produce a profit of up to NKr400m.</p>

Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> JAPANESE CHOSEN FOR REFUGEE JOB  </P> <P> Sadako Ogata, 65, a Japanese professor of foreign relations with experience in  the U.N. Children's Fund, has been nominated as U.N. high commissioner for  refugees, diplomatic sources said today.  </P> <P> She would replace Thorvald Stoltenberg, who recently resigned to become deputy  prime minister of Norway.  </P> <P> The reported move could end a long and controversial search for the next  refugee chief. Several developed nations, including the United States, have  been at odds with U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar over the  appointment.  </P> <P> She would be the first woman to hold the post, which traditionally has been  held by Westerners, including many high-profile politicians and fund-raisers.  </P></p>

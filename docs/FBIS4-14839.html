			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tigran Liloyan] </F>   [Text] Yerevan April 4 TASS -- Armenia has agreed to stop  hostilities in the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, but put  forward several conditions.    Those include the disengagement of the warring sides, the  deployment of peace-keeping troops and observers in the  demilitarised zone, equal participation of Nagorno-Karabakh in  the settlement process and recognition it as "one of the warring  sides."    The announcement was made by Armenian Presidential Spokesman  Levon Zurabyan on Monday.    Zurabyan said that Azerbaijan is the only country which  "does  not want to reconcile with the political reality -- the  existence of Nagorno-Karabakh." "Azerbaijan must recognise this  reality, sit down at the negotiation table with Nagorno-Karabakh  as Moldova did with the Dniester region and Georgia with South  Ossetia," he said.</p>

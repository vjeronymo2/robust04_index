			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / China to set up credit bank for capital projects CHINA is to establish a credit bank to fund large capital works projects, as part of long-awaited and extensive reforms expected in the moribund banking sector. Mr Lou Jiwei, a senior official of the Commission for Restructuring the Economy, said at the weekend that the Long-Term Development and Credit Bank, planned for early next year, would fund projects in 'vital sectors', such as those of energy and transportation. Mr Lou, a close adviser to Mr Zhu Rongji, China's senior vice-premier in charge of the economy, also confirmed that an Export-Import Bank would be established in the new year to 'stimulate' exports of machinery and electronics. Announcement of the formation of the new 'policy-lending' banks, plus indications that the People's Bank of China (PBOC) would have its functions as a central bank more clearly defined under a new central bank law, follows extensive consultation with officials of the World Bank, the IMF and other international institutions. World Bank officials have urged China to relieve its specialised banks of the policy-lending burden for large capital works projects. 'Priority investment, especially in long-gestation or very expensive projects, belongs to an institution similar to the policy banks' described by Chinese economists,' a World Bank report said. 'These investments could be financed by government-guaranteed bonds. This would obviously be accompanied by re-focusing the attention of existing banks on commercial activities. This will require much-strengthened supervision capacity in the central bank,' the report said. Chinese officials indicated at the weekend this process was already under way, with emphasis on tightening the regulatory functions of the People's Bank of China under Mr Zhu's governorship. Among the World Bank's recommendations is that the PBOC be shorn of its non-central bank functions such as ownership of securities companies and mutual funds to allow it to 'focus on its primary role as a central bank', on the lines of the US Federal Reserve. Western bankers in Beijing say that any step towards strengthening and streamlining the central bank's operations is welcome, but they are sceptical about plans for sweeping reforms of the banking sector. They point out that China's 'big four' specialised banks - the Industrial and Commercial Bank, Bank of China, Construction Bank and Agricultural Bank  -are heavily burdened by non-performing loans to state enterprises. Transformation of these institutions into commercial banks would require an enormous commitment of government funds which may well prove beyond the resources of the central government. The World Bank, in its recommendations, suggested that subsidies for loss-making state enterprises and allocations for agricultural procurement be removed as 'a matter of priority' from the responsibility of the banking sector. 'This type of lending,' the bank said, 'belongs to the budget.'</p>

			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Practical Traveller in Paris: Capital rooms that are cosy but not costly - Bed and breakfast IMAGINE THIS: after a morning stroll through the streets of the Left Bank, you turn down Rue de la Chaise and, pushing open a door set in a high wall, step into the cobbled courtyard of a 17th-century hotel particulier, writes Patricia Roberts. Birds chatter in the courtyard trees and sunlight hits a tall window, illuminating a cozy room - your bedroom, with your own marble bath. Downstairs, breakfast is set on a Russian antique table and beckons with steaming cafe creme and fresh croissants from the neighbourhood patisserie. Your indulgence in butter and jam is carefree; after all, a swimming pool awaits your penitent laps should the guilt prove too heavy. Sounds like a five-star hotel? A private chateau? Mais non, this is bed and breakfast Parisian-style. And for FFr354 (Pounds 44.25) a night for two, it is what the French call rapport prix qualite - good value for money. However, the real value of a B&amp;B (chez l'habitent in French) is the rare glimpse it offers of la vie parisienne. The moment you shake hands with your welcoming hosts, you go beyond being a mere tourist. They not only share their homes with you, but will usually part with wise advice worth its weight in gold: where to find the creamiest chevre, most impressive St Emilion or flakiest pain au chocolat. And with that first handshake passes an unspoken rule of respect for privacy and property, on both sides. In all, the B&amp;B experience adds character to a Paris visit that might otherwise be marked by an expensive hotel bill or the number of monuments duly photographed. 'Napoleon's brother lived in this very house,' says Monsieur Wolfe, master of the B&amp;B on Rue de la Chaise, as he gives me an armchair tour of the neighbourhood 'Next door is the abbey and, further down, the former home of Chateaubriand.' I dare not tell him how dangerous I think the neighbourhood is now, with Yves St Laurent, Montana and Robert Merloz boutiques within easy spending distance. Like most French hosts, the Wolfes are gracious and warm, and no doubt appreciate the extra income which helps towards maintaining their splendid residence. Extra income, and perhaps the comfort of company, is what prompted Madame Henri in the 17th arrondissement to turn part of her exquisite top-floor apartment into a B&amp;B. A striking woman celebrating her 81st birthday, Madame Henri guides me through her home, pointing out photographs of faraway children and grandchildren. She lectures on the high cost of living in Paris before revealing three lovely guest rooms (one with a mini-bar), perfect for a group of five. From the window I see the rotunda at Parc Monceau, and across the street I spot Le Bistro du XVII where Parisians pack the tables for the the low-priced, excellent four-course menu. Not all guest rooms are as special as the one on Rue de la Chaise, or even Madame Henri's, yet no matter how simply furnished, B&amp;Bs allow a unique perspective on life in the very different corners of the city. The best way to make reservations is to contact the France-based B&amp;B agents directly. Rates are less expensive than if booking through international travel companies and in most cases the local agencies have personally inspected the properties and met host families. If you require hosts to speak English, make this clear when booking. Rooms are generally ranked in three categories: Category 1 is the lowest priced, as residences are located out of the city centre and bath facilities shared. Category 2 includes guestrooms in the most sought-after arrondissements (4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th and 15th), and have private baths. Category 3 is reserved for addresses with extra charm or amenities: view, exceptional interiors, superb locations. The majority of rooms are furnished with two twin beds. For double beds, request a grand lit. Ask if bathroom facilities are shared or private. Breakfast usually means coffee or tea, tartine (fresh baguette spread with butter or jam) or croissants. Juice sometimes. Meals may be provided in some instances for a modest cost: ask when booking. Mini-bars are rare so ask if water and snacks can be kept in the room or kitchen, or purchased from your host. With its signature coffee-pot spouting a heart, Cafe-Couette has been welcoming travellers to its chambres d'amis lodgings for 10 years. The organisation is well-equipped to handle reservations worldwide and represents 70 residences in Paris, including the Wolfe residence. Rooms cost from FFr267 to FFr481 for two. Cafe-Couette publishes a directory of addresses (FFr69 at French bookstores, or from the agency) which, when purchased, makes you a member of Club Cafe-Couette, entitling you to 20 per cent off room rates. Two-day minimum stay. Credit cards accepted. Cafe-Couette: 8, rue de I'Isly, 75008 Paris, tel: 42 94 92 00; fax: 42 94 93 12. Bed and Breakfast 1 Connexion offers rooms ranging from FFr260 to FFr550 for doubles. Lowest priced rooms are located in the Paris suburbs, not more than 30 minutes away. FFr50 additional fee for private baths. Discounts of 30-50 per cent for stays over one month. Credit cards, international money orders, Eurochecks. Bed and Breakfast 1 Connexion: 7 rue de Campagne Premiere, 75014 Paris, tel: 43 35 11 26; fax: 40 47 69 20. France-Lodge has more than 300 B&amp;Bs in Paris and requires no minimum stay. Double rooms in the centre of Paris cost FFr250 to FFr350. A mandatory membership fee of FFr85 entitles guests to on-site insurance. Meals available at some addresses. French francs, international money orders or bank transfers. Credit cards not accepted. France-Lodge: 5, rue du faubourg Montmartre, 75009 Paris, tel: 48 01 02 17; fax: 42 46 65 61. Chez Vous represents B&amp;B's throughout France, including Madame Henri's in Paris. French francs, international money orders, no credit cards. Chez Vous: 47150, Lacapelle Biron, France, tel: (33) 53 40 85 54; fax: (33) 53 40 86 30). A point worth noting: B&amp;Bs are best suited for individuals, two friends or couples. According to Corinne Bigot, owner of France-Lodge, families and larger groups are better off renting furnished apartments. 'This is the most inexpensive way for a group to stay in Paris,' she says. 'Besides, having a kitchen is essential when traveling with children, especially in Paris.' France-Lodge, Bed and Breakfast 1 Connexion and Chez Vous also rent furnished apartments. Parissimo (9, avenue de la Motte Picquet, 75007 Paris, tel: 45 51 11 11; fax: 45 55 55 81) is the place to go for apartments with an extra special something - a terrace, a Seine view or outstanding decor.</p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Southend Property dips to Pounds 1.28m Pre-tax profits at Southend Property Holdings for the six months to September 30 showed a slight reduction, from Pounds 1.31m to Pounds 1.28m. The sharp fall in turnover, from Pounds 36.8m to Pounds 18.2m, followed the sale of the main part of the interest in Hamlet International at the beginning of 1992 and the decline in sales of Mt Martin Gold Mines. Earnings worked through at 0.72p compared with 1.13p but the interim dividend is increased from 1.45p to 1.52p.</p>

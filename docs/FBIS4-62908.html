			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, May 17, BNS -- The Estonian Cabinet at its  meeting today approved a draft of amendments to the farm reform  law. The step was made in a bid to prepare ground for a revision  of the already enacted procedures in places where the government  says the reform has meant unrightful transferring of former  collective farm property to new owners.    The amendments bill now enters the parliament.    "This bill is very much needed, as it would provide the  government with the possibility to `rewind' the farm reform in  some places so that corrections could be made where misprision  has been committed during the reform," Laar told reporters.    The prime minister said that although the farm reform had  been carried out mostly in compliance with the law, in many  cases the laws have failed to prevent malpractice. It is  impossible to improve this under the current laws, he added.    Laar said that the draft legislation approved by the Cabinet  today had been corrected for several times after examination by  the Justice Ministry.    The Cabinet today also discussed a bill on the organization  of the farm products market. "The government stated that,  generally, such kind of a law is very much needed, but since it  fails to properly comply with the rest of the currently valid  legislation, it earned no positive assessment," Laar said.    The draft was prepared by the parliament's rural affairs  commission.    The government now ordered the Ministry of Agriculture to  draw up a new draft law on the same issues.</p>

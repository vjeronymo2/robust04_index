			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto by Gaby </F> Neujahr; place and date not given: "We Do Not Want To Build  Nuclear Weapons"]    [Text] [Neujahr] In the election campaign you promised  prosperity and economic growth. How do you intend to keep this  promise?    [Bhutto] This is our biggest problem. When I assumed  office, the economy was in a desolate state. The budget deficit  was high, the public sector inflated, the social sector  neglected, and the infrastructure underdeveloped.    The top priority is to stimulate the economy. From July to  December we reduced the trade deficit by $260 million, foreign  investment increased by 54 percent, and our foreign currency  reserves rose from $200 million to $1.2 billion.    [Neujahr] How do your ambitious plans fit in with a defense  budget that swallows up 50 percent of the overall budget?    [Bhutto] I would like to make one thing clear: Pakistan has  never put 50 percent of its budget into defense. We have always  spent between 25 and 27 percent on defense. Over recent years  the expenditure has even declined a little, in contrast to the  rising defense budget in India.    It is our top priority to improve the people's economic  situation.    [Neujahr] Your relationship with neighboring India continues  to be tense. Talks to settle the conflict over Kashmir have not  yet brought a solution.    [Bhutto] First of all, India must reduce its policy of  oppression in the Indian part of Kashmir so as to create a  favorable climate for the negotiations.    If we do not make progress in bilateral negotiations then,  both countries should consider other ways and mediation by a  third party.    [Neujahr] When the Kashmir conflict escalated in 1990, U.S.  President Bush was narrowly able to prevent nuclear war between  India and Pakistan. Does Pakistan want to establish itself as a  nuclear power?    [Bhutto] We do not want to become a nuclear state. We are  against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, because they  endanger peace and security.    Our nuclear program must be viewed from the proper  perspective. The use of nuclear energy and the peaceful use of  nuclear science are important for our economic development. We  want to use the power of the atom only peacefully and not build  any weapons.    [Neujahr] Will you sign the Nonproliferation Treaty?    [Bhutto] We are willing to sign the Nonproliferation Treaty  together with India. We can accept the safety checks by the IEA  (International Energy Agency) in all nuclear facilities in  Pakistan and India.    However, we do not accept any conditions that apply only to  Pakistan and leave out India, which has just been testing  nuclear weapons.    [Neujahr] In 1990 you were driven from office with insults  and outrage. You were accused of corruption and of abuse of  office. Have these accusations been clarified?    [Bhutto] At that time more than a dozen accusations were  made against my husband and myself and these were dealt with by  summary courts. No court found any proof of the accusations.  Almost all the accusations have been thrown out.    [Neujahr] How fragile is your multiparty coalition?    [Bhutto] There are no problems, neither rifts nor trenches.    [Neujahr] What kind of influence have the fundamentalist  Islamic parties?    [Bhutto] The term "fundamentalist" comes from the West and  is linked with other associations there. Islam teaches  tolerance and peaceful coexistence with other religions.    We have had religious parties since 1947 but they are of  little importance in the National Assembly. At the elections in  1993 the Islamic Front, which consists of Jamaat-e-Islami and  other religious parties, won only three out of 200 seats. The  people in Pakistan do not want to entrust these groups with any  political power.</p>

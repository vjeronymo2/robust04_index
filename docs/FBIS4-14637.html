			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukraine has fulfilled its obligation before Russia  to pay by April 1 $100 million for Russian gas supplies,  Ukrainian Vice-Premier Valentin Landik told the Interfax-Ukraine  news agency on April 1. He said that the last $15 million were  remitted on Thursday.    Landik noted that from now on Ukraine plans to pay for  Russian gas once a decade.    Landik also said that the Ukrainian president would issue a  decree soon on setting up the open joint stock company  Ukrneftegaz with a controlling package of shares belonging to  Ukraine. He added that Kiev "can consider Russia's stake in  privatization of Ukrneftegaz not more than 30 percent."    According to Landik, Ukraine intends to offer its  participation in privatization of oil and gas extraction  enterprises in Russia. "Thus, nobody can reproach us that we are  selling off Ukraine," he said.    Landik said that in April "the government will still be  warning Ukrainian enterprises about the possibility of cutting  off Russian gas supplies, and then the Russian Gazprom, not me,  will cut off supplies."    It is expected that talks on gas supplies between the  government delegations of Ukraine and Russia will resume on  April 10.</p>

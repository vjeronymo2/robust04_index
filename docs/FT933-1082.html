			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Fortnum static at Pounds 2.01m FORTNUM &amp; Mason, the Piccadilly department store, reported pre-tax profits almost static at Pounds 2.01m for the year to July 10, against Pounds 2.15m for the comparable period. The outcome was achieved on turnover up slightly at Pounds 24.7m (Pounds 23.8m); profits at the operating level were marginally ahead at Pounds 1.43m (Pounds 1.41m). Mr Garry Weston, chairman, said the company's cash position had improved over the year, but the sharp drop in interest rates had hit interest income, which fell to Pounds 576,000 against Pounds 741,000. Earnings came out at 311p (334p) per share and a second interim dividend of 14p makes a total of 100p (98p) for the year.</p>

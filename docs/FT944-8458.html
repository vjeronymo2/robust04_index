			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Perspectives: Miners' dreams turn to dust - Nikki Tait visits Lightning Ridge where the supply of opals has dried up in the Australian drought Mounds of baked earth, about 10 ft high, are crammed between the gum trees. It looks as if giant moles have burrowed through the bushland around Lightning Ridge, the Australian outback town which produces most of the world's black opal. Bob Barrett, one of the 1,000-odd local miners, bumps his truck past a particularly mountainous cluster and summarises the situation succinctly: 'About 200 truckloads of opal dirt there,' he says. 'No water, no wash, no work'. Australia's drought, one of the worst this century, is picking some surprising victims. Most attention has focused on the farming communities of New South Wales and Queensland, some of which are facing their fourth year of failed crops. Local newspapers have been filled with pictures of cracked earth and skeletal cattle. Ministers have shed their Canberra suits and toured the region. Hundreds of millions of dollars of federal aid have been promised. But the miners of Lightning Ridge are a forgotten casualty. Their town, just south of the Queensland-NSW border, last saw rain nine months ago. Already, daytime temperatures are reaching 90`F (38`C), and what little water remains in the surface catchments is evaporating fast. This means that the giant cement mixers - called 'agitators' or 'agis' by the locals - which wash clay away from the lumps of precious opal are largely dormant. The inability to process opal dirt has brought torpor to the mining fields themselves. In contrast to diamonds or gold, opal mining is still the province of the individual prospector. Miners - many of whom have Irish, Scandinavian, Serb or Croatian roots - simply turn up, peg a claim and start digging. No one is allowed more than two claims at once, and the maximum size that can be pegged is 50 metres square. Technology has made few inroads. Because the gemstone occurs just below the earth's surface, the extraction process has changed relatively little since Charlie Nettleton sold the first parcel of black opal for Pounds 15 in 1903. Normal practice in the Lightning Ridge fields - where most of the opal occurs in random nodules, not seams - is to drill a 3ft diameter hole, perhaps 60ft deep. The miner then scoops out underground tunnels at its base, supporting his shafts with local pine trunks. The resultant dirt is vacuumed or winched to the surface for washing. At the best of times opal-mining is a raw business. Its safety record is worse than that of the coal industry. Inadequate propping of underground shafts is the main cause of fatalities. Moreover, while a successful find can bring in millions of dollars, most miners live in a state of perpetual optimism. Maxine O'Brien, who runs the Lightning Ridge Miners Association, reckons that about 40 per cent of the town's community is technically below the poverty line, subsisting from trailer homes or temporary structures on the pegged claims. ('Permanent' dwellings are not allowed). Another 40 per cent makes a 'reasonable' living. Perhaps one-fifth gets rich. Back in the pubs of Lightning Ridge, tales of Lady Luck's capriciousness abound. Bob Barrett, for example, recalls the day when a fellow miner picked up a chunk of opal dirt which was wedging the tyres of Barrett's truck. The other miner split open the lump. Inside was opal worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Barrett, who did not get a cent, refuses to believe that the block came from dirt he had dug up and discarded. But then, at least, things were happening. Today, the inability to process the opal dirt, coupled with a required weekly outlay of ADollars 500-ADollars 1,000 on diesel oil if a claim is being worked, means that many miners have simply shut up shop, leaving their stockpiles of dirt to await the rains. Only a few individuals, who know that they are working productive shafts, are paying vastly inflated rates to rent the limited agitator spaces attached to bore-fed dams. Production, estimates the LRMA, has fallen by about 60 per cent. This idleness is doing nothing to improve the strained relationships between miners and farmers. The rural community tends to view the miners as a degenerate bunch, gambling on the chance of a quick buck. Miners, for their part, think the farmers are a selfish breed, pampered by politicians. 'The problem is not about water, it's about distribution,' says Dino, a bearded bear of a man, mournfully surveying a muddy puddle which was once Smith's Dam. The miners argue that they should be given more access to bore water, from the artesian basin, pointing out that annual opal production in Lightning Ridge is worth around ADollars 50m. The value of the wool from the adjacent shire is only ADollars 20m, they say. Perhaps the biggest paradox is that this hiatus has not brought higher prices - at least, for miners. Australia produces about 90 per cent of the world's precious opals and Lightning Ridge is the main source of black opals. These are stones with deep background colours and iridescent flashes, whose individuality makes them the most highly prized by collectors. But marketing is crude. Miners sell their smaller stones to travelling middle-men, who rent rooms in the Lighting Ridge motels, posting buying signs above their doors. As the steady supply of stones has dried up, so have buyers' visits. Already, one auction house has seized the opportunity to arrange a sale in Hong Kong next year, hoping to persuade miners to part with some of their larger hoarded gems. In Sydney, the story is different. Scores of opal 'boutiques' jostle for the Japanese tourist trade. Sales opportunities provided by the drought are not being missed. Last Sunday, in one of the classier outlets by the Harbour Bridge, a German gentleman was pondering a ADollars 8,000 gemstone. 'Opals are getting very hard to replace - with the drought, we haven't got the water for polishing,' urged the saleslady. Her information may have been inaccurate, but her psychology was spot-on. He paid another ADollars 1,000 for a larger stone.</p>

Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> UNOPPOSED CEAUSESCU REELECTED  </P> <P> Communist Party chief Nicolae Ceausescu, who has staunchly opposed the  democratic reforms sweeping the rest of Eastern Europe, was reelected today.  </P> <P> The party's Central Committee unanimously chose Ceausescu -- the only candidate  -- to another five-year term, the official Agerpres news agency said. Delegates  to the 14th Communist Party Congress greeted the selection of Ceausescu with  "cheers and ovations," Agerpres said.  </P> <P> Ceausescu, 71, also called for the annulment of the 1939 Soviet-Nazi Germany  treaty that agreed to the partition of much of Eastern Europe among the powers,  Agerpres reported.  </P></p>

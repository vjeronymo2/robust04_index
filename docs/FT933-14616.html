			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading PRE-BT3 excitement was blamed for thin volume in the stock index futures, with investors thought to be saving themselves for trading in the stock, Christine Buckley writes. A total of 6,618 lots were traded in the FT-SE 100 September future in a range which stretched from 2,850 at its high point about half an hour into the day's trading to its low of 2,825 which was hit about 3pm when any optimistic signs from the US were dampened by a subdued Wall Street opening. 'There were just not the institutional buyers out there,' said one trader. The directionless trading which has been one of the main features of the futures market continued with little prospect of a change as dealers struggle to find a handle on economic prospects. The September Footsie contract started the day at 2,844 and closed 3 points lower at 2,841. It was 3 points ahead of its fair value premium to cash, which is 7 points. Traded options also suffered from low volume, a total of 16,553 lots being traded, against last Friday's 24,314. Of the stock options, BAA was the most active with 1,517 contracts dealt. The expiry of the July contract on the Euro FT-SE 100 option - which is due this Friday - was seen to stimulate some action, with a squeeze pushing its volume to 1,012 lots.</p>

			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Survey of Light Rail Systems (5): Big benefits of integration - Case study, Vienna's successful light rail underground and tram services score highly for reliability and frequency VIENNA'S figures speak for themselves. In the decade to 1990, there was an increase of nearly 36 per cent in the numbers of passengers using its public transport system. The numbers rose from 450.7m people carried in 1981 to 611.8m in 1990. This was in spite of an increase in numbers of cars in the city from 476,553 to 546,945 - up 15 per cent. The city's population grew slightly from 1.53m to 1.56m in the same period. Public transport in the Austrian capital was good, is good and is getting better. It consists of a well-integrated system of trams, underground trains, other light rail vehicles, and buses. Single passes cover all forms of transport. There are no conductors, but stiff fines for fare-dodgers caught by inspectors. The system is reliable, with intervals as low as three minutes between services for much of each day. It is the development of the underground that has transformed usage. There are now five lines and the network they form is being gradually extended or is having its gaps filled in. There are more than 40km of it now, but it has not come cheaply: the first three lines cost AS 18.4bn (Pounds 876m) at current prices between 1967 and 1983, while the next two cost AS 23m (Pounds 1.1bn) at current prices in the 1980s. Another AS 15.5bn (Pounds 740m) of public money has been made available for development in 1991-2000. There are more than 40km of it now, and about AS 15.5bn (Pounds 740m) of public money has been made available for development in 1991-2000. The promise of an improved public transport system was one of the factors which helped persuade the United Nations to open its third major centre, after New York and Geneva, in Vienna during the 1970s - along with having Dr Kurt Waldheim, now president of Austria, as UN secretary-general at the time. Several agencies, including those for drug control and industrial development, moved there. UNO City - part of a large, impressive complex of modern buildings that form the Vienna International Centre on what was once an island in the Danube - also houses the International Atomic Energy Agency. The U1, the first underground line to be built, services the complex, which also includes the Austria Centre, a conference venue. The U1 runs from near the Sudbahnhof, a main railway terminus in the south of the city, to Kagran, on the east bank of Danube, passing under the city centre, where it links with three other underground lines and a host of tram and bus services. The city centre itself is ringed cleverly by the underground. A western semi-circle is covered on a shuttle basis by the short U2 line, servicing the university, Rathaus, principal theatres and, via a shop-filled underground pedestrian passageway, the Opera. The eastern semi-circle is on the U4, which starts in the northern suburbs at Heiligenstadt by the Danube and loops round the city centre to take a westward route along line of the river Wien, past the Schobrunn Palace, to the Vienna woods. Under construction and now partly open, the new U3 also passes under the city centre, in this case roughly east-west. Its extension to the Westbahnhof, the main intercity terminus, will open next year, providing a much-needed link between the station and the U1. The Westbahnhof itself is on the Gurtel, the middle ring road around the city. The U6, the remaining underground line follows this, having been developed out of the light rail Stadtbahn and officially reborn as the U6 in 1989. Vienna's main light rail system, however, remains the Strassenbahn - the tram. There are 247.5km of tramways, 35 routes and 991 tram stops. Some short-term residents in the city have found an easy means of learning their way round the city by taking a new tram route to its destination and back on Sundays. There are no trams in the city centre itself, which is ringed, literally, by the Ring, a wide road built in the last century along the line of the encircling city walls after they had been demolished to allow Vienna, then a thriving imperial capital, to expand more easily. One tram service goes round the Ring clockwise, another anti-clockwise, with several stops linking to underground stations. The city centre itself is almost entirely 'walkable,' but is also criss-crossed by mini-bus services. To help passengers, there is a complimentary and comprehensive map of the city with all underground, tram, bus and regional commuter railway services imposed on it. It resembles a spider's web but colour-coding makes it easy to follow. The general pattern of changing usage has been for tram passengers to decline slightly from more than 250m in 1981, when Stadtbahn (now the U6) figures were included, to 241.9m in 1990. But use of the Stadtbahn leapt from 28.7m in 1989 to 43m in 1990 after its conversion to the U6. The shift and increase in new passengers has been to the faster underground as the network has developed. The 106.7m underground passengers of 1981 had swelled to 202.8m in 1990, not including the 43m who used the U6 that year. Bus travel also increased - from 83m to 124m over the decade. However, it is the figure for rides per population which show true popularity. In 1990, underground and trams were neck and with figures of 157 and 155 respectively, compared with 79 for buses. Vienna also has a route that runs on the railway as well as through the streets - the Lokalbahn service between the Opera and Baden, 20 miles to the south. This version of the supertram has vehicles the same size as normal trams, but with a different seating configuration, and more comfortable seats for the longer journey. The ultimate test of any city's public transport infrastructure, however, is whether it is possible to live there without a car. In fact, many who work for the UN, who do not need to travel round in the course of their work, and who live in or near the city centre, do so. Even Shopping City Sud, the main out-of-town retail centre, is served by the Lokalbahn to Baden. Some village inns and restaurants on the outskirts are easier to reach by car, but most are easily accessible by tram or bus. Even when a car is needed for normal family uses or work, it is much more possible to manage with just one per household than the two which are necessary for an equivalent professional lifestyle in many parts of Britain. Vienna's successful light rail underground and tram systems are what make these things possible. Their impact is therefore much wider socially and economically than just shifting people about.</p>

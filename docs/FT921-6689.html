			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Addison seeks Pounds 14.75m to fund AGB purchase ADDISON Consultancy, the market research group, is paying Pounds 14.75m for the main businesses of AGB Research, part of the collapsed Maxwell private empire. The price of the deal was revealed yesterday in a rights issue document designed to pay for the acquisition which will take Addison from sixth to top position in UK market research. Preliminary agreement on the purchase was reached with administrators Arthur Andersen last month. Addison, which trades as Taylor Nelson, will raise approximately Pounds 16.3m net from the rights issue which already has the support of more than 53 per cent of its share-holders. This does not apparently include Lord Hollick's MAI group, which has 24.8 per cent of existing Addison stock. MAI says it intends to sell if the acquisition is completed. Under the issue holders of ordinary shares will be offered new shares at 12p on a 9-for-4 basis. The rights issue, which is conditional on shareholders' approval, has been underwritten by Robert Fleming, the merchant bank. Trading in the shares of the enlarged group is expected to begin on March 13.</p>

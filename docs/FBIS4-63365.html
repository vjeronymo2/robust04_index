			<p>BFN     [Text] In Bosnia, much now depends not on politicians but  on the military. Vladimir Solovyev, the Ostankino correspondent  in Yugoslavia, managed to interview specially for our program  the man who is probably the most belligerent of the war leaders,  the Bosnian Serbs' commander, General Ratko Mladic. What does  he think of the prospects for a peaceful settlement?    [Begin recording] [Solovyev] In the Serb Republic and in  Yugoslavia he is called the Serbian Zhukov. In the West, some  regard him as a war criminal. Others study his victories in  military staffs and academies. Fifty-year-old Colonel General  Ratko Mladic commands the army of the Bosnian Serbs, the largest  and the most efficient army in the Balkans.    [Mladic, in Serbo-Croatian, with superimposed Russian  translation] Our people hold two things sacred -- the land and  the woman, because they give birth to new life. We never  declared war on anyone. We are defending ourselves, our ancient  land, our women and children, our monasteries and churches, our  culture. Look, even now, during the war, throughout the Serb  Republic, from Banja Luka to Trebinje, there are Croats and  Muslims who are not fighting against the Serb nation and who  enjoy all the rights of our citizens.    [Solovyev, in Serbo-Croatian, with superimposed Russian  translation] Mr. General, what do you think of the possible  division of Bosnia-Herzegovina? What share of the territory  would Bosnian Serbs agree to have?    [Mladic] This is inevitable, and we do not demand more than  we own. Serbs used to have most of the territory in Bosnia-  Herzegovina. The 1910 land register shows that nearly 90  percent was theirs. The Serb nation stands for peace, and we  propose that our adversaries sign an agreement on a universal  and lasting end to the feud and the hostilities throughout  Bosnia-Herzegovina, with the separation of forces along the  present front lines. And let politicians solve all disputed  issues later in conditions of peace.    [Solovyev] Do you think peace is a long way off?    [Mladic] As far as we are concerned, there can be peace  right  now. But looking at it strategically, the forces that unleashed  this war and their sponsors have not yet reached their goals,  either by force or by ruining Yugoslavia. They do not need  peace at present. Therefore I am somewhat pessimistic. I do  not believe that they want peace soon, because they profit  immensely from the war.    [Solovyev] What do you think of UNPROFOR's [UN Protection  Force] ability to bring peace to Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Mladic] One cannot generalize, but most UN soldiers and  officers do what they have to do quite well. But unfortunately,  there are some who forget about their peace-keeping mission and  openly side with the Croats or Muslims. I have to say that so  far not one UNPROFOR soldier has been hurt on the territory of  the Serb Republic. I am sure this will continue to be the case.  I would like to assure the parents of Russian and Ukrainian  soldiers with UNPROFOR that they are perfectly safe on our  territory and that the people welcome them as a force of peace.    [Solovyev] One last question: what is your greatest dream?    [Mladic] Peace. [end recording]    [Announcer] If General Mladic were to put his assurances  about striving for peace into practice, I think the entire  international community would breathe a sigh of relief. But  somehow I find it difficult to believe.</p>

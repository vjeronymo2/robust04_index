			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUICIDE RISK FACTORS  </P> <P> Question: I find it to be very helpful when you write about risk factors for  different diseases, such as diabetes. Have you ever done this for young people  who may be suicidal?  </P> <P> Answer: Possible risk factors for suicide among the young include loss of a  parent; family disruption, such as separation or divorce; emotional stress; a  history of abuse, neglect, or both; having a family member or friend who  committed suicide; previous suicide attempts; a history of alcohol or drug  abuse or a family member with a history of drug dependency; and access to  firearms.  </P> <P>  Neil Solomon is the author of "Sick &amp; Tired of Being Sick &amp; Tired,"  Wynwood Press. If you have a medical question, write to Dr. Solomon, P.O. Box  36184, Baltimore, Md. 21285-6184. Solomon cannot give personal replies but will  answer as many questions as possible in his column.  </P></p>

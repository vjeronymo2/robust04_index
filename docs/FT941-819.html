			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Italian markets surge on poll leaks Italy's financial markets surged yesterday with strong buying based on reports that the right-wing Freedom Alliance, headed by media magnate Mr Silvio Berlusconi, was likely to win an overall parliamentary majority. The Milan stock market's main index added 3.76 per cent, while the lira strengthened against the dollar and the D-Mark on hopes of a stable government. 'The market got stronger and stronger as rumours were spread of a Berlusconi victory,' said Mr Alberto Rolla of securities house Milla. Reaction in the markets was based on leaked exit polls conducted by at least three organisations during Sunday's voting in the country's general election. It did not take account of yesterday's second and final day of voting when polling stations were due to close at 10 pm local time. Electoral regulations banned the publication of exit polls until the stations had closed, but leaks gave between 46 per cent and 51 per cent of the vote to the Freedom Alliance, composed of Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement, the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi and the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance of Mr Gianfranco Fini. On the basis of these polls, the Freedom Alliance could have as many as 340 seats in the 630-seat chamber of deputies. In contrast, the seven-party Progressive Alliance headed by the former communist Party of the Democratic Left would have about 240 seats. The centre Italian Pact, headed by Mr Mario Segni, would have a maximum of 60 seats. Throughout the day political analysts continued to voice caution about predicting the outcome. They pointed out that exit polls might be unable to measure accurately the returns from Italy's experiment with two different election systems - a first-past-the-post method covering 75 per cent of the seats and proportional representation for the remainder. It was also far from clear yesterday whether Forza Italia's northern electoral ally, the Northern League, would be part of a government coalition formed by the Freedom Alliance. Speaking before the count yesterday, Mr Marco Formentini, the Northern League mayor of Milan, stressed that his federalist party would not join the National Alliance in government. He said that for this reason it was important for the Northern League and Forza Italia to stay together and that it might be possible to find other allies with which to form a government.

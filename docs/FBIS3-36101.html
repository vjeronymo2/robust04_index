The group also includes representatives of the State  Cooperation Committee, Customs Control Committee, and the  Central Bank of Russia. The visit is connected with  preparations for the signing of documents necessary to merge the  two countries' monetary systems. An official from the  Belarusian Cabinet of Ministers, who agreed to speak on  condition of anonymity, did not rule out a decision to gradually  replace the Belarusian currency with Russian rubles sometime  this year. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets is  expected to arrive in Minsk later this week to finally resolve  this issue.</p>

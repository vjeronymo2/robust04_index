			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Retail sales show rise for second consecutive month HIGH STREET sales rose modestly in February, perhaps indicating a cautious upturn in consumer demand. Sales rose 0.4 per cent, the second consecutive monthly rise, bringing the year-on-year increase over February 1991 to 1.5 per cent. The three-monthly figure, the best guide of the underlying trend according to the Central Statistical Office, was less encouraging. Sales grew by only 0.1 per cent in the three months to February compared with the previous three-month period. In the six months to January sales hardly grew. The Conservative party said the rise indicated imminent economic recovery. 'Retail sales volumes are now firmly established on a modest upward trend, as consumer confidence is being restored,' said Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's spokesman on trade and industry, said that hundreds of jobs remained at risk in Britain's high streets. Economists yesterday cautioned against reading too much into the figures, saying the pick-up could easily be reversed. Mr Michael Saunders, of securities' house Salomon Brothers, said: 'The trend in retail sales is still generally flat. Consumer spending in coming months is likely to be held back by weak personal incomes and falling personal wealth.' The official figures showed that last month's rise was concentrated in mixed business - mainly department stores - where sales rose by 3.4 per cent on the month. Non-food sales rose 0.7 per cent on the month after falling 1.6 per cent in January. Food sales dropped 1.2 per cent in February after rising 2.3 per cent during January. Sales in household goods - rose 3 per cent in the three months to February compared with the previous three month period. On the year, household good sales in the latest three months rose by 5 per cent although all the year-on-year comparisons were distorted by weak sales a year ago during the Gulf war. The more optimistic view of the economy suggested by yesterday's retail sales figures contrasts with the monthly output figures earlier this week which showed a fall of 0.7 per cent in February. The year on year decline in manufacturing output was 3.5 per cent. The two sets of figures suggest that, in order to meet demand, retailers are running down stocks rather than making new orders.</p>

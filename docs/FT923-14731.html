			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Economics Notebook: A blueprint for policymakers in a world of change AS the leaders of the Group of Seven countries gather for their 18th world economic summit in Munich today, it is a sobering thought that after 17 such gatherings since 1975 the world economy seems as difficult to manage as ever. We are now a quarter of the way through the 1990s and the decade has so far failed to live up to earlier expectations that it would be a period of good economic performance. World growth has been feeble. Unemployment in the 24 industrialised nations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has jumped from less than 25m two years ago to around 30m today. It remains to be seen whether last week's cut in the US discount rate to a 29-year low of 3 per cent can banish fears of a 'triple-dip' US recession. The persistent failure of the UK economy to resume steady growth is politically uncomfortable for Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Norman Lamont his chancellor, and promises to make this year's public spending round extremely difficult. While the Bundesbank has suggested that Germany, the summit host, may achieve growth of around 2.5 per cent this year, there are fears in some G7 capitals that Japan's present economic slowdown could turn into a recession. In these circumstances, a recent book* on economic policies for the 1990s, edited by two senior OECD officials, offers governments little comfort. 'While bad policy almost always results in bad performance - witness the performance of central planning in the eastern European economies - good policy can generally only permit, or at most encourage, good performance,' they say. Mr John Llewellyn, who now heads the private office of the OECD secretary general, and Mr Stephen Potter, director of the organisation's important country studies department, are in a strong position to make such judgments. They have held senior posts at the OECD for 15 and 20 years respectively and so lived and worked through all the changes of fashion in economic policymaking over the past two decades. Perhaps the most daunting lesson that they draw from their own research and that of the book's other contributors is that supply side shocks should be regarded by economic policymakers as a rule rather than an exception. In their view, the relatively calm years of the 1950s and 1960s were an aberration from the long-term norm and not a state to which the world economy can easily return. This means that policymakers, managers and employees must be prepared to adapt constantly to unforeseen circumstances. Moreover, macro-economic and micro-economic policies cannot be viewed in isolation. To some extent, these lessons have already been taken on board. Policymakers over the past decade have realised that structural policies which modernise economies through deregulation and the elimination of rigidities are of vital importance. But it does no harm to remind policymakers that they have to be more imaginative. Unemployment, for example, has become much more of a structural phenomenon as old industries die and new activities emerge. In response, governments should adopt (and some have adopted) so-called 'active' labour market policies, which focus on increasing the incentives for the unemployed to seek jobs or improving training rather than simply providing income support. Although Mr Llewellyn and Mr Potter do not elaborate, the corollary for displaced managers and employees is that they must be more willing than before to 'get on their bikes' in search of work. It may seem tough luck that so soon after the collapse of communism and the discrediting of such doctrines as Trotsky's theory of permanent revolution, the winners of the ideological battle should be condemned to a life of permanent adaptation. But capitalism has always demanded such a price for the rewards that it distributes. The difference today is that international competition is so intense that the pain is felt sooner. Accommodating that pain in the political structures of the industrialised democracies is no easy task, however. The stalled Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks shows how difficult it is for governments to translate good intentions into action when powerful vested interests are involved. Another point underlined by Mr Jean-Claude Paye, the OECD's secretary general, in the foreword to the book, is that the market economy must offer sufficient economic justice. 'Each must firmly believe that the opportunities open to him and her are not unduly limited and efforts are fairly rewarded.' But what should governments do to secure better economic performance? The book's editors have drawn up a checklist of five guiding principles for policy. Market forces have a key role to play. 'Although market failure can occur, it is generally appropriate to start from the presumption that market-based policies will lead to a stronger economy.' Policies need to be sustainable so that people and businesses can base their decisions on reliable and credible signals and be spared disruption caused by changing policies in response to crisis. Economies must be able to adjust to shocks. Governments should aim for a balanced mix of policies. In a passage of some relevance to the UK, they say: 'When objectives are numerous it makes no sense to jettison any proven instruments, let alone place overwhelming reliance on a single one.' International co-operation is useful - the guidelines are easier to follow if other countries follow them too. Messrs Llewellyn and Potter admit that the list may seem uncontroversial. The principles are already being followed to a considerable extent, they admit. 'But there are numerous examples in recent history where economic performance would have been better had they been accorded greater weight,' they say. *Economic Policies for the 1990s, Edited by John Llewellyn and Stephen Potter, published by Blackwell at Pounds 50.</p>

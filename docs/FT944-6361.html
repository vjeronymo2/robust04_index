			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Stranded ferry inquiry launched Swansea Cork Ferries last night began an inquiry into why its 8,797-tonne vessel Superferry was stranded on a sandbank with 346 passengers and crew for more than four hours yesterday. A tug pulled the Greek-registered ferry from the sandbank in the Irish Sea a mile from Swansea harbour. Coastguards said there was no danger to passengers but lifeboats and RAF helicopters were put on standby. Coastguards said the ship's master alerted them by radio after the ferry from Cork ran aground on the edge of the channel at low tide at about 6.30am. It was not known yesterday whether a local pilot was on board.</p>

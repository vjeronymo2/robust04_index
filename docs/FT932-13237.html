			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Appeal court backs teachers' right to boycott tests CLASSROOMS in England and Wales face a summer of disruption after Britain's second-largest teachers' union yesterday successfully defended its right to boycott the controversial national curriculum tests in the courts. Mr John Patten, the embattled education secretary, now faces the choice of an embarrassing climbdown, a rush to change the law or widely disrupted tests. The appeal court ruled against Wandsworth Borough Council, which brought the action to prevent the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers from boycotting the tests. Wandsworth will not attempt to appeal to the Lords. The NAS/UWT is already boycotting the tests, which are due to take place in June. The two other biggest teaching associations, the National Union of Teachers and the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, who are also balloting their members, are expected to join the boycott. However, senior Whitehall officials yesterday appeared to play down suggestions that the government would introduce emergency legislation to outlaw the boycott. Earlier this week a leaked letter to Mr Patten from Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, suggested that the government was preparing to amend the employment bill to outlaw industrial action which would flout the will of parliament. Downing Street refused to rule out such a move. But officials stressed that the idea was not under 'active consideration', reinforcing a general view at Westminster that the government would have to ride out the present storm in the hope that the teachers would eventually lose the sympathy of parents. The appeal court ruled unanimously that the NAS/UWT's action was lawful because it mainly related to the heavy workload that teachers would take on to implement the tests, and was not politically motivated by opposition to the national curriculum itself. Mr Nigel de Gruchy, NAS/UWT general secretary, proclaimed the result as a 'scorching victory'. He predicted that an attempt to change the law would meet 'open rebellion' from teachers. Mr Edward Lister, Wandsworth council leader, said: 'All those concerned with education should now move forward to greater agreement. Everyone acknowledges that improvements to the curriculum and the tests can be made.' Mr Patten responded in a speech to the annual conference of the Secondary Heads' Association, by pointing out that governors and head teachers still have a statutory obligation to implement the tests.

			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Arts: 'Shining Brow' - a tribute to Frank Lloyd Wright / Opera in Madison, Wisconsin Madison, Wisconsin, is a city one might compare with, say, Worcester for its size, for the way it is dominated by one spectacularly sited piece of architecture (the high domed state capitol on a hill between lakes), for the snare of its one-way system, and for its unlikeliness as a springboard for new opera. Hitherto the local company has put on a couple of productions each season: usually a favourite opera and a musical. But a few years ago some proud and tenacious residents got it into their heads that Madison Opera ought to present a new piece on the subject of Madison's most famous son, or stepson, Frank Lloyd Wright, who attended high school and college in the city. The next step was to find a Wisconsin composer to do the job. And because Daron Aric Hagen, the eventual choice, was staying at an artists' retreat in the company of Paul Muldoon when he received the call, Madison's dream began to become real in Muldoon's words. The resulting libretto is a curious and fascinating piece of work, as lopsided and quaint and wondrous as anything created by Wright himself. There are phrases, and sometimes whole miniature scenes, that are, as Muldoon has bemusedly said, more direct than anything he might have done without the cover of music. When, for instance, Wright is confronted by slavering reporters and prudish neighbours on his return from Europe with his mistress Mamah Cheney, he speaks to himself in the most everyday language: 'The truth is that I feel nothing, not the merest hint of remorse. Not a pang of guilt.' The brandy-doused resentment of Louis Sullivan, Wright's erstwhile mentor, is also expressed plainly and forcefully, and there are little moments of social comedy in what the chorus have to do. On the other hand, many passages are deeply underlaid with allusion or, more commonly, with subtleties of metre, rhyme and assonance. Mamah in Berlin has a long solo in terza rima and Muldoon proves himself a virtuoso in the da Ponte-ish trickery of enabling different people to sing different things simultaneously in similar sounds. Most conspicuously of all, his libretto is full of words and images that repeat themselves from mouth to mouth, so that the individualities needed for characterisation - and, to a degree, plot - are eroded by echoings. 'I know, I know, I know, I know, I know' is the simplest of these verbal tics, its echoings echoed in turn by those of other keywords: 'kowtow', 'brow' (Shining Brow, the opera's title, is a translation of the bard's name Wright gave to the house he built for himself and Mamah: Taliesin). 'I know, I know.' There is nothing new. The people of the libretto - moments of baldness or wit aside - seem to be caught up in a cat's cradle of words: of words put into their mouths, of words which have their own lives, meandering from mouth to mouth. Tides of words take the piece on; who speaks or sings them is irrelevant. The one character who has his own words is Carleton, the black chef at Taliesin, whose hot utterance springs across the gap from ecstatic African-American preaching to the Welshness of Wright's ancestry and of Muldoon's immediately preceding poetic work: 'I am the hart. I am the hind. I am the green and burning tree. I am the cloud no bigger than a hand. I will go down in history.' It is Carleton who, on the plot level, is responsible for the final catastrophe, the burning of Taliesin with Mamah and her children inside, and who, below the plot, challenges the other characters with the certainty and uniqueness of his language. Significantly, this language is spoken - or, rather, declaimed - not sung, while the orchestra stays silent. The composer's nobility is to leave Carleton's self-statement outside the purlieu of music which oddly thrusts this sophisticated libretto into a world compounded of Broadway, Peter Grimes and Der Rosenkavalier. The dedication of the score to the memory of Leonard Bernstein is apt. In the performance, everything that enthusiasm could do was done. Roland Johnson conducted a vigorous and spirited orchestra; the cast was led by Michael Sokol in the lyric baritone role of Wright, intrepidly seeking himself through the always confounding maze of words, with Carolann Page as Mamah and the tenor Barry Busse splendid and vituperative in disarray as Sullivan. Stephen Wadsworth's direction and David Birn's sets understandably opted for straightforward clarity.</p>

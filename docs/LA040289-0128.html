			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLD SHOWER ON DOORS  </P> <P> I would like to express a contrary opinion to the March 19 article by A. J.  Hand, "Shower Door Better Than a Curtain."  </P> <P> Shower enclosures may look good and may present a watertight, cozy enclosure  (if installed correctly) for the shower taker, but they are a nuisance to bath  takers and tub cleaners:  </P> <P> 1 -- If there are small children in a family, one cannot sit on the tub to  bathe them because of the railing, but must kneel or crouch uncomfortably;  </P> <P> 2 -- One cannot place a bath tray across the tub -- the ledge has been narrowed  by the railing;  </P> <P> 3 -- The cleaner of the tub is prevented by the width of the shower doors from  reaching the whole tub and must clean one side, shift the door, then clean the  other;  </P> <P> 4 -- The rails become filled with dirt and must be constantly cleaned out; the  shower doors become coated with soap scum and one must go inside the tub to  clean the glass.  </P> <P> After putting up with glass shower door enclosures over my tub (they are fine  for stall showers), I finally had them taken out in both bathrooms. What a  relief! Of course, we had to fill in the holes drilled in the tile to support  the side rails and the area where the bottom rails were installed is a lighter  color than the rest of the tub, but it is worth it. Having a double shower  curtain, vinyl inner curtain, decorative outer curtain, prevents water seepage  and, best of all, I can now clean the tub with ease.  </P> <P> JANICE K.

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / International Company News: Jump in Rhone-Poulenc income Lower tax charges helped lift net income at Rhone-Poulenc, the French pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, in the first nine months. Group income rose 47.4 per cent to FFr1.14bn (Dollars 222m), compared with the same period in 1993. The company yesterday said consolidated net sales improved 6.4 per cent to FFr63.4bn, reflecting growth in all sectors. The largest increases came in organic and inorganic intermediates, up 8 per cent, and fibres and polymers, up 17.8 per cent. It said operating income would have increased 24.6 per cent if the results excluded provisions for restructuring expenses and non-recurring items. In the first half it announced FFr699m provisions in Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, its US drugs unit. The income tax provision fell to FFr647m from FFr1.16bn, while the charge for minority interests also fell sharply to FFr697m, compared with FFr1.06bn in the first nine months last year. The group said the reduction reflected the merger with Institut Merrieux, and offset a decline in foreign exchange gains and capital gains on asset disposals which were much higher this year. Net income for the third quarter alone jumped sharply to FFr807m, compared with a loss of FFr299m last year while net sales rose 7.5 per cent to FFr21bn. The company believed the Full-year outlook remained positive and predicted an increase in net income due to improve doperations and a capital gain on the sale of assets.</p>

			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Observer: Pizza the action Some companies have learned to their cost that gimmicky promotions can backfire - viz Hoover's disastrous free flights offer . . . Pizza Hut, the Pepsico-owned restaurant chain, is possibly now regretting its latest marketing foray at New York's Madison Square Garden, home to the New York Knicks, America's top basketball team. At Knicks' games Pizza Hut is offering free pizzas to everyone in the crowd, so long as the Knicks' opponents fail to score at least 85 points. This is quite a gamble, given that every game is a sell-out to a capacity crowd of 20,000 fans, and the Knicks are the best defensive team in the league. Several times so far this season visiting teams have struggled to make 85 points, putting the heat under those Pizza Hut executives responsible for the idea. Their personal career version of pizza-to-go almost arrived in last week's game against Miami Heat. Thousands of hungry New Yorkers howled 'pizza, pizza, pizza' as the final seconds of the game against Miami - on a puny 82 points - ticked by. Miraculously, Miami reached 85 points as the whistle blew. Pizza Hut executives also blew - a sigh of relief - but it vanished as quickly as the smile on the face of a New York waiter who sees a tip of less than 12.5 per cent. For although the execs had avoided a jumbo-sized payout, their promo had nevertheless clearly bombed. New Yorkers to the core, the disappointed fans stopped screaming for pizza and instead started yelling abuse at Pizza Hut.</p>

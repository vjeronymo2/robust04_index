			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Skies without limits: A look at the problems facing airlines in the former Soviet Union The large blue and green globe advertising Aeroflot on a Moscow avenue used to boast of the airline's comfort and speed. More recently, the neon-lit words have been removed, leaving just the globe and the Aeroflot emblem. The alteration proved symbolic. Two crashes - one last month of an Airbus operated by the successor to the Aeroflot of Soviet times (which still uses its name) and another in January of an aircraft run by a tiny offshoot - have severely damaged the Russian airline industry's image. The revelation this week that the pilot in the Aeroflot crash, which killed all 75 people on board, had been teaching his children how to fly confirmed western suspicions that safety and discipline have fallen to dangerous levels. The accident has brought home to the Russian government the need to restructure the country's civil aviation industry and tighten its supervision. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Aeroflot has splintered into not just 15 airlines - one in each newly independent republic - but also about 300 regional and town-based mini-carriers. The break-up has exacerbated the problems of the old Aeroflot: ageing aircraft, dilapidated airports and poor service. Most of the new companies are state-owned, small and inefficient. In spite of the break-up of the old monopoly, few compete on the same routes, reducing incentives to improve standards. And they have little scope for cross-subsidising unprofitable domestic routes - some of which provide virtually the only form of transport in Russia's far north and east. Some help came in January 1992, when state price controls were lifted, enabling airlines to price their tickets at more realistic levels. Nevertheless, the Russian pilots' union reckons that last year only half of the country's airlines - mostly those that inherited profitable routes - made money. 'We are a country of extremes. We were thrown from the old state monopoly system right into a market without any rules,' says Mr Alfred Malinovski, head of the union. 'We interpreted the concept of a market in the most radical way by breaking up Aeroflot into 300 companies which turned out to be unmanageable. You can do that sort of thing with a state-owned laundry monopoly, but not with civil aviation.' The regulatory machinery is proving particularly ineffective. The old Soviet civil aviation ministry was replaced by a Russian air transport department to supervise airlines within Russia, and an inter-state aviation committee to agree common standards on issues such as safety among the independent republics. But both have lacked political clout, staff and money. Breaches of safety rules are highly visible on flights within the former Soviet Union. Travelling can be an unnerving experience: some passengers tell tales of heavy luggage being piled up against safety exits, despite complaints by western travellers; others say that, after their hand luggage had been carefully weighed at the check-in counters, young traders were allowed on to the aircraft at the last minute with outsize parcels. Passengers on the tragic Aeroflot flight to Hong Kong may have seen little to distinguish the Airbus they were travelling on from those of western airlines. But Mr Malinovski says a fall in morale and discipline has affected Russia's domestic and international pilots. He suggests setting up an independent, properly funded civil aviation authority, capable of attracting skilled staff and with the authority to devise and enforce regulations for the industry. Yet that would not overcome the problems airlines have in making the investment necessary to improve standards. Mr Mark Jarvis, Moscow representative of Fleming's, the UK investment bank with interests in aircraft leasing and manufacturing in Russia, says: 'None of the baby Aeroflots has any money left for anything else once they've paid for fuel and maintenance . . . They cannot even afford a new paint job for Dollars 50,000, or to refurbish interiors, let alone acquire new aircraft.' In large part, the financing problems stem from Aeroflot's disintegration. There is a need for consolidation, but political upheavals, disagreements about the direction of market reforms, and preoccupations with other pressing matters mean the governments of Russia and most of the former Soviet republics lack a strategy for the industry. An example of this is Moscow's indecision over Aeroflot-Russian International Airlines, the full name of the rump of Aeroflot. The privatisation ministry wants to break the carrier into more than one company prior to selling shares to the public. But other officials and the airline's executives want to preserve a unified national flag-carrier, able to compete against international rivals. While Aeroflot's successors languish, a bright spot is the emergence of a few privately funded competitors. The most prominent is Transaero, which boasts western-style service, by stewardesses trained by Air France, and five leased Boeings maintained by Israelis. Created in 1992 with backing from a private Russian bank, it flies to eight destinations within the former Soviet Union for a small premium over the prices asked by Aeroflot's heirs operating the same routes. Mr Leonid Kligerman, Transaero's public relations manager, says: 'For 70 years, passengers flying Aeroflot did not even know what service meant. We make it our business to show them. Having flown with us once, they will always fly with us.' Transaero's success is due partly to its ability to 'cherry-pick' profitable routes - with destinations such as the oil town of Nizhnevartovsk and the holiday resort of Sochi. It is also possibly aided by the fact that the mother of Transaero's chairman heads the inter-state aviation committee. Until the Russian authorities inject some coherence into the state sector, allowing private entrepreneurship to flourish at its expense may be the only way to provide Russian passengers with a genuine choice. The risk is that further lives may be lost before necessary changes are made.</p>

			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STATE VOLLEYBALL DIVISION II;  </P> <P> LA JOLLA FAILS TO OVERCOME LA HABRA HEIGHT ADVANTAGE  </P> <P> When top-seeded La Habra High School played La Jolla in the first round of the  Southern California Division II playoffs Tuesday night, it wasn't just a ho-hum  victory by La Habra. It was more like ho-hum-yawn.  </P> <P> Powered by middle-hitter Missy Clements' 14 kills, La Habra swept La Jolla,  15-4, 15-4, 15-7.  </P> <P> "Missy was hot early so we tried to got to her a little more," La Habra Coach  Sandy Blumenthal said.  </P> <P> Early? The entire match lasted just 75 minutes. The second game took 15  minutes.  </P> <P> La Jolla (20-10) had trouble spiking past 6-foot-5 Zrinka Kristich, 6-2 Ana  Kristich and 5-11 Clements.  </P> <P> "They really didn't have anybody who could just put the ball away," Blumenthal  said. "It was pretty obvious that we just had too many hitters for them."  </P> <P> Indeed, Zrinka Kristich had 12 kills and Ana Kristich had eight to add to  Clements' 14. Maybe that's why La Habra (23-0) has won 42 consecutive matches  and is the two-time Division 3-A champions and the defending Division II State  Champions.  </P> <P> La Habra will play Bakersfield Highland, which defeated Long Beach St. Anthony,  14-16, 15-6, 13-15, 15-10, 15-9, on Saturday at La Habra.  </P></p>

			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / InterCity links threatened by sell-off, BR report says DOZENS OF towns and cities in the UK will lose their InterCity rail links under the government's plans for the privatisation of British Rail, according to a confidential BR document. They include every InterCity destination in Scotland north of Glasgow and Edinburgh; every InterCity destination in Wales except Newport and Cardiff; and a score of English towns and cities such as Blackpool, Bradford, Hull, Lincoln, Worcester, Hereford and Penzance. The document, seen by Mr Brian Wilson, Labour's Scottish transport spokesman, threatens to provoke strong opposition to the privatisation plans from MPs representing the constituencies affected - many of them Conservative. But Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, yesterday dismissed it as 'scaremongering'. Although the document is likely to be seen as an attempt by BR employees to undermine the privatisation plans, it presents a plausible analysis of the likely consequences of selling InterCity to the private sector. It says that the government's insistence that InterCity should deliver a rate of return on its assets of 2.5 per cent a year has led to a steady erosion of services since 1982. A private sector owner, however, would require a far higher rate of return than this, the document says, leading to sharp cuts in peripheral services. It concludes that the lightly used sections of the InterCity network would be ruthlessly pruned, leaving them as branch lines with connecting services into the mainline network. Victims would almost certainly include the Aberdeen and Inverness lines in Scotland, points west of Cardiff in south Wales, and the Crewe-Holyhead line in north Wales. In England, it would mean the probable loss of InterCity links for points west of Plymouth in the south-west, for Worcester and Hereford in the West Midlands, and for branches off the main InterCity network to places such as Blackpool in the north-west and Hull, Lincoln and Grimsby in the north-east. The paper also questions whether a private sector owner would have the resources to fund BR's planned Pounds 750m upgrading of the west coast main line from London Euston to the West Midlands, the north and Scotland. Mr Rifkind is expected to produce his white paper on the privatisation of BR later this month, although the date may slip into February. Yesterday he said in an interview on BBC Radio Scotland: 'British Rail is a monopoly and some of its staff, possibly including the person who wrote this report, would like to keep it as a monopoly and not allow anybody else to run rail services. That's not my approach.'</p>

			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Gardening: Plant of the Week Alstroemeria Ligtu hybrids A beautiful race of herbaceous plants originally occurring from an accidental cross between alstromeria ligtu and A Haemantha. They produce, on 3ft stems, clusters of small, lily-like flowers in various shades of pink, salmon and orange. They grow from rather fleshy roots which, when established, run about fairly freely though not sufficiently so to become a nuisance as the common, orange flowered A Aurantiaca frequently does. They are best raised from seed in pots in spring, over-wintered in a frame or cool greenhouse and planted outdoors the following spring in good, well-drained soil and a sunny position. The roots can be protected in winter with a covering of peat or coir.</p>

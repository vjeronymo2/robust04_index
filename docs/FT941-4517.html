			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1994 - Business Briefing (15): The groupware revolution - Era of the 'empowered team' - Groupware could redeem the broken promises of 1980s office automation Ten years ago we were being promised the prospect of a paperless office. So much for that: 10 years later various survey reports (supplied on paper) show that 10,000 filing cabinets are delivered to UK offices every day, only five per cent of business documents are held on computers and that people spend four to six weeks a year looking for the other 95 per cent. Spending on office automation increased seven-fold between 1980 and 1990, yet office productivity rose by a meagre one per cent. Enter groupware, an ill-defined set of software packages which will nonetheless generate a market worth Dollars 2.5bn in products, consultancy and training in Europe and the US this year, according to a 300-page report on this market by research firm Ovum. Groupware has evolved from electronic mail and from the 1980s attempts at office automation to support office workers at all levels. Whereas early office automation focused on word processing, groupware aims to help people work together through communication with each other and through access to shared information, whether they are processing invoices, involved in a major engineering project or discussing corporate strategy. Several related types of products have been identified as lining up under the groupware banner. Communication with or through a shared system, for example electronic mail, is fundamental to all applications. As the Ovum report puts it: 'E-mail is the mother of groupware.' The automatic storage and retrieval of document images by any number of people at the same time is a desirable part of many applications: incoming correspondence, forms, drawings and other documents which cannot be keyed in through word processor systems are scanned in to be held on disc and called to a screen in seconds rather than hunted down in a filing cabinet or on someone's desk. Work flow management software, a late 1980s development of document image processing, usually refers to systems which manage document handling tasks carried out by clerical staff. Case studies in this issue of Software At Work show how work flow management can transform the way whole departments work, bringing big increases in efficiency and making work more interesting. Features variously described as information sharing, electronic conferencing and task management also fall under the groupware heading. At the simplest level there are bulletin board systems, which allow users to leave comments and queries for inspection and response by others. A development of this is the production of a document such as a corporate strategy, possibly controlled by one or two people, to which others can add their comments. Our Unipart case study (see page 14) shows how this can be taken even further to become a key part in the management of big projects. Other software in the broad category of groupware includes specialist products such as shared diaries and meetings schedulers. The Software At Work case studies reveal almost unbounded enthusiasm for groupware among users who in some cases are pushing such products to their limits, running widely differing applications from the same product. Software packages starting at less than Pounds 400 are forming the basis for the entire way some companies are organised and work. 'The enthusiasts are fervently committed to the idea that groupware offers an entirely new and even revolutionary approach to IT support for white-collar work,' says Ms Rose Lockwood, senior consultant at Ovum. 'At the other extreme, sceptics believe groupware is little more than a marketing strategy for a motley collection of products which are being repositioned by software vendors.' But she adds, 'We believe the enthusiasts are nearer the mark.' The research firm, Business Intelligence, which is also producing a hefty report on introducing and using groupware, says the combination of products covers the four main tasks that people perform in offices: finding information, using information, communicating with others and attending meetings. Groupware in the form of e-mail and conferencing eliminates the frustration and time wasting of trying to contact someone by telephone when the person is out or not answering or engaged. Document image processing, work flow management and conferencing enable people to discuss issues when convenient to them individually and without attending meetings. As our case studies show, groupware can cut the number of meetings and make those which are actually held more productive. Communications and access to documents improve the ability to use information. As Business Intelligence director Mr Ian Meiklejohn puts it: 'Stand-alone PCs provide useful tools such as spreadsheets and word processing packages, but a significant amount of management work involves input from several sources. The ability to share the document and work with it in a team is a considerable benefit over the benefits delivered by stand-alone PCs.' There are great hopes that while the office automation systems of the early 1980s failed to live up to their full promise, suppliers and users will get it right with groupware. This confidence stems from two developments. First, the technology is now relatively cheap, offers good performance and is widely used by people of all levels. Personal computer systems are quite attractive to users these days and high-capacity communications through the emerging ISDN digital services means pictures, voice and video can be transmitted from one screen to another. Indeed, Mr John Williams, UK work flow marketing manager at Digital Equipment, believes that 'there is probably enough technology on our desks already to support everything we want to do.' Ian Meiklejohn at Business Intelligence backs this view by pointing to surveys which show that more personal computers will be attached to networks this year than were installed in 1989. Research firm IDC says the number of electronic mailboxes on public systems will grow from 4.9m in 1991 to a massive 38m in 1996. The conclusion is that many individual users are ready for groupware, both psychologically and technically. The second reason for the confidence in groupware is that it fits in with the way businesses are re-organising themselves - 'it is clear that the empowered team is becoming a much more important part of the corporation,' says Ian Meiklejohn. He defines an empowered team as one which has the authority to make decisions to achieve a given task - 'if empowered teams are to work effectively they must have much better tools for sharing and using information,' he says. 'Groupware provides that set of tools.' This issue leads to a note of caution from Mr Meiklejohn and others - 'groupware could fail to deliver productivity improvements unless it is accompanied by a critical approach to business re-engineering,' he adds. 'It's not that groupware makes business re-engineering possible, although it certainly helps, but rather that unless business processes are rethought, groupware may deliver no more than mini- and mainframe-based office automation has done in the past.' Rose Lockwood at Ovum agrees and adds that any expansion of local area networks should now be done with groupware in mind: 'Many users have implemented groupware in an ad hoc way, leaving most decisions about what systems are developed and how they are administered up to end-users. This is dangerous and likely to lead to the same kind of dysfunctions that have dogged the desk-top world for a decade.' The Ovum report, Groupware: Market Strategies: details on 071-255 2670.

			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Clothing trade deficit 'at peak' BRITAIN'S trade deficit in clothing and textiles reached a record Pounds 3.8bn in 1992, almost one third of the total trade deficit, a report says today. Imports rose 7 per cent to Pounds 8.6bn as overseas manufacturers took advantage of the strength of sterling before it left the European exchange rate mechanism in September, says the report from the Apparel Knitting and Textiles Alliance, the industry body. The strongest rise in imports was in clothing - 18 per cent up in the final quarter compared with 1991. But the orders for those deliveries were placed before sterling's fall. Exports rose more slowly than imports but nevertheless reached a record of Pounds 4.8bn, up 6 per cent on 1991. Germany remains the biggest market for UK clothing and textiles with sales of Pounds 580m, slightly lower than in 1991. The report was optimistic on the long-term effects of the weakness of sterling. 'UK producers' scope for import substitution has improved, and there is potential for further increases in exports once overseas markets have recovered from recession,' it said. Clothing sales will recover more quickly than general consumer spending, says a report published today by the Economist Intelligence Unit. The recovery will push sales growth to 3.6 per cent in 1995, the report says. Trends in Textile and Clothing Trade 1992. AKT, 7 Swallow Place, Oxford Circus, London W1R 7AA. Pounds 40.

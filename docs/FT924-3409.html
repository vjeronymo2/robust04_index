			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Faber Prest expands by 53% to near Pounds 5m A REDUCTION in cost levels and the sale of loss-making businesses helped Faber Prest, the industrial and distribution services company, report a 53 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the year ended September 30. Profits increased from Pounds 3.14m to Pounds 4.8m, on reduced sales of Pounds 66.1m (Pounds 76.7m), and were struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 457,000 (Pounds 1.7m) relating to the loss from a disposal and continuing legal fees from proceedings in the US. Mr Roger Feaviour, who was brought in two years ago as chief executive, has refocused the group around three core businesses; industrial services, transport distribution and car retailing. Two new executives have been recruited to run the first two businesses, which the group hopes to expand. Mr Ron Woodworth, who was a manager at Trafalgar House's Davy Corporation, and Mr Len Minnikin, who worked for the National Freight Corporation, are heading up industrial services and transport distribution respectively. A group of smaller businesses, including truck franchises and heavy engineering, which Mr Feaviour said were 'losing money handsomely' were sold for about Pounds 2m. The divestments, along with a Pounds 500,000 reduction in working capital to Pounds 3.5m, helped reduce borrowings by Pounds 5.5m to Pounds 4m, representing gearing of 20 per cent (53 per cent). Industrial services, which takes the metal out of slag for steel producers, reported a 13 per cent decline in operating profits, from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 2.9m. Distribution, which provides services to the UK industry, reported a 36 per cent increase in operating profits, from Pounds 1.48m to Pounds 2.02m, working from one central site instead of three. Car retailing produced profits in line with last year at Pounds 362,000 (Pounds 366,000). Earnings per share increased to 36p (28.83p). The final dividend rises to 7.7p (4.3p) making a total of 12p (8.6p). COMMENT A comparison with last year's figures was always going to flatter Faber Prest given that reorganisation costs were taken through 1991's profit and loss account. That said, tight financial controls and reduced cost levels are making the desired impact. The group's brokers are forecasting that next year's pre-tax profits will rise to Pounds 5m, giving earnings per share of 33.5. This puts the shares, up 15p to 345p, on a prospective multiple of about 10, a significant discount to the market. The stock's illiquidity remains a problem. There is nothing Mr Feaviour would like more than for the Prest family, which controls 37 per cent of the group, to sell some shares to help him attract new investors.</p>

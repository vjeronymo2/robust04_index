Speaking at a UN Security Council session on Bosnia, France  Ambassador to the United Nations, Jean-Bernard Merimee, said  "the conflict has now reached a turning point, which we should  all be aware of."    Interpreting the NATO decision on Bosnia adopted on February  9, the ambassador said the decision essentially aimed to have  heavy weapons placed under UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR)  control within 10 days, and "those weapons positions that had  not been withdrawn would be subject to air strikes."    He said the decision had the sole aim of providing the  United  Nations with the means of implementing the decisions of the  Security Council.    The first priority, he said, was to lift the siege of  Sarajevo, begin its demilitarization and progress towards  placing that city under temporary UN administration.    The ambassador said France shared the objective put forward  by Russia on placing Sarajevo under UN administration, but that  must not interfere with the recent NATO decision.    However, he said, his government was fully prepared to  support all efforts to achieve peace through negotiations, and  "the time has come for us all to come out in favor of peace."</p>

			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Emerging Markets: Damming the flood of Indian issues - The Emerging Investor India's Ministry of Finance is imposing informal restrictions on Indian companies which want to raise funds in the international capital markets, in order to slow down the deluge of international equity and convertible bond issues flooding onto the market. Investment bankers and potential borrowers have been told that permission for new issues will probably be restricted to companies which are either heavily export-oriented, or involved in infrastructure projects - at least in the period to the end of March. In addition, ministry officials said they may introduce revised application procedures to control the subsequent flow of new issues. 'We have over 120 applications for GDRs (global depositary receipts) and euro-issues pending, and it would be sensible on anybody's part to examine them more closely before granting permission,' admits Mr NK Singh, a senior official in the Ministry of Finance. 'We are trying to orchestrate some sequencing, so that companies with strong balance sheets and good track records are given preference over indifferent ones. We also want to ensure that there is no bunching of issues - it is the companies which stand to gain by this,' he added. Last week the ministry gave permission for two big GDR issues - a Dollars 150m (Pounds 103m) offering for Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation (CESC), and a Dollars 100m deal for the Mafatlal group, the Bombay-based textiles and petrochemicals manufacturer. With the liberalisation and deregulation of the Indian economy under Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao, Indian companies have enjoyed a new-found freedom to raise funds abroad. Many are keen to do so in order to pay down domestic debt - on which they commonly pay interest of some 18 to 19 per cent - or to finance expansion of their existing operations. Mr Roddy Sale of Jardine Fleming India Securities, points out that 'there are about a hundred companies which want to do international equity offerings: whereas in the domestic market they commonly have to issue (shares) at a discount to the stock price, with an international equity offering they can do it at a premium (to the underlying share price)'. Barely a week goes by without one of India's bigger companies announcing a new international equity or equity-linked offering. So far this year, eight companies have tapped international investors for a total of Dollars 860m with issues of GDRs or convertible bonds, according to figures compiled by Euromoney Bondware. Issuers include names such as Industrial Credit &amp; Investment Corporation of India (ICICI), Great Eastern Shipping, Indian Rayon &amp; Industries, and Videocon International. Issuance so far this year has nearly reached the level seen in the whole of 1993 when new issues - from companies such as Reliance Industries, Sterlite Industries, and Essar Gujarat - amounted to nearly Dollars 900m. The ministry of finance is concerned that the flood of new international equity offerings could have a detrimental effect on the Rupee's exchange rate, triggered by the inflow of dollars. It does not want the Rupee to appreciate against the dollar as this would make India's exporters less competitive internationally. Mr David Maslin, economist at Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, points out that the Reserve Bank of India has been buying dollars to stabilise the Rupee over recent months. More cynical observers of the Indian market point out that the ministry's new 'slowdown' measures may help to smooth the path for the Dollars 500m international share offering from Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited (VSNL), the government-owned overseas telecommunications network, due later this month. The VSNL issue is critical to the government as 70 per cent of the funds will be used to finance the department of telecom's expansion programme. The government is particularly encouraged by the success of equity issues by private Indian companies, and plans to raise money on the international capital markets for many of the public sector companies. However, it is concerned that indiscriminate borrowing could spoil the conditions for subsequent issues, especially of government-owned corporations that have embarked on privatisation programmes. Officials say they are considering allowing up to three international issues every month to ensure a steady inflow of between Dollars 1bn and Dollars 2bn a year. Ministry officials said the government may also stipulate that proceeds from international offering be used solely to finance capital expenditure or repayments of high-cost borrowing or for working capital needs. In addition, the ministry may impose a ceiling on borrowing. Many of the international offerings by Indian companies have been hailed a success by investment bankers and fund managers. While the early, pioneering issues were launched at a discount to the underlying share price, subsequent issues were launched at a premium and performed relatively well thereafter. The heavy new supply has been snapped up by specialist Indian funds - emerging market funds - as well as more diversified funds, investment bankers say. International investors who want to invest directly in the stock market have to apply to be Foreign Institutional Investors. While the domestic market route provides investors with a far wider array of stocks - there are about 7,000 companies listed on India's various exchanges - the settlement procedures are cumbersome and subject to long delays. Many investors prefer to take the international equity route: 'The advantage of this is the liquidity - it is easier to accumulate and unwind positions, and settlement is less of a worry,' says one US-based fund manager. 'GDRs are a good place to park your funds because the settlement is very quick and there is potential premium expansion,' says Mr Tristan Clube, a director of the Indian Opportunities Fund, launched last year by Martin Currie Investment Management. Although the fund invests predominantly in the domestic stock markets, it has bought shares in four or five of the recent international equity offerings. The success of these international issues reflects the huge amount of money which has been invested in emerging markets generally. 'The success of these issues is driven by asset allocaters and because most people can't invest directly.' says Mr Clube. However, some warn that if the tidal wave of new issues continues, the market could suffer from 'investor fatigue'. Mr Peter Bassett, head of emerging market investment at Henderson Administration Group, a London-based fund management group, says: 'We are delighted to see a new equity market open up, but we are having to be selective now: I don't think the market is being well served by the glut of issues because this is a new area and we need time to digest'.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                  TEN BEST PERFORMING STOCKS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                        Friday     Week on week change Stock                      Country   dollar close   Dollar  per cent  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Telesp (pfd)               Brazil      0.5529       0.1383   33.36 Usiminas                   Brazil      0.0014       0.0003   29.68 Banco Bradesco             Brazil      0.0206       0.0043   26.00 Sadia Concordia Industria  (Pfd)                     Brazil      0.0109       0.0021   23.60 CIA Souza Cruz Industria   Brazil      9.0309       1.4466   19.07 TPI Polene                 Thailand    8.2482       1.2852   18.46 Copene                     Brazil      0.5492       0.0840   18.06 White Martins              Brazil      0.0003       0.0000   18.04 Filinvest Land             Philippines 0.4900       0.0734   17.60 Electrobras (Pfd)          Brazil      0.2967       0.0439   17.37  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Baring Securities  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

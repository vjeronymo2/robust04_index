			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PARENTS PROTEST SCHOOL CLOSURE PLAN  </P> <P> About 500 angry parents packed a high school gymnasium Thursday night to  challenge an Ocean View School District proposal to close three elementary  schools as a cost-cutting measure.  </P> <P> The district's Master Planning Committee of Eleven, which has recommended  closing Golden View, Haven View and Lake View schools, listened as parents gave  impassioned speeches pleading for their children's schools to remain open.  </P> <P> Parents argued that the committee should consider what programs are available  at the schools and other factors, rather than focusing on low enrollment -- the  chief reason the committee has cited in recommending the closures.  </P> <P> "This looks to me to be a Band-Aid solution to a problem that probably requires  surgery," said Debbi Wise, mother of a Golden View first-grader.  </P> <P> The Committee of Eleven, elected from among a 40-member group of parents,  administration officials, teachers and other district employees, recommended  this week that the district close the schools to slice $750,000 from its budget  deficit. The district, whose student enrollment stabilized this year after  steadily dropping the previous 14 years, faces a shortfall of $1.3 million to  $1.8 million, Supt. Monte McMurray said.  </P> <P> Golden View parents, wearing red armbands -- the school's colors are red and  gold -- appeared to make up the largest group of parents in attendance Thursday  night.  </P> <P> Eileen Mori, a Golden View parent and committee member opposed to the plan,  unveiled an alternative proposal to close only Haven View and Lake View and  make budget cuts elsewhere in the district.  </P> <P> Other parents opposed the closure plan because it would change boundaries and  force their children to switch schools next year.  </P> <P> The advisory committee targeted the three schools for closure because  attendance is well below the average for Orange County K-6 schools. According  to a March enrollment report, 340 students attend Haven View, Golden View has  350 students and Lake View has 395. The county average is 420, McMurray said.  </P> <P> The plan would also change Crest View, now a K-8 school, to a K-6 school to  help accommodate students from the closed schools. It would also expand busing  and alter the boundaries at Crest View, Mesa View, Spring View, Village View  and Westmont schools.  </P> <P> The school board is scheduled to hold public hearings on June 4 and 6,  tentatively planned to take place in the Ocean View High School gymnasium, and  a study session on June 5 before deciding on the committee's recommendation.  Trustees plan to make their decision following the June 6 hearing.  </P></p>

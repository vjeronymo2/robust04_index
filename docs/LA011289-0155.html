			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COOK IT LIGHT: CHICKEN RECIPE CUTS FAT WITHOUT LOSING FLAVOR  </P> <P> DEAR JEANNE: I've enclosed one of my favorite recipes for revision. It's  delicious, but I think a few of the calories could be cut.  </P> <P>  -- SHARON, Olympia, Wash.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CHICKEN PARISIENNE  </P> <P> 2 whole chicken breasts, halved  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons butter  </P> <P> 1 small onion, chopped  </P> <P> 1 cup sliced mushrooms  </P> <P> 1 (10 3/4-ounce) can cream of chicken soup  </P> <P> 1 cup sour cream  </P> <P> 1/2 cup Sherry  </P> <P> Season breasts with salt and pepper. Melt butter in skillet. Brown chicken on  both sides. Arrange chicken, onion and mushrooms in baking dish. Combine soup,  sour cream and Sherry in separate bowl. Pour over chicken. Bake at 400 degrees  40 to 50 minutes. Makes 4 servings.  </P> <P> Note: Serve with rice.  </P> <P> DEAR SHARON: My revision of your recipe will require just a little more work on  your part, but the end result will be just as tasty and much better for you.  </P> <P> I was able to achieve a substantial reduction in the calories and cut the  cholesterol and fat by about half simply by making the recipe with homemade  cream soup instead of canned. This also results in a huge reduction in sodium  and eliminates the additives many canned soups contain.  </P> <P> By substituting margarine for the butter and by reducing the amount used, fat  and cholesterol are further reduced. Yogurt works beautifully in place of the  sour cream; and you can lower the calories, cholesterol and sodium in my  revision even further by simply removing the skin of the chicken before you  cook it. In fact, per serving you can save about 80 calories, 10 milligrams  cholesterol and another 10 grams of fat if you cook the chicken with the skin  removed.  </P> <P> You will notice a big difference in my revised casserole when it cools down --  no more thick layer of congealed fat covering the top.  </P> <P>  -- JEANNE  </P> <P> </P> <P> LIGHT CHICKEN PARISIENNE  </P> <P> 4 teaspoons corn-oil margarine  </P> <P> 1/4 cup unbleached flour  </P> <P> 1 cup defatted chicken stock  </P> <P> 3/4 cup nonfat milk  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> Dash garlic powder  </P> <P> Freshly ground black pepper  </P> <P> 1/2 cup nonfat plain yogurt  </P> <P> 1/2 cup Sherry  </P> <P> 2 whole chicken breasts, halved  </P> <P> 1 small onion, chopped  </P> <P> 1 cup sliced mushrooms  </P> <P> Melt margarine in skillet.

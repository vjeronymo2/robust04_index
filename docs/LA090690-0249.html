			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PIMLICO FACES COIN TOSS FOR SUNDAY CARDS  </P> <P> For the first time in the five years of Maryland Million racing, the lineup of  some races Sunday at Pimlico Race Course may have to be decided by lot.  </P> <P> The races limited to horses sired by Maryland stallions are attracting more  business than usual.  </P> <P> Normally, oversubscribed races are divided. Because of tradition, certain  races, such as Triple Crown events, are not permitted to be divided. Dividing  Million Day races would be awkward and could reduce the purses.  </P> <P> Of the 10 races scheduled Sunday, with purses totaling more than $1 million,  four were oversubscribed after the pre-entry deadline of Aug. 23, when $500 had  to be paid for each pre-entry. Another $500 is required for each horse to  start.  </P> <P> Twenty-two 2-year-old fillies are still eligible for the $100,000 Maryland  Lassie, and 16 male 2-year-olds were pre-entered for the $100,000 Crown Central  Nursery.  </P> <P> Fifteen were pre-entered for the $100,000 Maryland Turf race for 3-year-olds,  and 22 were pre-entered for the $50,000 Mercedes-Benz Handicap, a race for  horses that have competed in claiming events.  </P> <P> Only 12 can start in the Lassie, Nursery and Turf. The maximum for the  Mercedes-Benz is 14. Maximums are determined by the width of the track at the  starting points.  </P> <P> If horses are excluded at entry-time Friday, their owners will be returned  their pre-entry fees.  </P></p>

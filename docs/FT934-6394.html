			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Technology: People still required - Safety in Travel Even with the best air safety technology in the world, human skills will remain at a premium. Powerful number-crunching computer systems will take much of the complicated routine out of navigation and air traffic control and make it easier to deal with unexpected and risky incidents, but highly trained people will still be needed to fly and control the aircraft. Computers and sophisticated electronics cannot do everything, however much they can simplify the business of taking off, flying and landing. They cannot, for example, deal with sudden and unexplained, engine or fuselage failures which need human ability to land crippled aircraft and save lives. Nor can they be a comforting substitute in passengers' minds for the physical presence of a crew, even if all is well. 'Airline passengers are unlikely in the foreseeable future to trust themselves to a fully automatic aircraft,' Charles Billings, a US safety expert, told a recent conference in London. 'Would you?' Billings, from the cognitive systems engineering laboratory at Ohio State University, said thousands of people each day placed their faith in urban, rapid transit systems. However, these run under much tighter constraints than are possible in aviation. 'You cannot simply stop the airplane when something goes wrong in flight.' Also, pilots and air traffic controllers were responsible by law for flight safety. 'This responsibility cannot be abrogated, even though automated devices may remove some of the authority formerly possessed by these human operators.' Thus he added: 'We believe that if pilots and controllers are to be held responsible for system safety, they must retain the authority necessary to command and control the system.' That is what the pilots think, too. Broadly, pilots support the introduction of sophisticated navigation systems such as automatic dependent surveillance (ADS), says James Gaskell, vice-chairman of the air traffic services study group at the British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa). But they are wary of too rapid a reduction of the present separation limits such as those applying over the busy North Atlantic, where more than 200 aircraft are in the air at peak times. Both Balpa and the international pilots' federation want a co-ordinated introduction in accordance with proper rules. 'It is surprising how busy the Atlantic is at times,' adds Gaskell. 'You can sit at night and see the lights of other aircraft above and below. It (ADS) does need to be treated very carefully.' Thus Balpa would like to see ADS used initially at the current separation levels, with these then gradually being decreased as the system proves its worth. Because aircraft are already so reliable and automated, some 75 per cent of accidents have a human cause, Phil Hogge, British Airways' general manager for flight operational services, told the conference which was organised by the UK's parliamentary advisory council for transport safety. These days, errors tend to stem from incorrect loading of navigational information into the on-board computer rather than wrong calculations, he said. 'Therefore, the subject that requires most attention is this whole area of why people make mistakes.' Apart from the work of psychologists, government agencies and manufacturers in designing effective warning systems and controls, BA also relies on its own intensive analysis of incidents - including use of its computerised Basis (BA safety information system) database - and the human factors involved. The airline uses this information to help training and improve procedures. Much of the automation that pilots and controllers have become used to, said Billings, 'is too often brittle instead of resilient, clumsy instead of facile and, above all, complex instead of simple.' But the new systems, he noted, were now starting to provide more help and information where it was most needed - such as after engine failures by compensating for uneven power thrust - and not just during routine flight. 'The means for at least semi-automatic air traffic control, as well as flight, are at hand.' But Billings added: 'It is the human operators, not the computers, that remain responsible for safety.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Reports by </F> Diplomatic Correspondents Dmitry Voskoboinikov, Igor Porshnev,  Vitaly Trubetskoi and others]    [Text] The Wednesday [12 January] extraordinary session of  the Armenian parliament has confirmed the privatization program  and program of denationalization of state enterprises and  uncompleted constructions sites. As many as 125 of 156 deputies  have voted for this decision.    Addressing the session, President Levon Ter-Petrosian, who  was the initiator of this extraordinary session, expressed  dissatisfaction with the fact that Armenia is far behind in the  privatization process. In his words, until now Armenia has made  only two serious steps in this direction, namely privatization  of land and housing.    "It's a shame to call privatization what we are discussing  now because these are just those first elementary moves which  had to be made much earlier. These moves don't even have any  connection with the economic policy," underlined Ter-Petrosian.  As he said, "the private sector always existed and played a  certain role in the sphere of the economy in normal communist  states, for example, in the previous German Democratic Republic,  Hungary, or China."    The president believes that the third serious step to be  made  in the near term should provide for issuance of cash totalling  20% of industrial enterprises'cost value to their workers. He  also deems it necessary to expand lists of sites destined for  privatization.    In his interview with Interfax Ter-Petrosian pointed out  that  Armenia plans to carry out "a widescale privatization of small  sites" and this, to quote Ter-Petrosian, must "give a noticeable  stimulus to the republic's economic life."    IF Note: According to the program confirmed by the  parliament, 8,913 sites will be privatized in 1994, 61% of which  are uncompleted construction sites, agricultural sites, state  trade enterprises, and catering and servicing enterprises. In  1995-1996, the percent of these sites is to grow to 74%. Small  enterprises are the first to be privatized (there are 75% of  them in the republic), with the number of workers at 80% of  these enterprises not exceeding 5 people.</p>

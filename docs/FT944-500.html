			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Rocked by tremors but still reassured: Though reinsurers claim risk is growing, cover for disasters is still available, says Ralph Atkins Prophets of doom have new friends as the year ends. As brokers this week hurry to complete January insurance policy renewals, there are warnings about the risks being borne by the world's reinsurers - the companies that sell protection against large-scale losses to insurance companies. Last month, Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurer, announced that it was prepared to reduce or terminate business connections where risks were greater than were justified by premiums. It believes there is a trend towards increasingly costly catastrophes. In 1993, there were 600 big natural disasters worldwide generating overall losses of Dollars 50bn. Rival reinsurer Swiss Re has published a provocative report warning that changes in weather patterns could lead to even greater catastrophes. 'All extreme weather catastrophes are basically the result of human systems failing to adjust to 'possible' local weather patterns,' the report argues. 'Now this peril is being dramatically intensified. 'Human intervention in the natural climatic system could accelerate global climatic change to such an extent that society might no longer be able to adapt quickly enough.' Swiss Re accepts that the impact of global warning on the climate is not fully understood. But even if the number of catastrophes is not increasing, the insured loss is rising, it says. A decade ago, for example, few living in Taiwan or the Philippines would have taken out insurance policies. That is now changing. Some idea of the risks insurers face comes from Standard &amp; Poor's, the rating agency. Its figures show that the world's 111 largest reinsurers excluding Lloyd's of London had 'shareholders funds' (a measure of the capital invested and surplus funds retained after taking account of liabilities) totalling Dollars 36.7bn in 1992. That was the last year for which figures are available. That might appear a comfortable financial cushion. But the Los Angeles earthquake in January, which is estimated to have caused Dollars 30bn of damage, illustrates how it might disappear. Reinsurers escaped relatively lightly on that occasion, because the insured losses from the 'Northridge' earthquake were only about Dollars 10bn-Dollars 12bn, of which they would have underwritten only a part. A stronger earthquake closer to a main population centre could have resulted in much higher costs - still more so if a greater proportion of properties had been insured. Policy claims from one event of, say, Dollars 50bn might force many insurers or reinsurers out of business. It might be expected that such grim speculation would place constraints on the amount of catastrophe cover available and lead to premiums rising rapidly. This has not happened this year for two reasons. First, in spite of the gloom spread by many reinsurers, the amount of business they are able to underwrite has increased. This is due largely to the flow of funds into new property/catastrophe reinsurance companies in Bermuda. Attracted by the favourable tax and regulatory regime, investment in the island's international insurers and reinsurers increased by Dollars 7bn last year, about half into nine new catastrophe reinsurance companies. The second reason why catastrophe cover remains readily available at reasonable prices is that the more cataclysmic projections of reinsurers have not radically altered the way premiums are set. 'It is only people in universities who worry about global warming,' says one reinsurance executive. 'When it comes to pricing, people look at what has happened in the past and at market forces: when people want more cover, perhaps after an incident, prices go up. As you get further away from a loss, people's memories shorten.' This produces a roller-coaster cycle of price rises and falls. In recent years, for example, some reinsurance premiums have doubled or tripled as companies have sought to make up for poor underwriting results earlier in the decade. This year there have been relatively few natural catastrophes, so there is little pressure to raise rates. With the added capacity in Bermuda, reinsurance brokers say that premium cuts in excess of 10 per cent are possible. Some insurance specialists even say the pessimism of European reinsurance companies in particular has been deliberately overdone to encourage higher prices. There is, however, a longer-term trend towards greater precision in risk assessment on the part of reinsurers. One sign is the increasing use of meteorologists, geologists and computer software to pinpoint and quantify risks. 'Five years ago many insurance companies were unable accurately to assess their exposure from a catastrophe event. Now they are much more careful about the risks they are carrying,' says Mr John Pelly, chairman of non-marine reinsurance at broker Willis Faber &amp; Dumas. Another significant trend has been a change in the type of policies reinsurance companies provide. Previously, reinsurers issued 'proportional' policies, in which they underwrote an agreed percentage of the risk borne by the insurance company without any limits on total claims. Now they prefer to provide 'non-proportional' policies, in which they agree to underwrite an agreed chunk of the risk borne by the direct insurer. These policies have minimum levels for claims, below which the reinsurer pays nothing, and upper limits that cap the reinsurers' total exposure. The effect of this change - and the increased focus on rigorous scientific analysis - has been to increase the control reinsurers exercise over their risks. One result is that insurance policyholders may have to bear a greater share of the risk, paying the first part of any claim or taking responsibility for the top slice. Another is that premiums paid by companies and individuals will rise still higher on the worst risks. Insurers, however, find it difficult to convince consumers that it matters to them whether reinsurance companies are financially safe. Mr Felix Kloman, editor of the US publication, Risk Management Reports, says: 'The insurance industry is held in very low esteem in the minds of the public . . . The security of the insurer or reinsurer has got to be right up the (priority) list.' The evidence of the current renewal season suggests that this is not yet happening. Buyers of catastrophe reinsurance can still beat prices down. To keep upward pressure on premiums, reinsurers may have to rely largely on apocalyptic warnings. That is, until the next large-scale disaster strikes.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          COSTLY CATASTROPHES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                      Economic    Insured                                                       losses      losses                                                      (Dollars   (Dollars Year   Event                       Region    Deaths      m)           m)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1992   Hurricane Andrew                 US      74    30,000     16,500 1990   Winter gales                 Europe     230    15,000     10,000 1991   Floods                     PR China   3,074    15,000        410 1988   Earthquake                  Armenia  25,000    14,000          0 1994   LA earthquake                    US      59    30,000     10,000 1993   Floods                           US      41    12,000      1,000 1989   Hurricane Hugo         Caribbean US      61     9,000      4,500 1990   Earthquake                     Iran  40,000     7,000        100 1991   Typhoon Mireille              Japan      62     6,000      5,200 1989   Earthquake San Francisco         US      68     6,000        900  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Munich Re  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

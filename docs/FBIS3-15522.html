			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ruslan Khasbulatov by correspondent Lucio </F> Gambacorta, in Moscow; Khasbulatov in Russian with superimposed  Italian translation; date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Gambacorta] Are you happy with the amnesty?    [Khasbulatov] Of course, it is not a pleasant experience to  be in prison. However, they would have released me soon in any  case, partly because of my health, but above all because the  judges could not find a shred of evidence against me.    [Gambacorta] President Yeltsin maintains ...    [Khasbulatov, interrupting] But which president? He was  elected president under the old Constitution, which he himself  regards as being undemocratic and to be annulled. However, this  Constitution is still better than the one which he had passed in  December without allowing the people to discuss it. I do not  believe that the 20th century has yet seen a worse constitution.    [Gambacorta] Boris Yeltsin maintains that he is in total  control of the situation. What do you think about this?    [Khasbulatov] I only say that in his message to the chambers  Boris Nikolayevich accepted 99 percent of the proposals which we  made three years ago. He accepted our diplomacy and gave in to  the extent that he reduced us to a satellite state. Suddenly we  find ourselves once again a great power. In Russia, if  Yeltsin's supporters want to, they can start a new civil war,  like the one in October which had a death toll of 1,500 and not  the 150 which the government maintains. Must we perhaps forget  everything? This is fascism, and the people have realized this.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, Feb 16 (CTK) -- Slovak Finance Minister  Julius Toth will make a statement in the near future confirming  that the Slovak customs authorities recognize quality  certificates issued in the Czech Republic as they did before  February 11, when the Slovak measure under which all food  exporters, including Czechs, were required to produce a quality  certificate at the Slovak border, came into effect.    This was announced at a news conference of Slovak Economics  Minister Jan Ducky and chairman of the Council of the  Czech-Slovak Customs Union following its extraordinary session  today. The conference was attended by six Czech and Slovak  ministers.    Both sides will meet before March 31 to iron out an  agreement  of the individual criteria which Slovak quality certificates  must meet in the Czech Republic, and vice versa.    The ministers said only one percent of their countries'  mutual trade still needed to be coordinated at the future  meeting, because for the other 99 percent of goods the  certificate question had already been resolved.    The Czech representatives at the meeting had requested the  Slovak Customs Administration reconsider its decision to require  the certification of all imported goods by domestic inspectors.  Czech Agriculture Minister Josef Lux informed reporters of the  Czech contingents' intentions before the meeting.</p>

Acquisition of this site and construction of this facility will provide one of three campuses planned to allow FDA to consolidate its facilities. FDA is located in three buildings within the District of Columbia and 35 buildings in Maryland. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In March 1994, GSA advertised for expressions of interest from potential offerors to provide the required site. The site is to accommodate the construction of a campus for the Headquarters of the Food and Drug Administration. The list of sites that will be considered as alternatives in the EIS are as follows (not listed in order of preference): <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;The Clarksburg Triangle Site <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Approximately 535 acres in Clarksburg, Maryland, (bounded by Interstate 270, Route 121/Clarksburg Road, and Old Baltimore Road). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;The King Farm Site <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Approximately 355 acres in the vicinity of Gaithersburg and Rockville, Maryland, (bounded by Route 355/Frederick Road, Shady Grove Road, Gude Drive and Interstate 270 at Piccard Drive). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;The Marriott/Milestone Site <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Approximately 443 acres in Germantown, Maryland, (bounded by Interstate 270, Route 118/Germantown Road, and Route 355/Frederick Road). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;The National Geographic Site <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Approximately 380 acres in Gaithersburg, Maryland, (bounded by Route 28/Darnestown Road, Great Seneca Highway, Route 124/Quince Orchard Road, and Muddy Branch Road). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EIS will focus on the Government's programmatic needs and potential short and long-term impacts that may result from new construction. The consulting firms of Leo A. Daly and Greenhorne &amp; O'Mara have been retained to prepare the draft and final EIS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GSA will initiate a scoping process for the purpose of determining the scope of issues to be addressed and for identifying the significant issues related to this proposed action. A public scoping meeting will be held on May 16, 1994, at 7 p.m. at Rockville High School, 2100 Baltimore Road, Rockville Maryland. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A short, formal presentation will precede the request for public comments. GSA and FDA representatives will be available at this meeting to receive comments from the public regarding issues of concern. It is important that Federal, State, and County Agencies, interested individuals, and groups take this opportunity to identify environmental concerns and significant issues that should be addressed by the EIS. In the interest of available time, each speaker will be asked to limit their oral comments to five (5) minutes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agencies and the general public are also invited and encouraged to provide written comment in addition to, or in lieu of, comments at the public meeting. To be most helpful, scoping comments should clearly describe specific issues or topics which the commentator believes the EIS should address. Written statements concerning the alternatives should be postmarked no later than June 6, 1994, to Mr. Andrew Dempster, Planning Staff (WPL) room 7618, National Capital Region, General Services Administration, Room 7618, 7th and D Streets, SW, Washington, DC, 20407, Telephone (202)&hyph;708&hyph;5530. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: April 29, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Mr. Jack Finberg,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Acting Director, NCR Planning Staff (WPL). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;10673 Filed 5&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6820&hyph;23&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

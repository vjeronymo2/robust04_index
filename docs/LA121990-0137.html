			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE WRONG BONG IMPERILS BIG BEN TRADITION  </P> <P> Big Ben's chimes, which traditionally announce the queen's Christmas Day  message and ring in the New Year, might not make it onto BBC airwaves this time  around. Seems the main bell has lost its distinctive bong.  </P> <P> A decision has yet to be made, and some British Broadcasting Corp. officials  believe that it would be a big mistake to depart from tradition by banning the  bong this holiday season.  </P> <P> The chimes have traditionally been used on BBC airwaves as a lead-in to news  bulletins, but disappeared temporarily in March after cracks were found in the  hammer arm of the 132-year-old main bell -- Big Ben -- that sounds the hours.  </P> <P> The original Victorian hammer was removed and replaced with a new, $15,000  steel hammer.  </P> <P> But ever since the 13-ton bell went back into service in August, BBC executives  have been unenthusiastic, so much so that they have begun phasing the chimes  out of regular broadcasts.  </P> <P> "It just sounds wrong," said Simon Schute, the BBC's general manager of  operations and engineering, responsible for setting up microphones in the Big  Ben belfry, 334 steps above the street.  </P> <P> "I'm no expert on bells, but this one has a sort of curious start and finishes  sounding sort of small and clattery. It certainly doesn't sound rich and  important anymore," Schute said.  </P> <P> Britain's Independent Television News has solved the problem by continuing to  use a 1967 recording of Big Ben. But BBC executives won't hear of it.  </P> <P> "We shall either use the real thing or nothing at all," said John Breach,  presentation organizer of Radio 4, the BBC's flagship domestic channel.  </P> <P> Breach said listeners understood the reason for the change, but BBC executives  fear that the public may not be so patient with a change in a holiday tradition  that dates back to midnight, Dec. 31, 1923.  </P> <P> Every year since then, the live sounds from Big Ben have rung in the New Year  and introduced the monarch's speech on Christmas Day.  </P> <P> "We're still trying to decide what to do," Breach said.  </P></p>

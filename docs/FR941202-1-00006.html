			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 32(c) Disclosures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulation mirrors the disclosure requirements of section 129(a). The law requires creditors to disclose a monthly payment based on an interest rate cap required for consumer contracts by a provision in the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 (CEBA), which is implemented in &sect;226.30. The legislative history provides that in calculating the maximum payment based on the interest rate cap, creditors should assume the maximum possible increases in rates in the shortest possible timeframe. To ease compliance, proposed paragraph (c)(4) refers to &sect;226.30 rather than CEBA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 32(d) Limitations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 129 of the TILA prohibits high-rate, high-fee mortgage creditors from including several terms in their credit contracts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 32(d)(5) Rebates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 129(d) of the TILA restricts how creditors may calculate refunds of interest when a high-rate, high-fee mortgage loan is accelerated due to a consumer's default. The statute provides that creditors must calculate the refund by a method no less favorable than the actuarial method, as defined under section 933(d) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (HCDA). That section describes a method of allocating payments so that a payment is first applied to accumulated finance charges. Any remaining amount is applied to the unpaid balance of the amount financed. The effect of the actuarial method is to prohibit calculating refunds by the ``rule of 78s.'' The proposed amendment defines the actuarial method by statutory reference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 32(d)(6) Prepayment Penalties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 129(c) of the TILA generally bars creditors from including a prepayment penalty in a high-rate, high-fee mortgage contract. The statute includes as a prepayment penalty, refunds of unearned interest calculated less favorably than the actuarial method in HCDA's section 933(d). The proposed regulation likewise limits rebate calculations by a statutory reference to the HCDA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The legislative history notes that the ``actuarial method'' has been defined by some states, and that in some jurisdictions the actuarial method provides a refund that is greater than the refund received under the HCDA definition. The legislative history states that in those circumstances, creditors should continue to apply state law to determine if a refund is a prepayment penalty for a high-rate, high-fee mortgage. The legislative history also states that the reference to the HCDA is not intended to be exclusive, and that penalties based on a percentage of the outstanding balance or on the number of months of interest are also prohibited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 32(d)(7) Exception  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 129(c)(2) of the TILA allows creditors to provide for a penalty when a consumer prepays a high-rate, high-fee mortgage under narrowly drawn circumstances. The proposed amendment follows the statute, except that in discussing permissible refund calculation methods, the proposed amendment incorporates the heading of HCDA's section 933(b)_prohibiting the rule of 78s_rather than referring to the actuarial method.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 32(e) Prohibited Acts and Practices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 129(l)(2) of the TILA authorizes the Board to prohibit acts or practices in connection with mortgage loans that the Board finds to be unfair, deceptive or designed to evade the high-rate, high-fee mortgage rules. The Board also may prohibit acts or practices related to refinancing mortgage loans that the Board finds are associated with abusive lending practices or that are not in the borrower's interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board believes a study and hearing required by the Equity Protection Act will assist the Board in its determination of whether certain acts or practices should be prohibited. Section 157 of the Equity Protection Act requires the Board to conduct a study and make recommendations to the Congress regarding, in part, the adequacy of federal laws protecting consumers with open-end credit plans secured by the consumer's principal dwelling. The statutory timeframe for the study is eighteen months, beginning after the amendments are adopted. Section 158 of the Equity Protection Act requires the Board (in consultation with its Consumer Advisory Council) to conduct public hearings that examine home equity loans in the marketplace and the adequacy of federal laws (including the new rules affecting high-rate, high-fee mortgages and reverse mortgage transactions) in protecting consumers_particularly low-income consumers. The statute provides that the first hearing must be held prior to September 1997, and the Board contemplates the initial hearing will occur sometime in 1996, so that the impact of the new rules can be evaluated. Thus, the Board is not proposing to prohibit a particular act or practice at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

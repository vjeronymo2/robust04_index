			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tzvi Singer] </F>   [Text] Volunteers signing up for the Magen Avraham  [Abraham's Shield] operation -- the campaign aiming "to protect  Hebron from the danger of Jewish deportation and of Hebron's  surrender to the enemy" -- are asked to fill out a form which  includes a question on the possession of weapons. The form is  been currently distributed in Judaea and Samaria settlements.    The Magen Avraham operation, which aims to prevent the  evacuation of Hebron Jews, is organized by the right-wing bloc's  operational command. The command is headed by several  settlement activists, as well as right-wing activists living  inside the Green Line. In the past, the command played a  central role in organizing mass right-wing rallies against the  government.    The sign-up form, which was distributed among the attendants  of the mass rally in Qiryat Arba' yesterday, asks the potential  volunteers to state their IDF [Israel Defense Forces]  assignment, navigation skills, whether they are paramedics or  doctors, whether they have a driving license, and whether they  own a car, a cellular phone, a video camera.    The potential volunteer is asked how many kilometers he is  willing and able to walk, if required, and how many days he is  prepared to devote to the struggle. The spheres in which  activists can volunteer are the distribution of leaflets on road  junctions and in mailboxes, fund raising, poster pasting,  graphics, marketing, writing and editing, photography,  lecturing, and other areas.</p>

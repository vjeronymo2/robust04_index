			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Jump in lending suggests growing confidence SIGNS that confidence among businesses and consumers is improving were boosted yesterday by news that bank and building society lending roselast month. The Bank of England said lending by banks and building societies to the private and corporate sectors - M4 lending - grew by Pounds 5.1bn in the month. The sharp jump suggested an increase in building society loans for house purchases. Economists warned against reading too much into one month's figures, and said much of the growth was a rebound from March, when companies and individuals made repayments totalling Pounds 400m net. It was the first time since 1982 that repayments on bank and building society lending outstripped new loans. The modestly encouraging news from the Bank was backed by figures from the British Bankers' Association, the trade body for Britain's nine biggest banking groups. The figures showed that lending by the association's members to the private sector grew by Pounds 2.6bn last month, the largest rise since the statistics began a year ago. This increase followed a net repayment by the private sector of almost Pounds 1.75bn in March. According to the association's figures, lending to individuals for house buying grew by Pounds 402m compared with a rise of Pounds 197m in April last year. The figures also showed that consumers continued to repay debt. Last month consumers repaid a net Pounds 43m on personal loans including overdrafts, loans for cars, and credit card loans, compared with a rise of Pounds 103m in April last year. Within the company sector, bank lending to securities dealers grew by Pounds 306m, to wholesalers by Pounds 200m and to manufacturers by Pounds 196m. Those figures were offset by net repayments from leasing, construction and property companies. 'One should never draw conclusions from one month's figures since they may be erratic,' said Lord Inchyra, association secretary-general. 'It is particularly difficult in a month like this, where there is a very large seasonal adjustment, to point to any clear signs of an upturn in the demand for credit.' Figures for money supply growth were in line with expectations. Narrow money, or M0, which comprises mostly notes and coins in circulation and represents underlying demand pressures, rose 0.4 per cent last month to give a 2.3 per cent increase for the year. M0 growth in the year to March it was 2.2 per cent. M4 rose by 0.8 per cent last month, bringing the year-on-year growth rate to 5.7 per cent. Lex, Page 18</p>

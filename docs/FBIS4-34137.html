			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Our Opinion" commentary by Orlando Contreras from the </F> "Doing Radio" newscast]    [Text] The Fourth Ibero-American Summit concludes today  with the approval of a final document which undoubtedly has  defficiencies, but nevertheless recognizes the need for joint  effort in the economic integration sector. The document must  also mention the need to improve the balance between nations  with higher and lower levels of development, and in the social  sector, it must insist that economic development is incompatible  without its social counterpart.    To be honest, in a continent where neoliberalism is still in  style, some of the ideas of neoliberalism are included, tempered  with a list of some of the urgent social needs which afflict a  majority of the 500 million human beings who live in countries  of Iberian descent.    Because we do not know the final version of the document, we  will not venture an overall analysis of the same. Fidel defines  our position in a brief speech. Cuba does not reject foreign  investment or some economic market mechanisms adapted to our  national needs, but it believes that financing for development  is insufficient.    Cuba also emphasized there are no definite solutions for the  increase in Latin America's foreign debt. Cuba was the country  to establish a clear position concerning the summons issued by  the United States for a hemispheric summit -- with a cowardly  exclusion in our case. The summit will be held in Miami in  December this year. Cuba does not oppose this meeting if it  really lets Latin America establish its legitimate positions  before the northern metropolis, but it rejects any attempt by  Washington to use the summit as an anti-Cuban forum or as a  mechanism to increase Washington's hemispheric rule in the  subcontinent's economic and social areas.    According to what we have learned and what special envoy  Demetrio Villaurrutia has reported, the summit's final document,  to be signed by the heads of state and government today at  Cartagena de Indias, must demand the elimination of economic  measures which negatively affect the free development of  international trade and are detrimental to the lifestyle of  Ibero-American peoples, in a much clearer allusion to the U.S.  blockade against our country. This is an unprecedented action  compared to previous summits.    We may recall that the final document for the last summit,  the one held at Salvador de Bahia, endorses the decision adopted  in other forums concerning problems, meaning the unfair blockade  suffered by our country. This time there is a statement that is  much more attuned to reality even though the term blockade is  not mentioned. In essence, the final document of this fourth  summit is not an ideal document that faithfully reflects the  problems which afflict us as Latin Americans and Caribbeans, or  urgently needed solutions. It is a position of consensus in  favor of integration, however. In this concern, it is positive.</p>

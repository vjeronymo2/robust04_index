			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Relayed by TV Polonia Network] </F>   [Excerpts] The Solidarity Mining and Power Industry  Secretariat has decided during its meeting in Katowice to ask  the government for immediate and direct talks with the union.  Otherwise the union plans to intensify the protest action and  restart the strike in brown coal mines.    Strike committees of the hard and brown coal mining  industries and power and heating industries took part in today's  meeting of the Mining and Power Industry Secretariat in  Katowice. Solidarity leader Marian Krzaklewski also took part  in this meeting. After the failed culmination of the strike  last Friday [6 May], which was announced by Krzaklewski, the  trade unionists were discussing how the Solidarity protests  would be organized in the next few days.    Solidarity is not withdrawing its general demands but is now  willing to agree to talk about the power industry demands on the  condition that these would be two-way talks between Solidarity  and the government. [passage omitted]    It is possible that a meeting between Marian Krzaklewski and  Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak or President Lech Walesa may  still take place tonight after the premiere of the Kazimierz  Kutz film in Katowice.</p>

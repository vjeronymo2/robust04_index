Events Behind Official Protocol of  Russian Premier's Visit to Italy"]    [Text] Moscow-Rome-Vatican City-Moscow -- Last night  Russian Government Chairman Viktor Chernomyrdin returned from a  visit to Switzerland. As you know, he went there 29 January  straight from Fiumicino Airport (Rome) after visiting Italy.  Now that all has ended well, I can talk about a sensation of  which everyone was unaware, apart from a few people responsible  for getting the high-ranking official to the location of the  visit and back, but first a word about a few other events that  occurred during Viktor Chernomyrdin's visit to Italy.    A group of Russian journalists arrived at Ciampino military  airfield near Rome half an hour before the main delegation from  Russia. Preparations to receive the eminent visitor were in  full swing here. The carpet had already been laid,  blue-uniformed employees were moving a square carpet from place  to place trying to find the right spot for it, and guardsmen in  parade dress and bandsmen formed up in front of the small  building. As soon as the special Russian Tu-134 touched down,  everything came to life: Policemen started running around  following their commander's orders, our security service sprang  into action, and officials walked down the carpet to where the  airliner was intended to come to a halt. We journalists were  taken to a symbolically chained-off area and two guards were  posted next to us. Viktor Chernomyrdin and his wife came down  the ramp and the solemn ceremony began.    We were above all struck by the absence of local mass media  representatives. This caused us some surprise. The new  schedule for the official visit which we were handed at the  airport listed the following among the party to welcome the  Russian premier: Italian Foreign Trade Minister Paolo Baratta  and his wife; F. di Roberto, Italian ambassador to Russia, and  his wife; G. di Lorenzo, head of Italian Diplomatic Protocol,  and his wife. These people are not that high-ranking. The  following question involuntarily arose: Does this not smack of  some disregard for our head of government? In response to my  puzzled question, an embassy spokesman said that it all depends  on the host country and different states have their own  protocol. And, as for Italian journalists, they simply might  not have been allowed in. In a word there was no sensation.    A motorcycle escort accompanied Viktor Chernomyrdin to his  residence -- the Grand Hotel. This is undoubtedly a high-class  hotel. But a more fitting place could have been found for the  premier of a country like Russia, for instance, the Villa  Abamelik [name as transliterated], the residence of the Russian  ambassador to Italy. We saw that this villa is one of the most  respectable addresses during a reception given by the Russian  ambassador. Set in vast grounds with evergreens, flowerbeds,  and elegant old buildings. Inside there are paintings,  tapestries, and gilded walls and ceilings. Viktor  Chernomyrdin's modesty probably prevented him availing himself  of what is indeed a mansion fit for a czar.    Two hours after his arrival Viktor Chernomyrdin was  scheduled  to meet with Italian Prime Minister C.A. Ciampi at the Villa  Madama. It is situated on one of the highest points in Rome, the  Monte Mario. There were just a few minutes before the talks  began. Russian and Italian journalists had already assembled to  cover the important meeting. One by one automobiles arrived  with officials. Then suddenly a police car got stuck on the  gravel in front of the building. There was some confusion among  the onlookers. After all, the Russian premier's motorcade was  due to arrive at any minute. However, to journalists' chagrin,  everything went without the longed-for sensation. The police  pushed the car out of the way.    The talks with Prime Minister Ciampi were more than  successful. He promised support for Viktor Chernomyrdin when  the question of Russia's joining the club of leading industrial  powers is discussed during the coming G-7 summit in July. This  statement made at a press conference has serious foundation.  After all, this time Italy is chairing the G-7. That is,  Rome's attitude to the Russian premier's visit is extremely  serious and committed.    A real sensation was brewing after the talks. Valentin  Sergeyev, head of the Russian prime minister's press service,  unexpectedly summoned an INTERFAX representative (I don't know  why the choice fell on what is effectively a private agency  although correspondents from the state-owned ITAR-TASS and RIA  "Novosti" were also there) and urgently asked him to carry a  strange report via agency channels. It accused Italy's CORRIERE  DELLA SERA of publishing an article which cited Viktor  Chernomyrdin as saying "I give the orders in Moscow." Valentin  Sergeyev described this stunt as a "hopeless venture" [dokhlaya  koshka]. He was convinced that it was planned by people wanting  to drive a wedge between the Russian president and premier. The  head of the press service awaited the reaction of local  journalists and even asked us to get them to organize a briefing  in order to deal a worthy rebuff. However, there was no reaction  from anyone. There was no sensation.    But many people agonized over another question: Why did  Italian President Scalfaro not receive Viktor Chernomyrdin? The  meeting was scheduled for 27 January. But it transpired that  the president's father had died and so he had to postpone his  conversation with his eminent Russian visitor. When he met  Viktor Chernomyrdin, Scalfaro apologized at length and stressed  that these talks are very important for him.    A visit to Vatican City and an audience with Pope John Paul  II were scheduled for day two of the visit. Having obtained  special visas we arrived in the Vatican ahead of schedule. We  were led through countless rooms, past formed up Swiss guards,  and down secret corridors. In every office there was a guard in  a colorful uniform. When anyone appeared he would stamp his  foot and pike sharply, making some intricate movements and  frightening those present since we did not entirely realize the  significance of his actions. It turned out that this was how he  welcomed eminent visitors. We went through a narrow passageway  to the door of the Pope's personal library. Some time later the  doors opened and Pope John Paul II himself came out to meet us.  He greeted us in Russian. A few seconds later Viktor  Chernomyrdin came in from the opposite side with members of his  delegation. They then closeted themselves with the Pope. A  one-on-one discussion took place. Everyone was impatient to hear  the news. We looked at the ceilings painted by Raphael and the  tapestries executed in accordance with the great artist's  sketches. Time went by. According to protocol the visit was to  have lasted 30 minutes. A conversation with Vatican State  Secretary A. Sodano was scheduled for later. But the meeting  only ended about an hour later. We were given permission along  with the delegation to bid the Pope farewell and shake his hand.  There was a breach of protocol. I was told by the Russian  mission in the Vatican that this was an unofficial visit. What  is more, it is the first ever visit of its kind at this level.  And, despite being a strictly private meeting, all the  requisite honors involving the Swiss Guard were performed. The  Pope showed tremendous interest in Viktor Chernomyrdin's visit.  According to informed sources, the sensation with regard to the  extended audience was planned by the Vatican itself in order to  thus show its great respect for Russia's head of government.  But Viktor Chernomyrdin's entire schedule was thrown out by  half an hour. Yet the remaining meetings took place at the  highest level.    By and large there were no deviations from protocol during  the visit. Everything planned in Moscow was carried out with  the exception of certain rearrangements. There were, if I can  say this, sensations too. Nevertheless no journalists were  aware of the main one, which occurred literally a few hours  before leaving Vnukovo-2.    The point is that, before an aircraft is provided for an  official trip, it is carefully checked over -- given a run  through. A special Tu-154M aircraft was scheduled to be used  for the Italian visit. As usual, it was tested in accordance  with procedure. The state commission then met. It examined the  functionability of all the airliner's systems. The  investigation was carried out with reference to the materials  provided by the government commission investigating the crash  near Irkutsk. Since the aircraft scheduled to fly to Italy was  the same type as the one that crashed. It emerged during the  discussion that there are a host of contentious issues regarding  this aircraft. In particular, it was necessary to see that the  so-called TA-6A auxiliary power unit was in good working order  and check that there was no failure in its combustion chamber  components. This regrettably proved impossible to do. There is  still no technology to perform these checks. And it was this  component that, according to preliminary information, was the  cause of the Irkutsk crash. Had this flight gone ahead and this  assembly been in disrepair there might have been a fire. So, in  order to preclude the danger, the state commission decided to  replace the Tu-154M with a standby aircraft.</p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: Consob staggers under criticism of political role THERE is a suspicion that the knives may be out at Consob, Italy's stock markets and companies watchdog. Its performance in regulating the troubled Ferruzzi group has been widely criticised: and this week one of its five commissioners announced his resignation. The criticism has highlighted a number of broader questions about the future role of a regulatory agency whose activities are still split between its big Rome headquarters and an understaffed markets unit in Milan. Observers are asking whether Consob's highly-politicised structure remains appropriate. Links between politics and business have come under increased scrutiny following Italy's 17-month old political corruption scandal, and the government is poised to launch a big privatisation programme. Last month, Consob's reputation took a severe blow when Milan magistrates investigating political corruption arrested Mr Bruno Pazzi, a veteran Consob chairman, now in retirement, over allegations that he was secretly on the Ferruzzi payroll. Moreover, small shareholders have bitterly attacked Consob over what they claim was its failure to monitor the affairs of Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), Italy's second biggest private company, which has borrowings of more than L28,000bn (Dollars 18.26bn). Shares in Ferfin have seesawed wildly as investors were stunned by allegations that its previous management paid substantial bribes to politicians and covered up vast trading losses since 1989. Although the attacks on Consob are seldom specific, many investors claim the Ferruzzi affair has pinpointed gaping holes in Italy's company and bourse supervision systems. Matters reached a head this week, with the news that Mr Roberto Artoni, a Consob commissioner associated with the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), was planning to resign. Although the move was officially described as a personal decision to return to university teaching, Mr Vincenzo Visco, a PDS senator and deputy chairman of the Senate finance committee, claimed in yesterday's La Repubblica newspaper that it reflected much deeper differences within Consob. Mr Visco accused the agency of being too slack in its company supervision. He cited its failure to replace until recently Mr Giuseppe Zadra, the current director general of Italy's Bankers' Association, who was formerly in charge of Consob's bourse division. Some analysts echo accusations of dilatory behaviour or an excessively bureaucratic approach. Consob's current chairman, Mr Enzo Berlanda, is a respected former politician, who played an important part as a Christian Democrat senator in steering through much of the recent laws which have helped to bring Italy's financial markets up to date with those in other big European countries. However, some observers attack the agency for an excessively legalistic and bureaucratic approach to its job. Even Consob's recent decision to ban Price Waterhouse, Ferfin's accountants, from auditing the group's books because of the accountants' failure to detect the alleged financial irregularities, backfired after some critics accused Consob of trying to pass the buck. The attacks are 'just political machinations', said a Consob official. Mr Zadra's job was left open deliberately, pending a reorganisation which includes reinforcing the Milan office, while the latest criticisms have been motivated by interested parties who want Consob to suspend Ferruzzi group shares, he said. 'We have to apply the law. If people don't like what we do, they should change the laws so we can apply them differently.'</p>

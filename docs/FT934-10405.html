			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: The view from inside The luminaries on the stock exchange's working party on disclosure must enjoy their peace and quiet on Sundays. Their objection to leaking market sensitive information to weekend newspapers stands out in yesterday's woolly consultative paper. Look again, though, and other useful nuggets appear. Profit warnings should not be buried in otherwise anodyne statements. If sensitive information is inadvertently leaked, immediate steps must be taken to issue a full statement - take note, Shanks &amp; McEwan. The close season is no excuse for witholding a statement if new developments warrant. That is all good stuff, but more work is needed to resolve the broader issue of ensuring that companies continue to communicate with the market while treating all investors fairly. The document leaves companies enormous leeway in deciding what constitutes price sensitive information. Delay is apparently permissible in announcing unexpected losses. Even unaudited quarterly trading statements are simply an option. However much finance directors huff and puff, increased formal disclosure is an inevitable part of the answer. The more information in the public domain, the less they have to fear from talking to analysts. That applies even to innocuous sounding details which, put together, could produce a market-sensitive conclusion. When in doubt, put the information out. That is the best prescription. It is in this document, but buried like a profit warning in a six page statement about a small joint venture in Siberia.</p>

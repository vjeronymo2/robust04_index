			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DE KLERK POSTPONES HIS JUNE WASHINGTON VISIT;  </P> <P> SOUTH AFRICA: SOME COMPLAINED THAT HIS MEETING WITH BUSH WOULD HAVE BEEN A SNUB  TO NELSON MANDELA.  </P> <P> President Frederik W. de Klerk said Tuesday he has postponed his visit to the  United States next month because of a controversy over the timing of his  meeting with President Bush.  </P> <P> Neither the White House nor the South African government had announced a date  for the meeting, but it reportedly had been set for June 18.  </P> <P> The African National Congress and others complained that a meeting on that date  with De Klerk would be a snub to African National Congress leader Nelson  Mandela, who is to arrive in the United States on June 20.  </P> <P> De Klerk and Mandela have said they do not care which one meets with Bush  first. But many ANC representatives and some black American leaders have said  that Bush should not meet with De Klerk at all until South Africa's apartheid  system is dismantled. It has been more than 30 years since a South African head  of government has visited the United States.  </P> <P> In Washington, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that "Mr. De Klerk  has notified us that he would prefer to wait until another time" for his visit.  "We are ready to see him whenever he wants."  </P> <P> He said the change of schedule "will have no impact" on Mandela's visit.  </P> <P> The South African president returned Saturday from an 18-day visit to nine  European nations, where he met with leaders and explained his plans to end  apartheid and give the voteless black majority a voice in running the  government.  </P> <P> De Klerk is under pressure from white rightists for conceding too much to  blacks and he needs to demonstrate to his voters that his reforms are winning  support abroad for isolated South Africa.  </P> <P> Diplomats said the last thing he wants are television pictures of noisy,  possibly violent, anti-South African demonstrations in the United States.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Mandela underwent minor surgery to clear up a complication  discovered during a routine checkup and will stay in the hospital for another  day or two, his doctor said Tuesday.  </P> <P> He would not disclose the nature of the surgery.  </P> <P> Mandela's wife, Winnie, visited him briefly at a private Johannesburg clinic  Tuesday and told reporters he was in excellent spirits.  </P> <P> She said his tour of European capitals, scheduled to start next week, will not  be affected by his longer-than-expected stay in the hospital.  </P> <P> Mandela, 71, was admitted in secrecy to the Park Lane clinic late Sunday. There  was speculation that he was being treated for a recurring prostate complaint.  </P></p>

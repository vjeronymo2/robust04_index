			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / 'Sinister' food stores attacked NURDIN &amp; Peacock, the cash-and-carry operator, yesterday accused the biggest supermarket chains of a 'sinister' attempt to 'strangle at birth' its plans to open US-style cut-price warehouse clubs in the UK. N&amp;P is constructing a warehouse club - a large shed selling goods at very low prices to card-carrying members - at Wednesbury, in the west Midlands. Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway are trying to overturn the 'general use' planning permission granted to the club. They argue it should have been classed as a retailer and only given permission to build on designated retail land, which is several times more expensive. They have taken the unprecedented step of employing joint legal advisers, planning specialists and a public relations agency to put their case. They are also attempting to overturn planning permission granted to US company Costco to build a warehouse club at Thurrock, Essex. Mr David Poole, N&amp;P's managing director, said the supermarket chains were trying to 'strangle us at birth'. He added: 'There is something sinister about three companies who have 40 per cent of the retail food market with combined sales of Pounds 20bn and who spend up to Pounds 2bn a year on new sites, getting together to thwart a business that has not even opened yet.' A spokesman for the three chains said the allegations were 'sensationalist and not borne out by the facts'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Anatoliy Ben: "The Criminal World Has Declared </F> War on Us"]    [Text] The criminal world has declared war on us. This is  how participants in the coordination conference on security that  was held the day before yesterday [22 June] by Ukrainian  President Leonid Kravchuk assessed the present crime-breeding  situation in our state.    Our peace and harmony are in danger. Ukraine's citizens have  found themselves defenseless before the onslaught of crime. Not  just so-called rank-and-file citizens, but also those who have  both money and power. The murder attempt on people's deputy V.  Bortnyk and very recent cases of murdering Ukrainian businessmen  confirm this. According to the statistics of Ukraine's Ministry  of Internal Affairs, the number of contract murders involving  firearms has tripled. As asserted by deputy minister of  internal affairs Yuriy Kravchenko, a black market of weapons has  emerged in our country; a pistol can be procured for just $500,  a submachinegun for $3,000, and a carbine -- for between $1,500  and $2,000.    It looks like the criminal world is openly mocking us. A few  days ago, the automobile of justice minister Vasyl Onopenko was  stolen. Onopenko is now clutching at his head because the  juridical nonsense according to which car thieves are still  divided into those who actually steal the car and those who  simply drive it away has not yet been abolished. The punishment  for driving away an automobile is like patting the criminal on  the back.    The black market and black humor: Had the criminals stolen  that automobile earlier, the minister would have started  pondering the nonsense earlier.    Leaders of power departments -- Ukraine's Security Service,  the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Procurator General's  Office are again demanding that the struggle against crime be  enhanced by legislation, in particular, preventive detention of  suspects for 30 days, mandatory capital punishment for the  murder of officers of law-enforcement bodies, state officials,  and people's deputies, the creation of strong legal executive  structures, and so on. The minister of justice also proposes  that order be established in issuing quotas and licenses, that  the right to register entrepreneurs be transferred from local  bodies to his own department, and that people's and oblast  judges be nominated by presidential edicts. At the same time,  head of the Security Service Yevhen Marchuk also sees salvation  from the revelry of crime in creating strong presidential power  with an experienced president at the head and in adopting  primarily those legislative acts that are aimed at protecting  the individual, and believes that a situation may take shape  when we will be compelled to resort, as he put it, to some  elements of an emergency situation which, in his opinion, the  people will support.    We are not talking about an emergency situation, stressed  Leonid Kravchuk, but about extraordinary measures for combating  crime. Having just issued several edicts -- on the return of  hard currency from abroad and on the struggle against  speculation -- he is ready to come out, as soon as possible,  with a corresponding legislative initiative before the  parliament. The president is also convinced that the criminal  world has declared war on us and that we, in turn, should also  get organized and declare war on crime.</p>

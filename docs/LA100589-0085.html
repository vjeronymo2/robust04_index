			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: CULVER CITY;  </P> <P> TENTATIVE TEACHERS ACCORD  </P> <P> The Culver City Teachers Assn. on Monday unveiled to teachers a tentative  agreement with the district that includes a 6% pay raise and new health  benefits for retirees but also has higher health insurance co-payments and a  1.45% salary deduction for teachers who wish to buy into the Medicare system.  </P> <P> Many of the 120 teachers attending the meeting at Farragut Elementary School  expressed disappointment at the tentative agreement, which is for this school  year.  </P> <P> Under the agreement, the district will pay $1,250 per year for health insurance  for future retirees after age 65, to supplement Medicare coverage they may  have. Retirees do not have any district health benefits.  </P> <P> The district will increase its contribution by 7% for teachers who are under a  fee-for-service health plan. But the the total increased cost is higher, so a  teacher's payment for individual coverage will go up from $41 to $57 a month,  said association President Bess Doerr.  </P> <P> The agreement also adopts a new state provision in which teachers can buy into  Medicare by paying 1.45% of their salary, which will be matched by a district  contribution.  </P> <P> Howard Bennett, chairman of the School Employees Assn. for Lifetime Health  Coverage, said the increase in teacher payments for the fee-for-service health  plan, the 1.45% contribution for Medicare and increases in the cost of living  eliminate any gain in buying power from the 6% raise.  </P> <P> Bennett urged teachers to reject the contract in the ratification vote Oct. 10.  "It doesn't take a math teacher -- and I'm an English teacher -- to figure out  this is no deal," he said later.  </P> <P> Doerr said she expects the contract to be ratified in a close vote. The  district and the teachers union have been negotiating since June over salary  and benefits for this year, the second in a three-year contract.  </P> <P> The agreement would cover about 280 teachers, counselors, nurses and  librarians. The district's 250 custodians, instructional aides, cafeteria  workers and other classified employees -- under a "me too" clause in their  contract -- will get the same salary and benefit provisions that teachers get,  Assistant Supt. Ralph Villani said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. TO PROBE RECENT JUMP IN OIL PRICES  </P> <P> The Justice Department is looking into the recent surge in oil prices to  determine whether price collusion took place, an Energy Department official  said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Asst. Energy Secretary John Easton told a House subcommittee that the Justice  Department has received numerous complaints about high price increases for  heating oil and natural gas during December's record cold weather. In some  areas, retail prices rose by 50% or more.  </P> <P> The retail price jump coincided with a 60% jump in heating oil prices on  futures markets, but prices have since fallen sharply and the wholesale market  prices would not have immediately affected the price of oil held by wholesalers  and retailers.  </P> <P> "The Justice Department currently is reviewing those complaints in its effort  to determine whether a formal investigation is warranted into the question of  whether collusion may have occurred here," Easton said.  </P> <P> He said price increases would be unlawful under antitrust laws if they were  made in collusion among competitors, but would be legal if they were taken  individually.  </P> <P> Last month, New York Gov. Mario Cuomo called on the Justice Department to  investigate the rise in heating oil prices. His office said retail prices had  jumped as much as 50 cents to $1.50 a gallon.  </P> <P> The governors of five New England states have written to the Energy Department  asking for an investigation.  </P> <P> Easton said record cold temperatures in most of the country during December  increased demand for distillate oil by over 1 million barrels a day and there  were problems in delivering more energy supplies to the affected areas.  </P> <P> "We can't tolerate these kinds of price increases," Rep. Edward Markey,  (D-Mass.), told Easton.  </P> <P> "In response to this increased demand there is evidence that additional  supplies of product are moving into the affected regions, not only making more  product available, but also exerting downward pressure on the higher prices we  saw at the end of December," said Easton.  </P></p>

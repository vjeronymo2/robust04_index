			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> MOUNTAIN LION PROTECTION UPHELD  </P> <P> A state Court of Appeal, sharply criticizing Fish and Game officials, refused  to lift a 17-year ban in California on the killing of mountain lions for sport.  The three-member panel upheld an order by a San Francisco Superior Court judge  blocking the proposed hunt until the state Fish and Game Commission more fully  analyzes the environmental impact of the plan and gives the public more  information on its consequences. The panel said the commission's environmental  analysis was "woefully inadequate." State officials, the court said, "chose to  circulate a document that simply swept the serious criticisms of this project  under the rug." Spokesmen for the commission and the state attorney general's  office declined comment, pending study of the panel's opinion, but said an  appeal to the state Supreme Court will be considered.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] According to a report, the South Korean hardliners  toward the North and military warmongers have recently babbled  that if the Team Spirit joint military exercise is suspended  this year, they will conduct other types of military exercises  that can easily fill the vacuum.    The warmongers also said they would conduct a large-scale  war  exercise--a combination of Ulchi and Focus Lens exercises--in  August, if the Team Spirit joint military exercise is suspended.    The puppet clique's remarks--which deteriorate North-South  relations and aggravate tensions on the Korean peninsula--is a  clear expression of their criminal attempt to stimulate the  atmosphere of war instead of peace and to continue to embark  upon the road of confrontation and war instead of conciliation  and unity.    As is known, during the DPRK-U.S. contacts at the end of  last  year, the U.S. side officially expressed its willingness to  suspend the Team Spirit joint military exercise in an effort to  eliminate a nuclear threat to us. Therefore, we decided to  allow the necessary inspections to guarantee the continuity of  the basic safeguards [sunsu tambo]. As a result, we brought  about a breakthrough for the progress of the talks.    At a time when there are positive prospects for the  settlement of the nuclear issue, the South Korean puppets are  viciously maneuvering to conduct a new joint military exercise  by babbling about other kinds of military exercises. This is a  shameless plot to apply, by any means, the brakes on the  progress in the DPRK-U.S. talks and to create a new grave  obstacle to the settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula.    This shows that the puppets actually do not want the  fundamental settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula even if they talk about denuclerization and  preconditions, and that they only pursue division and  confrontation.    With the beginning of the new year, the South Korean puppets  are showing their intention to pursue arms confrontation, while  talking about the assumption of the combatant posture and the  immediate countermeasure posture. Also, the fact that they are  going to conduct a large-scale war exercise this time clearly  shows such intention.    If another large-scale joint military exercise is conducted  again in South Korea instead of the Team Spirit joint military  exercise, this means, indeed, that they would continue to  conduct the Team Spirit joint military exercise. Even if the  large-scale joint military exercise had another name, it would  be, in essence, similar to the Team Spirit joint military  exercise. Therefore, if they continue the joint military  exercise like the Team Spirit exercise, the nuclear issue on the  Korean peninsula will neither be resolved nor the relaxation of  tension and peace be achieved. Also, they will create more  dangerous war situations on the Korean peninsula.    We are ready for either dialogue or war. If the puppet  clique provokes a reckless war, we will resolutely counter fire  with fire [purun pullo tasurilkkosimnida]. The South Korean  puppets must be clearly aware that aggravating tensions on the  Korean peninsula, turning them into an acute situation of  confrontation, will only bring destruction to them. They must  not act recklessly.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Oleg Zhirnov: "Skokov Shows His Cards"] </F>   [Text] On Tuesday, the former secretary of the  Security Council, and currently the chairman of the Federation  of Goods Producers of Russia, Yuriy Skokov, made a secret visit  to the State Duma.    His hour-and-a-half long speech to the members of the deputy  group, "New Regional Policy," about which only this group had  been given confidential notification, was presented behind  closed doors, without "outside" deputies or journalists.    Perhaps that is for the best. Skokov's evaluations of the  other Duma factions and the lower chamber as a whole were rather  unflattering. The State Duma is as yet "not a parliament, but a  party club," a mechanical conglomerate of party factions which  "are not accountable to anyone." On the contrary, the NRP ["New  Regional Policy"] group, in Skokov's interpretation, is the  bulwark and hope not only for parliament, but to a certain  degree for all of Russia. Reminding them that he "took an active  part in the stage of formulation of the group," Skokov called it  the "nucleus, the beginnings of the structure of representative  power in the entire country."    Such complementary interpretations ran through Yuriy  Vladimirovich's entire political philosophy and program of  action. The fact is that he has a rather low opinion of the  party system of current-day Russia in general. In his opinion,  parties do not have serious programs and principles. They are  created "under surnames" for the purpose of realizing the  political ambitions of these "surnames." Therefore, there is no  sense for Skokov, as any rational and responsible politician, to  build yet another party on the basis, for example, of the  Federation of Goods Producers. Rather, it is necessary to create  a "system of interaction" between deputies who share a single  mandate and who have ties in the regions, with the  representative and executive powers of the territories, the  regional unions of the Federation of Goods Producers, and with  the local intellectual and professional elite. This is the  "non-governmental, non-state" technocratic--in opposition to the  party--system, which can organize the country's emergence from  its historic dead end. In the name of its development, Yuriy  Skokov offered the deputies his cooperation "in any form,"  specially stipulating that it should not be limited to the field  of lawmaking.    Having understood the sense of the proposed deal, the  parliamentarians stopped to think. Despite the attractiveness of  the proposal, despite the respect which they had for the name of  the speaker, the "regionalists" were clearly concerned by the  problem: What does Skokov actually represent in the political  plane? Yuriy Vladimirovich, who previously expressed his  readiness to run for president, this time avoided responding to  the question of whether he sees himself as a future leader of  the country. Then at least they would like to know what his  "hosts and home fronts" are!    Skokov gave a rather detailed listing of the collective  members of the Federation of Goods Producers which he heads up,  noting that he includes in this category "all persons at the  local sites who create material wealth." However, in response to  the specific question of whether he has a group of persons  capable of working with the NRP on the formation of a  socio-political movement, he gave an expansive answer from which  it followed that, in general, he does not have such a group.  "Only individual persons are emerging." On the whole, however,  the cadre problem is the most complex, and that is why he has  appealed to the "regionalist" deputies.    It seems that after the "secret meeting," the  parliamentarians understood what was wanted of them, but never  did understand who stands behind Skokov. Is it only his  legendary humility which explains the fact that he stubbornly  stays in the shadows? Did he not rush to the deputy group as his  last hope? Or, in fact, is this a leader who only needs some  link, some Archimedes key, to turn Russia upside down?    In any case, it is obvious that Skokov has seen in the "New  Regional Policy" more than simply a duma faction. Perhaps he has  seen a sort of "micro-soviet of the Federation" in the State  Duma, a channel of power for emergence into the regions which he  lost when he left the post of head of the Security Council and  did not find in the Federation of Goods Producers, which he  currently heads up. And so he decided to make use of the actual  and imagined potentials of the deputy group.    There are varying opinions about these potentials. Some  believe that the NRP is a "union of unattached persons." Others  believe it to be a powerful government lobby in parliament. If  the latter is true, then Yuriy Vladimirovich has presented his  listeners with a serious choice. It is not overly disposed to  the current government and its head, and critizes it not only  for its failures in the economy, but also "from personal  positions." The Federation of Goods Producers long ago proposed  that Chernomyrdin sign the "agreement on interaction," and even  the president had a "rather positive" attitude toward this.  However, the "government is silent." Therefore, Skokov, for his  part, does not want to sign the Agreement on Civil Accord.    Thus, it has been suggested in cautious form that the Duma  "regionalists" define themselves. It is hard to say how  difficult this choice is for them in the ideological plane,  since in any case it is not a choice in favor of "classic  democracy." Because while Viktor Stepanovich embodies the power  of the "director-privatizers" in the eyes of many, the outline  presented by Yuriy Vladimirovich is a second variant of the  "nomenklatura renaissance," which casts off as being unneeded  the inalienable attribute of democracy--the leading role of the  party in the political process.    And finally. Is it by chance that Yuriy Skokov's blitz-visit  to the Duma coincided in time with the news of the resignation  of Sergey Shakhray, a long-time rival of Yuriy Vladimirovich in  the field of regional policy? Among the "regionalists" in the  Duma, Shakhray enjoyed the authority of being a practical man  who helped to solve specific questions of the territories. "With  Shakhray one could discuss the problem of the 'norths.' Now  Shakhray is gone. Do you know this problem?", one of the  deputies asked Skokov. "I know it very well," he accepted the  challenge.</p>

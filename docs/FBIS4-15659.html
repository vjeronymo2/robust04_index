			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Kucherenko: "Central Bank Prepared To </F> Reduce Rates for Centralized Credits"]    [Text] Central Bank Chairman V. Gerashchenko has made a  sensational statement in the State Duma to the effect that in  the very near future he will reduce commercial banks' credit  rates.    The exact figure is not yet known and the Central Bank of  Russia is not interested in making it public, to avoid  destabilizing the interbank credit market. But experts are  citing a figure between 180 and 200 percent per annum by the end  of April. Let us recall that the present rate is 210 percent    According to Gerashchenko this is being done because  inflation rates have declined considerably. And if the  government keeps its word and brings its average monthly rates  down to 7-9 percent by the end of the year then the Central Bank  will correspondingly lower the bank rate to 110-120 percent per  annum.    We have found out from competent sources in the Central Bank  of Russia that this has been talked about for a long time. But  there is a long way from talk to implementing that intention.  It will all depend on how far the cabinet of ministers succeeds  in keeping the budget deficit within the calculated limits and  also on whether the government approves the monetary and credit  policy concept sent to it by the Central Bank. Its thrust,  according to V. Smenkovskiy, chief of the Central Bank research  and information department, is that the Bank of Russia has set  limits and volumes for the credits granted, which must be sent  to specific enterprises and for specific projects. But which  projects these will be is to be determined by the government  program of "targeted" support for industry.    It is entirely possible that the Central Bank of Russia's  decision to embark on reducing the base rate was influenced by  the results of auctions to which centralized credits were  submitted. The feeble activity of the banks at the auctions  showed that loans have become excessively expensive and the  market has been saturated and the time has come to reduce the  cost of money, so to speak.</p>

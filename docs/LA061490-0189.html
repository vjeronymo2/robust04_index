			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTO THE NIGHT: X-RATED ANTICS AT AIDS BENEFIT  </P> <P> The Scene: The party after Tuesday's premiere of "Without You I'm Nothing" held  at Bar One in West Hollywood. The film was a record of comedienne Sandra  Bernhard's one-woman Broadway show, and the evening was a benefit for the  American Foundation for AIDS Research.  </P> <P> The Entertainment: X-rated antics from a troupe of transvestites, emceed by New  York cable TV star Robin Byrd, who wore a backless (and we mean backless)  cowgirl outfit. Chichi LaRue kicked off the fun by lip-syncing to the song  "Nasty," during which LaRue grabbed 15-year-old Drew Barrymore from the  audience. Bernhard cheered the whole thing and even dirty-danced with Robin  Byrd.  </P> <P> Who Was There: Director John Boskovich, designer Isaac Mizrahi (who designed  Bernhard's lipstick-red dress), singer John Doe, sculptor Julian Schnabel,  writer Bruce Vilanch, actress Theresa Russell with husband Nicolas Roeg,  professional gossips the Hollywood Kids, artist Allee Willis, and actress Kim  McGuire.  </P> <P> Dress Code: Bernhard's floor-length red Mizrahi dress made her look like  Cinderella's wicked stepmother. The other woman wore streetwalker chic, while  the guys who weren't wearing dresses wore leather jackets and T-shirts.  </P> <P> Chow: Fresh shrimp, antipasto, pate, and hot pasta. The guests attacked the  buffet like the zombies in "Night of the Living Dead."  </P> <P> Money Matters: The evening raised $50,000 for the group, according to AMFAR  president Mervyn Silverman.  </P> <P> Noted: As observed in this space before, the '70s are back. Guests wore vinyl  shorts, tank tops, dog tags, and even sequined tube tops. The deejay had the  nerve to play that ultra '70s hit, "One Tin Soldier" by Coven. The crowd showed  admirable restraint by not wearing bell bottoms.  </P> <P> Quoted: "Remember, if you don't have a loved one at home, you always have us!"  screamed Bernhard and Byrd to the appreciative crowd.  </P> <P> Triumphs: Sandra Bernhard is not your average Hollywood actress, and this was  definitely not your average Hollywood premiere.  </P> <P> Glitches: One woman who approached the buffet was told, "You can't have any  shrimp until 9:30!" That was rude -- almost as rude as adult film star Angel  Kelly, who took everything off as the mixed crowd screamed and whistled. As we  said, it was not your average Hollywood premiere.  </P></p>

			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canadian tar sands come of age  -Synthetic crude has been made competitive by years of gradual improvement of extraction technology CANADA'S VAST Athabasca tar sands - where extraction plants last year produced their billionth barrel of crude oil - have come of age, and promise to be an even more important source of energy in the future. Years of gradual improvement in extraction technology mean that synthetic crude from the tar sands is now competitive with crude from more conventional sources, particularly when exploration costs are included. 'Like the North Sea, the relatively lean price regime we have had over the past eight years has been an incentive to cost reduction,' says Mr Campbell Watkins, president of oil consultancy DataMetrics and an adjunct professor of economics at the University of Calgary. 'The tar sands are close to competitive with the North Sea, and the economics have improved and will continue to improve,' he says. When the giant Syncrude complex at Fort McMurray in Alberta was planned and built during the 1970s, it was widely regarded as a very costly white elephant. Now it is seen as a quiet success, reliably producing synthetic crude oil at a cost of just under CDollars 15 (USDollars 12) a barrel, while continuing to improve a technology that would justify expansion at oil prices not much above today's. Both major tar sands plants passed milestones in September - Syncrude, which has been operating since 1978, pumped its 600 millionth barrel; its older and smaller sister Suncor, which started up in 1967 as Great Canadian Oil Sands, reached a total of 400m barrels. Between them, the two plants produce about 16 per cent of Canada's crude oil, and that proportion is expected to rise as conventional production falls off. Syncrude estimates that a further 200bn barrels, more than the reserves of Saudi Arabia and its neighbours combined, are recoverable using present extraction techniques. Estimates of total reserves run as high as a trillion (million million) barrels. This huge resource has inspired a large number of projects since the turn of the century, most of which have foundered in the face of financial or technical problems. The success of Syncrude and Suncor in bringing their efficiencies up and costs down has inspired backers to consider a number of potential projects in recent years, but oil prices have been a little too low. Mr Watkins says: 'It wouldn't take much more. If we had the prospect that prices would be maintained at USDollars 25 per barrel, there might be room for a new plant'. That prospect has receded recently, however, with Brent blend, the North Sea marker crude, slipping below Dollars 18 a barrel. The new facility would be able to benefit from a steady series of improvements in the cost structure of the Alberta oil sands industry. In 1980, two years after Syncrude started production, it was producing synthetic crude at a cost of about CDollars 25 a barrel in 1980 dollars. It now has reduced the production cost per barrel to less than CDollars 15 in 1992 dollars, or about CDollars 20 when capital and royalty costs are taken into account. Mr Phil Lachambre, Syncrude's vice president of business and corporate affairs, says that the improvement has come about half through a gradual refinement of the processes and half through new technologies. The raw tar sands are turned into oil by first mixing them with hot water; the bitumen floats to the top and is skimmed off. The bitumen is then converted into synthetic crude by a series of processes, including extracting sulphur and adding hydrogen. Improvements over the years have ranged from better techniques for mining the raw mixture, to more effective processing of the separated bitumen, producing increased yields and much higher labour productivity. The synthetic crude produced by the plants is very marketable - 8 degree gravity bitumen is turned into 32 degree gravity crude. This compares with the 40 degree gravity of the best light crude produced in Southern Alberta. But the tar sands product is particularly 'sweet', or low in sulphur, says Mr Lachambre. Production efficiencies at Syncrude are such that the plant, designed to produce 50m barrels a year, has been bumping up against its permitted ceiling of 63m. It has therefore applied to Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation Board to have this limit increased to 79m barrels. In addition, Syncrude has outstanding permission, granted in 1988, for a CDollars 4.5bn (USDollars 3.6bn) expansion that would add a further 30m barrels of oil a year to its capacity. By way of comparison, another of Canada's energy 'megaprojects', the development of the 650m-barrel Hibernia oil field in the Atlantic off Newfoundland, is set to produce 40m barrels a year starting in 1997 at an anticipated cost of CDollars 5.2bn (USDollars 4.16bn). However, in spite of the existing Syncrude plant's average annual return on capital employed of 6 per cent over the past five years - twice the average for Canada's oil industry - expansion plans are on hold until oil prices recover. In the meantime, Canada's oil industry keeps planning for the day when oil prices rise again. In 1991 OSLO, a group of leaseholders in the tar sands, including Imperial Oil, the Exxon subsidiary that owns 25 per cent of Syncrude, shelved separate plans for a new Dollars 4bn (USDollars 3.2bn) plant. But nobody doubts that extracting synthetic crude from tar sands is a viable business, and any decisive upwards move in the oil price could be met with a torrent of production from Canada's north after a few years.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CANADIAN TAR SANDS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              Cost* per           Production                      barrel (CDollars)            (barrels)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1992e                            15.00                  87m 1991                             16.48                82.4m 1990                             17.41                76.4m 1989                             17.17                75.4m 1988                             14.82                73.6m 1987                             14.77                65.7m 1986                             14.98                67.8m 1985                             17.74                60.3m 1984                             26.17                  49m 1983                             18.68                54.4m 1982                             23.67                37.8m 1981                             24.42                34.6m  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Not adjusted for inflation. e = estimated.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sources: Syncrude (prices) and Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Boartd (production).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

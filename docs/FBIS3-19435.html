This is the conclusion reached by the investigative  authorities. Correspondent Yeoryios Platonos has the following  report:    [Begin Platonos recording] The bomb that exploded last night  on Lefkonos Street was made with a small quantity of high  density explosive material and was placed on the outside wall of  the mosque. The homemade device exploded at 2300. The Criminal  Investigation Department [TAE] is evaluating information that  Turkish agents are responsible for the explosion. It is  believed that the Turks possibly came from the occupied areas to  cause tension in view of the Cyprus issue talks. TAE is also  studying the relation of this incident to the arrival of the  Greek National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis. Police last  night visited and searched other mosques as a precautionary  measure. A UN officer visited the area after the explosion,  possibly after notification by the Turks. The explosion caused  the shattering of windows of a nearby school and shops. [end  recording]</p>

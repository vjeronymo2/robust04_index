			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: M and S bought A surge of speculative buying of Marks and Spencer helped the shares put on 2 1/2 at 350p in trade of nearly 9m shares, with a further 3m dealt in the options market. Some analysts reported whispers of strong February sales by the high street retailer, to follow a healthy performance in January. There was also talk of pressure exerted on M and S's suppliers as the group attempts to improve margins. The company is not due to report its final results until May, but yesterday's speculation will do nothing to dampen expectations in the market that the group will exceed most current analysts' forecasts. Brown Shipley moved forward 4 to 40p after it was revealed that GPG, the UK investment company controlled by Sir Ron Brierley, was considering a full bid for the group after increasing its stake to 22 per cent by buying a block of 2.35m shares, or 14.8 per cent, at 35p a share. Continuing worries about the extent of the losses arising from the bank's involvement in the Bombay securities market, and lingering fears that today's preliminary numbers may be accompanied by a large rights issue, took their toll of Standard Chartered shares. The stock retreated a further 8 to 691p on above-average turnover of 1.3m. Barclays' rally came to an abrupt halt, the shares relinquishing 8 to 413p on heavy volume of 8.4m. Sun Alliance outperformed the rest of the composite insurance sector as US buying, thought to have been prompted by a buy note published by one of the US investment banks, lifted the shares 9 to 342p. Bearish noises surrounding the leading building material groups saw BPB slip 3 to 215p and Blue Circle ease 2 to 234p. Redland held at 482p and RMC declined 11 to 611p. Meyer fell 10 to 318p, with BZW said to have lowered its profits forecasts for the group. For the current year BZW is said to be predicting profits of Pounds 11m, down from Pounds 15m, and for next year it expects the group to achieve profits of Pounds 18m compared with a previous estimate of Pounds 19m. Conglomerate Hanson eased a penny to 257p, with analysts at BZW reported to have come to the view that there was little upside in the stock. The securities house is believed to have also reduced its profits estimate for the year to September 1994, coming down to the bottom of the range which is around Pounds 1.19bn. With good figures expected today from international conglomerate BTR, the shares were once again in demand. They moved a penny forward to 591p, with turnover increasing to 5.4m. Results from Hillsdown generated good two-way business of 8.4m shares, but left the price steady at 163p. However, Nomura, which continued to mark the stock a weak hold, said questions over long-term strategy remain unanswered. Nervousness ahead of results today from Cadbury-Schweppes left the stock 5 adrift at 494p. Yorkshire Food Group made a strong market debut, the shares coming to the market at 110p and closing 28 forward at 138p. Turnover came to 8.6m. Asda continued its seemingly relentless march forward, with Hoare Govett positive following a recent company visit. The stock was also buoyed by suggestions it may shortly join the FT-SE 100 Index. The shares gained 1 1/2 at 69 3/4 p in turnover of 33m. However, according to market gossip, Asda'a rumoured inclusion in the Footsie could be at the expense of WH Smith, whose 'A' shares lost 7 to 422p yesterday. Buying pressure squeezed Stakis higher as shares in the hotel and casino group were said to be chased by institutions. The stock climbed 3 1/2 to 51 1/2 p. Speculation in Paris that Euro Disney would shortly be announcing the restructuring of some debt sent the shares surging by 65 to 1080p but was scouted by sources close to the company. Thorn EMI rebounded from Monday's weakness, with SG Warburg said to be positive. The shares appreciated 10 to 874p. Drinks stocks continued to respond to positive talk on consumer spending and economic recovery, with the second liners taking centre stage yesterday. HP Bulmer jumped 16 to 393p, Greene King rose 5 to 533p, helped by an analysts visit, and Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley gained 11 at 599p. Bass was steady at 593p following a reported downgrade from James Capel. Profit-taking amid nervous trading as British Aerospace met with fund managers yesterday afternoon left the shares 5 lighter at 272p. A view that shares in engineering group Glynwed International, which reported a 30 per cent increase in full-year profits, were overvalued weakened the stock. It gave up 7 to 282p, with one market watcher suggesting little improvement in trading in the short term. Vickers shed a penny to 118p ahead of today's figures, with a rights issue of between Pounds 80m and Pounds 100m expected from the company. BBA gained 5 at 171p on reporting a 53 per cent profits increase. Profits also improved at Transfer Technology and the shares responded by jumping 29 to 517p. Profit-taking drove Danka Business down 52 to close at 632p. News that Ocean Group was in talks to sell its bulk liquid storage company boosted the shares, which added 10 at 296p. Glaxo rebounded from the weakness inflicted by speculation over its dispute with US drug authorities, the shares leaping 16 to 666p. Medeva rose 9 to 225p ahead of results expected today.</p>

Six criminals guilty of the most  heinous crimes were escorted to the execution ground and  executed by shooting. They were Qin Youli, a jobless person of  the municipality, for rape and hooliganism; Sun Qinglai, a  person released from reeducation through labor, for arson; Han  Taiping, a peasant from Henan Province, for theft and escape;  Zhang Wenzheng and Gao Yunsheng, jobless persons of the  municipality, for murder with intent; and Nie Yongqing, a  peasant from Yanqing County of the municipality, for intentional  violence. Yang Yinlong, Jin Huang, Wang Guoen, Liu Qingrui, Li  Jingbin, Lu Xuejun, He Yibin, Zhang Guangli, Zhang Yong, Liang  Cuifa, Song Qingguo, and Ji Tiejun who were guilty of robbery,  intentional injury, habitual theft, intentional murder, and  swindling were sentenced to death and deprived of their  political rights for life at the first trial, and their  confederates were also sternly punished.    Most of the criminal elements who were punished by the  municipal intermediate people's court on 25 January had been  punished by public security and judicial organs before for  breaking laws, but they refused to repent and continued their  group or individual criminal activities. They humiliated and  raped young girls in public; committed arson to burn many people  and property; colluded with each other to rob with weapons,  injured people, and swindled money; fled to Beijing from other  localities to commit robbery and theft of public and private  money and property; committed murder for failing to win love;  killed and injured people without reason; robbed and killed a  taxi driver; and killed personnel on duty while robbing a  savings bank. They are the most evil criminal elements. Their  crimes were extremely vicious, caused great danger to society,  and incurred the greatest popular indignation.    Qin Youli, who was executed on 25 January, resorted to  violence on numerous occasions in raping two hired women workers  in his home during March and April 1993. He also raped,  humiliated, and acted indecently toward women workers in public  at a working room in the restaurant he ran. Three people were  victimized.    Zhang Wenzheng, a jobless person of the municipality who had  been sentenced before, harboring hatred towards his girlfriend  Liu who left him, premeditated retaliation through violence.  Using a sharp knife and other weapons on 13 January 1993, he  forced Liu who was on her way home from work, to go with him to  a certain plant in Shijingshan District. He killed Liu by  stabbing her several times on her neck and chest.    Yang Yinlong, Jin Huang, Wang Guoen, Liu Qingrui, and Li  Jingbin, who were sentenced to death at the first trial by the  municipal intermediate people's court on 25 January, formed a  criminal ring with two other jobless persons of the  municipality. From October 1991 to May 1992, they used  repeating firelocks and knives to rob houses or waylay people in  the Jiuxianqiao, Jiangtaixiang, Yonganli, and Tuanjiehu areas of  Chaoyang District. Many people were victimized. They stole  over 40,000 yuan renminbi, $1,500, a Bluebird car, and large  amounts of materials, such as cameras, videos, watches, and gold  ornaments, worth over 280,000 yuan.    Ji Shuhan, president of the municipal intermediate people's  court, said: The municipal intermediate people's court will  fully apply laws as a weapon to sternly punish criminals who  have seriously endangered the national capital's public security  by their crimes of murder, robbery, rape, and habitual theft.  In particular, it will resolutely and strictly crack down on  the criminals who have committed vicious crimes, the criminals  who refuse to mend their ways despite repeated admonition, and  the serious criminals who have fled to Beijing from other  localities to commit crimes; and will never be soft-hearted  toward them so as to safeguard the social stability of the  national capital and create a good social environment to  accelerate reform, opening up, and the modernization.</p>

			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft shares fall 8% Shares in Metallgesellschaft, the troubled German metals, engineering and chemicals group, fell 8 per cent yesterday as investors reacted with confusion to reports of possible moves to strengthen its share capital. There was also concern about the likely extent of further restructuring, especially on the non-ferrous metals smelting side. Shares in the company, which almost collapsed after significant losses on US oil futures trading last year, closed DM16 lower in Frankfurt at DM184. Metallgesellschaft said on Monday night, after a supervisory board meeting, that last week's deal releasing it from controversial oil refinery contracts with Castle Energy of the US meant it would need to set aside more than the planned DM1bn to cover losses. Yesterday, the company said it was talking with share-holders and creditor banks about improving its capital structure. It gave no details, but made it clear that the process would take time, with any decision to be put to the annual meeting next March. The market was unsettled by discussion of a possible reduction in the company's share capital - totalling 14.4m shares with a nominal value of DM720m (Dollars 464.5m), worth DM2.65bn at yesterday's share price - followed by a rights issue. 'This would have a huge negative psychological impact,' said Ms Lynn Reinhardt, a Frankfurt-based analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the UK investment house. Metallgesellschaft also said on Monday that operating profits could exceed DM100m this financial year. However, analysts said the outlook remained too uncertain for clear investment judgments. 'There is at least one further step to go on the smelter side,' said Mr Michael Geiger, an analyst at NatWest Securities in London. 'It's not yet the end of the total restructuring and potential disappointments.' The company's announcement this week also referred to an agreement in principle for the sale of the company's headquarters in central Frankfurt. It is believed that Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, the two main creditor banks, are negotiating to acquire the property - unofficially estimated as being worth some DM750m - to use or sell for development. This solution would speed up the sale, expected to be concluded this calendar year, and enable the proceeds to be booked retrospectively to Metallgesellschaft's accounts for the year ending September 1994. Also awaiting conclusion is the sale or placement of the 47 per cent of Kolbenschmidt, the motor components manufacturer. Talks are taking place with Dana of the US and T&amp;N of the UK.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Son Ki-yong] </F>   [Text] Seoul has given Washington the go-ahead to hold a  third round of U.S.-North Korea talks on condition that  Pyongyang promises to delay the scheduled refueling at a  Yongbyon reactor, a Foreign Ministry official said.    "Pyongyang's promise not to go ahead with the replacement of  spent fuel rods will effectively remove a major hurdle for the  third round of talks," he said.    As Pyongyang has already promised to accept an additional  inspection at the radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon, its  promise almost completely removes stumbling blocks to the  long-delayed talks between the United States and North Korea, he  added.    The second round of talks was held on July 11 last year in  Geneva and the United States promised to support the replacement  of North Korea's graphite moderated reactors with light water  reactors which yield almost no plutonium usable for nuclear  bombs.    Meanwhile, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  sent  a telex to Pyongyang, notifying it that it would send inspectors  in the next few days if the "core discharge campaign is  deferred," according to a copy of the telex message obtained  from the ministry.    "This team is to carry out the activities which the agency  was not enabled to implement during the inspection in March at  the reprocessing plant (radiochemical laboratory). It is  further to perform such activities as the servicing of cameras  and checking of seals," it added.    The international nuclear watchdog called on Pyongyang to  allow "IAEA inspectors to select and secure for measurements  later this year a representative sample of fuel rods."    Pyongyang has strongly opposed the sample-taking at the  reactor, insisting it is not related to the continuity of  safeguards. Therefore, the IAEA's flexibility on the timing of  measurements is apparently designed to bypass Pyongyang's strong  opposition for an early resolution to the nuclear issue.    The IAEA's telex can also be interpreted as a concession to  North Korea because it said last week that it would not send an  inspection team unless North Korea allowed experts to carry out  full tests of the reactor's spent fuel.    Meanwhile, the Foreign Ministry official said that the  inspection of the 5-megawatt reactor will be further discussed  at the third round of talks as insisted by Pyongyang.    However, he expressed a pessimism on the prospects of  Pyongyang agreeing to complete inspections at the nuclear  reactor, which is decisive to determining the state of the North  Korean nuclear development program which started in 1986.    "If the IAEA succeeds in the inspection at the reactor,  North  Korea will completely lose all use of its nuclear card," he said.    So far, North Korea has made use of the "nuclear card" to  secure concessions from South Korea and the United States.    He also denied the possibility that Pyongyang could go ahead  with the refueling of the reactor without international  supervision.    "In that case, Pyongyang would also lose the nuclear card  because it would mean a complete breakdown of all  nuclear-related talks, which would lead to U.N. sanctions," he  said.    Therefore, South Korea and the United States are in the  process of preparing another set of carrots and sticks to remove  all doubts surrounding the North Korean nuclear weapons program.</p>

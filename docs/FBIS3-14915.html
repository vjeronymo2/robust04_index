			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Correspondent Vladimir Fedorov report from Kyrgyzstan; from </F> the "Novosti" newscast]    [Text] It is hard to assess the new schedule for broadcasts  by Kyrgyz State Television as anything other than a stab in the  back for the republic's president. From today, Ostankino  broadcasts are being removed here after the newscast at 2100  local time. Almaty and Tashkent programs, previously carried on  another channel alongside Turkish broadcasts, are replacing  them. Now, Ankara broadcasts solidly between 0900 and 0200 the  next morning in a language that is completely unintelligible to  the overwhelming majority of the Kyrgyz population.    It is, however, intelligible to local television and  communication officials. Ostankino is in arrears for some  reason, whereas the Turks pay up and have even handed over  written-off video cameras as gifts.    It is typical that the squeezing out of Russian programs -  and Mayak has also been subject to this policy - has occurred  during the absence of Askar Akayev, who is now on vacation in  Barvikha outside Moscow following his successful talks with  Boris Yeltsin on the receipt of 75 billion rubles for a program  to prevent the migration of Russians in Kyrgyzstan and to  preserve the use of the Russian language.    As a result of this new assault on Ostankino, the republic's  viewers will this week lose their evening news bulletins on  Thursday and Saturday and also the "Voskresenye" program.</p>

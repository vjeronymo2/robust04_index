Attending the party were provincial leading personnel,  including Gu Jinchi, Quan Shuren, Shang Wen, Xu Wencai, Wen  Shizhen, Yu Junbo, Feng Yousong, Xu Tingsheng, Zhang Rongming,  and Zhang Chenglun; provincial veteran leaders, including Xu  Shaofu, Wang Guangzhong, Ge Xifan, Liu Yiyun, Zhang Yan, and  Shen Xianhui; as well as more than 80 representatives of  intellectuals.    During the party Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial  party  committee, delivered a speech in which on behalf of the  provincial party committee and the provincial people's  government he first extended heartfelt regards and lofty respect  to specialists, scholars, and intellectuals working on various  fronts and in various fields. Gu Jinchi said: The broad masses  of intellectuals are forces relied upon by our country in  conducting socialist undertakings and also the important forces  of conducting reform, opening up, and economic construction. He  urged the broad masses of intellectuals to bring their  enthusiasm and creativeness into full play, to turn as soon as  possible the scientific and technological results into practical  productive forces, and to make more contributions to  accomplishing the second-phase pioneering work. He also urged  party committees and governments at all levels to continuously  and correctly implement in an overall way the policy on  intellectuals by grasping the central tasks of respecting  knowledge and talented personnel. They should often listen to  the opinions, suggestions, and voices raised by the broad masses  of intellectuals and bring into full play their important  advisory role in making scientific policy decisions and in  participating in or discussing governmental and political  affairs. The departments of organizations, propaganda,  personnel affairs, and united front work; as well as science and  technology commission and association should realistically  assume their own responsibility and make concerted efforts to  intensively encourage the society as a whole to support the work  on intellectuals' affairs and to vigorously create a new  situation in the work in this regard.</p>

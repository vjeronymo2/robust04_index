			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Savage Pounds 2m back in the black SAVAGE Group is reaping the rewards of its two-year reorganisation of European businesses with a return to the black in the year to June 30. Yesterday the USM-quoted hardware group announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.02m, against losses of Pounds 115,000 previously. It is also returning to the dividend list with a 0.25p payment and expects that, if it is possible, an interim will be paid for the current half-year. Mr Doug Rogers, who became chairman in the wake of a shareholder revolt in autumn 1990, said: 'We have reduced the company to a solid base from where it can grow.' Pre-tax profits in continuing activities rose 57 per cent to Pounds 2.23m (Pounds 1.42m). When he arrived the balance of Savage's business was half UK and half Europe. Now it was 75 per cent UK, 15 per cent Germany and 5 per cent each for Benelux and the rest of the world. Mr Rogers said that recent interest rate cuts and the fall in sterling against other currencies reinforced the board's cautious optimism about the UK performance in particular and the maintenance of the group's recovery in general. Total turnover fell to Pounds 73.5m (Pounds 123.9m), though in continuing activities it rose 1 per cent to Pounds 69.4m (Pounds 68.8m). There were no exceptional costs (Pounds 494,000) and total interest charges fell to Pounds 1.34m (Pounds 4.09m). There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 2.85m (Pounds 5.13m). Earnings emerged at 0.9p (losses 5.4p).</p>

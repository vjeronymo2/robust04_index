			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Fifty-Six New HIV Cases"] </F>   [Text] Fifty-six new cases of HIV were diagnosed in 1993.  With 90 new cases in 1992 and 58 new cases in 1991 the  development is going as expected.    "The industrialized nations have economic resources and  medical competence and can control the spread of AIDS and HIV.  Developing countries are poor and are unable to do so," noted  Associate Professor Markku Loytonen.    Loytonen and Professor Pauli Leinikki of the Public Health  Institute co-authored the book Kaikki AIDSista [All About  AIDS]. Leinikki also stressed the problems developing  countries struggle with when it comes to preventing the spread  of HIV, as well as Finland's international responsibility.    "Finland should do more on the international level," he said  and mentioned Norway as an example.    Norway has an organization for medicine in developing  countries that uses state funds in its efforts to prevent the  spread of AIDS in Africa.</p>

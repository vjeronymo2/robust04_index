			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Global TV News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori has said he  hopes that U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American  Affairs Alexander Watson, who is arriving on an official visit  to Lima, will objectively evaluate the progress made by Peru,  especially in the struggle against subversion.    [Begin recording] [Fujimori] I hope that Mr. Watson -- who  knows Peru because he was ambassador here during a very  difficult period, during the previous administration -- will  objectively evaluate the situation, the progress that has been  made in the antiterrorist struggle, and the respect there is for  human rights, with the exception of isolated cases that might  have taken place. I sincerely hope that the assistance that has  previously been promised by the United States will be released.    [Reporter] There are reports that the talks on the Lima  Convention between the Peruvian and Chilean negotiators have  been suspended. What can you tell us about this?    [Fujimori] These negotiations are alternatively taking place  in Santiago and Lima. I hope they continue. I think that some  progress has been made. Some details have yet to be worked out.    [Reporter] Are there some discrepancies yet, Mr. President?    [Fujimori] Some points I consider details still remain. We  hope that the interests of both sides can be fully served.    [Reporter] In your speech at the Plaza de Armas on the  anniversary of the city, you said that the [word indistinct] of  Decree 776 divides the country and that it is necessary, in  order not to deprive the municipalities of authority, to repair  that damage. Is this going to be considered?    [Fujimori] Municipal autonomy has not been lessened at all.  What happens is that the tax reform has objectives. We have  always said, I believe with the support of the country, that the  General Sales Tax must be the most important tax. This is a  strictly technical opinion. It has nothing to do with some  interpretations of this. I have been surprised to find that  some provincial mayors have complained about this when the fact  is that they will be able to double or triple their revenues  because of the Municipal Compensation Fund.

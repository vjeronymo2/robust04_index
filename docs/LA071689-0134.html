			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> BODY PARTS NEEDED FOR TRANSPLANTS;  </P> <P> TRADE IN HUMAN ORGANS STIRS GLOBAL ATTENTION  </P> <P> A Turkish peasant claims one of his kidneys was stolen. Philippine prison  inmates trade organs for reduced sentences. Brokers in human body parts take  their cut of a shadowy market.  </P> <P> The forces of supply and demand in the desperate world of organ transplants  have created a commercial trade in human organs that worries health officials  and ethicists worldwide.  </P> <P> The need for organs to replace faltering body parts is growing as research  advances and surgery is more successful. But the number of donated organs has  failed to keep pace. Doctors say too few people die in circumstances that  provide transplantable organs. When they do, relatives are often too grieved to  donate a loved one's organ or object for religious or cultural reasons.  </P> <P> What to do about the organ trade varies. The United States, Japan and West  Germany have banned it. In India, such trade thrives legally. Lawmakers in  Britain and the Philippines have just begun grappling with the matter.  </P> <P> "There simply doesn't seem to be any country that has a public policy to  generate enough organs to meet the demand," said Arthur Caplan, director of the  Center for Biomedical Ethics at the University of Minnesota.  </P> <P> The World Health Organization in May called for a global ban on commercial  trafficking in human organs. Dr. Ursula Lehr, the West German health minister,  spoke for the ban.  </P> <P> "The idea of business-minded brokers taking advantage of the financial distress  of people in the Third World, buying their organs for a pittance and reselling  them to wealthy patients in developed countries, is awful for me," she said.  </P> <P> But some ask, what's wrong if people, fully informed of the risks, decide to  sell one of their organs, for example, a kidney? The question, however, becomes  complicated when the potential donor is desperately poor. People can live with  one kidney, and offers for transplantable kidneys have ranged in individual  instances from $3,000 to $20,000.  </P> <P> "Is it really for us, who are not faced with those difficulties and that  heart-rending decision, to deny people that choice?" Neil Hamilton, a British  lawmaker, asked in recent parliamentary debate.  </P> <P> "It really isn't a choice if you're coerced by poverty," said Caplan, the  Minnesota ethicist.  </P> <P> Others worry that selling organs would decrease the supply of donated organs  and make transplants more expensive in general.  </P> <P> "We believe . . . organs would go to the highest bidder rather than to the  patient who needs them most," said Bernadette Haze, a spokeswoman for the  Netherlands-based Eurotransplant, which matches organ donors and recipients in  the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, West Germany and Austria.  </P> <P> Britain, which has no law controlling the sale of organs, took up the issue  this year after a Turk was arrested in Istanbul for arranging commercial  transplants at a private London hospital. One of the "donors" contended that he  was duped and robbed of his kidney.  </P> <P> The alleged organ broker, Tunc Ay Kunter, was convicted May 18 and sentenced to  two years in prison for brokering the sale of a Turkish peasant's kidney to a  Libyan doctor. Police said Kunter confessed to arranging four such sales when  he was arrested.  </P> <P> Turkish law allows organ donation but outlaws selling, brokering or buying  human organs.  </P> <P> The peasant, Ahmet Koc, who got a two-year suspended sentence, contended that  he went to the hospital for a physical connected to a job offer and thought he  was being anesthetized for the checkup. After the kidney was removed, he said  he was paid the equivalent of $4,267.  </P> <P> British lawmakers have introduced legislation making it a crime to pay or  receive payment for a human organ. Parliament is expected to pass it.  </P> <P> Organ sales are not illegal in the Philippines, but in late May, the vice  president of the Philippine Senate filed a bill to ban sale of human organs and  tissues, calling practitioners "modern-day Draculas."  </P> <P> Filipino Death Row prisoners began donating organs in 1976 as part of a program  to reduce overcrowding without resorting to widespread executions, explained  Pablo Rosales, assistant director of the National Penitentiary. Rosales said  most donor inmates avoided execution and some were freed after spending a few  more years in prison.  </P> <P> When capital punishment was banned in 1987, prisoners started asking for money,  he said. One prisoner who donated a kidney even complained to Rosales that he  received only $95, without the cassette recorder he was promised.  </P> <P> Media attention greatly reduced the number of people seeking prisoners' organs,  Rosales said, and no prisoner has donated a kidney since last year.  </P> <P> But Rosales believes organ sales continue with private donors, most likely poor  slum dwellers.  </P> <P> Dr. Kazuo Ota, chairman of the Japan Society for Transplantation, said he knew  of several patients who had organ transplants in the Philippines and that some  Japanese were acting as organ brokers. Organ sales are banned in Japan.  </P> <P> Dr. Jorge Neumann of the Sao Paulo Heart Institute and a member of the  Brazilian Assn. of Organ Transplants said that "certainly there exists a black  market of organs in Brazil." But he said no statistics on organ sales were  available.  </P> <P> Last fall, reports in foreign newspapers that adoption rings were routinely  buying babies in Third World countries and selling them to American and Israeli  families whose children needed organ transplants prompted outrage from American  officials.  </P> <P> The State Department in October blamed the Soviet Union for the reports and  said a European Parliament resolution criticizing the purported activity was  based on "false and misleading statements and a discredited report by a Soviet  front organization."  </P> <P> In the United States, selling organs has been illegal since 1984, and sentiment  against the practice is high. But allegations of influence-peddling in  arranging precious transplants surface from time to time.  </P> <P> In April, Justice Department investigators said they had dropped an  investigation into accusations that pioneering surgeon Thomas Starzl, head of  transplants at Presbyterian-University and Children's hospitals in Pittsburgh,  had given high-paying foreigners preferential treatment.  </P> <P> The investigation followed newspaper articles that said about 28% of  transplants performed by Starzl's team in 1984-85 were on foreigners who often  weren't as sick as other patients or had waited a shorter time, but who had  paid surgeon's fees four times higher than Americans who had the same  operations.  </P> <P> Caplan argues for regulations to ensure that medical need, rather than money or  influence, determines who gets available organs.  </P> <P> Some in the field say the risk of exploitation would be reduced if a neutral  party, such as government, replaced organ brokers. And donations might increase  with incentives such as compensation to donors or their families for all  medical costs, time lost from work or burial expenses. There could also be a  break on inheritance or other taxes.  </P> <P> Recently, transplant researchers began looking at animal-to-human transplants.  </P> <P> At a May meeting of the American Society of Transplant Physicians, researchers  predicted that pigs would become the main source of donor organs once  cross-species transplantation becomes practical.  </P> <P> "There's always been a shortage of organs and there probably always will be  unless we learn to take them out of animals," said Caplan. "I don't know if  it's going to be biologically feasible, but I think that's the direction we  have to try."  </P></p>

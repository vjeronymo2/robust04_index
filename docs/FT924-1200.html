			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Moi warned over Kenya poll conduct THE Commonwealth observer group yesterday issued a second public warning to the Kenyan government about its pre-election conduct. A statement issued after a meeting with President Daniel arap Moi said the Kenyan leader had been told of the group's 'concern about the continuing dispute over (parliamentary) nominations'. The leader of the group, Mr Justice Telford Georges, told the president the nomination procedure 'is a crucial part of the election process'. Earlier this week the observers said the election process would be 'severely compromised' if opposition candidates prevented from presenting their nomination papers in 45 seats were unable to contest the December 29 elections. Yesterday Mr Justice Georges stressed the importance of the issue, telling the president that 'blocking participation is tilting the table.' Seventeen candidates of the ruling Kanu party have been returned unopposed, but opposition parties are challenging the outcome in the high court. Following a separate meeting with the chairman of the electoral commission, the Commonwealth group said it had pressed for measures 'to strengthen the integrity of the balloting procedure'. Demonstrators blocked streets throughout Zaire's capital with burning tyres and garbage containers yesterday in a mass protest against President Mobutu Sese Seko, Reuter reports from Kinshasa. Troops fired into the air to scatter the crowds, but the capital remained paralysed. The protest was originally urged by Zaire's powerful Christian Lay Committee, which called for a popular uprising to end Mr Mobutu's 27-year rule. The committee revoked the decision on Thursday, but residents went ahead with an apparently spontaneous show of anger against Mr Mobutu's efforts to cling to power.</p>

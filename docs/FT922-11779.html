			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / UK Company News: Bentalls declines to Pounds 1.43m BENTALLS, which operates seven department stores in the south-east of England, saw pre-tax profit fall from Pounds 3.32m to Pounds 1.43m in the year to February 1, as the expected upturn in trade over the last quarter failed to materialise. However, the dividend is maintained at 3.85p - with a final of 3.25p - as the group looked forward to improved retail trading and to the increasing stream of rental income from the Bentall Centre. Turnover edged ahead to Pounds 71m, including the former Lewis's store in Lakeside, Thurrock; the profit took account of a Pounds 346,000 start up deficit there. Earnings per share came to 2.21p (4.87p).</p>

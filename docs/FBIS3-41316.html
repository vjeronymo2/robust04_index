			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [EL TIEMPO editorial: "Hot Money"] </F>   [Text] There has been rather frequent mention in recent  times of the alleged link between money of dubious origin,  generally called "hot money," and the conduct of political  campaigns. The issue has taken on particular relevance in view  of the fact that there will be a series of elections this year  and the campaigns of candidates of all persuasions are in full  swing.    Naturally, to prevent the use of funds and resources of  illicit origin, provisions have been made for campaigns to be  financed according to very explicit standards and controls. But  the infusion of hefty sums of money into these campaigns, money  whose origin has not really been established, has given rise to  complaints about its use. Two specific cases have already been  reported in the departments of Cauca and Atlantico.    There is no question of accepting the accusations at face  value without conducting the necessary investigation. But it is  appropriate, indeed imperative, that the Office of the Treasury  Inspector, which has such a propensity to become distracted by  other matters that appear to be an abuse of authority, devote  its energies to the rigorous oversight that is incumbent upon it  in these cases, as many have urged it to do.    Any possibility that election campaigns, and political  campaigns in general, may be using resources of illicit  provenance should be confronted, investigated, and stopped at  the earliest opportunity. Radical action must be taken; there is  no excuse for any delay whatsoever. If there are any signs  pointing to this possibility, the situation must be clarified  immediately to ensure that campaigns are absolutely clean. The  Office of the Prosecutor General, for its part, should be  equally vigilant to make sure the appropriate legal standards  are strictly upheld, and that penalties for violations are  imposed without leniency.    We understand how difficult it is to pinpoint hot money. But  it is easy to smell it, to feel it: an excessively lavish  campaign carried out by someone who is not that wealthy, someone  who just manages to live on his salary or his inheritance,  someone who is in no position to afford to spend fabulous sums  to get elected. When that happens, "something is rotten in the  state of Denmark." The voters can, should, and must grasp these  subtle nuances in politics, because if the initial election is  corrupt, what happens afterwards will definitely be harmful. The  watchword of democracies in the world today should be to defeat  corrupt or hot money, whatever you want to call it. Otherwise,  democracy will have a hard time surviving.</p>

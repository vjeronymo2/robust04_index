			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> QUESTIONING GROWS HEATED IN EXTORTION TRIAL;  </P> <P> THREATS: A PROSECUTOR ADMITS HE "FIRED NO FATAL ARROWS" DURING THE TRIAL OF TWO  MEN WHO ARE CHARGED WITH MAILING HUNDREDS OF "PAY OR DIE" LETTERS.  </P> <P> A prosecutor spent three hours Wednesday grilling one of two men accused of  mailing hundreds of extortion letters to prominent Antelope Valley residents  last year, alleging that the defendants made an abrupt trip to the East Coast  in order to construct an alibi.  </P> <P> At one point during several combative exchanges in San Fernando Superior Court,  defendant Richard Faroni appeared to contradict testimony by his father that  the defendants gave little advance notice of their trip to Faroni's Connecticut  hometown during the period in late 1988 when the letters were mailed.  </P> <P> But Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen L. Cooley acknowledged Wednesday that he "fired  no fatal arrows" during the cross-examination of Faroni, a former Lancaster  aerospace technician who faces charges of attempted extortion and conspiracy  along with former co-worker Roman Makuch.  </P> <P> Defense attorney William A. Clark said the prosecution assault backfired when  Cooley produced phone company records to counter Faroni's claim that he called  his parents frequently. Faroni responded that he had used a long distance  company; Cooley later conceded that investigators had not obtained records for  that company.  </P> <P> Clark said: "I call that putting yourself out on a limb and getting it hacked  off by someone with a chain saw."  </P> <P> Cooley's duel with Faroni, who served as an Army communications expert because  of his exceptional intelligence and memory, produced the most exciting day of  the month-old trial. Cooley hammered away at the account of a trip from Las  Vegas to Connecticut, where the defendants spent about 10 days, putting them  out of town on Oct. 31, 1988. Prosecutors believe an accomplice mailed the  letters that day after Makuch and Faroni had prepared them.  </P> <P> Cooley suggested it was more than coincidence that Faroni called an  acquaintance in Los Angeles from Connecticut on Oct. 31, noting the  acquaintance told investigators that Faroni left a message that the call was  urgent but then "just talked about the weather."  </P> <P> "Isn't it a fact that you were trying to establish a telephonic record of your  whereabouts, an independent record with an independent witness?" Cooley  demanded.  </P> <P> "I don't see why I would do that," Faroni responded.  </P> <P> Cooley cited preliminary hearing testimony by Faroni's father, Richard Faroni  Sr., to attack Faroni's assertion that his father asked him to come home in a  phone call a week before the trip. The elder Faroni did not mention asking his  son to visit, testifying that the younger Faroni gave no prior warning other  than a phone call Oct. 25 announcing he would be arriving in two days for his  first visit since May, 1985.  </P> <P> The discrepancy shows the trip was intended to provide an out-of-town alibi,  Cooley said.  </P> <P> Judge Ronald S. Coen questioned Faroni about his possession of two CB radios of  the type victims were instructed to purchase in the extortion letters, which  demanded millions of dollars. No money was ever collected.  </P> <P> Faroni testified Tuesday that he bought the radios as gifts for family members  in Connecticut but forgot to bring them. On Wednesday, he told Coen he was  unable to pick up the radios from storage because he and Makuch stopped to help  victims of a car accident on the day of their flight.  </P> <P> Cooley called the testimony inconsistent, saying, "They are trying to  disassociate themselves from the radios because the radios would have been  essential to the extortion plot."  </P></p>

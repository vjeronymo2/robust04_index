			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  LOW TURNOUT IN 50TH DISTRICT EXPECTED  </P> <P> Candidates are working to get out the votes for today's special election for a  vacant seat in the 50th Assembly District. Turnout is expected to be low.  </P> <P> Campaign consultants said turnout could be as low as 15% for the rare February  special election in the district encompassing Inglewood, El Segundo,  Westchester, Lennox and parts of South-Central Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The election pits Curtis Tucker Jr., son of the late Assemblyman Curtis R.  Tucker (D-Inglewood), against Democrats Lois Hill-Hale and Carl McGill and  Republican Mike Davis.  </P> <P> Tucker is regarded as the favorite because of name recognition, a large  fund-raising lead and backing by state Democratic leaders. The special election  was called when the elder Tucker won a posthumous reelection victory in  November, a month after his death from cancer.  </P></p>

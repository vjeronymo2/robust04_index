			<p><P> July 4, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Negotiators for ABC and NABET are scheduled to hold a federally mediated  meeting in New York next Tuesday to discuss ABC's plan to put into effect a  contract that most of the union's members rejected. John Krieger, spokesman for  the National Assn. of Broadcast Employees and Technicians, says he doesn't know  what will occur after the meeting, though no walkout seems imminent. The  union's 2,150 full-time and 300 part-time members at ABC have yet to take a  strike vote. They have been working without a contract since March 31, when  their old one expired. NABET, which struck NBC for 17 weeks in 1987, last  struck ABC in 1977 in a walkout that lasted 20 weeks. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

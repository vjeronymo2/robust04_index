			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Khrustov; ``Bauman Probably Will Become </F> a State Scientific Center'']    [Text] It is desirable that a State Scientific Center be  established on the basis of the famed Moscow State Technical  University [formerly the Moscow Higher Technical School] imeni  N. E. Bauman. That is the unanimous conclusion reached by  participants in a joint session of the boards of the Ministry of  Science and Technical Policy and the State Committee for Higher  Education of Russia. This was a field session which was held at  the Bauman Institute because it examined the problem of use of  the scientific potential of the oldest technical school of  higher education in the country.    The Bauman Institute--today a technical university--needs no  special introduction: almost all the creators of aviation and  rocket-space technology have graduated from its walls. But not  many probably know that the Central Aerohydrodynamics Institute,  Moscow Aviation Institute and Moscow Systems Research Institute  (as well as many other institutions of higher education) are  ``daughter'' enterprises of the Bauman Institute.    Today the technical university is experiencing difficult  times. A sharp reduction in budgeted financing and orders for  scientific research development work (during the last 3-4 years  orders have decreased by a factor of 4-6) urgently dictate that  additional measures be taken for preserving the scientific  potential of the university, its scientific schools and the  material-technical base. Incidentally, the latter by many  criteria is unique. This applies, in particular, to the  academic-experimental center of the university in Dmitrovskiy  Rayon of the capital region, which in essence has today become a  scientific city.    The understanding that a further lag in the development of  science and education is fraught with irretrievable losses for  society is today determining, as was noted by Igor Fedorov,  academician ANS, rector of the Moscow State Technical  University, in a conversation with a ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI  correspondent, the principal directions in the development of  scientific research in the university and its activity as a  whole.    The guests were shown an exhibit displaying the latest  development work by the scientists and specialists of the Bauman  Institute. Among the new materials and technologies, instruments  and machines there are more than a few which are unique. For  example, a robotized complex, better than its foreign analogues,  has proven its worth in work on elimination of the consequences  of the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.</p>

			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / UK talks offer on Hong Kong Britain is proposing fresh talks with China later this month to try to bridge outstanding differences on Hong Kong, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said yesterday. In a conciliatory statement to the House of Commons, Mr Hurd left MPs in no doubt that the government backed Governor Chris Patten's decision to defy Beijing by pushing ahead with the first stage of his democracy legislation. But he claimed there was 'no argument' with China over the principle that Hong Kong's democratic institutions should continue to develop - just over how the principle should be 'turned into practical arrangements'. Mr Hurd said Britain had offered 'important moves' over 17 rounds of talks to accommodate Chinese views on issues relating to its resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997, without compromising 'essential' British requirements. The underlying question was simple: would Britain bequeath to Hong Kong 'an open and democratic system offering the electorate a genuine choice' or 'a system based on small electorates open to manipulation and corruption'? The next meeting between British and Chinese officials is due to take place in London today but officials in Hong Kong expect little headway. The meeting of the Joint Liaison Group - a bilateral forum for processing the practical aspects of Hong Kong's transfer to China - comes against a background of escalating Chinese hostility towards British administration in the territory. The two governments are at odds over Mr Patten's plans for democracy in the colony, a dispute which has bedevilled bi-lateral co-operation. Mr Patten is expected to gazette the first stage of democracy legislation on Friday, before its formal presentation in the Legislative Council, the colony's law-making body, next Wednesday. This week's meeting is seen in Hong Kong as a test of China's promise not to let differences about the colony's political development get in the way of broader factors.</p>

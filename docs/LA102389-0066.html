			<p><P> October 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POWER-SHARING PLAN APPROVED FOR LEBANON  </P> <P> Breaking a three-week deadlock in talks for ending Lebanon's civil war, the  Lebanese Parliament agreed Sunday on a historic political reform plan that will  for the first time share power equally between Christians and Muslims.  </P> <P> The plan, given unofficial approval just before midnight after last-minute  consultations with Damascus, also provides for withdrawal of Syrian forces to  eastern Lebanon. And there is a guarantee that Lebanon's national sovereignty,  eclipsed by 14 years of civil war and a long procession of foreign occupation  troops, will eventually be restored.  </P> <P> "Thanks be to God that we have reached this point. After 23 days of hard work,  night and day, we are now in final agreement," Youssef Hammoud, a Shiite Muslim  deputy, told reporters as Lebanese journalists broke into applause.  </P> <P> The future of the plan was far from certain, however. Lebanon's Christian  leader, Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, said in Beirut that it does not meet his  demands.  </P> <P> Even before the 61 deputies convened a full session to finalize the details of  the compromise peace plan, Arab League envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi flew to Beirut to  deliver word of the accord to the heads of Lebanon's two embattled governments  -- Aoun, who heads the army, and his Muslim rival, Salim Hoss.  </P> <P> Parliament is scheduled to convene a final session Tuesday in the Saudi port  city of Jidda to endorse the new national reconciliation charter before  returning to Beirut to officially adopt it and begin putting the reforms into  effect.  </P> <P> But even with agreement on opening the doors to Lebanon's Muslim majority and  phasing out the religious sectarianism that has so divided the country, the  fledgling plan still faces trouble in Beirut, where Aoun over the past several  days has remained stubbornly opposed.  </P> <P> Aoun said at a news conference that the plan does not meet his demands for a  specific timetable for Syria's withdrawal from Lebanon, the Associated Press  reported from Beirut. He said that he accepts political changes giving more  power to Muslims, "but I reject the part concerning Lebanese sovereignty. We  don't know what the Syrian role will be in Lebanon -- what for and how long."  </P> <P> Aoun proposed putting the peace plan to a referendum of the Lebanese people  since, he asserted, the parliamentary deputies "exceeded their jurisdiction and  legal powers by voting in . . . ambiguities that compromise Lebanon's  sovereignty."  </P> <P> There was no immediate reaction from Hoss, the AP reported.  </P> <P> Unexpectedly, Muslim militia representatives who had repeatedly denounced the  charter's failure to immediately abolish the religious basis for political  power in Lebanon said they would support the reform plan, with reservations.  </P> <P> "We shall struggle by logic, not by arms," declared Zaher Khatib, whose  National Front includes the Shiite movement Amal and the Druze sect, a Muslim  offshoot. "We will not be an obstacle to the reconciliation."  </P> <P> Maronite Christian deputies appealed Sunday to the Vatican and to Lebanon's  Christian patriarch to help coalesce support for the compromise, which would  end the Maronites' 46-year domination of Lebanon in exchange for the hope of  peace.  </P> <P> The reform talks convened in this Saudi mountain resort on Sept. 30, shortly  after an Arab League committee negotiated a cease-fire in Aoun's six-month-long  "war of liberation" and drafted a proposed charter for reforming the imbalance  of political power in Lebanon that has fueled the civil war.  </P> <P> Christian deputies had resisted any move to relinquish their authority,  however, as long as the plan contained no firm timetable for withdrawal of the  40,000 Syrian troops that now control two-thirds of the country and, through  Damascus, dominate much of the decision-making in Lebanon.  </P> <P> The compromise plan provides at least that Syrian troops will withdraw into the  Bekaa region of eastern Lebanon within two years of the adoption of a new  government and political reforms, with the precise timing and location of the  withdrawal to be worked out by a joint Lebanese-Syrian military committee.  </P> <P> But Christian East Beirut deputies remained opposed early Sunday to a proposal,  backed by Syria, to increase the number of deputies in the Parliament to 128  from 99. The Christians have insisted that the National Assembly be limited to  108 members.  </P> <P> Under either scenario, the Parliament would be evenly divided between Muslims  and Christians, but Lebanon's old-line politicians, heavily represented among  the Christians, have perceived a large infusion of new deputies, many of whom  would come from the warring militia groups that now rule Lebanon, as a threat  to the nation's traditional power brokers.  </P> <P> Perhaps more importantly, the 128-deputy scenario contains a provision that  would allow, for the first time, three of the 64 Muslim deputies to be  Alawites, a Shiite sect of which Syria's president, Hafez Assad, is a member.  Muslim seats now are allocated among Sunnis, Shiites and Druze.  </P> <P> Presumably, three Alawite seats in the Parliament would give Assad a direct  pipeline into the national government, and Christian deputies held off on any  approval until Syria reportedly agreed Sunday not to insist on the 128-deputy  plan, according to sources close to the Christian faction.  </P> <P> The sources said that Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, Prince Saud al Faisal,  telephoned Syria's foreign minister Sunday and relayed Syria's assent on the  108-seat Parliament to the Christian deputies, who then unanimously agreed to  the reform plan.  </P> <P> Once the plan went before the full Parliament Sunday night, there was  additional opposition from two deputies representing the National Front.  </P> <P> Militia leaders and their parliamentary advocates have objected to the  charter's failure to provide for a rapid end to the religious sectarianism that  has been both a basis for political power in Lebanon and one of its primary  sources of conflict.  </P> <P> Traditionally, Lebanon's president has been a Maronite Christian, its prime  minister a Sunni Muslim and its Parliament Speaker a Shiite, but there is no  similar position for the Druze sect.  </P> <P> The political reform plan calls for the president, prime minister and Speaker  to form a committee to discuss abolishing sectarianism in the government.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> Since 1975, Lebanon has been at war with itself, a conflict marked by political  upheavals, coups, assassinations and an Israeli invasion. In 1976, a  30,000-member Arab peacekeeping force dominated by Syrian troops moved in to  reinforce a cease-fire between Maronite Christian and Muslim forces. Syria has  been there ever since. The latest conflict began in mid-March, and the fighting  between the Christian forces of Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun and an alliance of  Lebanese Druze and Syrian troops has been marked by fearsome artillery  exchanges, with nearly 900 Lebanese killed and another 4,000 wounded. Much of  Beirut, the capital that was once hailed as the Paris of the Mideast, has been  reduced to rubble.  </P></p>

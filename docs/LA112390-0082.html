			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLIDAY GETS OFF TO DEADLY START -- 13 DIE IN STATE TRAFFIC  </P> <P> At least 13 people died in traffic accidents on California streets and highways  during the first 12 hours of the Thanksgiving Day weekend, compared to three  fatalities during the same period last year, the California Highway Patrol said  Thursday.  </P> <P> Drunk-driving arrests also were up in the period, beginning at 6 p.m. Wednesday  and ending at 6 a.m. Thursday.  </P> <P> Last year, there were 420 arrests in the 12-hour period, compared to 503 this  year, said CHP spokesman Robert Strong.  </P> <P> Six of this holiday's deaths occurred on roads and freeways in CHP  jurisdiction. "All the people who died were not wearing seat belts," said  Strong.  </P> <P> The other deaths occurred in local jurisdictions not patrolled by the CHP. One  woman was killed when her compact car collided with a tanker-truck on the  Pacific Coast Highway in Long Beach and burst into flames, police said.  </P> <P> Witnesses said the unidentified woman's car ran a red light at Santa Fe Avenue  early Thursday morning and hit a truck filled with gasoline that was headed  east on the coast road. The woman was trapped in her car and burned to death,  police said.  </P> <P> Two more highway deaths were reported later Thursday in a head-on collision  east of the Antelope Valley community of Llano. A 9-year-old girl and a  teen-age girl in one car were killed and six other people were hurt in the  collision on Highway 138 near the San Bernardino County line.  </P> <P> Spokesmen said it was too early to know whether the upward trend in deaths  indicates that the totals for the four-day holiday will surpass 1989 when 68  traffic deaths were recorded.  </P></p>

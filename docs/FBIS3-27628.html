Contrary to popular  belief that Guangdong will further dismantle the "birdcage"  imposed by Beijing over the operation of the economy, Mr Lu said  the province would stay in tune with the central authorities in  the next round of reform.    In financial reform Guangdong will seek to establish an  overseas Chinese bank and a provincial bank.    Guangdong shared much of the same policies with other  provinces in areas such as restrictions on foreign financial  institutions, control over the retail market, and a state  monopoly over the telecommunications industry.    Mr Lu defended Beijing's latest reform measures on tax  revenue and exchange rates, saying these policies would help set  a level playing field for all competitors.    Guangdong, according to the Vice-Governor, was still special  because it had a better economic foundation more experience in  the operation of a market economy and close proximity to Hong  Kong. "Central versus regional", and "liberalisation versus  controls", are two major themes dominating the Eighth Guangdong  People's Congress. While many congress delegates urged the  provincial government to Strike a better deal with Beijing over  issues such as taxation and banking reform, an equally large  contingent demanded a more aggressive government in dealing with  inflation.    Although Mr Lu admitted Guangdong was haunted by inflation,  he said this was the price the province had to pay in order to  develop. "High-speed growth will always lead to a certain degree  of inflation. But I believe this is better than keeping prices  at a very low level and a stagnated growth rate. The question  now is whether the government can adopt effective measures to  keep price increases in check."    These measures, according to the Vice-Governor, include  strict control over capital investments and retail markets and  increased supplies of staple products. He claimed these  restrictive policies would not hurt foreign investors and  promised no change to the five-year tax breaks promised in  China's joint-venture law.</p>

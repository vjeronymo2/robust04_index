			<p>Language: <F P=105> Estonian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Another round of Estonian-Russian talks will  open today at Lohusalu. It will last for two days. [passage  omitted]    According to the Baltic desk officer at the Russian Foreign  Ministry, Aleksandr (Udaltsev), Russia has not taken upon itself  any obligations regarding a troop withdrawal deadline. The key  obstacle in the interstate talks is the fact that several sets  of documents have so far not been signed. Russia is aiming for  a social guarantees agreement for Russian military pensioners  and their family members to be concluded at the same time as a  timetable and a deadline for the Russian troop withdrawal are  set. According to (Udaltsev), the talks opening today must  focus precisely on these issues.    The Foreign Ministry of the Republic of Estonia received  yesterday's statement of Aleksandr (Udaltsev), a Russian Foreign  Ministry employee, with amazement. The Foreign Ministry finds  that the content of (Udaltsev)'s statement is in conflict with  both the CSCE and UN documents, as well as with Russian previous  statements. The Estonian side is the more surprised by Russia's  behavior because during the latest rounds of talks the Estonian  side had made concessions on the issue of the troop withdrawal  deadline, without possessing a satisfactory timetable. The  statement of the Estonian Foreign Ministry notes that hopefully  (Udaltsev)'s statement must be seen as a position of a Russian  diplomat on the eve of another round of talks, so as to  influence the talks. Should this, however, become Russia's  official position then the issue of suspending the talks will be  seriously on the agenda, due to Russia's unconstructive behavior.</p>

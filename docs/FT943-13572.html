			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Cultural trends in German equity markets Sir, On July 14 I attended a manufacturing engineering conference where discussion centred on the competitiveness of European industry. We consistently heard examples both from the speakers and from the floor of long-term views and solid investment in Germany (and elsewhere) and the lack of such investment and vision in the UK. It was typical that on the same day I should find a report in the FT, by David Waller, on the lack of a share culture in Germany, as if it were some kind of disability ('Resisting the bait of equity ownership'). I think what he meant was that they don't have a share trading culture - because they recognise that wealth creation is a product of custodianship in which share trading can only ever be secondary. Do we get a balancing article on the lack of an ownership culture in the UK? Jim Platts, department of engineering, University of Cambridge, Mill Lane, Cambridge CB2 1RX</p>

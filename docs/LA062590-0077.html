			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE AND MUSIC;  </P> <P> MARTIN CO. SOARS WITH 'ALVIN,' STRUGGLES WITH 'VISIONS' AT INNER CITY  </P> <P> When they're good, the Martin Dancers/Dancnicians are very good, but when  they're bad, they reek. Over the weekend at the Inner City Cultural Center,  they were both.  </P> <P> There was an arresting premiere of a lengthy selection from Section A of "A  Suite for Alvin", an athletic exploration of the techniques developed by Alvin  Ailey's mentor, the late Lester Horton.  </P> <P> Reportedly inspired by a request from Ailey to Shirley Martin to develop  choreography based on her experience with Horton's method, the dance is a  free-flowing study in style. Solos and duets focus on groups of movements --  floor moves, balances, the so-called "primitive squat" -- as distinct motifs  began to mirror and complement one another, like jazz musicians on a roll.  </P> <P> While "A Suite for Alvin" was marred by a few obtuse vocalizations, the second  half of the program was filled by a work nearly all chat and almost no dance: a  wretchedly hokey dance-drama called "VISIONS . . . it never was" (1983,  restaged 1990).  </P> <P> This melodrama -- narrated by insipid dialogue fragments -- takes place in the  warehouse abode of a crazy recluse (Martin) and her family of mannequins.  </P> <P> It was hard to believe that it was the same Martin who choreographed "A Suite  for Alvin."  </P> <P> One hopes the newer creation (which is part of a total of eight hours of  choreography yet to be performed) is a sign that Martin is heading back to what  she does best: unadulterated dance in the Horton-Ailey tradition.

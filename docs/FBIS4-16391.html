			<p>BFN     [Text] The Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev left for the  Russian capital today to attend the meeting of the CIS heads of  state in Moscow. The Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev and  those accompanying him on the trip were seen off at Baku's Bina  Airport by Rasul Guliyev, chairman of the Republic's Supreme  Soviet; Afiaddin Dzhalilov, deputy chairman of the Republic's  Supreme Soviet; deputy prime ministers, ministers, and other  officials. The Azerbaijani leader granted an interview to our  correspondent Beshir Sherifov at the airport.    [Begin recording] [Sherifov] Mr. President, you are leaving  for an official visit to Moscow and will hold talks with the  heads of state of CIS countries. What will the benefit of these  talks be for Azerbaijan?    [Aliyev] As you know, we are going to attend the regular  meeting of the CIS. The CIS heads of state will discuss matters  on the agenda of the meeting. We will take part in these  discussions. A number of important problems will be discussed  there. We have our own views on these issues. However, during  this meeting I mainly intend to raise once again the need to  prevent Armenia's aggression against Azerbaijan. This is  because, as I said, a war between CIS members is abnormal, it is  an abnormal situation. Therefore, this issue is my main  concern. I consider it more important than other issues,  because Armenia's Armed Forces offensive against Azerbaijan is  continuing. Intensive attacks were also launched yesterday.  Before arriving here at the airport in the morning, I contacted  the commanders at the front. The Armenian Armed Forces are  continuing their attacks today. They are not stopping their  aggressive actions and intentions. I intend to raise these  issues in strong terms. I also want to state that our military  units and fighters are able to resist the attacks of the  Armenian Armed Forces and are dealing them deserved replies and  blows. However, sadly enough, the Armenian side still fails to  draw the necessary conclusion from this.    I addressed the nation and the entire world on 12 April on  Armenia's aggression. Reports coming in yesterday showed that  my appeal to the world has been positively received. We have  already received reaction from various countries. However, what  pleases me most is that our people, the Azerbaijani citizens,  have highly appraised this address. The commander of the troops  headquarters at the front, deputy defense minister, commander of  the troops in Agdere [Mardakertskiy] and Geranboy  [Shaumyanovskiy], and other commanders informed me last night  that after my address many of the deserters returned to the Army  yesterday and are taking part in the fighting. A certain sector  informed me yesterday that more than 100 deserters have  returned. I highly appreciate such a thing. And therefore, I  gave orders yesterday that they be pardoned for the crime they  committed by deserting. And, now through the television I am  addressing our young people who have deserted or evaded the  mobilization: Let them come to their senses and follow the path  of those young people who have taken the correct path. I was  very pleased when informed at night that the deserters are now  returning to their units. This means that our people and youth  are acting with reason and conscience. I believe that some of  them might have fallen onto the wrong path out of objective  reasons, inexperience, or youthfulness. However, what is  satisfying is that they are now becoming aware of their  responsibilities.    In one word, our army units are standing firm on the fronts.  The attacks resumed early this morning. However, these attacks  are being checked and repulsed, and I am sure that it will  continue to be thus and our homeland will be defended. However,  as I said on 12 April and I am saying now, we want to put an end  to the war. I have invited the Armenian side to peace talks.  After an hour I will be in Moscow and there I will make the  same call to the leadership of both Armenia and Russia, and  other CIS leaders. Let us see. I have not lost hope, and I  expect that our views would produce some positive results.    [Sherifov] Cables arriving at Azerbaijan television prove  that your address to the nation was well received and the people  are expecting much from your meeting in Moscow.    [Aliyev] I also have such an expectation. We will see. [end  recording]</p>

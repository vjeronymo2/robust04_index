			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Chen Zhenji (7115 2182 1015) from Consulting </F> Group on Technology and Trade of Ministry of Foreign Economic  Relations and Trade and Tang Chuanfeng (3282 0278 6912) from  University of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade: "Report on  Survey of 11 Enterprises in Anhui"]    [Text] Enterprises are the main bodies of various economic  activities. The development of enterprises, particularly the  large and medium-sized ones, directly affect the growth of our  overall economy and the realization of the "four modernization"  program. Therefore, how to invigorate large and medium-sized  enterprises is a major event of universal concern in the whole  country. With regard to this issue, we carry out some  investigation and studies in some prefectures and cities such as  Hefei, Chuzhou, Wuhu and Xuancheng from April to May this year.  We called on the leading comrades of the Anhui provincial  committee on economic affairs and trading and the aforementioned  prefectural and city committees in this connection, visited a  number of factories and enterprises, tried to understand the  situation in the development and analyze the existing problems  of 11 plants and companies including the Chang Jiang Electric  Appliance Group Corporation and the Hefei Fork Lift Plant, and  held discussion meetings with relevant plant directors and  managers. We now summarize the situation as follows:  <H5>  I. Some Enterprises' Good Experience in Developing Themselves </H5>   1. They attach importance to the role of science and  technology in developing themselves.    Anhui is originally fairly backward economically and  technologically. The scientific and technological standards of  most of the factories and enterprises in Anhui are much lower  than the world advanced level. Even compared with China's other  provinces and coastal areas, Anhui also lags behind in the field  of science and technology. This kind of situation has seriously  hampered the development of some enterprises. After carrying out  reform and opening up the country to the outside world, some  enterprises in Anhui have realized the significant role of  science and technology in developing themselves. In order to  rapidly narrow the gap between their scientific and  technological level and that of China's other provinces and the  world, they have adopted the following measures:    a. They have imported and purchased a large number of  suitable advanced technological equipment. According to a rough  estimate of the resources of the 11 plants and enterprises, they  have imported or purchased most of their technological equipment  in China or from abroad. They imported 41 percent of such  equipment from abroad, purchased about 38 percent of such  equipment from domestic sources, and developed and manufactured  about 20 percent of such equipment themselves. Naturally the  import of technological equipment costs the enterprises a great  deal, but it saves money in doing research and development. More  important is the fact that it would save the enterprises the  time in doing their own research and development and help them  raise their technical and production standards within a short  period of time. For example, the Hefei Fork Lift Truck Plant was  built in 1958. It began to manufacture fork lift trucks from  1963. Up to 1982, the annual output of fork lift trucks was  still approximately 100, the production quality was low, and  there were not many varieties. In 1985, this plant and the Baoji  Fork Lift Truck Manufacturing Company joined efforts to import  the technology in manufacturing Japan's TCMI-10T balanced  diesel-engine fork lift trucks. After six years of hard work to  assimilate foreign technology and develop painstaking technical  innovations, the production technology of the plant had reached  the world level of the 1980's, and its annual output of such  trucks rose to 3,400. Right now, the plant has maintained the  highest record in history in terms of production value, output,  total volume of sales, taxes and profits, earnings in foreign  exchange and other norms in the manufacture of fork lift trucks.  It ranks top among all fork lift truck producing plants in the  country. Another example is the Chang Jiang Electric Appliances  Group Company (formerly the Chang Jiang Refrigerator Plant).  During the period of the Sixth 5-year Plan, its name was changed  to the Chang Jiang Electric Appliance Group Company. It had  developed on the foundation of an outmoded iron and steel plant  in 1984. At that time, its technology was backward, and it was  short of funds at all times. Later, the company to import a  refrigerator manufacturing technology from Italy with a loan of  US$3 million. By importing and assimilating such technology, it  had improved most of its manufacturing technology to the  standards of the late 1980's. It had also added one more  production line by improving the imported technology and relying  on their own efforts. Right now, about 10 percent of its  products are medium and high-level technology-intensive, while  35 percent of its products are medium-level  technology-intensive. It has also continuously raised its  production efficiency. In 1992, its total output value reached  552.7 million yuan with a per-capita output value of 105,600  yuan. It turned over 36.08 million yuan of taxes and profits to  the state during that year.    b. They have paid full attention to developing technical  innovations.    Prior to reform and opening-up, the technological  equipment of some of the enterprises in China remained outmoded  in general, and their productivity low. Anhui was of no  exception. In order to improve productivity of the existing  enterprises, Anhui instilled new vitality into those old plants  by encouraging "technical innovations." Let us take the Chang  Jiang Electric Appliance Company as an example. Dissatisfied  with the technical standard of the original production line for  refrigerators, the company relied on its own technical forces to  develop technical innovations on its existing production line,  and trial-produced many new equipment such as the side panel  production line, computerized thermometer production line, the  bubbling production line and the painting production line. It  modernized all its production facilities. Another example is the  Tongling Film Plant. It had paid full attention to technical  innovations since 1983. It imported a total of seven  sophisticated production lines from Japan, Germany, Britain,  Italy and other countries such as the induction foil production  line, the inductionless foil production line, the metallization  production line and the AC capacitor production line, and became  the only enterprise in China's electronics industry, which  produces "thin film--metallic film--thin film capacitor" by  linking production, processing and marketing to form an  integrated whole. Its advanced equipment and technology greatly  helped improve production quality and productivity. Seven of its  products won provincial prizes, while five of them won  ministerial citations. One of its products won a national silver  medal. It was rated as one the nation's Second Grade Enterprises  in 1990. This old enterprise has many new features.    c. They have imported technology in the form of joint  ventures.    By importing technology in the form of joint ventures,  they have not only solved the problems of funds and technology,  but also whipped up the enthusiasm of both sides of joint  ventures which share profits as well as risks. Thus, production  quality and economic performances of such joint ventures have  been improved. For example, three companies including the Hefei  Fork Lift Truck Plant and Japan's TCM Company established the  Andong Casting Company Limited in 1990. It has gone into  operation now. Its production quality accords with the demands  of the Japanese market. Its products are popular in Japan, thus  changing the situation whereas fork lift trucks were only being  exported to markets in the third world. Let us take the Chang  Jiang Electric Appliance Group Company as an example again. In  recent years, it made use of its land, factory buildings, public  utility facilities, the abundant local natural resources and  cheap labor to attract foreign investments and set up more than  10 Sino-foreign joint ventures and helped the advanced  technology and equipment from foreign countries quickly play  their role in increasing production and improving work  efficiency.    2. They improve management and efficiency by relying on  scientific management.    Strengthening management with a scientific approach  involves all the departments in production and management. For  example, the import, installation and testing of technological  equipment and the opening of the market need management. It is  necessary to manage personnel and financial affairs as well as  material resources. Efforts must be made to control production  quality and the distribution of profits. In short, only by  managing the various activities of an enterprise with a  scientific approach, will it be possible to help an enterprise  develop itself and improve its production efficiency. All these  enterprises which we had surveyed paid full attention to their  work in doing scientific management through which they had  improved their work efficiency to varying degrees. Their typical  methods used are as follows:    The methods used by the Anhui Tire Plant are: A) Reform  the management system and run the plant in a modern way; B)  Improve its operating mechanism and its system of performance  appraisal and clearly define the limits of the authority of the  plant and each of its department and office; C) Improve its  system of quality control and implement a system of veto power  in this connection; D) Facilitate the flow of information for  technology in production and for marketing, continuously develop  new products and stop producing products that are  technologically obsolete. The best way used by the Anhui  Technology Import and Export Corporation in strengthening its  management with a scientific approach is to link its efficiency  with the benefits of its workers. As a result, it has whipped up  the enthusiasm of all its workers and truly permitted its  workers to participate in its management work.    The best way used by the Anhui Fork Lift Truck in  carrying out scientific management is reflected in assimilating  imported technology and improving upon it. A) It carefully  studies the technologies to be imported, make good selections,  and carry out its work well in negotiating and signing  contracts. B) It also tries to get price quotations from  different suppliers and ensures that the technology to be  imported is not only suited to China's national conditions but  also comparatively lower in price. In assimilating imported  technologies, it has ensured the supply of funds and  strengthened administrative work in this purpose. (This plant  has set up an office led by the plant director for assimilating  imported technologies and developing technical innovations.) C)  It vigorously strengthens its work in improving imported  technologies and introducing new ideas, and pays full attention  to users' feedback on its products. It also tries its best to  improve those parts and accessories which fail to satisfy the  needs of the users. In the course of assimilating imported  technologies, it has actively developed new products. During the  past six years in which foreign technologies were imported, the  plant had marketed 34 new varieties of fork lift trucks.    Methods used by the Quanjiao Diesel Engine Plant are as  follows:    A) It builds its workshops with a standardized  scientific design.    B) In allocating its building funds, it gives higher  priority to workshops and lower priority to office buildings.  (The construction of its office buildings was postponed three  times, because the funds earmarked for the building of office  buildings were used to build workshops.    C) In production management, it follows a path of  diversification, and continuously develops new products.    3. They attach importance to the role of the market.    Although the market belongs to the sphere of commodity  circulation, it plays a significant role in promoting  production. Enterprises must obtain their new technologies and  equipment from the market. They must also attract scientific and  technical personnel from the market. They must test on the  market their new products which they developed with the new  technologies. The value of their products must be determined by  the market, while the consumers also use the market to send in  their feedback to the enterprises. In short, enterprises cannot  separate themselves from the market. All the enterprises in  Anhui which are well developed scientifically and technically  take the market as a guiding factor and pay attention to the  role of the market. Let us take the Hefei Fork Lift Truck Plant  as an example. On the basis of the needs on the domestic and  international markets, it has imported the necessary  technologies and equipment, and assimilated and improved upon  them. Within a short period of few years, it has developed more  than 30 new models of fork lift trucks which are readily  marketable. Its export market has been diverted from the  low-priced markets in the Third World to the medium and  high-priced markets in Western Europe, North America and  Southeast Asia. The number of fork lift trucks exported to  Western Europe alone accounted for 78 percent of its total  amount of exports in 1992. In order to consolidate and expand  its markets of sales, it has maintained ties with 16 companies  in 11 countries abroad and set up steady sales channels. It is  also making preparations to set up assembly plants and sales and  service centers abroad. On the one hand, this is aimed at  establishing a channel for export on a long term basis. On the  other hand, it is also aimed at sending the information on  foreign markets back to China and continuously producing readily  marketable products. Again let us take the Chang Jiang Electric  Appliance Group Company as an example. It has established an  import and export department and set up offices in Hong Kong and  other localities in charge of importing technologies and doing  export work. All its products are market-oriented. It closely  follows the needs of the market to change its models in order to  satisfy the market demands. For example, the Anhui Tire Plant  closely watches the famous brands on the domestic and foreign  markets. It relies on its technologies to rapidly change the  varieties of its products. Thus it is able to expand its market  and continuously improve its efficiency. The total output value  of the aforementioned three enterprises reached 1.15 billion  yuan; and paid taxes and turned their profits to the state  totalling 170 million yuan in 1992.    4. They pay attention to the role of professionally  trained people    Men play a major role in the development of social  activities and productive forces. They are indispensable in  developing science and technology, managing enterprises with a  scientific approach and opening up the market. Competitions in  science and technology and in market are, after all,  competitions for professionally trained people. Some enterprises  in Anhui used favorable terms to attract professionally trained  people; spend a great deal of money to train them; and  respected, cherished and put them in various important  positions. As a result, these enterprises have attained notable  economic results and drawn benefits from their practice in  cherishing professionally trained people. For example, the Hefei  Washing Machine Plant was founded in 1984. At that time, it had  only a handful of professionally trained people and poor  production equipment. Its business was not so good. In 1986, it  started to import technologies and equipment from Japan.  However, it is necessary to rely on professionally trained  people to make full use of advanced technologies and equipment.  Only by doing so will it be possible to accomplish good economic  results. Lack of professionally trained people means lack of  technology. Thus, this plant made use of various favorable terms  to attract professionally trained people and encourage them to  work for the plant. The plant clearly spelled out the following  favorable terms: 1) Housing will be provided to any college  graduate during the first year when he or she is hired. His or  her wage will be two grades higher than that offered by other  plants. 2) The bonus issued to technical personnel is 20 percent  higher than that to ordinary workers. These favorable terms had  attracted a large number of professionally trained people. Right  now, this plant has 211 technicians including 11 high-ranking  technical personnel and 200 medium-ranking technical personnel,  accounting for 0.5 percent and 10 percent respectively of the  total number of workers in the plant. The total output value of  this plant reached 230 million yuan and its per-capita output  value totalled 140,000 yuan in 1992. It delivered profits and  paid taxes to the state totalling 41 million yuan in 1992. The  Hefei Fork Lift Truck Plant pays full attention to the training  of qualified professionals. It sent out more than 100 people to  Japan for training. When its cadres returned home from abroad,  they brought back tools and reference materials instead of major  home appliances. Another experience of the plant is that the  training of qualified professionals must be three to four years  ahead of schedule. Only by doing so, will it be possible to  maintain a predominant position in technical management.  Advanced technological equipment must be operated and handled by  well trained technical personnel. Only by doing so, will it be  possible to turn advanced technological equipment into actual  productive forces and ensure the fine quality of the products.  <H5>  II. Existing Problems in Developing Enterprises </H5>   The aforementioned plants have different ways in developing  themselves, while they too have their own problems. These  problems are even more outstanding in other backward enterprises  in Anhui.    A. There exist problems and difficulties in enterprises    1. There is a shortage of engineers and technicians,  seriously affecting the technical developments in various  enterprises.    The aforementioned 11 plants are enterprises with a  comparatively large number of scientific and technical personnel  in Anhui. However, the number of their scientific and technical  personnel only totals 2,165, accounting for 7.9 percent of the  total number of workers. The percentage of high-technological  personnel is even smaller -- only 0.77 percent. This percentage  is far below the requirement for a modernized enterprise. It is  understood that the percentage of technical personnel in the  total amount of workers is even smaller in other enterprises in  Anhui. The shortage of scientific and technical personnel has  made enterprises even more difficult to develop new technology,  change new models, improve production quality and raise the  added value of their products.    2. There are not enough investments in doing research  and development work. This has seriously affected the  enterprises' reserve strength for development.    In recent years, the aforementioned 11 enterprises spent  14.224 million yuan each year on research and development, a  mere 0.53 percent of their total output value and 4.28 percent  of the amount of their profits and taxes paid to the state. As  compared with some enterprises in the developed countries, they  spend much less on research and development. Right now, the more  technically advanced enterprise, the greater attention it pays  to research and development. This kind of enterprise believes  that investments on machinery and equipment only affect its  immediate interests, but research and development will affect  its future. If our enterprises pay little attention to research  and development, they would have little reserve strength for  future development.    3. There is a great shortage of professionals in foreign  trade. This hampers the enterprises in dealing with the world  market.    China has implemented the reform and opening-up policy,  delegated power to do foreign trade to the lower-level  organizations, and encouraged enterprises to do business on the  world market. However, there is a serious shortage of  professionals in developing economic relations and trade with  foreign countries. There are not many professionals who know  foreign language, foreign trade and rules and regulations  involving foreign countries. Let us take intellectual property  rights as an example. Some enterprises ignore the need to  legally protect their own patents and trademarks when they sign  contracts on importing and exporting patented technologies. When  they try to open up the international market, they lack  information. They only seek to achieve the goal of pushing their  products out of China and lower their prices to compete with  others without paying attention to economic results. This  practice has prevented them from advancing toward the  international market.    4. The enterprises are under poor management.    The main symptoms are: a) The enterprise's business  targets are not so clear. A considerably number of enterprises  still regard the fulfillment of production tasks as their goal  without giving top priority to the enterprises' economic  efficiency and long-term and short-term profits. With regard to  imported technologies and equipment, they are unable to  assimilate them and make them yield economic results. Some of  the equipment and facilities are left unused for a long time  after they have been imported. Investments are high, but the  output is low. b) Workers' responsibility, authority and benefit  are not clearly defined. The system of everybody eating from the  same big pot still exists, and the enthusiasm of workers  including technical personnel has not been fully aroused. c) In  some enterprises, there are a large number of workers, but the  amount of profits and taxes turned to the state remains low. The  enterprises even suffer losses for several years running. This  runs counter to what the market economy demands. Market economy  demands that enterprises change the way they operate, become  market-oriented, pay attention to economic performances and give  full play to the role of science and technology, manpower,  material and financial resources.    B. The external environment affects the development of  enterprises.    There are many external environmental factors which  would affect enterprise development, but the major ones with  direct impact on enterprise development are as follows:    1. The procedure in importing technologies is too  complicated. Enterprises demand that they be given more power to  manage their own affairs in importing technologies and that the  government organization in charge of the import of technologies  perform more actual deeds and help enterprises solve specific  problems in importing technologies.    2. Imports of technologies have often been duplicated or  carried out blindly, wasting a great deal of foreign exchange.    3. Enterprises have not been truly given the power to  manage their own affairs. The main symptoms are: a) Some of  large and medium-sized enterprises do not have the authority to  handle exports even now. They can only export their products  through companies doing foreign trade. They do not understand  the market abroad. Nor are they allowed to open up their market  abroad. b) Even those enterprises with the authority to handle  export business cannot take the initiative to export their  products in accordance with the situation on the international  market. If an enterprise fails to fulfill the task in exporting  its products assigned by the higher authority, its authority to  do export business will be revoked. c) There are too many  restrictions for sending personnel to foreign countries. The  procedure for examination and approval is too complicated, and  its takes too long to go through this procedure. Restrictions on  the use of funds approved are so strict that it is hard for the  enterprises to adopt appropriate measures to keep up with the  changes on the market. As a result, they often lose the chance  of winning contracts.    4. The state fails to provide enterprises with a good  environment for fair competition. For example, a) the  Sino-Foreign joint ventures and cooperative and exclusively  foreign-funded enterprises receive far more preferential  treatments than ordinary enterprises. b) There are significant  differences between the preferential treatments given to  enterprises inside the development zone and those outside the  development zone. c) The state treats enterprises which are  included in the list of enterprises for technical renovations  differently as compared with those not included in the list.  Enterprises included in the list not only may obtain loans with  preferential terms, but also may reduce or remit taxes. Those  not included in the list not only cannot procure loans with  preferential terms, but also must pay customs duties when they  import machinery and production equipment. d) The dual price  system is also an important factor leading to unfair competition  among enterprises.    5. The rate of exchange for the yuan is too low,  affecting the import of equipment from abroad. Although the  lower rate of exchange for the yuan is conducive to expanding  China's exports, it however increases the costs of imports and  the enterprises' burdens in importing technological equipment.  <H5>  III. Several Suggestions to Relevant Government Departments </H5>   1. It is necessary to give enterprises greater authority  to manage their export business; allow enterprises with  favorable conditions to directly compete with others on the  international market; and help them understand the world market  and timely adjust their products and marketing and management  tactics. Efforts must be made to ensure that enterprises with  authority to handle exports truly have such power to export  their products. Enterprises must have the power to decide  whether they should export or not, what kind of products to  export and the amount of their exports in accordance with the  market situation.    2. It is essential to abolish the restriction on the  minimum amount of goods that an enterprise must export. The  practice of the government in giving enterprises assignments to  export their products is actually a method of planned economy.  It prevents enterprises from carrying out production and doing  exports based on the principle of economic results. In order to  fulfill their export targets, some enterprises have to export  their products even at a loss, while others use yuan to purchase  foreign exchange at a higher price so as to show the government  that they have fulfilled their export targets. In order to guard  against "poor business" in the next year, some enterprises  deliberately kept their export figures low so that they might  include these figures in the report when they really had some  "bad years." In doing so, they would not likely lose their  license to do export business because of their poor export  business. Apparently, the aforementioned practice of some of the  enterprises are erroneous. However, this is mainly because of  the government decision to set export targets for the  enterprises. Therefore, we must abolish the system of assigning  a minimum quota for each enterprise to export its products, and  truly permit enterprises to produce and sell their products  according to the market situation.    3. It is necessary to simplify the procedure in  importing technologies and that in examining and approving  enterprises staff members's applications to visit foreign  countries. The government department in charge of importing  technologies must help enterprises do solid work and solve  problems in importing technologies; and improve its services to  the enterprises.    4. It is imperative to stabilize the exchange rate in  order to maintain China's imports at the proper level. China is  a developing nation with comparative low standards in science  and technology. To moderately import advanced technological  equipment to expand its scale in production is necessary in  order to raise China's productivity and developing its economy.  The yuan's rate of exchange with foreign currencies has a direct  impact on the costs of imported goods. Therefore, only by  stabilizing the yuan rate of exchange will it be possible to  help enterprises import the right amount of technological  equipment for themselves.    5. The government must create an environment for fair  competition among enterprises. To develop a socialist market  economy, we must do things according to market economic laws.  Under no circumstances should we divide different areas and  different enterprises into different groups, and work out  different policies in dealing with each group. Efforts must be  made to abolish the dual price system and fundamentally plug the  loopholes with which some enterprises or individuals use to  undermine the policies of the state.    6. It is necessary to improve measures in importing and  exporting technologies. The import of technological equipment is  conducive to helping enterprises develop their production.  Efforts must be made to give preferential treatments to  enterprises in terms of import duties and loans. The export of  technological equipment is aimed at optimizing the product mix  and raising the added value of China's exports. Preferential  treatments should be given to enterprises which may retain a  portion of foreign exchange for their own use and wish to  procure loans in order to encourage exports.</p>

			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Arts: Classical disappointment - Architecture It was that great English architect, Sir Edwin Lutyens, who wrote, 'You cannot copy: you find if you do you are caught, a mess remains. It means hard labour, hard thinking, over every line in all three dimensions and in every joint; and no stone can be allowed to slide. You cannot play originality with the Orders. They have to be so well digested that there is nothing but essence left. When right they are curiously lovely - unalterable as plant forms . . . The perfection of the Order is far nearer nature than anything produced on impulse or accident-wise.' Lutyens was writing about his knowledge and love of the classical language. He understood it so well, and his own buildings demonstrate that his knowledge of classicism was so profound, that he could defy the rules with originality and wit. A classical building is one whose decorative language is derived from the architectural vocabulary of the ancient world. The vocabulary is developed to embrace the five orders of columns and a series of standard ways of combining mouldings, door and window openings and pediments and porticoes. But a successful classical building is not simply a selection of these elements mixed up to any old recipe. Success in classical archi-tecture depends upon an understanding of how to achieve a harmony of the different parts. Harmony is guaranteed by an understanding of proportion. A lot of pretentious nonsense has been written about the nature of proportion. It is enough to say that its purpose is to create harmony throughout a structure. This is achieved either by a consistent use of one of the orders or by the application of a system of dimensions that regularly repeats basic ratios. The important thing to remember about proportion is that it depends upon a rigorous and thorough application of simple rules throughout a building. It is that logic that creates elegance. It is that discipline that creates architecture. Almost opposite the London office of this newspaper, on the north bank of the Thames by Southwark Bridge, is a huge new office building that has serious pretensions to be regarded as a classical building. Vintners Place is the building's name and the architects are The Whinney Mackay-Lewis Partnership working for the developers Wates City of London Properties plc and Sumitomo Corporation in conjunction with the Vintners' Company. The site is a large one incorporating the Vintners' Hall and the listed facades of an Edwardian building. It called for a grand gesture and the architect has certainly made a bold effort with a giant portico on the river front - an attempt to raise Vintners Place above the level of the grim and mediocre riverside buildings that have been built since the war. A stone- fronted building was clearly called for to be at home alongside the listed facades. As the Prince of Wales said when he opened the building recently, 'it is very difficult, I think, to find a way to combine elements of the classical approach to architecture with contemporary requirements for office space.' While the prince went on to admire the architect's efforts, he was right to point out the difficulties any architect would face. The difficulty lies in using only elements. A classical building has to have a classical quality throughout. This new building is really only classical in part. Some of the parts are very rich and colourful. Unfortunately the public won't very often see the marble halls and stairs and galleria that run from Upper Thames Street to the river - ingeniously dealing with the changes of level and making some grand spaces on the way. The colourful marble floors (based upon the floor of Saint Peter's in Rome no less) are examples of excellent marble craftsmanship. I enjoyed too the invented column capital that uses the swan symbol of the Vintners. There is a rather untypical example of the mural painting of Ricardo Cinalli on the circular ceiling of the hallway telling the story of Leda and the swan. His work is usually much more muscular and sexier . . . The architect has been brave in attempting a copy of the great Scala Regia in the Vatican (designed by Bernini) to take visitors gradually to his atrium. In the Vatican Bernini was dealing with light as well as the gradient - and he was reminding us, in the concentration of his columns, of the majesty of his exterior colonnade in Saint Peter's Square. Why was I moved to tears when I first climbed Bernini's stair and left untouched by this version? The answer is that Bernini understood weight and light and intercolumniation. The Romans and all the great classical architects attached a great deal of importance to the spacing of columns. The width of the gaps between columns is measured by column diameters. This gives each different classical building a distinctive and particular tempo. The intercolumniation of the great big portico on the Thames front of this building does not have the right rhythm for its scale. Perhaps economy prevented the widening of the portico and the addition of more columns in scale and proportion to the whole building? It must, I assume, have been economy that prevented the regular addition of mouldings and frames to all the windows. And there is something odd about the windows because of the almost total absence of glazing bars. I know that enormous effort goes into a building like this; there is no doubt that it is an ingenious and complex achievement. But if you build a classical building it has to obey the rules, and only intense knowledge of those rules allows you to try and fit the Vatican into a modern office block. I would have though that Venice rather than Rome should have been the source of this building on the river - or perhaps Vicenza, where the Palazzo Chiericati would have made a marvellous model. From the outside this building does enhance the river, but it is no masterpiece, and to any eye trained to look at classical buildings its comprehension of the integrity of the classical language is frankly disappointing.</p>

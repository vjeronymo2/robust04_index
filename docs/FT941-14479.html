			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Why it is right to link trade policy to labour standards Sir, Your editorial, 'Mr Clinton's trade agenda' (January 14), arguing that it is wrong to link trade policy to the observance of minimum labour standards, misses the point. The Trades Union Congress has advocated a social clause in trade agreements to tackle some of the worst abuses of workers' rights, including forced labour and cruel exploitation of children. With other national trade union confederations, in industrialised and developing countries alike, we want to eliminate appalling situations such as those which prevail, for example, in China, where in four separate factories in the last two months more than 220 workers have been killed in fires and explosions. Where such abuses are linked to trade, it is reasonable to use trade instruments to address them and we would not be asking anything more than states have already committed themselves to through their membership of the International Labour Organisation. Your editorial is right to say that this would not eliminate the competitive threat posed by cheap labour countries. But that is not the purpose. Rather, it is aimed at encouraging a positive improvement of employment conditions in the exporting countries. As a consequence, it would also help to distribute the benefits of trade more fairly within the countries themselves, ultimately benefiting their own growth and the expansion of world trade generally. If there is a danger that a social clause could become an excuse for protectionism, as your editorial suggests, then it arises for each country or group of countries acting on its own. The surest way of avoiding the protectionist danger would be to reach agreement on a multilateral basis, through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade machinery which includes the developing countries, rather than to ignore the problem altogether.

			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> COUNTY TO SEEK STATE GRANT FOR VEHICLE PARK  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved applying to the  state for a $17.5-million grant to build an off-highway vehicle park in the  Santa Clarita Valley.  </P> <P> The board made the request contingent upon the project satisfactorily passing  environmental tests.  </P> <P> Walt Disney Co. has warned that noise from the park in rugged Whitney Canyon  would jeopardize filming at its nearby movie ranch. The environmental study is  expected to be completed this summer. The earliest the facility could be opened  is the summer of 1991, officials said.  </P> <P> Off-road enthusiasts have been lobbying for a place to ride since the only  other park in the area, Indian Dunes Park, was closed in 1984.  </P></p>

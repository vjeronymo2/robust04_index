			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andriy Berezniyy and Valeriy Novytskyy, members </F> of the inter-departmental working group on trade and industrial  cooperation issues of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation  Organization: "Black Sea Cooperation: Time for Action"]    [Text] The Black Sea Economic Cooperation  Organization (ChES), one of the newest international  organizations to start to have a considerable impact on the  dislocation of forces and alliances on world stage, is  attracting considerable attention to itself.    The idea of forming such a group had been mooted long ago,  but only in recent years, mainly thanks to efforts by Turkey, it  has attracted wide recognition which was implemented with the  signing of the relevant declaration by leaders of 11 countries  on 25 June 1992. That day in effect became the founding date of  the ChES; among the founding members of that organization, in  addition to Ukraine, were Azerbaijan, Albania, Bulgaria,  Armenia, Greece, Georgia, Moldova, the Russian Federation,  Romania and Turkey.    Most of those countries fully support the concept of the  ChES  and have serious, although sometimes dissimilar, intentions to  build the necessary legal foundations for economic integration,  growth of trade and implementation of joint investment projects.  For instance, the position of Greece, Romania and Bulgaria on  investing ChES organizations with considerable powers and  creating special favorable conditions for economic cooperation  in the region has been cautious and reserved. As to creating the  appropriate legal foundations, modifying existing foreign trade  regimes and establishing a free trade zone and other  institutional structures, all this would seriously impact their  status in another, for them more significant organization: the  European Union (EU). (Greece is its full member and Bulgaria and  Romania hold associate membership.)    Ukraine has its own interest in this, and its candidacy as a  leader of the ChES could become an acceptable compromise.  (Initiatives to that effect are the responsibility of the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs.) Other solutions are also possible:  representatives of different states could hold this position by  turns.    While discussing the role of Ukraine in the ChES, it should  be mentioned that on Turkish initiative our country was chosen  as the site of a parliamentary session of that organization at  the start of December. Analysts have noted that the ChES  parliamentary session, which took place in Kiev, was very  productive.    Sometimes one hears doubt whether attention should be  focused  on the problems of Black Sea cooperation if for Ukraine, as well  as for other countries in the region, the geopolitical goal is  to become integrated into the EU, or whether hopes to bring  together dissimilar member states within the ChES might not be  Utopian.    Responding to the first of these general questions, we  should  note that it would be irresponsible to define the issue in  either-or terms. For Ukraine to claim a full EU membership  status that would allow it to participate in its integration  processes and make use of all the related advantages, subsidies  and a wide range of favorable opportunities for economic  development would be impossible for many years to come. Yet, the  task of overcoming a severe socio-economic crisis is already  facing our country today. Moreover, strengthening cooperation  with other countries of the "European underbelly" as a way  toward Brussels would only give us more weight in the eyes of  desirable partners. Incidentally, these considerations are very  important for Turkish politicians. Thus, we think that Ukraine  should look at the problem more broadly, in the context of its  officially declared intention to seek widest possible  geographical ties and to overcome distortions resulting from a  one-sided orientation.    Clearly, it would be much easier to build economic  cooperation in the Black Sea region as a series of bilateral  projects or broader geographical projects focused on a single  industry. But this does not preclude the possibility, or removes  the need, to build a system of multilateral cooperation, which  would encourage many forms of localized cooperation while, on  the other hand, assuming a much broader form.    During negotiations within the ChES, member states expressed  their interest in cooperating in such areas as construction and  modernization of highway and railway networks; rational  utilization of Black Sea fishery resources; construction,  modernization and improved use of Black Sea ports; improvement  of telecommunications links between ChES members and laying of  the fiber-optic cable between Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria and  Ukraine.    On its part, Ukraine expressed an interest in working within  the ChES framework on modernizing oil refining plants, building  terminals on the shores of the Black Sea for receiving shipments  of oil and liquefied gas, cooperating with foreign companies on  the development of non-traditional energy sources, technical  retooling of metallurgical plants, building new capacities,  implementing a multilateral program to produce electronic  equipment for various sectors of the economy using  semiconductors produced in Ukraine, etc.    At this stage, Ukraine must develop a general conceptual  vision of its economic interests in the ChES, set a target level  for integration into ChES and its organizations and find  practical ways to achieve expected results. The latter task is  related to the need to find out, at last, who is responsible for  what in the context of goals being considered, since it must be  acknowledged that, as a rule, the Ukrainian side does not  generate initiative in developing various business proposals,  and that in our country those who are responsible for this are  often insufficiently active or incompetent.    This is why we must now start serious analytical and  organizational work at state organizations and enterprises. The  future of Ukraine is closely linked to the Black Sea region and  at the early stages it is important not to err in selecting  strategy and tactics, for in no time at all we may find  ourselves on the "dustheap of history."</p>

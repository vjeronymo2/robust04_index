			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LABOR PARTY GIVES SHAMIR ULTIMATUM;  </P> <P> ISRAEL: IT THREATENS TO DISMANTLE THE COALITION UNLESS THERE IS PROGRESS ON  PEACE TALKS WITH THE PALESTINIANS. DEFENSE CHIEF RABIN JOINS IN THE MOVE.  </P> <P> Labor Party leaders threatened Thursday to dismantle Israel's rickety coalition  government if, within two weeks, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir makes no  progress on holding peace talks with Palestinians.  </P> <P> Although such threats have been a staple of the 14-month-old coalition that  center-left Labor shares with Shamir's rightist Likud, this one was novel: For  the first time, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who is considered the keystone  of the partnership, joined his Labor colleagues in issuing the warning.  </P> <P> The ultimatum comes on the eve of a visit by Foreign Minister Moshe Arens to  Washington where he will meet with Secretary of State James A. Baker III. Baker  has tried to arrange a meeting with Arens and Egypt's foreign minister, Esmat  Abdel Meguid, to work out a list of Palestinian delegates to hold talks with  Israel. The plan is bogged down in disagreements over the makeup of the  Palestinian panel. Rabin thinks that compromises are on the horizon that Israel  should accept.  </P> <P> "Reasonable answers were given by the Egyptians to the United States on  everything that is linked to the composition of the Palestinian delegation,"  Rabin said in a radio interview. "If there is a delay here, I doubt if there is  any point in the continuing existence of the government."  </P> <P> Egypt has been fronting for the Palestine Liberation Organization in  preliminary talks with Washington and Israel. A compromise is in the works that  would permit not only Palestinians from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip  to take part, but also residents of Arab-populated East Jerusalem and  Palestinians who have been sent into exile.  </P> <P> An elaborate fig leaf has been designed to subdue Israeli opposition to talking  to anyone other than Gaza and West Bank residents: The Jerusalem participants  must have second homes in the occupied areas. Selected Palestinians-in-exile  will be permitted to come home first.  </P> <P> In order to mask PLO approval of the package, Egypt would announce the makeup  of the delegation. The Palestinian peace panel is supposed to work out details  of Shamir's proposal to hold elections in the West Bank and Gaza.  </P> <P> Labor's 107-member party bureau voted to insist on a Cabinet decision on peace  talks by March 7.  </P> <P> "There is a need for an immediate decision on issues that will ensure the  continuation of the peace process and that a further delay will cause serious  harm to Israel," a party statement said. "The Labor Bureau and the party's  Parliament faction again emphasize that the condition for the continuation of  the National Unity government is the continuation of the peace process."  </P> <P> While backing the proposal, Rabin modified it somewhat in public comments. If  the Cabinet is discussing the issue, the deadline can be postponed until a vote  takes place, he said.  </P> <P> Finance Minister Shimon Peres was more emphatic.  </P> <P> "We have within the coming two weeks to make a clear decision as far as Israel  is concerned, and the clear decision is either yes or no," he said of the peace  talks.  </P> <P> Likud members, already in turmoil because of accusations by hawkish members  that Shamir will make significant compromises, were incensed by the Labor move.  Deputy Foreign Minister Binyamin Netanyahu said flatly: "I don't believe in  ultimatums. I don't deal with them, and I don't yield to them."  </P> <P> It is Likud dogma that a role for Arabs from East Jerusalem will put Israel's  control over its own capital at risk. The inclusion of outside members is  viewed as making way for participation by the PLO -- and with it, demands for  an independent state and the right of Arab refugees to return to their former  homeland.  </P> <P> "Deportees and East Jerusalem Arabs! This is something that is not included in  the initiative of the Israeli government," said Ronnie Milo, the environment  minister and a Likud supporter of Shamir.  </P> <P> Despite the tough talk, Shamir's office has hinted that some form of compromise  as outlined by Rabin might be acceptable. Shamir has ordered Arens to hear  Baker out and not reject any compromise formulas out of hand but rather to  bring them back to Israel for discussion.  </P> <P> These hints of compromise prompted rivals of Shamir to challenge his  leadership. Ariel Sharon, fresh from quitting Shamir's Cabinet, is carrying on  a public campaign to unseat the prime minister.  </P> <P> "Shamir should reject the Labor ultimatum immediately," Sharon said, pouring  oil on his inflamed battle with Shamir.  </P></p>

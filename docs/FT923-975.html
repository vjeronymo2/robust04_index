			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Reform of standard on cashflow is demanded THE NEW accounting standard on cashflow needs urgent reform if it is not to lose credibility according to a critical analysis published this week. The analysis of the work of the Accounting Standards Board and of accounting practice concludes that use of Financial Reporting Standard One, which became mandatory for year-ends after March 23, is causing widespread inconsistencies. It says that without rapid reform the standard will lose credibility. The findings are contained in the latest edition of UK GAAP - or generally accepted accounting practice - which examines the state of financial reporting in British companies each year. GAAP says a number of practical difficulties have already emerged with the standard - the first to be introduced by the board after it began work two years ago. It also says there is confusion over the definition of 'cash and cash equivalents' as laid down in the standard and over the definition of 'operating activities'. GAAP also points to inconsistencies between companies in classifying cash outflows relating to provisions set up in previous years. It also highlights practical difficulties in the treatment of cashflows from joint ventures and from research and development. UK GAAP, 3rd edition. Macmillan. pounds44.95.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres to the </F> Crans Montana Forum in Bucharest -- live, in English with  simultaneous translation into Romanian; translated from the  Romanian]    [Text] Mr. Chairman, President Iliescu, Chairman Yasir  'Arafat, Mr. Chairman of the Egyptian Assembly, ladies and  gentlemen: When I took my first swimming lesson, my instructor  told me the following: Look, try to cross the lake. If you  cross 50 percent of the distance and you feel tired, do not  return, continue swimming, because to finish the swim means less  effort than to return. I have the feeling that Chairman 'Arafat  and Mr. Rabin made the most efforts and as Churchill said, we  are at the beginning of the end.    We are glad to be here in Bucharest. There is something  about this town that makes Arabs and Israelis understand each  other better here than in other places. [applause]    There is a precedent to this event. You know that this  flirtation of ours started in Bucharest when former [Egyptian]  President Sadat and President Begin [title as heard] had started  negotiations and as a result of it peace with Egypt was  achieved, which is very dear to our hearts and which was very  highly regarded by the rest of the world. [applause]    I believe that in the same way, the fact that the chairman  of  the PLO, who represents the Palestinian people, and I are here  and we are meeting, is not a simple coincidence. The conflict  has lasted for 100 years. The Jewish people and the Palestinian  people, two peoples that were born in the Middle East, are  meeting in hopes of reviving themselves.    Unfortunately, instead of holding a favorable meeting and  achieving an understanding, there was a bitter conflict, and not  only there. The Palestinians are part of the Arab world and the  Israelis are part of the Jewish world, and they meet on a small  stretch of land where the conflict has become increasingly  dangerous and terrible. We felt that our history is much more  important than geography in order to solve problems. The  conflict has continued and many young Arab people lost their  lives. Many young Israelis lost their lives. Women and children  were killed and their houses were destroyed.    It is not easy, within the middle of this history of hatred,  suspicion, and dissatisfaction and among all the manifestations  of extremism, weapons, arms, and guns, to try to rearrange the  situation and reach a new understanding. If I may speak as a  Jew, four months ago we signed an accord with the Vatican, with  the Catholic world. This is an important diplomatic event that  takes place once in 2000 years, but it happened indeed and the  pope said that all of us -- Muslims, Jews, and Christians -- are  Abraham's children. I told the pope that I believe that we are  indeed Abraham's children but the journey that we have made cost  us so much, my God, and I pray to the Lord, we do not want to  create an accident in this journey. It is our wish to achieve a  similar understanding with the Arab world. As you know,  democracy is not only the right to be equal. Democracy is also  the right to be different. We can be different and live in  peace and understanding.    I know how difficult it was for Chairman 'Arafat to make  this  historic decision, while surrounded by this hatred and distrust  in his leadership with so many demands. [words indistinct] a  period in which the grand mufti of Jerusalem refused to offer  his hand. I believe that for Chairman 'Arafat it was equally as  difficult to offer his hand as it was for us.    And now we are trying something that one or two years ago  seemed completely impossible. Allow me to make a remark in  connection with the nature of the accord. What makes it so  difficult are not only complications, the geographic layout, and  national feelings and the interference of so many forces. What  makes it so difficult is to draw permanent lines because we  cannot establish a map under the current conditions. We are  also talking about Europe now. The idea of sovereignty was  introduced by the big thinkers of the world in the 17th century  and since then all of them wanted clear borders, strong armies,  strong customs barriers and each of them wanted to live in his  own nest, separated from the rest of the world. Sovereignty  justified walls, sovereignty justified armies and conflicts.  But now we are trying to make things differently, following the  example of the end of the Cold War. It is a unique step in  diplomatic experience to try to establish new relations even  before having permanent borders.    The big attempt on the part of the PLO and Israel is to be  able to say: We agree, we do not have a permanent map yet, but  we have a permanent goal, namely we have decided to start off on  a journey from conflict to peace. But first of all, we agreed  to start off together and create a new situation. The  difficulties in our negotiations have two parts: When Mr.  'Arafat is negotiating with us, we make difficulties for him,  and when we negotiate with him, he makes other difficulties for  us. But each party makes things look different. If each side  had to negotiate with its own people there would be no problem.  And they say, why do you make concessions, why are you so weak,  why do you give in? And then again we have the third  difficulty, and this difficulty lies in the fact that there is  no precedent. We cannot go to a book, open it, consult it, and  see how we can conclude peace between a movement that is called  the PLO and a country that is called Israel, without deciding  right away on sovereignty and borders. We want to achieve  something new and promising and I believe it is both a moral and  political decision. The Jewish people have never dominated  another nation for 2000 years. We do not wish in our lifetime  to dominate the lives of the Palestinian people. This is  against our moral principles. [applause].    Second, what the new age requires from us is to be separate  from national viewpoints and to cooperate from an economic  viewpoint. You can see what is happening in the Balkans, in  Yugoslavia, and you know that in politics it is exactly like in  your own kitchen. You can break eggs and make an omelet. But  from an omelet you can no longer make a whole egg. Each  politician has to be very careful not to make an omelet from  each situation and create a situation in which nobody can live  freely according to his wishes. On the other hand, let us  cooperate from an economic point of view. As Chairman 'Arafat  said, let us build an economic Benelux while each of us will  follow his own path as people and nation. Thus we want not only  to permit the Palestinian people to live in dignity, but to lead  their own lives, choose their own leaders, and appoint their own  judges and police. It is not our wish to be leaders, judges,  and police officers of the Palestinian people. They have to  lead their lives alone. But from an economic viewpoint, we wish  to build a new Middle East. How should we do this? You know,  the war has its own cost and the peace has its own price. The  cost of the war for Europeans, for those in the Balkans, for the  Russians is huge. In the Middle East in the past 10 years the  countries of the Middle East have spent $1 trillion to purchase  weapons, that is, $1,000 billion. There is no Marshall plan  that could offer so much money and if we could reduce this  [words indistinct].</p>

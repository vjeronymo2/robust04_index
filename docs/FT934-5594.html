			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (8): Looking under the manhole covers - Local authority application The London Borough of Merton started to explore geographical systems as a result of its unusual contractual relationship with Thames Water Authority, writes Claire Gooding. As the authority responsible for the highways in the area, Merton became TWA's agent in keeping track of the network of sewers beneath the roads. The problem of creating sewer maps led to the idea in 1988 of digitising the sewer network as a separate transparency, for overlaying on road-maps. 'We had hard copy maps and text about the sewer network,' explains Mick Bird, GIS co-ordinator. 'The drawback is that there's only ever one copy, and over the years its condition becomes very tatty.' Thames paid for the original digitising effort in 1988-89, which provided a digitised map for distribution to all users. In January 1990, the release of digital maps 1:250 scale from the Ordnance Survey made it possible to extend the system to the borough's own work. 'About 90 per cent of local authorities depend on locational references in some part of their activities,' says Mr Bird. 'The need to produce an asset register by April 1994 has forced them to change their approach to asset accounting.' A steering group examined every area of the local authority's activities, and looked at several options including Intergraph, Unisys, SIA, and custom-built systems. Flexibility, cost, and rapid development tools played a part in the eventual choice of the dataMAP product from SIA, which had the further advantage of allowing Merton to continue using its existing MS-DOS based PCs in a networked environment under the OS/2 operating system. SIA provided consultancy, implementation and training services as part of a Pounds 130,000 contract, and also assisted with data capture. Having started its GIS efforts well before there was a general recognition of the problems involved, Merton initially had to struggle with many problems. Now there is a seamless, minutely detailed map of Merton's entire territory, covering 220 miles of road, 500 miles of footway, and 320 miles of sewers. Each individual house and every piece of street furniture is shown, including footpaths, litter bins and manhole covers. The system runs on an ICL 386 file server, with 10 PCs and a selection of laser and Postscript printers. Also linked to the 3-COM network are three pen-plotters, an A4 flatbed scanner, and a digitising tablet. Working with SIA, Merton has already produced several applications including a planning applications management system and a land register. The dataMAP product is written in the DataFlex 4GL programming language. Merton's use of DataFlex for other administrative applications such as purchase order control, skip licensing and asbestos monitoring, has made it easy to dovetail geographical with ordinary reporting functions, and test new ideas. Over the four years of development, costs have risen to about Pounds 250,000, but the payback is in sight, and Bird cites a better service to the public as one of the business benefits. Future uses are likely to include housing, social services, leisure, education, and electoral planning. Analysis of census data on the mainframe, using the SPSS statistical package, is likely to provide further valuable input for planning purposes. 'Having good locational information stored in one central place saves effort in many areas' concludes Bird. 'However, the real business benefit is in the general ability to draw together information from different sources so that management can make effective decisions on it.'</p>

Wilson, who was lured out of retirement a year  ago to revitalize the city, has been fired unexpectedly by the City Council.  </P> <P> Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant was joined by colleagues Nell Soto and Tomas  Ursua, who was elected in March, in voting to oust Wilson at an executive  session of the council late Monday. Mayor Donna Smith wanted Wilson retained,  and Councilman Mark Nymeyer left the meeting in protest.  </P> <P> Bryant said Wilson usurped council authority and would not follow directions.  Wilson could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Wilson, 47, was a former city manager of Kansas City, Mo., where he eventually  resigned under pressure. Earlier, he spent three years in Santa Ana as city  manager, helping to initiate an aggressive redevelopment program.  </P> <P> City Atty. Patrick J. Sampson was temporarily named to the manager's post.  </P></p>

			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Economic Watch: German engineering orders rise Orders for Germany's engineering sector in April rose 3 per cent in real terms compared to April 1993, the VDMA, the engineering industry association, reported yesterday. The increase in orders, which appear to confirm that the industry is now emerging from recession, was boosted by a particularly strong growth in exports to European Union countries. They rose 21 per cent over the same period, increased by 15 per cent during February and April of this year when compared to the same period last year, and rose by 8 per cent between February and April this year. However, domestic demand remains sluggish. The VDMA reported a fall of one per cent between April 1993 and 1994. Judy Dempsey, Berlin Italian employment in major industrial companies with over 500 workers fell 5 per cent in February 1994 from the corresponding month of 1993 and was unchanged from January, the state statistical office Istat said yesterday. The decline was evident in all sectors. Among the worst hit areas were textile and clothing jobs (down 8.2 per cent) and chemical and related sectors (down 8.3 per cent). Belgium's year-on-year inflation was a preliminary 2.56 per cent in May, up from 2.41 per cent in April but down from 2.69 per cent a year earlier, the Belgian government said yesterday. Sweden's current account showed a surplus of SKr2.7bn in the first quarter of this year according to new calculation methods, the Central Bank said in a statement.</p>

			<p><P> September 10, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHIEFS CROSS UP VIKINGS, BRING THEM DOWN, 24-21  </P> <P> The Minnesota Vikings went for the fake and Steve DeBerg didn't blame them.  </P> <P> DeBerg, utilizing play-action fakes to 260-pound fullback Christian Okoye,  drove the Kansas City Chiefs 78 yards to a touchdown with 9:35 left Sunday and  beat the Vikings, 24-21.  </P> <P> "It wasn't breakdowns by the defense," DeBerg said. "When we play-action fake,  usually a team does get a little out of whack. They're trying to stop Christian  Okoye with all the guys they can, and all of a sudden I have the ball going the  other way. That is a tremendous burden for any defense."  </P> <P> Okoye scored the go-ahead touchdown on a run from two yards out. On the winning  drive, DeBerg found Bill Jones all alone for a 16-yard gain and connected with  Rob Thomas, also uncovered, for 20 yards.  </P> <P> Both plays came after fakes to Okoye, who set up the score with an 11-yard run  around left end.  </P> <P> "We didn't do a good job of stopping the play-action pass," Minnesota Coach  Jerry Burns said. "We practiced against that bootleg, but we didn't stop it  very well. We didn't cover their receivers."  </P> <P> After Okoye's go-ahead touchdown, the Vikings failed on a fourth and two with  2:14 left, and the Chiefs ran out the clock.  </P> <P> Practically given two touchdowns in the first quarter, the Chiefs had to rally  after Minnesota took a 21-17 lead when Wade Wilson flipped a six-yard scoring  pass to Herschel Walker in the third quarter.  </P> <P> DeBerg completed 16 of 28 passes for 196 yards and two touchdowns, but didn't  want any credit.  </P> <P> The Chiefs took a 14-0 lead in the first quarter after recovering fumbles by  Wilson and Herschel Walker deep in Viking territory.  </P> <P> DeBerg threw a four-yard touchdown pass to Jones and a 22-yarder to Rob McNair.  </P> <P> Wilson rallied the Vikings with three touchdown passes, two of them six-yarders  to Walker, and a 26-yarder to Steve Jordan. The first two tied the score,  14-14, and the third, after Kansas City's Nick Lowery kicked a 43-yard field  goal, gave Minnesota a 21-17 lead.  </P></p>

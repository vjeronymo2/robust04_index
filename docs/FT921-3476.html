			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / International Company News: Henkel's net profits rise 3% NET profits at Henkel, the German chemicals and consumer products group, rose by more than 3 per cent last year to DM443m, (Dollars 270.1m), in spite of weak performances in export markets and chemicals, writes Christopher Parkes. Turnover, up 7 per cent to DM12.9bn, was helped by strong advances in detergents, up 10 per cent, and adhesives, up 8.6 per cent. A 13 per cent increase in sales of adhesives stemmed mainly from the impact of acquisitions.</p>

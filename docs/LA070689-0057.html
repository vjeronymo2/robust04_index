			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VALUE OF TAXABLE PROPERTY IN VENTURA COUNTY RISES 13%  </P> <P> Ventura County Assessor R. J. Sanford said this week that the value of taxable  property in the county had increased by about 13% in the last fiscal year, but  he predicted that next year's growth might decrease about 10%.  </P> <P> Sanford said rising interest rates and a decreased rate of home sales could  account for the fall.  </P> <P> At a Wednesday press conference announcing closure of the local assessment roll  July 1, Sanford said the county's total valuation was more than $33.4 billion.  Commercial and industrial development made up 22% of the $3.8 billion increase  since last year, he said.  </P> <P> He said the housing industry had not matched the growth of other businesses,  resulting in a housing shortage among people drawn for newly created jobs.  </P> <P> According to the assessor's figures, the taxable value of property in Ventura  County cities rose by these amounts: Fillmore, 14.24%; Ojai, 12.39%; Oxnard,  13.76%; Santa Paula, 10.44%; Ventura, 9.4%; Port Hueneme, 10.72%; Camarillo,  13.47%; Thousand Oaks, 14.59%; Simi Valley, 13.32%, and Moorpark, 18%.  </P></p>

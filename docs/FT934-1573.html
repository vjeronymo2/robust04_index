			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / International Company News: Ascom bullish on Bosch venture Ascom, the Swiss tele-communications group, yesterday said a planned venture with Robert Bosch, the German electronics and auto parts manufacturer, in private mobile radio would lead to improved results in 1995, Reuter reports from Berne. The company said that negotiations about the venture would be completed during next year and until then Ascom would be responsible for all losses and restructuring costs at Ascom Radiocom, the fully owned private mobile radio subsidiary. However, Robert Bosch said it planned to take a majority stake in Switzerland's Ascom Radiocom. It said an agreement had been signed with Ascom on Wednesday. 'With this co-operation Bosch's radio communications technology business should be further strengthened in the European private mobile radio market,' Robert Bosch said. Bosch has an annual turnover of DM280m (Dollars 163m) in its private mobile radio division which employs 1,100. Ascom will set aside provisions for 1994 losses and restructuring this year. 'The results will be significantly relieved in 1995,' a spokesman said. Ascom lost SFr79m in the first half of 1993 and has predicted a marked loss for the full year, mainly due to losses at the Radiocom unit.</p>

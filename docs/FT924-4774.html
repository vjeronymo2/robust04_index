			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Fakes feature in glitzy auction of Maxwell effects ROBERT MAXWELL could not have foreseen the very public way the contents of Headington Hill Hall - his family home he once boasted was the finest council house in Britain - would be put under the auctioneer's hammer. Yesterday, journalists descended on the Oxford house - rented for just over Pounds 10,000 a year from Oxford City Council - for a glimpse of the building where not so long ago deals were struck and fortunes enjoyed. Mr Harry Dalmeny from Sotheby's was on hand to offer informed comment prior to a sale on January 14 expected to raise at least Pounds 300,000. 'It is not a collector's house,' he said. 'It is functional house and the function it fulfilled was to impress people. It was a house very much used for power entertaining.' In the grand Victorian galleried hall, a large double staircase rises to a stained-glass window depicting Samson at the gates of Gaza - the head not unlike that of Maxwell himself - framed by reproduction Regency lamps. In the hall itself, where the marble columns were in fact made of painted wood, a late 19th century Aubusson tapestry hung alongside a 1950s collage sculpture of Neptune. 'Pretty glitzy. Would have worked wonderfully on a cruise ship,' said the man from Sotheby's. In Maxwell's room - with its Chinese-style wallpaper and a large-screen television - a bedside telephone had direct lines to company directors, two sons, newspaper editors, the Mirror newsdesk and the kitchen. Nearby, the collected works of Shelley and Samuel Pepys' diaries were fakes, hiding a spotlight. In an agreed statement handed out by Sotheby's, Mrs Elisabeth Maxwell said she had inherited some of the more tasteful items on show - the furniture, carpets, silverware and china. 'They've been with us for 33 years but material possessions don't mean much to me and nor did they to my husband,' it said. 'The only things I collected were minerals, fossils, coral, and seashells.' Maxwell memorabilia on display included a mother-of-pearl inlaid nameplate inscribed 'Robert Maxwell: Chairman' (a gift from Japanese businessmen), a photograph of him with the US president with the inscription 'To Sir Robert Maxwell, warm greetings from Washington, George Bush', several military medals and a cigar. The more expensive items include a large regency mahogany dining table (estimated value Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 15,000), and a pair of satinwood and parcel gilt card tables (Pounds 7,000 to Pounds 10,000). There were few items of jewellery and silverware, and the only paintings of any worth were by the Israeli Reuven Rubin - one depicting a scene of Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives where Maxwell was buried. Buchler Phillips, receivers of Mr Maxwell's private estate, have instructed Sotheby's to realise the highest possible value from the auction, which follows other recent disposals. Pensioners are likely to take little comfort from the paucity of items on display yesterday, and from the fact that division of proceeds remains subject to negotiation between the receivers and Mrs Maxwell.</p>

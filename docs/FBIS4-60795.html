It is supposed to appoint as  its head mayor of the capital Yuriy Luzhkov, who would also  receive the rank of vice premier of the Russian Government. A  draft of the edict is being prepared in corresponding  subdivisions of City Hall, and Boris Yeltsin's agreement to sign  it has virtually been secured, according to information from the  same sources. Viktor Chernomyrdin, according to confidential  information, does not like such plans. The reaction by Moscow  Oblast administration head Anatoliy Tyazhlov is yet unknown.</p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei surges 2.7% to year's high THE NIKKEI average shot up by 2.7 per cent yesterday, led by a sharp rise in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone after Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, said that the supplementary budget to be approved in 11 days' time would exceed last August's Y10,700bn package, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. Volume totalled 620m shares, against Wednesday's 697m, with the Nikkei gaining 507.64 at a closing peak for the year of 19,099.09 on heavy buying by individual investors and dealers. It registered a day's low of 18,526.65 in the morning, before advancing to a high for the session of 19,135.83 just before the close. Rises outscored declines by 663 to 377, with 134 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks jumped 39.32 to 1,471.19, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 2.01 at 1,160.40. Speculation that the supplementary budget will focus on upgrading the country's telecommunications infrastructure boosted telecoms stocks, including NTT, which rose by its daily limit of Y100,000 to Y977,000. Expectations that the government may pass an additional budget in the autumn also encouraged investors. Cable companies were active on buying encouraged by NTT's rise. Furukawa Electric, the most active issue of the day, moved ahead Y82 to Y730 and Fujikura climbed Y100to Y945. Rumours that Saudi Arabia was considering the acquisition of a Japanese oil company prompted large buying of oil-related issues. Nippon Oil gained Y29 at Y749 and Mitsubishi Oil Y100 at Y984. Electric power companies, which rely on oil imports, surged on the dollar's fall against the yen. The US currency finished Y0.81 lower at Y114.54. Tokyo Electric Power moved ahead Y340 to Y3,670 and Kyushu Electric Power ended Y240 stronger at Y2,860. The dollar, however, hit some high-technology exporters, with Matsushita Electric Industrial losing Y40 to Y1,220 and Sony Y30 to Y4,400. Sumitomo Metal Mining rose Y45 to Y800 on higher gold bullion prices. Mitsui Mining and Smelting was also strong, adding Y12 at Y510. Companies linked with the Japan Railway Group rose ahead of JR East's listing, expected this autumn. Totetsu Kogyo appreciated Y190 to Y1,250 and Tokyu Car Y100 to Y725. Nippon Paper, the new paper company resulting from the merger between Jujo Paper and Sanyo Kokusaku Pulp, forged ahead Y69 to Y545 on its first day of trading. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 167.33 to 20,307.44 in volume of 27.6m shares. Roundup THE REGION offered little concrete response to the strength of Tokyo. AUSTRALIA picked up late in the session, helped by Tokyo and the emergence of arbitrage trading in futures, but the All Ordinaries index closed only 1.4 higher at 1,668.8 in turn-over of ADollars 317.7m. Gold shares provided a strong feature, the sector index climbing 16.8 to 1,255.2. HONG KONG was cautious as the Sino-British row on the colony's future simmered on but shares still moved ahead. The Hang Seng index closed 20.02 up at 6,408.88, having hit 6,427.08 in early trading. However, turnover shrank from HKDollars 3.19bn to HKDollars 2.93bn. BANGKOK gave up almost all of the gains of the previous session. The SET index retreated 13.46, or 1.56 per cent, to 851.77 as investors became concerned at the possibility of a cabinet reshuffle following criticism from within the ruling coalition that the government has achieved little in its first six months in power. KUALA LUMPUR was in more confident mood after its recent consolidation and the composite index moved ahead 6.31 to end at a year's high of 649.56 in active trading.</p>

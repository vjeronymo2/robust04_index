			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MARYLAND PENALIZES ITSELF FOR BREAKING AN NCAA RULE  </P> <P> The University of Maryland has penalized itself for an admitted rules violation  by delaying the opening of men's basketball practice five days.  </P> <P> Athletic Director Andy Geiger, in making the announcement, said the length of  the self-imposed penalty matched the number of pickup games observed by Coach  Gary Williams and his coaching staff before last season.  </P> <P> Geiger said that Williams had watched parts of two workouts.  </P> <P> "I consider this pretty important, and I want to get this business behind us  and not have to worry about this anymore," said Geiger, who assumed his new  position last week.  </P> <P> With the penalty, the Terps will open preseason practice Oct. 20 rather than  the normal Oct. 15.  </P> <P> Geiger was to meet today with Mark Jones, a director of enforcement for the  NCAA, at the organization's headquarters outside Kansas City.  </P> <P> Observing preseason workouts normally is considered a minor, or secondary,  infraction by the NCAA. But the NCAA has examined this matter more vigorously  because Maryland was under investigation for more serious violations committed  under former Coach Bob Wade.  </P> <P> The Terps subsequently were put on three years' probation, including a two-year  ban from postseason competition and a one-year ban from live television  appearances. Maryland's appeal of the sanctions was rejected by the NCAA in  August.  </P> <P> Asked if the self-imposed penalty would ensure that the NCAA doesn't pursue the  matter further, Geiger said: "I'm hopeful it will be a sign that we're taking  this very seriously. There is a clear message that we want to have a firm hand  at the helm."  </P> <P> Said Jones: "I won't comment on whether a self-imposed penalty by an  institution is appropriate. Anything they report will be reviewed by the  Committee on Infractions."  </P> <P> The NCAA's Committee on Infractions will meet next in Hilton Head, S.C., Nov.  8-10.  </P></p>

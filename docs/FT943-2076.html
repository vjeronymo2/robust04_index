			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Bringing colour to Barbican Sir, May I respond to Colin Amery's thoughtful tribute to Theo Crosby (Architecture, September 19). We at the Barbican Centre are greatly saddened by his death last week. We sincerely hope and believe that the ideas and concept that he had for our improvement scheme which is half way to completion will be finished as he had planned and on target and hopefully within budget. We agree that his scheme will bring colour and joy to the Barbican Centre. Geoffrey Lawson, Chairman to Barbican Centre Committee, Barbican, London EC2Y 8DG.</p>

			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Finance and the Family: Crunching the numbers Will a with-profits policy repay your mortgage? The economy must get much worse before there is any danger of this happening. Mortgage endowments are written on very conservative assumptions: premiums are normally fixed so that the maturity value will pay off your mortgage exactly if there is no terminal bonus at all, and reversionary bonuses continue at only 80 per cent of their current rate. For many offices, terminal bonuses make up more than half their final pay-outs. Money Management magazine's latest survey of with-profits pay-outs says that this applies to eight out of the top ten paying offices for 25-year contracts - for example, Standard Life pays 61.5 per cent in terminal bonus, Scottish Life pays 60 per cent, and Equity &amp; Law pays 62.0 per cent. In many cases total pay-outs would need to fall by more than half before failing to pay a mortgage. Which is the cheapest with-profits policy? Offices with high reversionary bonuses usually offer the lowest premiums for paying off a set mortgage. According to Money Management, the lowest premiums on endowments come from Eagle Star (Pounds 47.80 for a 24-year-old man with a sum assured of Pounds 40,000) and Tunbridge Wells (for 30-year-old and 40-year-old couples). Other offices named by Money Management as low-cost are: Royal Life, Standard Life, Friends Provident, Pearl and Scottish Widows. Which is the highest paying with-profits policy? League tables are available, but cannot predict the future. Money Management says that the top 25-year pay-outs this year, assuming the policies were for Pounds 30 per month and started by a 29-year-old man were: Pounds 110,771 by Commercial Union, Pounds 110,399 by Standard Life, Pounds 110,093 by General Accident, Pounds 108,200 by Scottish Life, and Pounds 106,948 by Friends Provident. Which company has the strongest reserves? Only very raw data is available on this, which should be treated with great caution. According to Money Marketing, returns made by life companies to the Department of Trade and Industry show that 'free-asset ratios' are falling. This is the technical term for the amount by which a company's assets exceeds its liabilities. Money Marketing's figures show that Pearl (29.6 per cent), Commercial Union (23.6), Equity &amp; Law (23.2) and GA Life (22.7) are all relatively strong, while Equitable Life (2.6), NPI (4.6), Scottish Amicable (5.6), Norwich Union (6) and Scottish Life (6) have much smaller margins.</p>

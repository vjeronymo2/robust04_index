			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Paul Newman has filed a $5.45-million suit against Home Box Office Inc.,  claiming the cable television giant undersold "Fort Apache, the Bronx" -- the  New York police drama that Newman made for HBO subsidiary Time-Life Productions  in 1980 -- so that it could rent out other HBO features. Ronald Rosen, Newman's  attorney, said HBO charged a rental fee of only $1 million for "Fort Apache" in  a deal with Procter &amp; Gamble Co. that included 192 other films. Newman  maintains that the film's true value through licensing was $4 million. The suit  filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles alleges breach of contract  and antitrust violations and seeks $5 million in punitive damages, plus  $450,000 that the actor claims he lost in fees.

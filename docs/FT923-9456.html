			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / International Company News: Catastrophe losses cause setback at Cigna CIGNA, one of the largest composite insurers in the US, has unveiled underlying second-quarter earnings of Dollars 1.09 a share, compared with Dollars 1.88 in the same period of 1991. Mr Wilson Taylor, Cigna's chairman, blamed the shortfall on weak worldwide property and casualty markets and high catastrophe losses, particularly from the Los Angeles riots. The company had already warned its results would fall below analysts' expectations of about Dollars 1.25 a share, but did not give specific reasons. Mr Taylor said the company was reviewing its London property and casualty reinsurance operations because of recent concerns about the London reinsurance market. Cigna's pre-tax catastrophe losses climbed to Dollars 55m, including Dollars 39m from the Los Angeles riots, from Dollars 11m a year earlier. Net income for the three months to June 30 was Dollars 125m, or Dollars 1.74 a share, including one-time gains of Dollars 47m. A year earlier, Cigna net income was Dollars 170m, or Dollars 2.38, including one-time after-tax gains of Dollars 36m. For the first half, Cigna recorded net income of Dollars 231m, or Dollars 3.22 a share, including after-tax gains of Dollars 70m. For the same period of 1991, it earned Dollars 218m, or Dollars 3.05 a share, including extraordinary gains of Dollars 41m. Premiums and fees for the group overall in the second quarter were Dollars 3.45bn, against Dollars 3.6bn a year ago, while net investment income totalled Dollars 970m against Dollars 960m. For the first half, premiums and fees stood at Dollars 6.9bn while net investment income totalled Dollars 1.96bn. A year earlier, premiums and fees were Dollars 7.2bn while net investment income was Dollars 1.93bn.</p>

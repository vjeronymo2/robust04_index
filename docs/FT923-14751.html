			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Enterprise bodies 'fear role change' LOCAL enterprise trusts in Scotland fear that they will lose their independence and be forced to narrow their activities as Local Enterprise Companies (Lecs) become more established, according to a study by Strathclyde University. It says this will lead to a loss of diversity in support available to businesses and the possibility that 'unglamorous' businesses without much growth potential will be denied support. The report's findings may have implications for Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs), the equivalent of Lecs in England and Wales. Most Scottish trusts were originally contracted to provide a range of services to their nearest Lec, primarily support for start-ups of small businesses and for very small established businesses. They have feared being restricted to this traditional role and therefore being prevented from becoming involved in areas such as marketing and inward investment and from continuing to help medium-sized and large businesses. Many Lecs have said they do not want the trusts to undertake these activities, and have indicated willingness to use their contractual and financial powers to prevent it. The researchers suggest several ways in which relations between the trusts and Lecs might develop. They say the trusts might gradually be absorbed or, while remaining independent, might supply services only to the enterprise companies. 'It is probable that many trusts will effectively become dependent arms of the Lecs, regardless of their theoretically independent status,' the study says.

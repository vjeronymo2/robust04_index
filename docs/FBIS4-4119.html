After  hearing and deliberating the work report, the Second Session of  the Eighth Anhui Provincial People's Congress decided to adopt  it.    The session held: Under the guidelines of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the 14th CPC National Congress in the past  year, various nationalities of Anhui's people have further  liberated the mind and have united and forged ahead; the  provincial economy has been developing rapidly; the socialist  spiritual civilization drive has been further enhanced; the  stable and united political situation has been consolidated; and  a pleasant setting characterized by prosperity and progress has  appeared across the province. Meanwhile however, we should also  note that some difficulties and problems still exist in the  course of our progress. We should deepen reform and  realistically and meticulously do our work in an effort to  resolve the problems.    The meeting pointed out: The national economy has been  sustaining a favorably developing momentum in 1994 which is also  an important year for accelerating the establishment of a  socialist market economy. While performing various tasks, we  should abide by and serve the overall requirements of seizing  opportunities, deepening reform, opening up wider to the outside  world, enhancing progress, and maintaining stability. We should  earnestly and properly handle the relations among reform,  development, and stability; promptly discover new circumstances  and new problems that may pop up along the route of progress and  resolve them accordingly. We should strive to facilitate a  sustained, rapid, and healthy development [chi xu kuai su jian  kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455] of the  national economy.    The meeting stressed: We should persistently adhere to the  basic and guiding ideology that "development is the last word;"  improve structure, raise efficiency, and promote a rapid growth  in the national economy. We should persistently give top  priority to agriculture and rural work; strengthen leadership in  this regard; deepen reform; pursue consistent policies; increase  investments; continually implement the strategy "that stresses  steady growth first, and rapid progress later"; comprehensively  develop the rural economy; earnestly and properly perform tasks  to aid and cultivate the poor; realistically reduce peasants'  burdens; strive in every possible way to raise peasants'  incomes; and accelerate rural areas' advance toward attaining  comparatively well-off living standards. Furthermore, we should  improve industrial structure, accelerate technical  transformation, make great efforts to improve large and medium  state enterprises' performance, strive to reverse losses and  increase profits in enterprises, raise economic benefits, and  invigorate enterprises. Also, we should strive to develop  markets in urban and rural areas, improve the circulation of  commodities, reinforce supervision and inspection of commodity  prices, properly handle the establishment of "vegetable basket"  projects, and make efforts to ensure that the rates of increase  in commodity prices will be below the average national level.  Additionally, we should develop more channels to attract funds,  and should enhance the construction of infrastructural projects  and primary industries to boost reserves for further  development. We should regard education as a strategic project  to be developed on a priority basis, strive to develop various  social undertakings including science, technology, culture, and  health care; and improve tasks in family planning, environmental  protection, and land management. While enhancing economic  progress, we should continually improve people's living  standards. In particular, we should attach great importance to,  and take measures to resolve daily problems faced by the masses  in poor areas and by staff and workers of enterprises in  distress.    The meeting stressed, We should accelerate establishing a  socialist market economy; continually change enterprise  operating mechanisms; actively explore effective ways to  establish a modern enterprise system; and make great efforts to  promote reform in taxation, finance, investment, and foreign  trade. We should open up wider to the outside world, ensure a  steady increase in exports, and use more foreign funds to  further develop the open economy.    The meeting pointed out: We should continually implement the  principle "that while conducting rectification, we enhance  economic progress and that we are strict in both tasks;" boost  the socialist spiritual civilization drive further; assiduously  promote patriotic, collective, and socialist ideological  education programs; oppose money worship, extreme individualism,  and decadent lifestyles; promulgate Lei Feng's spirit in a new  era as represented by Xu Honggang; extensively launch education  programs to promote social public spirit and professional  ethics; advocate the spirit of diligence and thrift; wage hard  struggles; and establish good social practices.    The meeting pointed out: We should further strengthen the  development of socialist democracy and its legal system and  should enhance social progress in an all-around manner. We  should also persistently govern Anhui and enforce administrative  procedures according to law. We should launch in-depth  education programs on the legal system to strengthen all Anhui  residents' concepts in this regard. Furthermore, we should  steadfastly and unwaveringly boost honest government building  and launch an effective anticorruption drive. We should further  comprehensively rectify social order, strictly crack down on  various crimes and on culprits of serious economic crimes, and  correctly handle internal contradictions among the people.  Additionally, we should strive to eliminate various factors  that are detrimental to stability in an effort to create a  favorable social environment for reform and development.    The meeting urged: Governments at various levels and  relevant personnel should always remember their fundamental  purpose of wholeheartedly serving the people; establish the  concept of serving as public servants; and stress ideals,  discipline, unity, and the overall situation. They should study  further, persistently seek truth from facts, improve workstyle,  mingle with grass-roots units and among the masses, intensify  investigation and research, surmount bureaucracy and formalism,  earnestly perform concrete tasks, and realistically implement  measures. They should conscientiously and properly carry out  organizational reform, and earnestly change government functions  so as to raise government work performance to a higher level.    The meeting urged: Anhui's people of various nationalities  should rally more closely around the party Central Committee  with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core. Under the guidance of  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, and under  the leadership of the Anhui provinical party committee, we  should be of one heart and one mind, earnestly perform concrete  tasks, wage hard struggles, do pioneering work, open up, forge  ahead, and strive to work hard in an effort to comprehensively  invigorate Anhui's economy and various other undertakings.</p>

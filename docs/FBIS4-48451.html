			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with SANDF Chief Georg Meiring by </F> reporter Donald Pressly; place and date not given]    [Text] As long as there are men with weapons in their  hands, there will always be a danger that they will use them in  an undisciplined way, says the chief of the SA [South Africa]  National Defence Force [SANDF], General Georg Meiring.    Asked if the defence force will be a threat to the  Government  of National Unity, Meiring said the history of Africa showed  that armies could well be a danger to democratic governments.    But he did not believe that the SANDF was such a threat.    "If a force is well-disciplined, the chances that it will be  used indiscriminately are much lower," he said.    A defence force could only constitute a danger to the State  if it was made up of a fulltime component which came under the  influence of a specific body which wishes to overthrow the State.    It was for this reason that the former SADF [South African  Defence Force] had questioned the African National Congress'  reasoning that the SANDF should be made up only of volunteers.    "We said we should have both ... with the force made up  largely of part-time soldiers drawn from the entire spectrum of  society", he said.    The new system, while not placing emphasis on conscription,  allowed for a volunteer programme coupled with a ballot system.  Young men still had to register for the service and were liable  for service should the country need them.    Turning to the integration of the liberation armies, the  homeland military formations and the various arms of the SADF --  including the navy, air force, medical services and army -- into  the new National Defence Force, he said all their cultures would  have to be fully assimilated "so they make up the same  substance."    There was a realisation "that oil and water do not mix". He  and former Umkhonto [Spear of the nation; ANC military wing --  (MK] chief of staff and now Minister of Defence Joe Modise had  agreed that a two-year period of bridging training was required  to ensure equal opportunities for those lacking the skills of  modern warfare.    Meiring said a two-year period of "bridging training" will  be  required to ensure that equal opportunities for all members of  the new force were available.    There would be no tokenism with black people achieving top  posts. "A high level of training at international military  standard would have to be maintained," he said in an interview.  If there are black people of sufficient merit in MK, for  instance, to be generals, "there will be black generals."    The former SADF has not been completely representative of  the  various race groups in the past because of the political  circumstances but he contends that it is the first major  organisation in South Africa to take blacks on in large numbers  12 years ago.    Blacks have reached the rank of major, captains and below.  Training of coloureds started 19 years ago with one coloured man  having reached the rank of brigadier. There are a number of  colonels and commandants. "If we had started earlier we would  have had black generals ... bearing in mind it takes 30 years to  become a general. It's not something that happens overnight."    The SA Army is now one third black, one third brown, and one  third white.    There will have to be rationalisation of the service as  integration will lead to "a big fat service". The best man  would therefore get the job.    Everybody will have to be trained to a specific level --  with  some recruits needing more training than others. Air Force  fighter pilots, for instance, will take longer than two years to  achieve flying competence -- it takes seven years to train a man  to reach standards of a Mirage pilot.    A tank commander will take longer to train than an  infantryman, while to train a soldier to man a mortar takes less  time that training him to fire an artillery gun.    "The eventual new defence force will not come into being  overnight. Cultures will have to be assimilated. We must get  people to believe in the same things, train together, play sport  together and even make war together."    Outlining the differences between a liberation army, such as  Umkhonto we Sizwe, and the SADF, he said the training MK had  received was that of a freedom fighter. "It is totally  different to the necessary skills for a conventional defence  service." The SANDF believes that it is an apolitical  organisation which serves the government of the day. "A soldier  is a professional, highly trained, highly disciplined being with  skills in a particular type of warfare.    "A freedom fighter behaves in a political way," he says.    Now freedom fighters have to be assimilated into the  apolitical culture of the SANDF. He believes, however, that the  culture of the defence force is so strong that there will be no  need for a political reorientation of former freedom fighters.    His message to blacks who wish to join the defence force is  that the SANDF is changing as the country was changing. "It is  not an entity above the country or beyond it.    "We believe we are an apolitical, professional force that is  from the people, for the people."    He hopes that the liberation armies will have a positive  contribution to make on the emerging SANDF "that they will build  it up rather than break it down".    Pondering the failings of the old SADF, he says the force  has  "done our job as we were given it to do. As part of the state  system, one does good or as bad as the state tells one to do."    "The complexion of the State is now changing, therefore our  complexion should also change."    Asked if he intended to hold on to his job, he said he was  on  a five-year contract and was more than willing to continue. "It  depends of what the new government tells me to do," he said.    Should the new government turn into a one-party Marxist  state, he said any officer who could not find it within himself  to support the state would have to resign.    He did not believe, however, that it would become a Marxist  state.    The various armies that are to make up the SANDF are being  placed at assembly points to be integrated under the direction  of the Joint Military Co-Ordinating Council.</p>

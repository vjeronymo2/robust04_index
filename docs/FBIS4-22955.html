			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by T. I. Sukashev, L. U. Gapuova, A. Zh. Nauanova, </F> M. S. Rozenberg and B. K. Yelamanov, Aktyubinsk Oblast Public  Health and Epidemiological Station; UDC 614:621.31]    [Text]Abstract: A department of informatics and ASU  was established at the Aktyubinsk Oblast Public Health and  Epidemiological Station, while automated control system (ASU)  groups were formed at the rayon level. Information was  transmitted from the rayons to the oblast ASU, where the data  were fed into a computer. This freed specialists of the oblast  public health and epidemiological station from having to fill  out report forms and other documents. The experience of working  with computers showed that epidemic control measures are now  being implemented more efficiently and promptly in the public  health system.    Key Words: public health and epidemiological station,  computer, automated control system, preventive work.    Computerization of public health and epidemiological  institutions, which is gaining momentum, should culminate in  creation of a sector-wide automated system for managing the  public health and epidemiological service of the Kazakh  Republic. The Sanepid OASU [Sector Automated Control System of  the Kazakh Republic Public Health and Epidemiological Service]  is a man-machine information and advisory system in which man  functions as the controlling and decision-making unit, and which  is intended for dynamic observation, evaluation and prediction  of correlations in a complex social triad:  production--environment--public health. The goal of the ASU is  prompt and high quality accounting, analysis, evaluation and  prediction of the health of the population and of the state of  the environment, and their interaction.    Under the OASU presently in operation, activities of  administrative bodies such as collecting, monitoring and storing  data, analyzing them from numerous aspects, subjecting results  to expert examination and issuing hygienic conclusions are  automated. These bodies also retain the functions of evaluating  the presented results and making administrative decisions. All  of this requires the strictest possible fulfillment of certain  requirements. First of all the same package of programs must be  used throughout, so that the information could be processes  throughout the republic as a whole, and feedback could be  provided.    A department of informatics and ASU was established under  the  oblast public health and epidemiological station in early 1992  and ASU groups, each consisting of three persons and supported  by public funding, were formed at the city and rayon levels in  order to service the computers and process the data. The data  transmission procedure was simplified: Data are now transmitted  by telephone from local public health and epidemiological  stations and then fed into the computer. This frees specialists  of the oblast public health and epidemiological station from  having to fill out report forms, and the information is  transmitted to the Ministry of Health by modem. In the past it  was sent by mail or by courier.    Use of 12 computer programs makes it possible to efficiently  control the public health and epidemiological situation in the  oblast. Thus, after the data are processed, a specialist may  request, at any time and in the necessary quantity, outputted  documents representing report form No. 1 (infectious morbidity)  taking the form of 24 statistical tables, and form No. 5  (preventive immunizations) with 12 statistical tables.  Analytical tables on individual infectious diseases in the  reporting period of the current year (in absolute numbers and as  indicators per 100,000 population) are furnished to specialists  on demand. The growth or decline of morbidity on a cross section  of the oblast's administrative territories is calculated in  these tables. The user sets a fixed data monitoring period--a  week, a month, a quarter or a year. At the sector level we  selected a week.    The processed information consists of values of monitored  indicators referenced to particular objects of analysis (water,  food products, air, the population etc.) and objects of  inspection (monitored institutions and territorial facilities)  at which the corresponding bacteriological, public health and  chemical analyses were made.    The monitored indicators include unsatisfactory results of  bacteriological analyses (for example, isolation of pathogenic  and conditionally pathogenic microorganisms, detection of  various sorts of deviations of the overall content of  microorganisms from the standards, and so on), as well as  so-called ``risk factors'' (information on physicochemical  pollution, violations of production conditions, accidents etc.).    The ``Public Health and Epidemiological Evaluation of  Industrial and Drinking Water Supply'' program provides an  objective evaluation of the potential epidemiological danger  presented by water pipelines on a regular basis (once a month),  while the ``Public Health and Epidemiological Evaluation of  Oblast Dairies'' program gives evidence of the probability of  production of infected products.    Creation of a single set of software for the republic's  entire public health and epidemiological service creates the  possibility, depending on the way in which this software is  used, to make the necessary changes and additions in the course  of operation, with regard for, as an example, the specific needs  of the user, the particular statistical report forms, and so on.    The issue of computerizing the republic's public health and  epidemiological service at the oblast level has now been  resolved, which has resulted in the creation of a unified  network and a sector-wide data bank. In our oblast, besides the  oblast computers there are also computers in the city and the  Martukskiy public health and epidemiological stations. In the  future, as funds are appropriated, we intend to furnish each  rayon public health and epidemiological station with a minimum  of one IBM PC/AT personal computer, which will make it possible  to fundamentally change the system for collecting, transmitting  and analyzing information, and to upgrade the quality and  efficiency of its processing.    Efforts to organize and operate data bases and software in  the first generation of the Sanepid OASU have now entered their  final stage in the oblast. We have created a data base  supporting background public health indicators, infectious  morbidity indicators, the accounting and use of bacterial  preparations, and other programs at the rayon level. This is  making it possible to manage the public health and  epidemiological situation better, and to develop packages of  public health and epidemic control measures with adequate lead  time.</p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / International Company News: Thyssen cuts payout as steel division deteriorates THYSSEN, the German steel and engineering group, is to cut its dividend by 40 per cent to DM6 a share following a 33 per cent slump in net earnings for the year to the end of September. Describing the results as 'satisfactory' - profits were DM350m (Dollars 219.5m) compared with DM520 last time and DM690m in 1990 - the group reported advances in all key divisions except steel. The business environment had worsened considerably in recent months, Thyssen said. There were virtually no signs of growth anywhere, and threatened subsidies and protectionism in steel markets were making a bad situation even worse. Even so, the group expected its capital goods and trading divisions to report successful results for the current year. Volume sales, turnover and profits at Thyssen Stahl, its main steel business, all suffered from the cyclical crisis afflicting the international market. Output fell 4 per cent and sales were down 5 per cent at DM9.9bn. Turnover from the group's special steel activities, which are being merged with Thyssen Stahl, fell 8 per cent to DM3.1bn. Government statistics, released yesterday, reflected both the recent rapid deterioration in the steel market and companies' efforts to cope with it. Raw steel output in western Germany during October was 10.5 per cent lower than a year earlier. However, production for the first 10 months was down only 1.9 per cent. Last month's sudden drop was caused in part by implementation of Thyssen's plans to cut output by 25 per cent in the last quarter of this year and reductions in other companies forced by falling demand from industries hit by the general domestic slowdown. Group sales fell 2 per cent to DM35.8bn for the year under review despite a 4 per cent improvement to DM8.7bn in the capital goods and processing division, whichalso showed improved profits. HOESCH, another leading German steelmaker, announced an almost complete shutdown over Christmas and the new year, and said further cuts could not be ruled out. Lex, Page 20</p>

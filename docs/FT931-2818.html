			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Seoul move on interest rate delayed South Korea's new government is delaying plans to deregulate most interest rates until the second half of the year, writes John Burton in Seoul. Mr Hong Jae-hyong, finance minister, said this was because deregulation could increase interest rates and further slow economic growth. He said the government might instead cut the central bank's key lending rates for the second time in three months to stimulate the economy. It will decide whether to deregulate interest rates after reviewing economic growth during the second quarter.</p>

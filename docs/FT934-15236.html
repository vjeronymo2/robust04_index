			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Redundancies at NI Electricity NORTHERN Ireland Electricity, the former public utility which was privatised in June, is to shed 600 jobs in the next three years. The redundancies, announced yesterday, will affect management and manual workers in all areas of the company except the shops which sell electrical appliances. Discussions have already started with the trade unions. The company said: 'We are operating in a new environment and part of the redundancy programme has already been discussed in the context of reorganisation.' The utility's privatisation began in April last year when the province's four power stations were sold. The transmission, distribution and supply side of the business were sold in a public flotation in June. More than 600,000 applications for shares were received with the initial price set at Pounds 1 a share with a further Pounds 1 instalment payable next June. Turnover and operating profits for 1992-93 were Pounds 452.4m and Pounds 56.6m respectively. Around 500 people have already left the company since the power stations were sold and a further 600 will reduce total employment to around 2,600. Many employees have long service records and are likely to be attracted by an enhanced redundancy package. Management said customers would not expect the company to unnecessarily add costs to services. The job losses were part of a long-term plan aimed at stabilising prices, it said.</p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Guinness pressure continues The fall-out from Guinness's round of meetings with analysts on Wednesday continued, a series of downgrades sending the shares once again into retreat. The meetings followed purported remarks by the company's chief executive and chairman-elect that trading conditions would be tougher in 1993 than in 1992. The meetings, which continued yesterday, clarified Guinness's trading situation and led analysts to cut profit forecasts. Most pulled their figures back by between 6-10 per cent to around Pounds 920m for this year. But such is the pessimism regarding earnings growth for the following 12 months that the new 1994 forecasts are not substantially above 1993. Guinness was said to have pinpointed the problems as chiefly in the Spanish beer market, LVMH, the French luxury products maker in which Guinness has a cross holding, and a higher interest charge caused by sterling's devaluation. After falling 23 on Wednesday, the shares tumbled a further 24 yesterday, closing at 478p. However, some analysts feel they sill have further to go. Mr David Thompson at Kleinwort Benson argued that the shares should be sold down to 450p, and that they will probably fall further still in the short-term. Tarmac alert A sudden burst of activity in shares of Tarmac, the building materials/housebuilding group, revived takeover stories, with market rumours suggesting that BTR, the conglomerate, could be about to launch a bid for the troubled building company. Turnover was boosted by the second half of a bed and breakfast, or tax-related, deal in the stock which accounted for some 4.4m shares in early trade. But heavy demand during the afternoon saw overall turnover in the stock spiral to 15m shares, the heaviest single day's business since mid-September. Tarmac shares settled a net 4 higher at 99p. Tarmac has been the subject of many takeover stories this year. An offer from Minorco, part of Mr Harry Oppenheimer's worldwide mining empire, was said to have been rebuffed by the UK group. BTR settled a penny harder at 512p on turnover of 3.7m. TSB sell-off A substantial profits downgrade by Smith New Court was behind the marked weakness of TSB shares which, after a steady performance for much of the morning, suddenly came under pressure prior to closing a busy session a net 4 off at 139p. Turnover in the stock expanded sharply during the afternoon, eventually reaching 4.7m shares. Smith New Court's banks analyst Mr Michael Lever chopped his current year profits expectation, already one of the lowest in the market, by half, down from a previous Pounds 125m to Pounds 62m. Mr Lever blamed the steep reduction on the ongoing problems at Hill Samuel, the merchant bank bought by TSB in the late-1980's. He said worries about Hill Samuel's Mortgage Express division had been prompted by the recent warning on the mortgage business issued by Abbey National. 'Mortgage Express needs more provisioning,' said Mr Lever. Store group hit A critical note from US-owned broker Goldman Sachs helped hurt Marks and Spencer in a weak stores sector. The shares retreated 9 to 319p. Analyst Mr Paul Deacon argues that the food and stores group will suffer on two fronts, namely from the rapid expansion of the big food retailers and from its low retail recovery potential. Both issues point to several years' underperformance from the shares. Renewed fears of a price war in the perfume market hit Boots following reports that the high street retailer and chemist had reduced prices of some brands by 25 per cent. However, analysts played down the concerns arguing that the effect on Boots would only be in the region of 1 per cent of profits. The shares, which have had a good run, fell 8 to 519p. Results from Great Universal Stores, although in line with expectations, proved worrying in parts to some in the market and the shares were marked back. Most criticism was voiced over the low margin growth in the mail order business. The shares fell 35 to 1618p. SG Warburg was said to have been advising clients to take profits. Sears slipped 2 to 97p. Kleinwort Benson changed from a buy to a hold on the stock which it considers to have overrun. Initial strength in conglomerate Lonrho gave way to heavy selling, leaving the shares to close 4 lighter at 75p, 10p below the 3-for-10 rights issue price of 85p, as market watchers predicted that take-up of the issue was likely to be very low. Turnover had reached 6m by the close. The shares moved 4 ahead to 83p in early trading but closer examination of the offer details led to a turnaround in sentiment. The two-way pull in BP continued yesterday with the shares again the most active on the London market with turnover approaching the 22m-mark. At the close the shares were marginally easier at 221 1/2 p as domestic sellers achieved ascendancy over US buyers. Shell, meanwhile, eased to 548p on good turnover of 7.7m, despite reported switching from BP. There was no let up in the selling pressure on Lasmo. The latter dropped a further 8 to 143p despite a well-received presentation in the US. Enterprise also suffered, falling 10 to 434p. Premier Consolidated, on the other hand, touched 19p prior to closing a net penny ahead at 18 1/2 p after more encouraging drilling news from its operations off the coast of Burma. The maintained interim dividend announced by Pilkington, the glass specialist, took the market by surprise and saw the shares run up to 89p before settling a net 3 higher at 87p. Turnover reached 16m shares with dealers reporting takeover speculation. The stunning performance of computer software group Tadpole Technology since the debut on Monday continued another burst of buying, driving the shares up 8 to 143p. Coach operator National Express made an impressive debut on the market. The offer and sale of nearly 28m shares at 165p was said to have been oversubscribed and the shares closed 6 higher at 171p. Turnover in Anglo-French paper group Arjo Wiggins Appleton rose to 13m, after UBS Phillips &amp; drew, the company's broker, downgraded current and following year profit expectations. The shares fell 6 to 145p, after UBS reduced its profits estimate for this year by Pounds 25m to Pounds 160m, and cut the following year's figure by Pounds 32m to Pounds 158m. BZW prompted a burst of strength in Lloyds Bank shares by lifting their current year profits forecast from Pounds 665m to Pounds 700m. 'We think provisions will be marginally lower than we previously expected,' said Mr Julian Robins, banks specialist at BZW. The change helped drive Lloyds shares up 5 to 502p on good turnover of 3.2m. HSBC tumbled 15 more to 471p, with dealers wary of further big falls on the Hong Kong market. Standard Chartered shares were sustained by their impending entry to the prestigious Footsie-100 and settled only a fraction off at 534p. Hambros Bank retreated very late in the session, slipping 11 to 219p as the market reacted nervously to suggestions that a verdict in the long-running dispute between the merchant bank and the state of the late Norwegian shipping magnate Mr Hilmar Reksten will be made next month. The continued decline in Guinness again undermined Allied Lyons, the stock off 11 at 617p. However, Grand Metropolitan bounced back on hopes that the US recovery would lift trading. The shares rose 7 to 430p. Disappointment at presentations held by Cadbury-Schweppes and United Biscuits was said to have knocked both stocks. The former retreated 9 to 456p and the latter 10 to 337p. The disposal of the loss-making Sliks swimwear division and concentration on the lingerie business was behind the strong performance of Celestion shares, up 10 to 77p.

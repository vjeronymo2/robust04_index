			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: ICL makes Pounds 100m rights to bolster balance sheet ICL, the computer company is raising a total of Pounds 100m through a rights issue, underwritten by its parent, Fujitsu of Japan. Northern Telecom of Canada, which holds 20 per cent of ICL, is not taking up its entitlement resulting in Fujitsu's stake rising from 80 per cent to 84 per cent. Fujitsu is subscribing for 77m new shares for Pounds 50m, giving it an entitlement to warrants to subscribe for a further Pounds 50m of new shares next year. It has agreed to exercise the warrants in November 1994. It is the first time since 1982 that ICL has sought further equity and reflects the company's pessimistic view of trading conditions for the next two years. Mr Peter Bonfield, chairman and chief executive, said the issue was to strengthen the balance sheet as a precaution against continuing structural upheaval in the industry. 'Against this background,' he said, 'it is more important than ever that we approach the next few years from the strongest possible financial base. 'I may be more cautious than I need be, but I believe a number of information technology companies are going to find themselves seriously short of cash and that access to money will become as big a problem as access to technology.' The proceeds will be used to cut borrowings, giving gearing of between 20 per cent and 30 per cent against the present 50 per cent to 60 per cent. Fujitsu took over ICL, formerly a subsidiary of STC, at the end of 1990. The two companies have since operated at arms length, partly in preparation for ICL's return to the London stock market, now unlikely for at least three years. As a consequence, Fujitsu's further investment has been treated as a formal rights issue. ICL has proved the only consistently profitable European computer maker over the past few years as red ink has engulfed its French, German and Italian competitors. Profitability has been falling, however. Last year the group recorded pre-tax profits of Pounds 60.6m on turnover of Pounds 2.48bn. Mr Bonfield did not see appreciably better results for the next two years.</p>

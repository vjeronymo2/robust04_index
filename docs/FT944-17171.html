			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Plans for agency owe more to dogma than concern for business Sir, Your report, 'Companies House plans attacked' (October 4), describes but one of the threats arising from the proposal by trade and industry secretary, Michael Heseltine, to contract out most of the agency's services. Within three to five years of a contractor being appointed, the agency's London presence would be reduced to being that of a deposit-only (ie post box) facility. More than 100 jobs would be lost in the process. By then, Companies House would merely be a wholesaler of company information, with large commercial retailers offering on those data (no doubt supplemented with other business information which many users might not actually want) at 'commercial' rates. At this point, many company search agents' jobs, and perhaps entire businesses, would be lost. Meanwhile, the contractor or contractors who had taken over what remained of Companies House would be trying, understandably, to make a profit. However, the European Court ruling in the so-called Italian Tax case ('Companies House to cut charges after EU court ruling', August 16) would prevent that margin from being derived from Companies House fee income. Since ministers have claimed that contracting-out would not increase costs to the taxpayer, the only way left to ensure contractors' profitability would be by allowing them to reduce the quality of the service offered. This then raises a far bigger issue than the consequential loss of several hundred jobs to the struggling south Wales economy. Company information is simply not going to be as available, accurate and complete as it is now. Good news no doubt for companies with something to hide: bad news for others about to do business with them. A large and growing number of our customers are now the ones who are saying loudest that Conservative dogma and ideology, and not true concern for business, are what really lie behind the Companies House review. It is about time that ministers started to listen. Howard Pell, member, National Union of Civil and Public Servants, Room 2.145, Companies House, Crown Way, Cardiff CF4 3UZ</p>

			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PARENT GETS PROBATION FOR SON'S TRUANCY  </P> <P> A 38-year-old Downey mother, who pleaded guilty to violating the state  Education Code, is one of the first parents to be prosecuted by the district  attorney's office in a crackdown on truant children.  </P> <P> Linda M. Parmenter was placed on probation for nine months last week and was  ordered to attend parenting classes with her 9-year-old son. The son was  ordered to attend school regularly next school year.  </P> <P> Parmenter was sentenced by Downey Municipal Court Judge Robert G. Drees.  </P> <P> Parmenter was prosecuted under the district attorney's Truancy Mediation  Program. The program, by Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, was  initiated in February to enforce the state Education Code provision that  requires youths ages 6 to 18 to attend school daily. Since February, the  district attorney's office has reviewed 250 cases in the county and referred  nine to adult court and 12 to Juvenile Court for code violations.  </P> <P> "When kids are not in school, they are out in the streets," Deputy Dist. Atty.  Leslie Hanke said. She said the program may also prevent crimes by youths who  are frequently absent from school.  </P> <P> Truancy problems go to the state School Attendance Review Board, where a  hearing is held. Both the guardian and student are asked to sign an agreement  to comply with the law. The case is reviewed 45 days later.  </P></p>

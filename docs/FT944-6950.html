			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Motoring: Range Rover is no stick-in-the-mud - This mobile drawing room can be taken for a rough ride The woodland ride was like a switchback - glutinously muddy on the peaks, deeply waterlogged in the troughs. Bushes scraped the sides of my Range Rover 4.6 HSE automatic as it dealt effortlessly with terrain on which few people would risk a valuable horse. So what was I up to, treating Pounds 44,362 worth of air conditioned, wood and leather trimmed mobile drawing room as cruelly as a farmer might a battered old Land Rover? It was all the manufacturer's doing. 'Come to Eastnor Castle,' an executive had said. 'I know you liked driving our new Range Rovers on the road; now spend a day trying them over the rough stuff.' (He could have added: 'Where only one buyer in 100 ever drives them.') Eastnor Castle estate provides the best (by which I mean the worst) terrain in Britain on which to play with a 4x4. Barring snowy wastes, rocky screes or desert sands, you can find any kind of surface that an on-off road four-wheel drive could be expected to cope with or climb up. With one exception; the proverbial high kerb outside Harrods, which is the toughest obstacle most Range Rover owners reckon to surmount. No doubt the resourceful Major Ben Hervey-Bathurst, who for years has allowed Land Rover use of the Eastnor Castle estate to test its products to destruction, could provide one if asked. This archetypal English country gentleman has managed, with the aid of bulldozers and, it is rumoured, occasional explosions by army personnel in training, to provide absolutely everything else. Coincidentally, I had a Range Rover LSD - the model with a BMW 2.5-litre turbo-diesel engine and manual gearbox - on test. On the 400-mile return trip from my home to Eastnor it motorway-cruised in near silence at business motorist's speeds, rode and handled almost like a luxury car on A and B roads and returned a more than satisfactory 24.7mpg (11.44 l/100km). This bluff fronted, two-tonne, on-off road vehicle is no heavy drinker. But back to serious off-roading. There used to be a golden rule for driving off-road. Never touch the brakes. On steep, slippery hills, rely entirely on the drag of the engine in low range first gear to control the rate of descent. This meant automatics were inclined to run away. But the Range Rover has ABS brakes. I was allowed a dab on the pedal to keep the 4.6 HSE nicely under control on muddy slopes as steep as the roof of a house. Nothing fazed this most luxurious of all Range Rovers. An air suspension that can be set to five different heights is also standard equipment. The lowest setting is to make it easier for women in tight skirts to enter and leave with dignity. And the highest gives enough extra clearance to let it be driven over humps on which lesser machines might perch helplessly, all four wheels off the ground. On the road, the Range Rover's heavy beam axles prevent ride comfort - good though it is - from being equal to that of independently suspended luxury saloons such as BMW's 7-Series, the Mercedes S-Class and Jaguar's XJs. But off road, the Range Rover has no rival. Extreme axle articulation keeps all the wheels on the ground while the soft air suspension takes the sting out of what would otherwise be horrifying bumps. A slightly less expensive (Pounds 36,512) 4.0-litre V8 petrol engined Range Rover with automatic transmission went just as well as the flagship 4.6 HSE but my favourite, on as well as off road, was the 2.5-litre turbo-diesel. It costs the same as the 4.0-litre V8. On road, I prefer automatics (a two pedal diesel is coming next year) but I still think there is nothing like manual transmission for serious off-roading. On hills on which ABS brakes were needed to curb the automatic V8's urge to run away, the turbo-diesel wound itself down slowly with the sure-footedness of a mountain goat. With bucketfuls of torque (pulling power) at low revolutions, it climbed steep slopes in third gear without excessive wheel spin. Most of the people who drive Range Rovers - or for that matter Shoguns, Land Cruisers, Troopers and the rest - have not the slightest idea of the off-road capability that has been built into them. Many are not interested. But any who are should take advantage of the off-road driving courses offered by the manufacturers and independent specialists. Beware of the operators who buy a couple of clapped-out old Land Rovers and rent a disused quarry. Vince Cobley, who runs off-road events in Northamptonshire, says an inexperienced driver of a 4x4 on rough terrain can be a disaster. His firm, Pro-Trax, can provide vehicles and tuition. But if you have a 4x4 of your own, you can have tuition and then try serious off-roading on a course that will leave your vehicle dirty but undamaged. Call him on 0536-770096. After a day's driving through mud and water, I promise you will never look upon your on-off road 4x4 as just a high-slung car substitute again.</p>

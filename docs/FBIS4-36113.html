			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Safwat Abu-Talib] </F>   [Text] Iraqi Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf has  stated that there are positive signs at the UN Security Council  that might lead to the lifting of the blockade imposed on Iraq  in the near future. In a statement to AL-JUMHURIYAH, he  stressed that his country seeks to extend its hand to the  neighboring Arab and non-Arab countries to coordinate their  policies in the interest of the peoples, noting that this desire  is at times rejected and at other times remains confined to  contacts, as is the case between Iraq and Qatar and Oman.    Responding to a question on the reasons why Iraq refused to  recognize Security Council Resolution 833 that defines the  demarcation line and border posts between Iraq and Kuwait,  al-Sahhaf said that this resolution did not include a provision  requesting Iraq to recognize it. If it had included such a  provision, we would not have hesitated to recognize it. He  added: We agreed to and complied with Security Council  Resolution 687 that outlined the conditions that must be met to  lift the blockade. We have met all the conditions, as the ad  hoc committee and the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency]  have recognized. There is now a majority in the Security  Council demanding that the embargo be lifted.    Al-Sahhaf said: Generally speaking, the Security Council  requested Iraq to abolish the resolutions regarding Kuwait. We  indeed abolished all the resolutions, including the one on the  19th Governorate. This revocation was outlined in official  letters to the Security Council, which accepted them.    Commenting on Iraqi President Saddam Husayn assuming the  post  of prime minister in the recently formed cabinet, al-Sahhaf  said: This decision was made in accordance with a proposal by  the Revolutionary Command Council to help the Iraqi people deal  with their suffering.    Responding to a question on the possibility of partitioning  Iraq, al-Sahhaf said: Even if all other countries were to be  partitioned, Iraq would never be partitioned under any  circumstances because its social, economic, and cultural fabric  have survived for more than 7,000 years. The best proof of this  is the failure of the Kurdish gangs in northern Iraq to achieve  the schemes drawn for them.    Regarding the future of the Nonaligned Movement, al-Sahhaf  said: We agree with the view President Husni Mubarak proposed at  his inaugural speech. We believe that there is a need to  activate the movement and strengthen the bonds among its members  to face the present and the future, particularly after the  demise of the Soviet Union. A dialogue should be held between  the Nonaligned Movement members and the countries of the north  to prevent accumulation of the causes of conflict.    Responding to a question asking if Iraq seeks dialogue and  respects its neighbors, why it does not respect international  legitimacy, al-Sahhaf said: International legitimacy has  substance and is not slogans. The firm substance of the  international legitimacy is international law and the UN  charter. Anything else is not international legitimacy.    Replying to a question on Iraq's position on the Yemeni war  and on reports of Iraqi pilots' participation in the war,  al-Sahhaf emphasized that there is no Iraqi pilot or soldier  taking part in the Yemeni war. Anyone who says this has to  prove it.    Regarding the Kuwaiti POW's in Iraq, al-Sahhaf said: In  fact, there is no POW problem but a problem of missing people.  Kuwait has 611 missing people and Iraq has more than 60,000  missing. We maintain that this humanitarian issue should be  addressed in accordance with the Geneva agreements. The files  we received from Kuwait through the Red Cross Committee affirm  that they are missing. Every file that the Kuwaiti Government  submitted has the word missing written on it. This issue will  take a long time. We must not forget that the Americans still  have missing personnel in Vietnam.</p>

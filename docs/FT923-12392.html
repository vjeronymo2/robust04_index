			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / West to aid Jakarta despite rights abuses WESTERN aid donors yesterday pledged Dollars 4.94bn (Pounds 2.58bn) to Indonesia this year, despite lingering concerns about its human rights record. The pledges, made at a meeting organised by the World Bank, follow Indonesia's decision, in March, to disband its Dutch-chaired aid forum. Jakarta has refused Dutch aid since then, angered by alleged Dutch interference in its internal affairs. The Netherlands and other donors have shown concern about the killing of protesters in East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, last November. Reuter reported yesterday that Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, Portugal's foreign minister, warned that his country would block a European Community accord with the Association of South East Asian Nations, unless Indonesia improved its human rights. Economic deregulation plans, tabled earlier this month, also met with initial disappointment from donors. However, western countries yesterday praised the government for reducing dependence on oil imports (from two thirds of foreign earnings a few years ago to one third now), for stimulating the private sector and curbing poverty. The aid, for the tax year to the end of March 1993, is a slight increase on the Dollars 4.75bn pledged last year. About Dollars 1bn will be for balance of payments support and the rest for development. Japan remains Indonesia's biggest donor.</p>

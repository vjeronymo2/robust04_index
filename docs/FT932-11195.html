			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Tenaga Nasional beats market expectations TENAGA Nasional, Malaysia's partially-privatised electricity utility, reported pre-tax profits of MDollars 911m (USDollars 354m) for the six months to February 1993, a 15 per cent increase over the same period last year. Turnover improved to MDollars 2.4bn from MDollars 2.06bn. The results were slightly above market expectations and reflect expanding power sales in Malaysia's fast-growing economy. Tenaga shares were heavily oversubscribed when the government sold some 25 per cent of the company a year ago. But it fell out of favour following a series of power failures. Tenaga said unexpectedly high demand and maintenance work had necessitated load shedding in several areas. The company admits that adequate power supplies might not be available for some months. Analysts point out that demand for electricity is likely to continue to expand. But any future large scale power failures might lead to the government reorganising the company. They also say that with more than 25 per cent of Tenaga's long-term loans yen-denominated, the company is likely to be hit by the continued rise in the value of the Japanese currency, which has appreciated 12 per cent against the Malaysian dollar so far this year.</p>

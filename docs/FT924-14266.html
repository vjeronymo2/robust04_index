			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Where there's a will, there's a better way - Scheherazade Daneshkhu lists the benefits FOR MANY people, writing a will is about as attractive as signing their own death warrant. Some feel they have too little to leave and others cannot bear thinking about who should get what. But many simply never get around to what they consider a ghoulish task. This probably explains why just under 70 per cent of the population does not have a will, according to a recent survey by Gallup. But dying without one can cause unnecessary hardship or hurt to family and friends. So, the Law Society has designated next week as Write a Will Week. Many married couples believe a spouse will inherit all of the other's worldly goods. But under the intestacy rules in England and Wales, a spouse gets only the first Pounds 75,000 of an estate; the rest is shared between the spouse and the couple's children. If there are none, the spouse is entitled to the first Pounds 125,000 and shares the rest with his or her parents (the rules for Northern Ireland and Scotland are slightly different). A will also can be an important tax planning tool. While there is no inheritance tax (IHT) when an estate is left to a spouse, there is the danger of a higher IHT bill when they die. But married couples can make use of their nil rate bands to save their children paying too much tax. Mary Falk, a partner at law firm Farrer &amp; Co., suggests a simplified case in which one spouse leaves Pounds 150,000 (his nil rate band for the present tax year) to the children and the rest of his estate to his widow. If she also makes use of her nil rate band in her will, there would be no IHT on Pounds 300,000 of their joint estate. A will does not have to be complicated but there are dangers in keeping it too brief. John Tompkins, a chartered surveyor, describes how his uncle left a will directing that everything he owned should be transferred to his wife, who was 10 years younger. The uncle was seriously ill in hospital when his wife, who had written a detailed will, died of a heart attack. 'Because of his wife's sudden death, none of her wishes, which included selling the family home and leaving the proceeds in trust for a great-nephew, could be honoured,' says Tompkins. A will usually has three sections: appointing executors, distributing the property, and prescribing powers for the trustees. Executors handle your affairs after you die. It is usual to appoint a spouse, or the main beneficiary of the will, as executor but it is advisable to have two executors to share the burden. But you should make sure first that they are happy with the responsibility. Professionals, such as solicitors or accountants, can be appointed but there should be a clause to arrange payment of their fees. Those with children should also think of whom to appoint as guardian. Inheritors. Before deciding who should get what, list what there is to leave. This will include your house, car, and valuable possessions such as jewellery and investments. These should be described clearly. It is advisable to name family members you wish to benefit. If you just say 'my children' and have step-children, there could be a problem of interpretation. Since you will probably be unable to divide up your estate down to the last pence, you should also state who is to inherit what is left over - the residue. If one of your beneficiaries dies before you make an amendment to the will, their inheritance will be added to the residue. Trustees can be given variable degrees of discretion over how much money children should receive, and when. They own property legally for your beneficiaries - usually children to the age of 18 - but cannot benefit from that property themselves. To draw up a will, you can go to a bank (which will insist on being an executor) or will-writing service, but it is safest to consult a solicitor, particularly if your estate is large or complicated. Which?, the Consumer's Association* magazine, found in its latest survey that the cost of a simple will drawn up by a solicitor was between Pounds 25-Pounds 50, with more complicated wills starting at Pounds 100. Ask for an estimate in advance and try to find a good solicitor through personal recommendation. Mary Falk says there are several essentials to bear in mind: The will must have at least three signatures to be valid - your own and that of two witnesses. They cannot be beneficiaries (if they are, their inheritance will be invalidated). Marriage revokes a will automatically (unless the person you are marrying is mentioned specifically in it). Divorce also produces complications. Your bequest to a former spouse can be revoked by divorce, but not necessarily. Review your will every five years - or sooner if your personal or financial situation changes significantly. *The Consumers' Association this week published The Which?

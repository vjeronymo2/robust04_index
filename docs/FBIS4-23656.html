			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Government communique issued in Bamako on 9 June -- read by </F> announcer]    [Text] The Republic of Mali has, since independence on 22  September 1960, always considered as one of its priority  external policy issues, the safeguarding of international peace  and security. For Mali, maintaining peace and security has no  price because it is convinced that without peace and security  there cannot be smooth development, an indispensable condition  for the improvement of the living standards of our people.  Based on this principle, our country has made every effort to  make its modest contribution to peacekeeping operations in  various African countries. Yesterday, it was in Congo -- now  Zaire -- and today, it is in Liberia, Burundi, and Rwanda.    Confronted with the magnitude of that human tragedy, the UN  Security Council in Resolution No. 918/1994 of 17 May, launched  an appeal to the international community to bring the number of  the soldiers of the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda to 7,500.  In line with the implementation of this resolution, the Malian  Government has decided to send 150 men to Rwanda in addition to  the 10 officers already present on the field. This  contribution, although modest, concretizes our country's  willingness to act in line with its international commitments  and to express its solidarity with our Rwandan brothers.    Indeed, nothing can justify the genocide that is raging in  that country and Africa's silence in the face of such a tragedy  constitutes a dangerous precedent. Despite a difficult internal  situation, we do not have the right to live in ostracism because  we have to assume our historic mission in Africa and for the  African people to the end.</p>

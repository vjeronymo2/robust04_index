			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Jiri Leschtina: "Puzzling Pleasure on the </F> Part of the President"]    [Text] On Saturday [26 March], President Vaclav Havel  confided to reporters that he was extraordinarily pleased about  the proposal by a group of deputies that endeavors to  consolidate the Civic Democratic Party [ODS] idea of 81  single-seat constituencies for the senate elections with the  remainder of the coalition that demands 27 three-seat  constituencies. The newly emerged "81 + 27" hybrid is,  however, more reason for lament than pleasure.    The "81 + 27" project assumes for the first senate  elections 27 constituencies, in which the citizens would have  three votes to cast in three smaller (sub)wards. While we would  have 81 small wards, the citizen would not vote for a single  senator in his ward, as proposed by the traditional majority  system, but also in two additional ones. Moreover, these 81  wards are to exist only the first time around. In the  subsequent senate elections, the citizens would only vote for  one candidate in 27 large constituencies, as the smaller  coalition parties headed by the Civic Democratic Alliance [ODA]  demanded from the very beginning.    In other words, the deputies propose: In the first year, we  will satisfy the ODS's demand for 81 wards (no longer according  to the pure majority principle of one candidate-one vote), and,  in subsequent years, we will transfer to the ODA system. Every  second year, then, a single senator would be elected in each of  the 27 wards. In the meantime, the ODS proposal has the citizen  elect his senator once in six years.    Why, however, is the president so pleased with this  pseudocompromise, when he recently declared that he likes the  idea of small single-seat constituencies, calling it a pure  majority system as prescribed by the Constitution?    It seems that, at the last moment, the president revised his  opinion so he does not have to support the ODS in its struggle  against the ODA and the Christian and Democratic  Union-Czechoslovak People's Party [KDU-CSL]. The meeting on  Thursday [24 March] between the president and [ODA chairman] Jan  Kalvoda and [KDU-CSL chairman] Josef Lux (for the second time in  absence of Vaclav Klaus] indicates that a certain triumvirate is  emerging for defense against the prime minister and his party.    There is nothing wrong with Havel, Lux, and Kalvoda feeling  the need to join hands and face the hegemony of Czech politics  together. Nevertheless, it is no reason for the president to  turn away from the practical project of the ODS, which complies  with the constitutional stipulations better than any of the  other projects.</p>

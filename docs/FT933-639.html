			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: CNC deal on Indosuez loans CLARKE Nickolls &amp; Coombs, the property investment and trading company, has reached agreement with Banque Indosuez under which a third party could gain control. An unnamed company is to take over Clarke's liabilities for CNC Grand Union in return for shares. Clarke is also paying shares for a portfolio of commercial properties from the company. As a result the company will hold more than 50 per cent of Clarke's enlarged capital. Mr Richard Mais, managing director, said he could not name the company as there was a lot of work still to do. It was hoped a further, more detailed, announcement would be made within a month. The shares rose 3p to 22p.</p>

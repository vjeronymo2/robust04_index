			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FIREFIGHTERS FREE HIM AFTER COLLISION;  </P> <P> DRIVER TRAPPED BY LOAD OF METAL SAVED  </P> <P> A piece of metal weighing two tons crashed through the back of a pickup truck  and into the cab in a three-vehicle collision Friday, trapping the driver for  more than an hour before firefighters could free him, Santa Ana police said.  </P> <P> Benjamin Chavez, 23, of Santa Ana suffered serious injuries in the midday  collision at Raitt Street and MacArthur Boulevard after the impact of the crash  lodged the metal in Chavez's back and jammed the truck's doors shut.  </P> <P> Motorists tried to help, but the piece of prefabricated metal, which was  apparently unsecured, was too heavy to move, witnesses said. "I tried to pull  the door open, but it was stuck," said Frank Beverly, who stood by watching  rescue workers try to free the man. "You couldn't move it."  </P> <P> Surgeons helicoptered to the scene, prepared for an on-the-spot operation if  firefighters had been unable to free Chavez. But he was taken from the wreckage  at 1:10 p.m. after firefighters used a pneumatic jack and a tow truck to pry  the metal off the victim and open the pickup's doors. Chavez was put aboard a  Lifeline helicopter that landed on the field of Greenville Fundamental School  next to the intersection and flown to United Western Medical Center-Santa Ana,  where he was reported in serious condition Friday night with a possible broken  back and internal injuries.  </P> <P> Police said the pickup collided with a car trying to turn north onto Raitt as  Chavez drove west on MacArthur. Chavez, who was alone in the blue-and-white  Chevrolet pickup, hit the turning car along with another westbound vehicle,  police said.  </P> <P> Witnesses said the car that tried to turn onto Raitt from MacArthur was driving  slowly.  </P> <P> Santa Ana Police Lt. Earl Porter said the driver of that car, an 83-year-old  woman whom he did not identify, and the driver of the other car were not  injured. Porter added that no charges were filed immediately.  </P> <P> The traffic light at the intersection of MacArthur and Raitt does not have a  left-turn signal.  </P> <P> "I guess it takes something like this to get" a turn signal, said nearby  resident Gloria Vasquez as she watched the rescue efforts. "All I saw was that  thing," she said, pointing to the wreckage. "It's awful."  </P></p>

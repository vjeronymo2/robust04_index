			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nickel muted as strike looms A pay and conditions offer by Falconbridge of Canada, the second biggest western nickel producer, has been rejected as 'unrealistic' by the mine, mill and smelter workers' union at its operation in Sudbury, Ontario but talks were continuing yesterday in the hope that a walkout by 1,300 miners at 8am today could be averted. Neither side would reveal the terms of the offer, but Mr Gary Hrytsak, vice-president of Local 598, said: 'It looks as though we'll be walking out barring an 11th hour company proposal.' He said the union had asked Falconbridge to negotiate realistically on money, job security, contracting-out, fringe benefits and overtime, but 'the company continues to drag its feet.' Mr Gerald Foley, Falconbridge's chief negotiator said, however: 'We believe we have a realistic offer on the table and that in the remaining hours we both can reach agreement.' Last year Falconbridge produced 38,500 tonnes of nickel and 48,000 tonnes of copper at its Sudbury mines, plus cobalt and platinum group metals. With its neighbour Inco, it has recently found major new sources of high grade ore at greater depths. Inco settled with its mine unions last May. The hourly rate remained unchanged in the three-year contract but the benefits package amounted to about 4 per cent over the contract life. Reaction at the London Metal Exchange was muted, nickel's three months delivery price closing only Dollars 132.50 higher at Dollars 6,125 a tonne.</p>

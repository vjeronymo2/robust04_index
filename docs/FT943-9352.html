			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Markets Report: Political woes hit lira The ongoing woes of the Berlusconi government yesterday prompted further weakness in the Italian lira, writes Philip Gawith. The dispute about a series of government advertisements on television reminded markets of the political risks in Italy, and drove the currency lower to a London close of L1,008 against the D-Mark from L1,001. The lira's weakness came against a general background of D-Mark strength. Most currencies, however, traded in fairly narrow ranges and volumes were low as the market lethargy of the past few days persisted. The dollar was slightly weaker in London ahead of the US Treasury's 10 - year note auction following the disappointing three-year auction on Tuesday. The currency ended at DM1.5745 from DM1.582 and Y101.155 from Y101.2. But it closed higher in New York at DM1.5843 and Y101.425 following a moderately successful note auction. The pound lost nearly a pfennig against the stronger D - Mark to end at DM2.4253 from DM2.4349. It was slightly firmer against the dollar at Dollars 1.5404 compared to Dollars 1.5392. The trade - weighted sterling index closed at 79.3 from 79.4. The background to the relative strength of the D - Mark is a spate of firmer growth figures recently which have led some observers to conclude that the German interest rate cycle is nearer to the bottom than originally thought. Mr Tim Stewart, currency strategist at Morgan Stanley in London, said some of the weakness in the peseta, lira and Swedish krona could be attributed to market concerns 'whether the rest of Europe is going to be able to keep pace on the upside as they did on the downside'. Economists at SG Warburg note in their latest currency brief that political resistance, or the need to maintain lower borrowing costs in the face of escalating government debt, could inhibit interest rate increases in countries, such as Spain and France. 'For many countries, Bundesbank tightening will come too early in the business cycle and in a situation where real rates are already very high. It will therefore be tempting to tolerate a weaker currency against the D - Mark . . .' Economists disagree whether a turning point has yet been reached with German interest rates. SG Warburg argues that 'the Bundesbank clearly lacks economic justification for a further monetary relaxation now', but economists at Nikko Europe in London think there will be a final discount rate cut in September to 4 per cent. There was no fresh evidence to account for the lira's renewed weakness. Mr Stewart attributed it to a dawning realisation of the 'fractured' nature of Italian politics. 'The market has now woken up and a lot of longer term holders of Italian assets, who bought the political revolution story, are now having their faith tested. The risk still is that they are not going to get the job done,' he said. Mr Stewart contrasted the situation of countries such as Italy and Sweden, where the currencies were weak and governments faced considerable problems, with New Zealand, where the Kiwi dollar has been under pressure on fears that the government might lose its parliamentary majority if it fails to win Saturday's Selwyn by-election. Whether the government loses or not, Mr Stewart noted: 'There really isn't a big job on the table to be done. They have done the hard work. Now it is just a question of managing at the margins.' Yesterday the 'Kiwi' currency slipped further to close in London at Dollars 0.5978 from Dollars 0.6007 on reports of an opinion poll which showed the ruling National party to be trailing the opposition Alliance. The dollar had little news to trade on, save for the appearance before Congress of Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, to discuss monetary aggregates. The dollar gained more than  1/2 pfennig on his comment that it was crucially important for the currency to be strong and viable. The market's main focus remains on whether or not the Federal Open Markets Committee will raise interest rates when it meets next week. The tenor of recent comments from Fed officials have hinted as much, but a lot will depend on the retail sales and inflation data due today and tomorrow. Activity in the interest rate futures markets was again very subdued. The December short sterling contract traded 15,455 lots to end at 93.43 from 93.44. The December Euromark contract saw 18,181 lots dealt to close at 94.96 from 94.95. In the cash markets, UK rates were unchanged, with three-month sterling LIBOR closing at 5 9/16 per cent. In its daily operations, the Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 200m assistance at established rates after forecasting a Pounds 300m shortage. Overnight money traded between 3 and 5 1/8 per cent. In Germany, call money rates eased to 5/5.1 per cent from Tuesday after the Bundesbank allocated DM2.3bn in its weekly repo tender. The market had been hoping for a more generous allocation and rates firmed from 4.94/5.05 per cent before the tender.</p>

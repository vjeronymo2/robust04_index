			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Amman Jordan Television Network in  Arabic at 1830 GMT on 17 March 1994 carries an 18-minute  "special program" entitled "Drugs".    As the program begins, the announcer says a problem,  regarded  as one of the most complicated problems in the 20th century, is  sweeping the world, particularly youths: drug addiction. The  announcer adds: "An analytical reading of statistics on drug  cases in Jordan reveals that the drug problem will grow  continuously." She notes that what makes the drug phenomenon a  growing challenge in Jordan is the fact that Jordan lies between  areas that produce drugs and those that consume them. Jordanian  territory is used illegally by drug smugglers as a passage for  drugs, she adds.    The program presents interviews with several unidentified  individuals, including an unnamed official who says: "No doubt,  we have a drug problem. As long as we confiscate various forms  and kinds of drugs, arrest people involved in drug cases, and  refer drug cases to the courts, we have a problem. With much  regret, this problem grows from one year to another. This is  proven by the fact that in 1992 we confiscated 3,000 kg of  hashish, whereas in 1993 we confiscated 4,000 kg of hashish. In  1992, we referred to the court 163 drug cases in which 396  people were involved, whereas in 1993 we referred to the court  212 cases in which 513 people were involved."    Later, the announcer adds: "With regard to the geographic  distribution of drug cases in 1993, it was as follows: Amman,  59 cases; al-Zarqa', 35 cases; al-'Aqabah, 35 cases; the desert  area, 16 cases; Irbid, 17 cases; al-Mafraq, 16 cases; Ma'an, 11  cases; al- Salt, one case; al-Ramtha, five cases; Ma'daba, one  case; al-Azraq, five cases; the central Jordan Valley, one case;  the al-'Umari border post, one case; the Suwaqah rehabilitation  center [prison], four cases; the al-Juwaydah rehabilitation  center [prison], two cases; the al-Karamah border post, two  cases; al-Ruwayshid, one case; al-Karak one case; and  Kurayyimah, one case."    The announcer notes that "international reports indicate  that  there are 7,000 addiction cases in Jordan, most of them are  addiction to medicines disbursed by medical prescription and  which are available in pharmacies. A few of these are drug  addiction cases."    After explaining that the campaign against drugs cannot be  carried out only by the drug fighting department because the  drug problem has many other aspects, such as health, medical  treatment, educational, information, and rehabilitation, the  unnamed official adds that Jordan's Crown Prince Hasan has asked  all concerned ministers and officials to coordinate and  cooperate among themselves to work out the necessary plans, in a  step similar to the formation of a higher national committee to  fight drugs.    The program then discusses the impact of drug addiction on  people's bodies, emotions, psychology, and productivity, as well  as on the community's productivity and development programs and  on the family's economic and social situation.    The announcer also interviews an unidentified clergyman who  stresses that drugs adversely affect the human mind and  perceptions, and that Islam prohibits drugs. The announcer  points out that in the second half of 1984, the drug fighting  department, assisted by other competent organizations,  confiscated more than five million narcotic pills smuggled from  Jordan's northern borders en route to neighboring Arab  countries. Moreover, more than 10 kg of heroin were confiscated  while being smuggled across Jordan en route to Arab and European  countries and the United States. This department, the announcer  adds, bans the illegal planting of drugs in Jordan and prevents  the importation of poppy, opium, and cannabis seeds, unless they  are toasted.    Interviewed by the announcer, Jordanian Health Minister Dr.  'Abd al-Rahim Malhas says his ministry plans to build a special  center in Jordan designed to treat drug addiction cases.</p>

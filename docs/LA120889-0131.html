			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH: RENEWED INTEREST IN RENTING 'BACK TO THE FUTURE' VIDEO  </P> <P> The smashing box-office success of "Back to the Future II" has rejuvenated the  market for the original film, "Back to the Future," which has been out on home  video since May, 1986.  </P> <P> "The original has been renting like a new release," said Allan Caplan, head of  the Midwest Applause Video chain. "If it weren't for the sequel, the original  would be renting very infrequently, just like any movie that's a couple of  years old."  </P> <P> Meir Hed, co-owner of the local Videotheque chain, said that "Back to the  Future" has been a hot rental since the release of the sequel two weeks ago.  "Rentals are up 2,000%," he said. "The word is out that seeing the first one  helps you to understand the sequel. Now people who've seen 'II' are coming in  to rent the first one. Also, some people are now renting the first one before  they see the sequel."  </P> <P> Louis Feola, MCA's senior vice president of marketing, said it's too early for  figures on how many copies have been sold. but did say: "The great box office  of 'Back to the Future II' has obviously stimulated all this activity for the  original. Without the sequel, we wouldn't be able to do all this business with  the original."  </P> <P> Feola said that MCA began alerting distributors and retailers in May to stock  up on "Back to the Future." A TV ad campaign for the movie in the Top 50  markets includes pitches for the video.  </P> <P> Since "Back to the Future" came out in 1986, industry sources say MCA has  shipped more than 800,000 copies to retailers and distributors. Originally  released to the rental market at $79.95, the price dropped to $29.95 last year  and then to $19.95 in September.  </P> <P> Feola wouldn't say when "Back to the Future II" would be out on home video but  Applause Video's Caplan speculated that it would be released at a low price --  in the $22-$25 range for the sales market -- next May, when "Back to the Future  III" is scheduled to hit theaters.

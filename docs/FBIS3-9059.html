The Alliance was  set up by 46 Bulgarian politicians, scientists, intellectuals  and public figures last May as a non-profit public organization.  In February it re-registered in court as a movement under the  Political Parties Act. The Alliance claims that it has over  25,000 members.    According to Tomov, the decision to split off from the  parliamentary group of the Socialist Party (the former  Communists) was taken last December but it is only now that the  obstacles to a final break have been removed.    The main reason for the delay, Tomov said, was the passage  of  the 1994 Budget Act on February 28. In the coming days Tomov  will officially inform the parliament chairman and the  parliamentary group of the BSP-led coalition of GOR's step.    So far five GOR members have declared in writing they are  leaving the parliamentary group of the BSP, STANDART NEWS said  today. It takes ten MP's to set up a new group. If fewer MP's  support GOR, they will go independent, according to Petya  Shopova MP, quoted in the same daily.    Tomov today held a lengthy conversation with Ahmed Dogan,  leader of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms, on  whose mandate the present cabinet headed by Lyuben Berov was  formed. Tomov and Dogan reached the conclusion that no cabinet  crisis is in the offing and it would be unethical to call for a  cabinet reshuffle or for consultations for a new cabinet.</p>

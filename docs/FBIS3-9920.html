In an official communique the Foreign Ministry states that  the attack was "all the more repugnant because it was  perpetrated against innocent victims at a place intended for  prayer."    The communique also "calls upon all the parties to this  conflict to act with prudence and conciliation to avoid further  bloodshed," and calls for compliance with the agreements entered  into by Israel and the Palestinian leaders as "as the only way  to achieve a lasting, genuine peace" in the Middle East.    The communique concludes by conveying the Argentine  Government's "heartfelt condolences to relatives of the victims  of this tragic event."</p>

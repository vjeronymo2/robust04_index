Gavrilova, Evolutionary </F> Physiology and Biochemistry Institute at Russia's Academy of  Sciences and Biological Scientific Research Institute of the St.  Petersburg University; UDC 574.64]    [Abstract] The ability of heavy metal ions--the most common  contaminants in the hydrosphere which cause numerous reactions  in natural ecosystems at the cell and population level, e.g.,  the development of morphological anomalies in cyanobacteria and  algae--to serve as environmental condition indicators and thus  help resolve the issue of the mechanisms of heavy metal ions'  impact on cyanobacteria and the character of their primary  contact with cells prompted a study of the cyanobacteria  sensitivity to the toxic effect of zinc sulfide. To this end,  the Anabaena variabilis Kuetz strain CALU 787 from  the collection of the St. Petersburg Biological Institute was  examined due to this genus proliferation in stagnant water. The  culture was grown in liquid medium No. 1 in 50 ml bulbs at a  25C temperature with round-the-clock light at a 2,000 lx  medium level. The experiment procedure is outlined. The data  reveal three types of zinc ion impact on the culture growth:  stimulated growth for 5 days (at 0.001 ml/g or 0.1 MPC), a  prolonged lag phase after which the growth rate is the same as  in the control group (at 0.01 ml/g or 1.0 MPC), and a drop in  the cell density, especially in the steady-state growth phase  (at 0.02-0.2 ml/g or 2-20 MPC). Both the growth inhibition and  stimulation were equally treated as undesirable phenomena since  any deviation from natural productivity is quite dangerous for  aquatic ecosystems. The A. variabilis cell population  behavior under various concentrations of zinc ions is plotted.  The results confirm the A. variabilis high  sensitivity to Zn ions. At zinc ion concentrations above 5.0  MPC, intensive trichome fragmentation, morphological anomalies,  and irreversible ultrastructural defects of the photosynthesis  apparatus were observed. A 20 MPC concentration is lethal for  A. variabilis. It is speculated that the  morphological anomalies under some experimental conditions are  not caused by the specific effect of zinc ions, and may be used  as bioindicators of the habitat.

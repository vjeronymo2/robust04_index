			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR WHEELS: SEVERAL ROADS LEAD TO SAFE AUTO STORAGE  </P> <P> Question: We plan to leave for a vacation for several months and will leave our  new Chrysler in the garage. What should we do to store the car properly? We  have heard all kinds of conflicting advice on this. -- D.L.H.  </P> <P> Answer: The reason for the conflicting advice is that experts can't quite agree  on how much preparation is necessary for storing a car. If you plan to leave  the car for less than a month, you don't need to do very much, but after a  month, the car may need some more elaborate protection. Few owners' manuals  take up the subject, though it is certainly an important issue.  </P> <P> The most critical problem that you face involves the gasoline, because after a  certain point the gasoline will begin to form gum or varnish that will do  serious damage to your fuel system. The gas tank, gas line and carburetor or  fuel injection system can be plugged up by these gum or varnish deposits.  </P> <P> Experts give widely different advice on how long one can safely keep the same  gasoline in a tank while the car is in storage. It ranges from as little as two  months to a full year.  </P> <P> Most major brands of gasoline contain additives to help stabilize the fuel and  prevent the formation of gum or varnish. But some of the cheaper gasolines on  the market do not contain these additives and will go bad in as few as two  months.  </P> <P> Manufacturers of the higher-quality gasolines that contain a good additive  package make the claim that their fuels can be stored up to a year without  problems.  </P> <P> The varnish or gum forms through oxidation, in which the gasoline chemically  reacts with oxygen. That is why it is important to keep your tank as full as  possible if you are going to be storing the car with gasoline in it.  </P> <P> The Auto Club of Southern California, however, advises motorists that if they  plan to store a car for more than 30 days they should drain their fuel systems  dry. The only safe and practical way to do that for an average motorist is to  allow the car to run out of gas in the driveway. But be careful not to let it  idle for too long, because that's not good for the engine either.  </P> <P> Among the other advice provided by the club for storing a car for more than one  month is to change the oil, wax the car, pour SAE 10W motor oil into the  carburetor, drain the coolant, remove the battery, inflate the tires to maximum  pressure, set the car on blocks and remove the windshield wipers.  </P> <P> You'll need a vacation after all that. I would guess that involves about six to  eight hours of work. And when you get back, you are supposed to change the oil  again and refill the coolant. If you want some extra work, the club suggests  you can remove the spark plugs and squirt oil into the cylinders before  attempting to start the car.  </P></p>

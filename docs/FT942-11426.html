			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures fell back sharply on renewed worries over UK and US interest rates, together with political uncertainity ahead of today's local elections, writes Joel Kibazo. The June contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 3,089. But for an early and brief bout of buying that took June to 3,091 in the first half an hour, active selling dominated the session. Dealers remained particularly concerned about the outcome of today's local elections, one saying: 'I think we shall see few buyers until we know the outcome.' June traded at a discount to cash for most of the day, and broke through the 3,050 support level to hit the day's low of 3,047 just minutes before the close. But it picked up to finish at 3,057, down 34 from its previous close and at a 12-point discount to cash. Volume was 14,370 lots. A further decline in after-hours' trading indicated a poor opening today. The June Mid 250 traded 198 contracts and closed at 3,074. Volume in the traded options improved substantially from Tuesday's poor levels to reach 36,825 contracts. That total included 13,836 lots dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 6,951 in the Euro FT-SE option. Bid candidate Lasmo was the most active trader among the stock options with a day's total volume of 4,476 contracts.</p>

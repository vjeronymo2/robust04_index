			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Markets: Banks can damage your fiscal health - Serious Money or, more precisely, the desire to bank-hop - afflicts most people from time to time. Usually, it takes the form of a despondent friend or acquaintance enquiring if you are happy with your bank since they want to leave theirs. Many think the interest rates on their overdrafts are higher than at other banks, or that the level of service is below standard, but a few depositors also are worried about the strength of their bank's balance sheet and what it could mean for them. Collectively, the Big Four banks - Midland, National Westminster, Barclays and Lloyds - had loan losses of Pounds 5.6bn last year, and none has been out of the headlines recently. The news this week that Heron International, the property and finance group headed by Gerald Ronson, wants to reschedule Pounds 1.3bn of debt caused the shares of its most exposed UK lender, Barclays, to fall. Barclays also has the biggest lending exposure of the large banks to Tiny Rowland's troubled Lonrho group and is also exposed to Olympia &amp; York, the world's largest property group, which is developing the Canary Wharf project in London's Docklands but has debts of Dollars 20bn. National Westminster's chief executive, Tom Frost, also resigned this week after the Department of Trade and Industry re-opened the affair of the botched Blue Arrow rights issue. NatWest has been going through dismal times, with pre-tax profits in 1991 down by 78 per cent to Pounds 110m due to some of the biggest losses ever incurred by a UK bank on domestic lending. Lloyds, at least, has been doing relatively well compared with its peers, and actually increased its 1991 pre-tax profit over the previous year - despite a record loss on UK loans of Pounds 885m. But its position was strong enough for it to propose merger talks with the ailing Midland Bank. Indeed, the Midland has been struggling harder and longer than the others following its disastrous acquisition of the US bank, Crocker, early in the 1980s. It was exposed badly to Third World debt and in 1990 became the first UK bank since the 1930s to cut its dividend. But a fairy godmother came to the rescue when the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation made a takeover proposition almost a fortnight ago. The details have yet to be published but it seems likely that a deal will be worked out. Depositors at the Midland may feel alarmed that their bank is likely to be taken over by an institution from so far away, even though the Hongkong and Shanghai is domiciled in the UK. But the Bank of England is expected to give regulatory approval to the deal only if it is satisfied that UK depositors will be protected. How should customers regard such developments? There was a time when banks seemed to be as safe as houses; but just as that cliche has lost its meaning, so customers should be aware that these august institutions are subject to pressures which could be passed on to depositors. Some Midland customers may be sceptical of the Bank of England's capacity to shield them from potential disasters, mindful of the losses caused to depositors when the Bank of Credit and Commerce International went under last year. But it is almost inconceivable that a government of any party could allow a Big Four bank to go the same way. The same is not true of smaller institutions - indeed, there have been several failures of small regional UK banks in the past few years. But the real danger for clearing bank customers lies more with the increased costs of borrowing and less-generous rates of interest than the danger of collapse. Already, the recession has caused large institutions such as the Halifax building society to introduce charges for across-the-counter withdrawals by customers with low balances in savings accounts. Home-buyers also are finding that they are getting credit on terms far less generous - some would say, less foolhardy - than a few years ago. And it was the complaints by owners of small businesses over their borrowing rates that started a furore over banks' lending practices a few months ago. So, most people will find that when the banks come under pressure, so do they. Under such circumstances, it is as well to realise when you are getting a particularly bad deal. For example, many home-owners who went to the centralised mortgage lenders (which were exposed particularly badly to the housing slump, since they do not take savings) are now finding they are paying rates well above the present standard of 10.95 per cent. And if you have a lot of money in one institution, you might consider taking the advice given by Kevin Goldstein-Jackson in his Diary of a Private Investor last week. He spreads money between a number of building societies so as to make the best use of the Investor Protection Scheme, which covers the first 90 per cent of the amount deposited up to a maximum of Pounds 20,000. The Deposit Protection Scheme for bank deposits is lower, covering only 75 per cent up to a maximum of Pounds 15,000. Hopping from bank to bank is probably not necessary. But some nimble footwork to keep a presence in several banks at once might repay the effort.</p>

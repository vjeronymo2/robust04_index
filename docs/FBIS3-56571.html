Although the death has not been confirmed it is believed the  body of Zviad Gamsakhurdia is buried in western Georgia.  Zviadists demand a funeral ceremony: a minute of silence with  the suspension of work of enterprises, organizations and  traffic, as well as rallies that are banned by the state of  emergency regime introduced in Georgia on September 20, 1993.    No excesses or clashes between the Tbilisi police and  supporters of the ex-president were reported today.</p>

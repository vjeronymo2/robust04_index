			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Sarajevo, April 14 (AFP) -- Sarajevo airport was  closed late Thursday [14 April] after unidentified firing  targetted UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] helicopters, an  UNPROFOR spokesman said.    Captain Eric Chaperon said two helicopters -- a Sea King and  a Puma -- were targetted in the attack, but did not say if they  were hit or where the firing had come from.    Only UNPROFOR planes had been continuing to use the airport,  he said, since the UN High Commissioner for Refugees suspended  aid flights to Sarajevo in the wake of the Gorazde attacks.

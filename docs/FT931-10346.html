			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Roadbuilders warned on contracts CONSTRUCTION companies working for the government may have to take a greater share of the economic risks in roadbuilding contracts, Mr Patrick Brown, permanent secretary at the Department of Transport, warned yesterday. He told members of the Commons public accounts committee that the cost of roadbuilding contracts had overshot their tender estimates by 28 per cent last year - equivalent to Pounds 85m. Most of this cost - which was borne by the department - had been due to unforeseen ground conditions or mistakes in design and construction, he said. Nevertheless, with the department facing criticism that it was failing to monitor these construction projects sufficiently, Mr Brown said pilot schemes were being run in which construction companies will bear the cost of any overrun themselves. 'We are not talking about simple cost overrun,' Mr Brown added, insisting that since roadbuilding was a 'dynamic piece of construction' it was impossible to assess the scale of these engineering risks at the time of the tender. Most of these overruns had occurred on the largest projects, he said. Additional sources of finance to fund Britain's roadbuilding programme may be needed by the end of the century if congestion on motorways and trunk roads is to be avoided, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, told MPs yesterday. 'We have to see whether private finance can augment public finance,' he said, responding to opposition calls to clarify whether the government was considering introducing road tolls as an environmental measure or to raise Treasury revenues.</p>

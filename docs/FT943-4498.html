			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Nordic decline hits Intrum Continuing problems in Sweden and Finland led to a 6.6 per cent fall in profits at Intrum Justitia, Europe's largest debt collection group, in the six months to June 30. Pre-tax profits slipped to Pounds 7.01m (Pounds 7.47m) while operating profits fell more sharply to Pounds 6.78m, including Pounds 300,000 from acquisitions, against Pounds 7.83m. Turnover edged ahead from Pounds 41.7m to Pounds 42.3m, including Pounds 1.39m from acquisitions. Mr Bo Goranson, the chairman and holder of 30.9 per cent of the shares, admitted that the depth and length of the decline in the Nordic markets had been unforeseen. He cautioned that the cost saving programme would not benefit the group immediately, but in years to come. 'We have not reached the bottom yet.' Operating profits from the region fell from Pounds 6.2m to Pounds 3.9m. By contrast, German-speaking countries (particularly Switzerland) saw growth to Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 100,000), while the UK, France and the Netherlands chipped in Pounds 3m (Pounds 2.6m). In the UK, the group launched the Pounds 500,000 business-to-business collection operation and already has some 1,600 clients, 4 1/2 times more than the group had expected at this stage. Over the past three years the group has spent Pounds 3m sponsoring a boat in the Whitbread Round The World Race, from which it accrued mentions in 10,000 articles, in 80 hours of radio and 90 of TV. It reckons equivalent advertising would have cost Pounds 28m. It hopes to capitalise, especially in the UK and southern Europe, on expected EU legislation on late payment, which it expects will be compulsory in about two years' time. Earnings declined to 4.5p (5.2p) per share, but the gross dividend is held at 1.1p.</p>

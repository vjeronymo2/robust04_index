			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Kohl plea for investment in east: W German industry wants special regime for eastern goods WEST GERMAN industry yesterday called for special treatment for east German goods in response to a call by Chancellor Helmut Kohl for investment to be stepped up in the east of the country as a means of countering the collapse of the economy there. Mr Kohl made his appeal at a meeting in the Chancellery with industry and unions. He and government officials are increasingly concerned about rising unemployment in the five eastern Lander. The rate is 15 per cent of the 8m-strong labour force, but when job creation schemes, short-term work, and retraining programmes are taken into account, the figure exceeds 35 per cent. The restructuring process 'could not be left solely to the free play of market forces', Mr Kohl said, calling on western industry to invest more in the east to stem the fall in manufacturing and induce growth. He singled out how investments in construction, services and crafts in small workshops were already contributing to the slight growth in gross domestic product. These three sectors are largely fuelling GDP which is forecast to grow by about 6 per cent this year - albeit from a very low base following a 30 per cent decline in 1991. They are mainly focused on the local market in eastern Germany, rather than exports. At yesterday's meeting the Federation of German Industry (BDI) said higher investment should be coupled with a system granting preferential treatment, including tax benefits, for east German products in order to make them 'good value'. West German industry has so far placed DM14bn (Pounds 5.6bn) worth of orders in the east over the past two years. Last week the BDI said it would increase its purchases from the eastern states to DM25bn a year by 1995. The need to create local pockets of industry in eastern Germany stems not only from high unemployment. It reflects a tacit admission by west German industry, unions and government officials that the entire structure of wage agreements there has priced the region out of the market. Wages in most sectors are now 80 per cent of west German levels, but productivity, particularly in steel, engineering and mining, are about 70 per cent below levels in the west.</p>

			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Now Sweden faces being model of unemployment: The shock of the virtually unknown AN EMPLOYMENT agency in Stockholm reported four vacancies in the construction sector last week: it wanted a plumber, a construction worker, a driver for an earth-digger and an asbestos-remover. With 4,000 unemployed construction workers on its books, there was no shortage of applicants. In a country which has traditionally placed great emphasis on full employment and the right to work, the fact that unemployment has reached its highest level since records began in the 1970s has come as a shock to many Swedes. The Labour Market Board, which administers the employment system, is close to breaking point in providing retraining programmes for the jobless and the centre-right coalition government has come under considerable pressure from the unions to reduce the number of people out of work. Official unemployment reached 4.2 per cent in March according to the Central Statistics Bureau, while in addition at least 3 per cent of the workforce - the 'hidden' unemployed - are registered in retraining schemes and temporary jobs. Economists forecast that open (or official) unemployment is likely to reach between 5 and 7 per cent in 1993, putting further strains on the retraining schemes. 'If unemployment threatens to approach 5 per cent and pressure on the government increases as a result, unemployment could be seen as a risk for the government's stability,' says a recent report from Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, the leading commercial bank in Sweden. Faced with a recession both at home and in Sweden's main export markets of Europe and the US, much of Swedish industry has been forced to reduce production and cut costs. SAS, the Scandinavian airline, Saab Automobile (the car company jointly owned by General Motors of the US and Saab-Scania), and Volvo are among the biggest names in Sweden to have cut hundreds of jobs. A report from the National Institute of Economic Research last week warned that nearly half the 1,862 companies it surveys have cut jobs in the first quarter of 1992, and about 40 per cent of the companies expect to make further cuts in the second and third quarters. The construction sector has emerged as one of the most severely hit as the property bubble of the 1980s has burst. Real estate prices collapsed in 1990-91 and office construction has slowed. Unemployment in the construction sector is 17 per cent, and a high proportion of the unemployed in this sector are men in the 16-24 year age group. However, in the next three years there is likely to be a shift towards increasing unemployment among public sector workers, especially women who tend to work in the social welfare services such as nurseries and care of the elderly. Already, up to 25,000 of the 1.2m Swedes working in the public sector are expected to lose their jobs in the next three years because of cuts planned in the January 1991 budget, including railway and telephone company employees. The Social Democrats' determination to maintain full employment during their administration resulted in severe wage-push inflation in the late 1980s. Unemployment in the Stockholm region was 0.7 per cent in 1988-89, according to Mr Per-Olof Edin, chief economist at LO, the Swedish blue-collar trade union confederation. 'We cannot handle such an overheated situation,' says Mr Edin. 'However, I think we can handle unemployment of 2-2.5 per cent, and if we could get down to 3 per cent (unemployment), which is realistic in one or two years, it doesn't create a risk for wage levels.' The danger, he admits, is that if Sweden returns to full employment, fears that this would push up inflation would probably spark an outflow of capital from the country. At the moment, though, as unemployment rises, the Labour Market Board is finding it increasingly difficult to provide retraining for the jobless. Mr Robin Lapidus, spokesman for the board, says: 'We cannot handle retraining for more than an average of 3 per cent (of the workforce). At the moment we have about 165,000 out of a workforce of 4.5m - or over 3 per cent  -on training programmes,' he says, though he adds that there are seasonal fluctuations. 'Above 3 per cent we cannot guarantee the quality and administration of training courses unless we get more money or more personnel.' LO has asked the centre-right government (which came to power last autumn) to cut unemployment by bringing forward plans for new construction projects and by encouraging high-school students to opt for three-year (rather than two-year) final courses. At least, it is argued, this could provide a temporary solution until the Swedish economy starts to pick up and companies begin to boost their workforces again.'</p>

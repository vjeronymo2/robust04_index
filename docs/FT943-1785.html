			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Laporte up 14% to Pounds 58.6m - Strong sales growth contributes to sharp rise in working capital Laporte, the speciality chemicals group that acquired Evode for Pounds 129m last January, increased pre-tax profits by 14 per cent from Pounds 51.3m to Pounds 58.6m in the six months to July 3. Mr Ken Minton, chief executive, said that the group had experienced 'modest' improvements in trading conditions in many of its major markets, with the trend accelerating in the second quarter. But the strong sales growth at the end of the period contributed to a sharp rise in working capital, about which Mr Minton said he was 'bloody angry'. He added that some of the build up of debtors would reverse in the second half. Turnover rose 11.5 per cent to Pounds 490.8m. Laporte said that allowing for disposals, sales increased by 16.8 per cent; however, this has not been adjusted for acquisitions. Earnings per share rose 9.5 per cent to 22p and the interim dividend is up 7 per cent to 7.9p (7.4p). Stripping out disposals, operating margins slipped to 12.75 per cent (13 per cent), but before depreciation - which rose Pounds 1.9m - and rationalisation costs of Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 800,000) margins were ahead. Mr Minton said he hoped to widen margins further helped by the reorganisation of the group into 16 strategic business units. Started last year the process is already yielding 'substantial' savings and is on track to cut costs by 2 per cent after two years. Laporte is also managing to push through some price rises helped by the improving health of some of its customers, notably polymer manufacturers. All five divisions reported higher profits with organics, construction chemicals and engineering polymers/electronic chemicals showing strong growth. After a Pounds 30.7m jump in working capital, there was a cash outflow from operations of Pounds 14.4m and net borrowings rose Pounds 4.7m to Pounds 139.9m during the period. However, the company stressed that this was partly seasonal that net debt continued on a declining trend. Gearing was 41 per cent, but interest cover 14.6 times. COMMENT The lingering worry with Laporte is that it tries too hard to impress. The 16.8 per cent figure for sales growth allowing for disposals was admirable, but meaningless. Adjusting for the acquisition of Aztec and the extra month from Evode, the underlying increase was nearer 10 per cent. That is respectable enough though it is easy to see why Laporte might be tempted into a bit of window dressing. Now that the main gains from Evode are in the bank, it needs to show healthy organic growth to justify its premium share rating. But on current forecasts its growth is lagging the rest of the market. The solution might be another deal and after the success of Evode the City would be likely to back a cash call. Another rights issue might also push it back into the FT-SE 100.</p>

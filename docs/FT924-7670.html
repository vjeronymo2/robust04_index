			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Fashion: As the Suits crumple the creative Jackets take over at the top - A look at a welcome change in fashion for the business elite WHEN Private Eye, the satirical magazine, launched a cartoon called The Suits, you knew that the tide had really begun to turn. Now, it is The Jackets who are making the most creative business decisions. In the late 1980s, the classic suit became the symbol for every kind of professional achievement. Both style and status were captured in the designer interpretations of the traditional City two-piece. But now that finance no longer has its gung-ho image, the suit is a symbol of the drab money men who come and pore over the books - men for whom the word cut has more to do with costs than clothing. To describe someone as 'a suit' is an insult. And so, creative professionals have been turning away from the suit, towards combinations of jackets and trousers for business wear. From Jasper Conran's jackets in vivid orange and acid green, to Marks &amp; Spencer's range of soft, woollen mouflon jackets in rich colours from blue to raspberry, menswear right across the design spectrum is turning its attention back towards jackets - and for business rather than pleasure. The suit is no longer the be-all and end-all of the professional wardrobe. In September, Dunhill presented to the press their new menswear range. Alan Duddle has been brought in as director of merchandise to bring the label into line with the 1990s. And as part of his strategy, he explained, the company's range of suits was being ignored for the time being. Instead, the energy was going into developing the separates, the jackets and trousers which have traditionally been reserved for weekend wear. He explained that 'The suit is a required portion, but no longer a pivotal portion, of a man's wardrobe.' Just two autumns ago, Anthony Bottomley, managing director of Hermes GB, presented a menswear collection which contained no suits at all. 'It reflects,' he said 'the increased Europeanisation of our dress sense.' And at the same time, Burberry's similarly acknowledged that 'the blazer and slacks have been accepted in the office on the continent for more than ten years, and it could catch on in the UK. We are certainly selling more blazers than before.' If the Italians were the biggest continental influence on the suited look of the 1980s, then the French have more responsibility for the rise of the 1990s separates. For years, Frenchmen have done business in sports jackets and trousers, wearing in the boardroom a look which the English would reserve for the bar room. Not, of course, the heavy tweed jackets of the English country weekend; rather, jackets in cashmere and linen, with subtle patterns and checks, or in plain but rich and sophisticated colours. It is this style of jacket which is being accepted as business dress in advertising, architecture, retailing and design - the creative professions which always spearhead changes in the executive dress code. In response, companies like Dunhill and Hermes are putting their energies into jackets rather than suits. Hugo Boss, the designer label responsible for many of the sharp-shouldered suits of the 1980s have switched their advertising images to portray men in relaxed jackets instead. George Bush was prepared to make policy statements in his Kennebunkport wardrobe of preppy sports jackets, worn over cotton chino trousers. The English sports jacket emerged in the 1920s. As the lounge suit began to replace formal, morning dress as proper professional attire, the tweed jacket worn with flannels became its casual counterpart. It was a sign of status to have a separate jacket for 'sports' with its suggestion of a country estate on which to pursue them. That is why, to the Englishman, the jacket has always been a country item, out of place in business. And its colours and patterns have been predominantly those of the country. But the French, in spite of their fascination with le style Anglais, never relegated the jacket to the countryside. In Paris, the jacket retains the metropolitan chic of the intellectuals and creative types who wear it. Jackets, or blazers, with separate trousers, are acceptable business dress in all but the most formal French professions. And the concept is spreading. Bernard Lanvin, who works most days in a cashmere blazer, explained his look to Americans when he took on Lanvin, the US wing of his family's designer label. 'Whereas I have suits for specific occasions,' he said, 'my blazers are for the office, for travelling and for the country.' (He did not elucidate on the specific occasions which that did not cover.) Hermes designer Veronique Nichanian was more direct. 'You don't need to wear a suit to look smart,' she declared. Combining separates does give men a greater opportunity to combine colours and patterns in an individual way. 'People's personality comes through more,' insists Duddle. 'Business dressing today is much more about enjoyment and about putting different things together in a personal way. The days of every man looking like a clone have gone.' Which does make dressing a little more difficult. Gone may be the simple choice of a plain, dark suit each morning. The US financier Ivan Boesky wore a black, three- piece suit with a white shirt to his office every day. Asked why it never varied, he replied 'I have enough decisions in my life already.) Of course, if you are wearing separates for business, you do have to wear them with the formal accoutrements, the proper shirt, tie and shoes, that would accompany a suit. Mark McCormack, the sports agent, often wears a sports jacket as opposed to a suit, but with a formal shirt and classic tie. He recalls correcting another executive who matched a blazer with grey slacks and an open silk shirt. 'Many of our clients are in their twenties, and many of them, particularly the tennis players, show up for meetings dressed casually. But many of these 20-year-olds are also millionaires, and we handle their money. 'They want our executives to look more like bankers than like tennis players  -even nicely dressed ones.'</p>

			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar/yen decline checked THE Japanese yen fell sharply against the dollar yesterday, reversing its recent upward trend, as dealers waited to see whether the Bank of Japan would cut its official discount rate tomorrow, writes James Blitz. On Monday, the Japanese currency looked as though it would break straight through the Y100 barrier against the dollar, as dealers continued to be swayed by the size of Japan's trade surplus and the belief that the US is pursuing a dollar depreciation policy in an attempt to boost its exports. However, the yen's rise was checked yesterday and, after closing in London at Y101.05 on Monday, the currency depreciated to a low of Y102.30 in European trading yesterday before ending at Y101.45. In New York it closed at Y101.05. There are strong expectations in the market that the Japanese authorities could cut their official discount rate tomorrow by  1/2 percentage point to 2 per cent, in an attempt to boost their economy and stop a currency appreciation that is damaging exports. Japanese government officials also said that they had 'emer-gency measures' in mind to stop the yen's rise, which led some dealers to take profits. However, barring more currency intervention, it was hard to see what the Japanese authorities could do. A cut in the ODR has already been discounted by many dealers. Another fiscal boost would help the economy but would possibly strengthen the currency. Mr John Hall, an economist at Swiss Banking Corporation, believes the yen will break through to the Y90 level by the end of the year in any event. Trading in European currencies was dominated by a bout of D-Mark weakness, with several dealers talking of speculators taking profits in the wake of its recent move upwards. The French franc appreciated sharply against the D-Mark yesterday, moving to a close of FFr3.517 from a previous FFr3.544. In part, it was helped by another reduction in the Bank of France's overnight rate of lending, this time to 8.75 per cent from 9.25 per cent. But comments from Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French finance minister, that France was not seeking to introduce capital controls in the wake of the widening of exchange rate mechanism bands may also have helped. One leading fund manager said the threat of capital controls might still lead international fund managers to put a premium on French assets by selling the franc. Sterling profited from the D-Mark's weakness, rising 2 pfennigs on the day to DM2.5225. Better than expected figures for the public sector deficit in July helped bond markets, pushing the currency upwards. Dealers continued to think that the pound's recent fall may have bottomed out. The dollar was also a beneficiary of D-Mark profit-taking, ending at DM1.6960 from a previous DM1.6865. It finished New York trading at DM1.6927.</p>

Leading cadres, particularly high-ranking  cadres, should strictly implement the systems and rules and  regulations of the CPC Central Committee and the Central  Military Commission concerning the party style and the promotion  of ethical integrity. They should set an example of serving the  people wholeheartedly and abiding by discipline.    Liu Huaqing made these remarks at the all-Army discipline  inspection work conference. After expounding on the  achievements made by the Army in promoting the party style and  ethical integrity in 1993, he pointed out: We should grasp four  links in this year's work. First, we should further enhance our  ideological understanding and fully understand that the task of  combating corruption and promoting ethical integrity has a  bearing on the survival of the party and the country, and that  it is a long-term task for the entire stage of socialism.  Second, it is necessary to made a new breakthrough in  investigating and handling major cases. Third, more efforts  should be devoted to dealing with key issues. Fourth, new steps  should be taken to improve relevant rules and regulations and to  supervise and inspect their implementation.    Liu Huaqing said: The party committees and leading cadres at  all levels of the Army should set the example in promoting the  party style and ethical integrity and should resolutely  implement the decisions of the party Central Committee and the  Central Military Commission. While we must seriously implement  rules and regulations, we absolutely must not disregard orders  and bans. We must truly identify ourselves with the party  Central Committee politically and ideologically. In promoting  the party style and ethical integrity, leading cadres should  display a revolutionary devotion and sense of responsibility and  set an example of performing more actual deeds than talking and  of being as good as their word.    Yu Yongbo, member of the Central Military Commission and  director of the General Political Department, presided over the  meeting today. Present at the meeting were Zhang Zhen, vice  chairman of the Central Military Commission; Chi Haotian, Zhang  Wannian and Fu Quanyou, members of the Central Military  Commission; and leading comrades of the three general  departments of the People's Liberation Army [PLA], all major PLA  units in Beijing, and the Armed Police Force. The all-Army  discipline inspection work conference opened on 25 February.  Zhou Ziyu, deputy director of the General Political Department  and secretary of the Central Military Commission Discipline  Inspection Committee, delivered a report to the conference.    Those in attendance included members of the Central  Commission for Discipline Inspection serving in the PLA, and  members of the Central Military Commission Discipline Inspection  Committee, as well as secretaries of discipline inspection  committees and directors of discipline inspection departments of  major PLA units and the Armed Police Force headquarters.</p>

			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Observer: Loss leader However much Britain's industrialists may talk about exercising leadership, they've scarcely been at the forefront in accepting pay-restraint. But with public-sector staff limited to rises of 1.5 per cent this year, one high executive may be about to set a spectacular example. He is Mike Bett who, although earning around Pounds 250,000 as deputy chairman of British Telecom, is front-runner to take over the government's Acas conciliation service where he'd be paid only Pounds 60,000 or so. The reason is that, after the departure of current Acas chairman Sir Douglas Smith who's on over Pounds 80,000, the post is to be pegged back to a lower civil service rank. Bett, now 57 and one of the UK's most experienced industrial relations experts, has seen his BT role whittled down by the transfer of duties to other senior executives. But if he makes the move, the pay-cut should be somewhat compensated for by the knighthood traditionally conferred on the Acas chief - especially if he gets it ahead of BT chairman Iain Vallance.</p>

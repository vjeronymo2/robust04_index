			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / International Company News: IEL sells undertaker business for ADollars 102m INDUSTRIAL Equity (IEL), the Australian investment group, has sold Pine Grove, Australia's biggest undertaker, for ADollars 102m (USDollars 69.3m). The buyer is Service Corp, the US funeral company. IEL, which is part of the Adsteam group, said the sale would yield a book profit of about ADollars 25m, and the proceeds could be used for payments to shareholders. The purchase is the first outside North America by Service Corp, estimated to be the world's largest funeral company. It will add about ADollars 47m to its revenue. Pine Grove controls between 13 and 16 per cent of the Australian funeral market. Mr R. Waltrip, chairman of Service Corp, said the acquisition represented the beginning of a truly global company. The deal is subject to Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board. IEL is also in the throes of selling its Woolworths supermarket chain, which is the subject of a planned ADollars 2.45bn public flotation. Westpac Banking, the big Australian bank, plans to sack 12 per cent of the staff at its head office for New Zealand operations, Reuter reports from Sydney. Westpac currently employs 700 people at the Wellington office. The decision to make staff redundant follows a review of the bank's operations by an independent consultant. The review 'identified a number of activities and structures that are no longer necessary for the current market environment and have been dispensed with', the bank said.</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (11): Tough talk by creditors - Balance of payments NIGERIA'S international creditors are faced with a dilemma. Nigeria has no chance of sustaining non-inflationary growth unless it is granted debt relief on concessional terms; but the government's recent track record is so poor that granting debt relief may well mean throwing good money after bad. Nigeria's current account slipped into deficit last year, further proof of the macro-economic mismanagement of the past two years. The government's decision to expand domestic demand at too rapid a pace, and the naira's depreciation, mean that import values have raced ahead of exports. Imports grew by 11.6 per cent in 1991 and 7.1 per cent in 1992 while export values fell by 12.8 per cent and 1.3 per cent respectively. The current account deficit has slipped from a surplus of 7.8 per cent of gross domestic product in 1990 to a deficit of 2 per cent last year. The slide into deficit has been accompanied by a growing capital account deficit caused by capital flight, debt service obligations and outflow of some Dollars 3.4bn to buy back London Club debt. The government has been forced to finance the combined and current and capital account deficit of Dollars 6.2bn by accumulating debt service arrears and running down its stock of official foreign exchange reserves. The IMF estimates that debt service arrears increased from Dollars 2.2bn at the end of 1991 to Dollars 3.4bn at the end of 1992. The UK reports Dollars 600m in unpaid export credit guarantees. Meanwhile, foreign exchange reserves have fallen from Dollars 4.1bn in 1991 to around Dollars 1bn by the end of 1992. The IMF's recent Article 4 report expects that Nigeria's balance of payments position will remain weak in the medium term. Even if the government is able to pursue sensible policies, the IMF estimates that Nigeria will face an average Dollars 2bn a year financing gap throughout this decade. The IMF's baseline case assumes that the government is able to institute a programme designed to bring inflation under control. The current account returns to surplus in 1997 but the debt service ratio, as a percentage of exports, never falls below 25 per cent. The result, according to the IMF, is a cumulative residual financing gap, not covered by reserves or private capital flows, of Dollars 16.5bn up to 2000. Higher oil prices would ease the burden - the IMF assumes that a Dollars 1 a barrel rise in oil prices generates an extra Dollars 0.6bn a year in oil revenues - but, within a reasonable range of projections, would not close the financing gap. Conventional debt rescheduling merely postpones the problem. The IMF concludes that 'a durable solution to Nigeria's external debt problem and the achievement of external viability would require debt rescheduling on concessional terms, including a significant reduction in the stock of debt'. Yet Nigeria will not be handed debt relief on a plate, regardless of the IMF's projections. The Paris Club creditors have made it plain that Nigeria must first agree a tough and comprehensive adjustment programme with the IMF, and establish a track record. The British government has said it will support concessional debt relief for Nigeria if an IMF programme is signed but not all the creditors are so amenable. Germany and Japan remain sceptical that a reduction in the debt stock is needed for external viability. Nor are the World bank and the IMF confident that an agreement can be reached soon. The transitional council has said publicly that it would like to agree a shadow programme with the IMF in April, hoping that a two-month track record will be sufficient to produce a fully-fledged agreement and unlock debt relief. But World Bank officials say this timetable is unrealistic. The best the transitional council can hope for is a shadow programme which endorses the government's proposed policy framework but requires a six to nine months track record before an extended structural adjustment facility can be signed. The transitional council is prepared for some hard negotiating. 'The IMF will tell us they want to see lots of good evidence before they can act,' says one senior council member. 'But I say, for God's sake help us to succeed because this is Nigeria's last chance.' Finance minister Chief Dele Olashore takes a tougher stance. 'If the western creditors withhold support and want us to commit suicide then they will lose as well as us. I hope that they are informed enough to prevent that from happening.'</p>

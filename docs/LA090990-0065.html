			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: SECOND CHANCE  </P> <P> It's taken nearly 14 years for William Friedkin's "Sorcerer" (1977) to make it  to video stores -- it's due Oct. 4 -- and it gave the director time to  "rethink" the film in terms of color and sound, thanks to changes in  technology.  </P> <P> What happened when he took it back to the editing room?  </P> <P> "I was surprised by the movie," he tells us. "I thought I had made an adventure  film, and instead I had made a grueling and intense two hours."  </P> <P> In the transfer to video, Friedkin says he was able to adjust and enhance the  film, shot by shot. "The color scheme," he notes, "is psychologically important  to the story." It's based, you'll recall, on "The Wages of Fear," Henri-Georges  Clouzot's mid-'50s suspense drama about four fugitives who try to buy their way  to freedom by transporting a load of fragile explosives over hazardous terrain.  (Friedkin also remixed the movie's electronic score, by Tangerine Dream, from  monaural to stereo.)  </P> <P> "Sorcerer" opened to some favorable reviews but died at the box office when  "Star Wars" opened a week later. Video rights to "Sorcerer" then got tangled up  in litigation between co-producers MCA/Universal and Paramount Pictures. MCA  eventually won.  </P> <P> Friedkin admits that the delay -- and the chance to work again on the picture  -- has been a boon.  </P> <P> "I'm happy about it," says the Oscar-winning director of "The French  Connection" and "The Exorcist." "It's my favorite film of the ones I've  done."SI David J. Fox  </P></p>

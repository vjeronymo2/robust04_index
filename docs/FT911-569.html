			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Tokyo house sales fall SALES of new condominiums in the greater Tokyo area fell 46.3 per cent in April from a year earlier, reviving fears that Japan's property market slump will intensify in coming months, Robert Thomson writes from Tokyo. April is generally a strong month for property sales in Japan, but the sales figures announced yesterday by the Real Estate Economic Institute were the worst April figures for 19 years. The proportion of condominiums sold before being built in Tokyo and three neighbouring prefectures fell to 56.8 per cent, down from 87.7 per cent in the same month last year, while the year-on-year sales figure was lower for the sixth month. Japan's property slump has been uneven, with prices falling 10 per cent for some condominiums on the fringe of Tokyo and larger falls recorded in Osaka. The surprisingly poor figures for April will put further pressure on apartment developers, who have been hit by the increase in interest rates, declining sales and growing inventories.</p>

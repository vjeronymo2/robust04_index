			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Observer: Low life Time was when being a life president meant something. In return for giving up the keys to the chairman's suite, corporate grandees were rewarded with a title, secretaries, free lunches and continued use of chauffeur-driven limos. But outgoing Hammerson chairman Sydney Mason, one of the grand old men of British property, is not even being allowed to keep his office when he inherits his title after Hammerson's annual meeting today. Indeed, he will be lucky if he can even find his name in future annual reports. How he must envy Lord King, British Airways' newly created president. One of the rumoured perks of being an ex-chairman of a big airline is a lifetime's free flying on any of the world's main airlines.</p>

			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Swiss Franc It is by now almost axiomatic to blame at least part of the recent turmoil in currency markets on doubts over the ability of European currencies to keep up with the D-Mark. One currency which has done even better in recent months, however, is the Swiss franc. Its rise against the D-Mark of roughly 5 per cent since May is all the more remarkable in that Switzerland has also managed to undercut German interest rates. These are normally considered a floor for other European countries whether members of the ERM or not. But three-month Eurofranc rates are a full 2 percentage points below their D-Mark equivalent. Doubtless it helps that, in contrast to Germany, Swiss money supply growth is now within reasonable bounds while inflation rates in the two countries are roughly level-pegging. But it would be rash to ascribe the franc's strength purely to the skills of the Swiss National Bank. Though hard to quantify, the Swiss currency once again seems to be playing something of a refuge role. It would be unlikely if Italy's economic crisis, which was moving to a head last night, had not provoked some revival of the traditional outflow of capital to its northern neighbour. At a more general level, the franc's performance can be seen as the mirror image of other European currencies in the Maastricht debate over currency union. The franc would be vulnerable were monetary union to proceed. It would be perceived as a small currency subject to speculative flows. Conversely it has some attractions as a safe haven if the Maastricht exercise fails and bond markets around Europe decide to ditch the convergence theory on interest rates. Investors cannot put all their money in D-Marks. Japan and the US have drawbacks of their own. It is probably no coincidence that the franc began to appreciate around the time of the Danish referendum. Whether that continues may now depend on next Sunday's vote in France as well as reactions to yesterday's realignment.</p>

			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> CITY COUNCIL REJECTS SENIOR HOUSING PLAN  </P> <P> A small group of homeowners in the central part of the city has successfully  opposed a senior housing complex that members said would bring too much traffic  and be inappropriate in their neighborhood of single-family homes.  </P> <P> The City Council denied a plan to build a two-story, 15-unit senior housing  project on Rio Vista Street, just south of Lincoln Avenue, despite arguments  that the project offered affordable housing and was within walking distance to  nearby shops.  </P> <P> "This is a very, very stable neighborhood with single-family homes, and it's  very right for senior housing, but that doesn't mean it needs to be built this  way," said Councilman Tom Daly.  </P> <P> This is the third time in one year that residents have opposed, and the City  Council has rejected, different projects for the parcel of land. One project  was an eight-unit apartment complex and the other was a commercial development.  </P> <P> About a dozen residents this week spoke against the senior housing project,  offering several reasons for their opposition. Some were concerned that the  building would be too large for the plot of land, which is about a third of an  acre, and too close to homeowners' property. Others argued that an apartment  complex would bring too many residents and too much traffic to the  neighborhood.  </P> <P> George F. Murdock wrote in a letter to the council that he was opposed to the  project because the height of the building would "block out the afternoon and  evening sun."  </P> <P> The council voted 4 to 1 against the project, with Mayor Fred Hunter in favor  of it. Hunter said he voted for the project because the city needs more  affordable senior housing, and the location offered seniors easy access to a  number of nearby stores. LISA MASCARO  </P></p>

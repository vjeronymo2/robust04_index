			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS: SUBSTITUTE GUESTS FILL IN, FILL UP  </P> <P> Chefs found themselves without dinner guests when a fund-raising event for a  Washington shelter for the homeless was canceled because of last-minute  contract problems. So they decided to cook for the homeless instead. Although  the shelter's regular meals are "very nice," said Mitch Snyder, an activist for  the homeless, "we don't serve clams or crab. People around here got all perky  about that." Some of the invited guests reserved judgment until after the meal.  "It'll probably be all right," said Ronnell Showell, 29. A for-profit group had  planned to donate at least $150,000 of its proceeds from the event to the  shelter, a spokeswoman said. After it was canceled, the chefs "decided we were  here to help the hungry and homeless, so why don't we?" said John P. Hughes  III, owner and chef of Windows on the Water in Kennebunkport, Me., where the  Bushes have dined. Chef Daniel Thiebaut of the Mauna Kea Beach Resort in Hawaii  got his company to donate lamb, fruit and special colored, chocolate-covered  macadamia nuts. The crab meat came from two restaurants in Mobile, Ala.  "Hopefully, they'll have a memorable meal and they'll realize they ate as well  as some of the fat cats," chef John Weichman said.  </P> <P>  -- A 7-year-old boy appointed to the Berkeley Youth Commission after he worked  for the reelection of a councilman proposed an attack on poverty when he  attended his first meeting. Edward Andrews, who looked bored at times, sat  through an hour of plodding discussion on topics such as student motivation and  high school assemblies. But then the boy, known as Teddy, rose and said: "I  propose we join together to help the poor and homeless children." His  suggestions included soliciting contributions from UC Berkeley and the city  Police Department; helping "children in need" get haircuts, and collecting  books, toys and clothing for homeless children. He said he has found two  bookstores willing to donate books and persuaded several establishments to  donate haircuts. The rest of the Youth Commission endorsed his proposals.  </P> <P>  -- Rock star Ted Nugent, 40, married Shemane Deziel, 26, on a casino showroom  stage in Reno, with actor Kurt Russell as a groomsman. It is the second  marriage for both. Nugent met his new wife in October at a Detroit radio  station, where he was a guest host and she was a traffic reporter at the time.  The bridegroom wore black jeans and a casual coat, but the bride was dressed in  a more traditional white gown. Nugent said they will spend their honeymoon  hunting in Texas and will live in central Michigan. DAVE JOHNSON  </P></p>

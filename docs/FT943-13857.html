			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Ministers bow to pressure over forests The government is tomorrow expected to formally shelve its forestry privatisation plans after overwhelming opposition from backbench MPs, environmental groups and the public. But ministers are due to announce reforms that will force woodland managers to operate on a more commercial basis when they release details of a review of the Forestry Commission. The three ministers responsible for woodlands - Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, and Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary - will then publish a consultation document on the proposed restructuring of the commission. The ministers are expected to suggest a formal separation between Forest Enterprise, which is a division of the commission responsible for managing Britain's 1.1m hectares of woodlands, and the commission itself. This will leave the commission to handle policy and regulation issues. Forest Enterprise is expected to have its own board of directors along with tougher financial targets and a requirement to produce more transparent accounts. This compromise move is seen by critics as a possible stepping stone towards privatisation and as such a way of placating the Treasury, which was keen to generate cash by selling off the nation's woods. Conservation and recreational groups still fear that forcing Forest Enterprise to make a profit could lead it to abandon some of its environmental commitments. 'It may have to revert to planting wall-to-wall sitka spruce, which we would see as regrettable,' said Mr Alan Mattingly, director of the Ramblers' Association. This activity would make more money than the current policy of diversifying tree species and age ranges, he pointed out. In spite of the government's partial climbdown, forests are expected to continue to be sold piecemeal. Forest Enterprise is set to double its sales of woodlands to 15,000 hectares a year next year. By the end of the century it will have sold 20 per cent of its estate. The reforms to the way Forest Enterprise is run come as the division is beginning to break even. Many slow-maturing plantations were established 30 to 40 years ago and are just coming to a point where they can be harvested to provide a steady stream of income. Observer, Page 15</p>

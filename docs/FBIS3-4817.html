The Petroleum Council, an advisory body to the trade  minister, held the first meeting of its subcommittee in charge  of studying basic problems in the nation's oil policy.    The meeting is designed to infuse efficiency and  competitiveness into the oil industry amid a growing call for  deregulation in the industry and a shrinkage in a petroleum  product price gap between Japan and overseas, said an official  of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry.    The panel will map out an interim report in the middle of  June in line with recommendations in a report prepared last year  by the Advisory Group for Economic Restructuring, an advisory  organ to the prime minister, the official said.    The report said rules and regulations in the oil industry  should be reduced to "the minimum level necessary."</p>

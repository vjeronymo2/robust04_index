			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOINGPLACES: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> MUSHROOM HUNTING  </P> <P> POD MALLS AREN'T the only things springing up in Southern California at this  time of year. As the winter rains begin, mushroom season spreads a carpet of  delicious and sometimes deadly flora over foothills and woodlands, and pickers  descend to track up the floor.  </P> <P> "It's a treasure hunt. It's even a treasure to find a lethal one and know what  it is," says veteran mushroom hunter John Clawson, who calls himself a cautious  collector, even after a lifetime of fungus finding that began when he walked  the Utah canals with his irrigation-specialist father.  </P> <P> It's also a walk on the wild side, or as close as we can come to it in Southern  California; mushroom hunting offers the opportunity to get some fresh air and  exercise and to explore nature. And in the process, it's possible that a fabled  fungus will be discovered. There are about 1,200 kinds of mushrooms and related  large fungi in Southern California, 80% of which are edible (though many are  not tasty).  </P> <P> Since there's always the other 20% to consider, mushrooming can be extremely  hazardous to the health of the unwary and untutored, making it imperative that  prospective hunters learn much about their prey before undertaking the chase.  </P> <P> A pleasant and informative way to do so is to participate in field trips  sponsored by the Los Angeles Mycological Society. The society's free guided  trips are leisurely walks during which different kinds of mushrooms are  identified. No experience is required, but shoes and clothing should reflect  the fact that most good mushroom areas are also hotbeds of poison oak.  </P> <P> The mushroom is a fruit, according to Greg Wright, editor of the LAMS journal,  The Spore Print.  </P> <P> "When you pick an apple or an orange," he says, "you don't harm the plant  itself. The same is true of picking mushrooms, unless you remove so much of the  fruit that it is unable to reproduce itself, or you damage the necessary  connection between mushroom and tree. To avoid this, we teach pickers how to  gather mushrooms without removing leaves or disturbing the soil."  </P> <P> January, February and March are Southern California's best mushrooming months,  and the date for the first LAMS field trip of 1990 is set for mid-January.  </P> <P> More information can be obtained from the mushroom society's information line,  (213) 292-1900, which will also provide news about mushroom fairs; the first of  these will take place in Orange County on a yet-to-be-scheduled date in March.  Spore Print editor Greg Wright also welcomes interested individuals to call him  at (714) 593-3791.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Deferral of termination of assistance is available to a mixed family that qualifies for prorated assistance (and does not qualify for continued assistance) but decides not to accept prorated assistance, and the responsible entity allows the family time to find other suitable housing. If granted, the deferral period shall be for an initial period of six months. The deferral may be renewed for additional periods so long as the total period does not exceed three years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Eligibility for These Forms of Relief <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although the language of the statute would only have afforded relief to families receiving assistance on February 5, 1988, the 1994 proposed rule provides, as did the 1988 proposed rule, that such relief will be afforded to families receiving assistance at the time the restrictions on immigration status are imposed. Since the restrictions are not imposed until the effective date of the final rule, the 1994 proposed rule uses the effective date of the final rule as the critical date for eligibility for these forms of special relief.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Decision to Provide Continued Assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. Project owner discretion. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters objected to the discretion given project owners under the 1988 proposed rule to determine whether a family containing at least one ineligible person could continue to receive assistance. They stated that the statute authorizes HUD to exercise this discretion, not a private owner. The commenters expressed concern that private owners would abuse this discretion, resulting in increased evictions, divisions of families, and homelessness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1994 proposed rule provides that if the qualifying conditions are found to exist, the project owner must provide continued assistance to a family.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters objected to the provision of the 1988 proposed rule that permitted project owners to deny special relief to a tenant who is receiving ``only minimal financial assistance'' if the project owner determines that the tenant could afford to continue occupancy without assistance. The commenters stated that this provision is not authorized by the statute, and that decisions about minimal assistance and affordability are subjective and must be made by the tenant rather than the project owner. The 1994 proposed rule does not contain this provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. HA Discretion. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Similar to the concern expressed about the likelihood of a project owner not granting continued assistance when the qualifying conditions are satisfied, was the concern expressed by three commenters that the 1988 proposed rule authorized HAs to not even consider whether to provide continued assistance to tenants in occupancy. These commenters stated that implicit in the statutory authority given to HAs to grant this type of relief to families is the duty to consider it.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Unlike the statutory language with respect to programs administered by project owners, which gives the discretion to provide special relief to HUD, the language applicable to HAs grants the discretion directly to the HAs. The 1994 proposed rule requires HAs to establish a policy and the criteria to be followed in determining whether to grant a family this type of assistance. The rule notes that the statute establishes certain criteria applicable to continued assistance and this criteria must be included in the HA's policy guidance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> c. Persons Eligible for Continued Assistance. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A number of commenters took issue with the limit on the type of family to whom continued assistance is made available. The statute, however, prescribes the definition of the ``family group'' that is to be preserved: Head of household, any spouse, any parents of the head of household, any parents of the spouse, and any children of the head of household or spouse. The list has been carefully drawn to include not only common children of the head of household and spouse but also any other children either of them may have. Other relatives not having the prescribed relationship to the head of household or spouse (such as an aunt or uncle) who may have been living in the household and who have eligible status may be just as integral members of the family, but the Congress has not included them in the list of persons to be protected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Deferral of Termination of Assistance <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. Discretion to Provide this Type of Relief. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The statute permits HUD (in the case of project owners) or the HA to defer termination of assistance in certain circumstances. For project owners, the 1994 proposed rule requires project owners to grant this type of relief if a family meets the qualifying conditions. For HAs, the 1994 proposed rule permits HAs to determine whether this type of relief will be provided, but requires the HA, in establishing its standards, to be guided by the standards set forth in the rule implementing Section 214.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. Length of the Deferral Period. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The statute also requires that the length of time of any deferral must be six months. The statute provides that deferrals may be renewed to total as long as 36 months. Commenters objected to the 1988 proposed rule's provisions that merely restated these periods. One commenter stated that 36 months exceeded a reasonable period, arguing in favor of a six month limit, and that a long deferral period unfairly diverts Federal housing assistance from eligible applicants. The other objector stated that an HA should have the discretion to renew deferrals for 12-month periods, to coincide with the annual recertification date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1994 proposed rule, similar to the 1988 proposed rule, provides, consistent with Section 214, for the possibility of allowing subsequent deferrals and that these deferral periods may aggregate to as long a time as 36 months. Each deferral is to be based on an examination of the ability of the family to find alternative housing. Since some housing markets are very tight, HUD believes that owners should have the flexibility permitted by the statute to allow families already occupying assisted housing to remain until they are able to locate other suitable housing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / The EBRD - Attali Resigns: 'I know of no action worthy of reproach' Jacques Attali's resignation letter to the chairman of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Mrs Anne Wibble Dear Mrs Wibble, It is with regret that I inform you of my intention to resign the presidency of the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development. I stated during the Annual Meeting that the interests of the Bank would always be my highest priority and would dictate my decision. I am deeply honored to have served as President of this institution since it was conceived, at a crucial moment in history, at the initiative of the Government of France. The Bank's achievements in encouraging democratic market economies in Eastern Europe speak eloquently of the dedication, talents and professionalism of its staff. Through their hard work, their remarkable skills and their international character, the Bank will continue to play a leading role in the future of the region. As you know, the Bank has come under increasing negative press attention in recent months. I know of no action that I have taken that in any way could be worthy of reproach. Unfortunately this attention has begun to have a detrimental effect on the Bank's work and on its staff, and it is with the interests of the Bank in mind that I have taken this decision. As we agreed during our conversation this morning, it is my intention to remain in my position until a successor is elected by the Board of Governors and has taken office. Yours sincerely, Jacques Attali 'I UNDERSTAND AND RESPECT HIS DECISION' Mrs Wibble issued the following statement: In my capacity as Chairman of the Board of Governors of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, I have today been informed by Jacques Attali about his intention to resign as President. Considering recent events, I understand and respect his decision. I will call a meeting with my Vice Chairman and the President to discuss the transition and the procedures for the nomination and election of a new President in accordance with the provision of the Agreement Establishing the Bank. Jacques Attali has been instrumental in setting up the European Bank, which has an important mandate to support the transition to market economy in Eastern Europe, in particular through the development of the private sector. I acknowledge that the institution has become fully operational with remarkable speed under the energetic leadership of Mr Attali. I am convinced that the achievements of the Bank will be fully recognised once the recent turbulence has subsided.</p>

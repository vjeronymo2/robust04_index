			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Regular operation of the electric furnace (a  continuous sintering furnace) that burns and hardens pellets at  the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corp.'s (PNC)  Tokai plutonium fuel production facility (Tokai-mura, Ibaraki  Prefecture) started on 25 November. The facility had been  producing fuel for the initial loading of the Monju prototype  FBR power plant (electrical output, 28 kW; located in Tsuruga  City, Fukui Prefecture), but a breakdown in the continuous  sintering furnace on 7 June caused a temporary suspension of the  fuel production. Monju was to achieve criticality in October,  but that date was pushed up about six months because of the  suspension of fuel production. For that reason the PNC invested  in a batch furnace to augment the continuous sintering furnace  and has been producing fuel with the two furnaces in parallel  since October.    With the regular operation of the continuous sintering  furnace now started, the FBR fuel production line is completely  restored.</p>

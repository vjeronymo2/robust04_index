			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Arts: Playboy of the West Indies - Theatre Plays do not cause riots like they used to. At the opening of The Playboy of the Western World in Dublin in 1907, the cast sent a telegram to WB Yeats saying 'play great success'. At the end of the performance, there was a second telegram: 'Audience broke up in disorder'. Quite why the audience should have reacted in that way to JM Synge's macabre comedy is hard to understand today. Possibly it was because it took a few pot shots at Irish mythology. The characters make a hero out of a man who kills his father: then it turns out that the father is not quite dead, the son tries again, still cannot quite bring it off, and in the end father and son go off happily together. In a word, atavism. Pity we do not have a few Synges around in 1993, poking fun at the IRA. It was a brilliant idea to transplant the original piece from Ireland to the Caribbean. Mustapha Matura's Playboy of the West Indies is not new. The production at the Tricycle is a revival to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the play's first performance at the same theatre. And what a joyous work it is] Matura's version remains remarkably faithful to the old Playboy. Many of the lines are identical. Synge specialised in catching the speech rhythms of English spoken by Irish; Matura does exactly the same with English spoken by West Indians. Note the way how people speaking in a dialect tend to fall into it more deeply when talking to their own kind. The dialect becomes a language in its own right. The Tricycle programme includes a glossary which tells you, for example, that 'san-e-man-e-teh' means 'without humanity'. Clearly the original settlers were not all English. There is no great problem in adjusting the geography. Where the patricide in the original is offered a ticket to the western states to get him out of the way, here the ticket is from Trinidad to Venezuela - just across the water. Everything else falls into place. The Irish like racing; so do the Trinidadians. There is a background of colonialism, and also a contrast between those who live in towns or villages and those who live in the country. In these island cultures there is a similar belief in ancient, perhaps surviving, gods. The direction is by Nicolas Kent just as it was 10 years ago. He avoids social comment, but teems with social observation. The Tricycle nowadays tends to have excellent casts: see especially Cecilia Noble as Peggy (Pegeen in the original) and Cyril Nri as Ken. It has very good sets as well, designed this time by Adrianne Lobel. She provides a wonderful rum bar, which is where the action takes places. This is a production worth going out of your way to see.

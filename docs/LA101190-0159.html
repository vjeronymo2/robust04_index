			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRED CITY MAINTENANCE CHIEF SEEKING REINSTATEMENT  </P> <P> A Glendale city building maintenance superintendent, who was fired last week  after a probe into misconduct allegations, is seeking reinstatement through  Glendale Civil Service Commission hearings slated to begin this week.  </P> <P> Paul Koehler, who supervised custodial services and communications repairs in  city-owned buildings, was fired Oct. 3, said John F. Hoffman, the city's  personnel director.  </P> <P> Hoffman said Koehler had been on a paid leave of absence since early July, when  Glendale officials began an investigation into allegations about Koehler's  work.  </P> <P> The former superintendent has appealed to the Civil Service Commission, which  was scheduled to begin reviewing the matter late Wednesday afternoon. Koehler,  a Glendale resident, had been a city employee for three years in a post that  pays about $64,000 annually.  </P> <P> Hoffman said the hearings will likely take several months to complete.  </P> <P> Citing confidentiality rules regarding city personnel, he refused to reveal the  reasons for Koehler's firing. He said the findings may become public if Koehler  requests open appeal hearings.  </P> <P> Koehler's attorney, David Cordier, said Wednesday that some of the allegations  against his client are "pretty silly" and do not constitute grounds for  dismissal.  </P> <P> He said one of the city's charges was that Koehler took home junk wood to burn  in a fireplace, but Cordier said that has been an accepted city practice for  years.  </P> <P> "Allegations of mismanagement are absolutely contrary to his performance  evaluations, which have been exemplary," Cordier said.  </P></p>

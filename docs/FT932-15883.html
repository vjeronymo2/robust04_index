			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / UK Company News: Savoy Hotel shows Pounds 1.4m loss SAVOY HOTEL incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.43m in 1992, compared with a profit of Pounds 2.27m last time. Turnover of the group, whose hotels include the Savoy, Claridge's, the Berkeley and the Connaught, fell from Pounds 79.2m to Pounds 76.8m. With low interest rates and inflation, and an exchange rate which is attractive to US visitors, 'there is a reasonable chance that 1993 will be a better year than 1992,' said Mr Giles Shepard, managing director. The dividend is held at 7p per A share and 3.5p per B share, because of the more optimistic economic outlook and the cover of previous years. Losses were 1.3p per A share (earnings 17.5p) and 0.6p per B share (earnings 8.8p). Mr Shepard said Pounds 9.6m had been spent on capital projects last year, with improvements at the Savoy and Claridge's.</p>

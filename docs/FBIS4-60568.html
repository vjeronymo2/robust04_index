			<p>BFN     [Text] Damascus, 25 May (MENA)--Former Yemeni President  'Ali Nasir Muhammad has praised the efforts exerted by Arab  leaders, primarily President Husni Mubarak, King Fahd  Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, and Shaykh Zayid Bin-sultan, to contain the  Yemeni crisis.    Speaking to a MENA correspondent in Damascus tonight, the  former Yemeni president said that he and several Yemeni figures  are holding consultations to stop things deteriorating in Yemen,  achieve a cease-fire, reverse the south Yemeni decision to  secede, and start negotiations. The new initiative, he added,  also aims to lift the siege on several Yemeni cities, preserve  unity, and end the bloodshed.</p>

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / UN elects its council members THE UN Security Council, which many countries are eager to expand and re-organise, will acquire five new members after General Assembly elections late on Tuesday. Brazil, Pakistan, Spain, New Zealand and Djibouti will supersede Ecuador, India, Austria, Belgium and Zimbabwe for two-year terms beginning on January 1. The changes are not expected to alter greatly voting patterns in the 15-nation council. However, India and Zimbabwe were inclined to be fence-sitters on some issues, including those of Iraq and former Yugoslavia, sometimes abstaining on crucial resolutions. Pakistan and Djibouti, both Moslem countries, may be expected to be more supportive of actions designed to help Bosnia-Hercegovina. Regional groups in the UN customarily offer agreed nominees for the five elected positions that have to be filled every year. The 'western European and others' group - the others being states of the old British Commonwealth  -proposed three candidates to succeed Austria and Belgium, leaving the assembly to choose two among Spain, Sweden and New Zealand. As expected, Spain easily gained the required two-thirds majority in the first ballot. New Zealand was a surprise winner in a third ballot, overtaking Sweden.</p>

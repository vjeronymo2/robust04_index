			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Letter sparks environment fears The Department of Transport is attempting to block European Union inspired reviews of the environmental impact of large road and rail schemes, according to a leaked letter from Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, to Mr Tim Yeo, environment minister, Charles Batchelor writes. Friends of the Earth, the environmental group, which has obtained a copy of the letter, said last night it would take High Court action against the government if Mr MacGregor succeeded in blocking the environmental reviews. The Department of Transport said it could not comment. In the letter Mr MacGregor says he has 'clear legal advice' that there is no need for reviews of projects already under construction.</p>

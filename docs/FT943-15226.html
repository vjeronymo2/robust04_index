			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Labour slams fall in training cash Government spending on training, enterprise and labour-market services has fallen by more than a third in real terms since its peak in 1987-88, Mr Tony Lloyd, Labour's training spokesman, said yester-day. According to figures obtained through parliamentary questions, Pounds 4.3bn was spent in 1987-88 at 1993 prices compared with Pounds 2.6bn in 1992-93. Mr Lloyd said this showed that there had been a substantial cut in resources, combined with a switch from spending on training to cheaper schemes for the long-term unemployed.</p>

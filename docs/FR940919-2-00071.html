			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In some instances, the Medicare cost report does not include all of the clinics and services which should be eligible for the PHS discount pricing. For example, hospitals refer patients for specific types of treatments to other hospitals, such as large teaching hospitals which have specialized equipment and medical personnel. Further, hospitals are establishing separate primary care services in different areas of the community. These facilities are often free-standing and not included on the DSH Medicare cost report, but generally are customers of the hospitals and have limited financial resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although it is understandable that the DSH would desire to obtain PHS pricing for these various facilities, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statute clearly states that it is only the DSH that qualifies for discount pricing. We have attempted to define DSH in a manner consistent with HCFA policy guidelines (Provider Certification, State Operation Manual, section 2024). Only outpatient facilities which are an integral component of the DSH will be included on the DSH Medicare cost report, and only these facilities will be eligible for PHS discount pricing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed guidelines would permit any health care entity, by means of its business relations with other health care entities, to make itself eligible for PHS pricing. Any clinic, facility, or community hospital affiliated with a DSH could consolidate its cost reporting requirements and use the Medicare provider number of the DSH to make itself eligible for PHS pricing. This is not consistent with Congress's intent in precisely defining a list of entities eligible for the PHS discount pricing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Congress referred to section 1886 of the Social Security Act (Medicare inpatient hospital payment) for the definition of DSH; therefore, it is reasonable to utilize existing Medicare rules to determine eligibility for PHS discount pricing. The proposed Medicare cost report test was developed by Medicare officials and used, in part, to determine whether a facility is a component of a hospital. If an outpatient facility does not share in the hospital cost report, it is properly viewed as an independent, free-standing facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When a DSH attempts to certify multiple components as a single hospital for purposes of Medicare certification, it must follow guidelines developed by HCFA. These guidelines (Provider Certification, State Operation Manual, section 2024) establish tests to determine whether an additional hospital facility, geographically separated but in the same metropolitan area, is a separate facility from or a component of a single hospital. These tests include: (a) all components subject to the control and direction of one common owner (i.e., governing body) which is responsible for the operational decisions of the entire hospital enterprise; (b) one chief medical officer who reports directly to the governing body and who is responsible for all medical staff activities of all components; (c) integration of the organized medical staff (e.g., all medical staff members having privileges at all components); and (d) one chief executive officer through whom all administrative authority flows and who exercises control and surveillance over all administrative activities of all components. This does not preclude the establishment of a deputy or assistant executive officer position.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the off-site clinic meets these tests, it would be included in the DSH Medicare cost report. This test clearly determines whether a facility is an integral part of a DSH hospital, and is an appropriate standard to determine eligibility. It incorporates Medicare criteria that are not ambiguous and forms an independent and objective basis on which to determine eligibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed guidelines should be applied uniformly to all DSH outpatient facilities, regardless of whether they fit the common perception of a traditional hospital outpatient clinic (e.g., include facilities that serve prison inmates, HMOs, home infusion and home health patients). Anything short of this would be extremely difficult to administer since separating traditional from non-traditional facilities would be a highly subjective and time-consuming exercise. Further, PHS should include in the final notice a specific definition for eligible ``outpatient facility.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

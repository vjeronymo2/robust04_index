			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Upheaval on the high street: The contest over Midland is just one element of the sweeping changes taking place in British banking This week, Lloyds Bank, in publishing its terms for the acquisition of Midland Bank, proposed to disturb the structure of the high street banking industry after almost a quarter of a century of stability. Time has brought about a curious reversal of the roles. In January 1968 it was the then chairman of Midland, Sir Archibald Forbes, who called around at Lloyds to propose a closer association. He was frostily received. Instead, Lloyds made a bid for Martins Bank, which failed. Midland may now draw some comfort from Lloyds' historical lack of success as a predator: in 1986 its offer for Standard Chartered was also abortive. The turmoil of 1968 created the industry's present shape. Westminster merged with National Provincial to create NatWest, and Barclays absorbed the then number six bank, Martins, after a grand scheme to wrap Barclays, Lloyds and Martins together fell foul of a Monopolies Commission investigation. Midland, then number two, was the wallflower in all this. The decline of Midland over many years to its current position as struggling number four is only one of the factors which is triggering the latest shake-up. With profitability under severe pressure from external competition and the wave of bad debts, all the Big Four are cutting staff and rationalising their branch networks. Lloyds is by far the strongest financially, and sees an opportunity to reduce capacity more efficiently by taking over Midland. At the same time, this would block the attempt by an overseas bank, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, to buy its way into the inner circle of English clearing banking. Headlong expansion during the 1980s, when bank deposits and lending soared and the staff numbers employed by the Big Four climbed from 229,000 in 1980 to a peak of 282,000 in 1989, obscured crucial questions about how the introverted management culture of the clearing banks could cope with deregulation. An industry familiar with cartels and official controls was faced with vastly greater competition and risks. In the past two years, as profits have crashed, its leaders have begun to face the consequences. Lloyds has been the sharpest in its response, focusing on its return on capital, and cutting its staff numbers by 8,500 in 1991 alone. It claims that the 20,000 jobs threatened by the Lloyds-Midland merger would only represent the inevitable continuation of this trend. All the banks are now planning to shed many thousands of jobs and hundreds of branches. Until the 1980s, the banks had been accustomed to operating in a highly restricted environment. Before the Conservatives arrived in 1979, for instance, bank balance sheets were constrained by the so-called 'corset' on deposits. Bank profit margins were fattened by the so-called endowment effect of high interest rates related to the double-digit level of inflation. With deregulation, however, tough competitors appeared and feasted eagerly on the soft underbelly of clearing bank business. The building societies creamed off savings accounts by offering competitive rates, while in corporate banking American and Japanese banks were ready to offer money at very fine rates. New technology has threatened to change the nature of banking. A proliferation of magnetic cards, hole-in-the-wall machines and telephone banking services has opened new opportunities but has also destroyed tried and tested banking conventions. This process will continue at an accelerating rate and is another reason for the rapid rundown of the branch networks which were once seen as fundamental to the success of retail banks. The management challenges have been immense. There has been a severe test for the classic clearing banker, who will have joined straight from school at 16, done his banking exams, and progressed up the ladder through the branches. Once, the best of the bunch would have emerged in their fifties into a secure, hierarchical world at head office for a comfortable few years at the top. Instead, in recent years top clearing bankers have been plunged into a world for which they were unprepared by their experience in branch banking - a world of aggressive marketing, leading-edge technology and global acquisitions. In choosing a new chief executive a few weeks ago, NatWest missed a stratum of more traditional contenders for the succession and opted instead for a 44-year-old Cambridge graduate. Perhaps the biggest single problem for bankers is assessing lending risk in a competitive market place. Bad debts have been climbing for years, and in 1991 the Big Four wrote off an amazing Pounds 5.6bn. Banks responded to the new freedoms of the 1980s by scrambling competitively for market share without recognising that the game had changed. They need to develop some new prudential rules. If the Big Four shrink to the Big Three, does it matter to the public? In most respects not at all, although there may be some minor inconvenience if your favourite local branch puts the shutters up. Retail banking is already highly competitive and most people these days can get all the banking services they need from a building society as well as a bank. There is one highly sensitive area, however. Small businesses rely on local bank branches and have nowhere else to go. This is the one sector of the market where 'relationship banking' is still important. The small businessman needs to build up the confidence of his local bank manager and it is difficult for him to shop around. It is also difficult for new banks to break into the market - as TSB, for instance, would like to do - because they would tend to pick up the most untried, dissatisfied or troublesome customers. The disappearance of Midland would reduce choice. The risks are probably not serious, but small businessmen are vociferous in protest. The small business lobby is particularly angry at Lloyds, which is seen as having been especially insensitive to push up charges and lending margins last year in the middle of the recession. These business customers argue that they are being made to pay for the mistakes made by the banks elsewhere, especially in their big corporate bad debts. The bankers say, however, that charges have had to go up to make this area of their activity profitable. No doubt the Monopolies Commission, if it is called in, will probe some of these claims. But the row forms part of a general problem in that the clearing banks are being forced to raise and rebalance their charges in order to adjust to competitive pressures and restore profitability. For instance, some banks are now charging Pounds 2 to cash cheques for non-customers. The public, which has often had an unrealistic idea of what it should pay for banking services, is offended. In the past, it was easy for clearing banks to pocket most of their income in the form of largely hidden spreads between lending and borrowing rates. Cross-subsidy then became the name of the game: services ranging from cheque cashing to visits to the bank manager were thrown in for nothing. Competition with non-banks and foreign banks has upset this cosy arrangement, however. Squeezed on their lending margins, clearing banks have been forced to examine costs in detail. This explains the frequent claim by bankers that Britain is 'overbanked', although branch networks were shrinking even during the buoyant 1980s; accountants now study each branch's costs whereas in the past the bankers only really looked at the volume of business which it would generate. Small business accounts are victims of this process. On the other hand, customers with savings accounts are getting a much better deal from the clearing banks than they used to. Big specialist competitors like Abbey National (now rivalling Lloyds for the title of Britain's most profitable bank) and Halifax Building Society cover the country with only a quarter of the number of branches of the big clearers. At least competition for corporate business has eased somewhat, now that the Japanese banks have adopted a much lower profile. Corporate lending margins have widened significantly. But the ability of the clearing banks to service the top end of the corporate market has been permanently damaged by the impact of deregulation on the risk profile of the big banks. They have all lost the AAA credit rating they once enjoyed - Barclays was downgraded only last week - and it is now cheaper for top-rank companies to borrow direct from the money markets. What is banking, anyway? It is a collection of businesses that have been bundled together in the past but today, in different circumstances, are often being profitably segmented. Why should retail banks expect to serve business customers out of the same premises, for instance? And what have the processing skills needed to handle millions of bits of paper got to do with the ability to sell investment plans? Often the glue holding all this together has been the branch network, but the economics of it are now being rethought. In their drive to cut costs, the clearing banks are looking at radical measures, albeit short of full mergers: for instance, whether they should pool their cheque-clearing facilities. In a way, it is surprising that the era of the Big Four has survived for as long as 24 years - and if the Hongkong Bank has its way, may last for a while longer still. After all, there is today no equivalent of the Treasury Minute of 1920 which halted the wave of banking mergers up to that point. The Monopolies Commission was far from unanimous in coming down against the Barclays-Lloyds-Martins leviathan in 1968. The Bank of England is officially neutral on mergers, but as the banking industry's statutory regulator it can be expected to be in favour of changes which strengthen banking profitability and remove weak links. There is much more competition in banking today than there was in 1968. But the clearing banks have too high a profile and have made too many public relations blunders for Lloyds to have an easy ride.</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / VW agrees second joint venture in Czechoslovakia VOLKSWAGEN is to take an eventual 94 per cent stake in a small volume car assembly and gearbox production venture with BAZ (Bratislavske Automobilove Zavody), the Slovak automotive engineering group. It has already agreed to take an eventual 70 per cent stake in the Czechoslovak car-maker Skoda for DM1.4bn (Pounds 460m). VW said the joint venture with BAZ would be named Volkswagen Bratislava. VW will initially take an 80 per cent stake in the DM60m equity capital of the new venture, the remainder to be owned by the Slovak government. It will inject a further DM140m in 1992 and 1993. VW plans to produce 30,000 cars a year (probably the Passat) from completely knocked down kits from 1993. Until then it will make 3,000 a year from semi-knocked down kits. It will also establish a gearbox assembly line at BAZ with a capacity to produce 1,300 units a day from 1994 for export to VW plants elsewhere.</p>

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / International Company News: Nestle turnover improves 5% Nestle, the packaged foods and mineral waters group, has reported a 5.4 per cent rise in 1993 sales to SFr57.5bn (Dollars 39.4bn), in spite of recessionary conditions and currency devaluations in many of its main European markets. The group said that sales volume, excluding the effect of acquisitions, grew only 1.7 per cent last year, compared with 3.3 per cent in 1992. However, volume grew strongly in Asia and in North and South America. Among product groups, drinks, milk products and pharmaceuticals had good volume growth. On 1993 profits, Nestle said only that it expected an increase over the 1992 net income of SFr2.7bn. Mr Helmut Maucher said in November that profit would rise by roughly the same extent as sales. It anticipated further increases in sales and profits in the current year unless the European recession deepened or exchange rates took 'a very unfavourable turn' against the Swiss franc. Oerlikon-Buhrle, the armaments and retailing group, said its 1993 sales dropped 16 per cent to just under SFr3bn, mainly because of the completion of large military contracts. Operating income was 'distinctly lower' than last year's SFr232m, but net income was expected to be better than last year's SFr37.2m because of financial and extraordinary gains. No dividend could be paid because of accumulated losses.</p>

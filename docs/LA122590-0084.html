			<p><P> December 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN KIDNAPED, RAPED, BEATEN BY 2 CLAIMING TO BE GANG MEMBERS  </P> <P> A 19-year-old woman was kidnaped, raped and beaten early Monday by two armed  men who identified themselves to her as gang members from Los Angeles County,  police said.  </P> <P> "When they released her, they said that by not killing her, that was their  Christmas present to her," Police Lt. Ed McErlain said.  </P> <P> The woman was walking from her car through the parking lot of her apartment  complex when the men approached and asked directions, police said.  </P> <P> "She attempted to run from the men, but they grabbed her and struck her in the  face several times and forced her into their vehicle at gunpoint," McErlain  said.  </P> <P> They held her captive for about an hour, beat her repeatedly and raped her, he  said. Both men had guns.  </P> <P> After she was released, the woman went to a nearby home and called police. She  was taken to a local hospital, where she was treated for a possibly broken  nose, McErlain said.  </P> <P> McErlain said one assailant was described as Samoan-American, about 22, 5 feet,  7 inches tall and 200 pounds, with brown hair. The other was described as a  stocky Latino, about 22 and 200 pounds, with brown hair. The victim described  their car as a "four-door, shiny blue compact."  </P></p>

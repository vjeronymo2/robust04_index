			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 11 (XINHUA) -- South Korea today  welcomed the resolution of the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) for sanctions against the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea (DPRK) for its refusal to accept further  inspections of its nuclear facilities.    A statement issued by the Foreign Ministry here said DPRK  should learn a due lesson from the resolution and clearing up  [as received] all its nuclear suspicions.    The IAEA resolution was passed by its Board of Governors in  Vienna yesterday by a vote of 28 for, one against and four  abstentions.    Under the resolution, IAEA would stop its technical  assistance to DPRK, which amounts to 500,000-600,000 U.S.  dollars a year.    In protest DPRK said that its nuclear program is peaceful  and  there should be "no more inspections" of its nuclear facilities  by IAEA.    DPRK's envoy Yun Ho-chin told reporters in Vienna after the  vote: "The DPRK will no longer guarantee the continuity of  safeguards. The two IAEA inspectors still in (DPRK) will have to  leave."    The envoy stressed at the closed-door meeting at the IAEA  Vienna Headquarters that the DPRK seeks a negotiated solution to  the crisis.    Just before the IAEA passed the resolution, DPRK Foreign  Minister Kim Yong-nam said in Berlin that his country would take  "appropriate measures" if its honor, sovereignty and security  were endangered through sanctions.    The current sanctions against DPRK was the fourth of its  kind  imposed by IAEA on its own. South Africa, Iraq and Israel were  the preceding countries that IAEA had punished.</p>

			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Low asset recovery rate expected The liquidators to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International expect to be able to realise only a third of the stated assets of its English operations, an official report revealed yesterday, Andrew Jack writes. Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, said it had realised Dollars 749.6m (Pounds 513.4m) and estimated that a further Dollars 344.2m could be recovered from a book value of Dollars 3.2bn, according to the annual return filed with the Department of Trade and Industry. The low proportion gives an indication of the poor degree of loan management or the extent of falsification in the figures reported in BCCI's accounts in the final year before it was closed in a worldwide swoop by regulators in July 1991. Total receipts in the English liquidation to January 15 this year are Dollars 882.4m, including Dollars 132.8m in interest and tax refunds. Most of the realisations are from the BCCI loan book - with a reported value of Dollars 1.7bn - which included more than 63,000 overdrawn accounts. The DTI report shows that there have been 34,799 claims on the English BCCI branch assets from creditors around the world totalling Dollars 3.17bn. BCCI in Liquidation. Report to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. Touche Ross, 100 Leadenhall St, London EC3A 3AD. Free.</p>

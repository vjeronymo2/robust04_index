"We are very happy," said Economy and Finance Minister Sam  Rangsi in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE before departure.    Rangsi accompanied co-premiers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and  Hun Sen to a meeting of the International Committee on the  Reconstruction of Cambodia on Thursday and Friday.    "Before we came we were a little bit anxious because we know  that donor countries face many requests from many other  countries in many parts of the world," he said. "We were a  little bit afraid that people may forget Cambodia. But finally  we have noticed that there is still a strong concern about  Cambodia and that the world community realizes that without  development all the achievements in peace can be jeopardized,"  he said.    The 773 million dollars pledged will go toward  reconstruction  costs over a two-year period.    The meeting, chaired by Japan, was attended by delegates  from  32 countries, the European Union and 12 international  organizations.</p>

The device standing on it is  scarcely larger than a packet of cigarettes, but all attention  is focused on it. The lack of a cover reveals an 8-mm-format  video cassette. The electronics surrounding it would seem bare  to anyone who has ever taken apart a home video recorder.  Behind the plinth is a television. A man in a white coat  standing in front of it operates the remote control. The screen  shows successive clips of a Brazilian sitcom, the latest UB40  video, a cartoon, etc. At first glance, this is nothing  extraordinary. Closer examination reveals, however, that the  television is not plugged into any antenna, satellite dish, or  cable network. The only wire coming out of the set runs into  the curious device on show on its silver plinth. The engineer  is flicking channels...on a video tape.    This kind of luxury may appear banal to blase consumers, but  it is a real technological miracle. The device, a high-density  video player and recorder, is capable of storing -- on the  smallest video cassette on the market, the Hi8 -- as much data  as can be contained on 50,000 computer diskettes, 200 compact  disks, or a semitrailer crammed with encyclopedias. The small  marvel can also read one or more channels and simultaneously  record about 10 others. Great, I will have one, you might say.  Not so fast. The product is still kept under lock and key in  Thomson CSF's Central Research Laboratory (LCR).    Located in the southeastern suburbs of Paris, between the  Chevreuse and Bievre valleys, the world detection specialist's  research and development sector employs 330 people. Everyday  work here includes logical constraint programming, the study of  submicron structures, and the design of millimetric transistors.  Video cassette channel hopping was designed by the Magnetism  Group, one of the laboratory's seven branches. Normally, this  team works on applications closer to Thomson CSF's main sectors  of activity, such as high-temperature superconductors, one of  the most promising electromagnetic detection technologies.    Research sometimes finds openings on the consumer  electronics  market. Thanks to the Magnetism Group, Thomson already receives  royalties each time a CD player is sold somewhere. This is  because the two inventors of the compact disk, Philips and Sony,  used some Thomson patents in the laser read head. The new video  recorder falls into much the same mold. It is of interest to  all sectors that need small-size mass memory storage devices,  whether for the on-board electronics of a fighter plane or the  space shuttle, in a desktop computer, or simply in the home.  Indeed, ordinary TV lies at the root of the research project,  with much speculation surrounding its future. In the hubbub of  possibilities for the future, one thing is certain: Consumers  always want more TV programs. Another certainty is that TV of  tomorrow (or the day after tomorrow) will be digital. Video  signals will be recorded, carried, and read as data bits, with  sound and picture converted into huge packets of noughts and  ones. In this way, picture quality should be improved and its  format enlarged.    All this assumes that giant storage media are required to  store the mass of data contained in a film, for example. A  three-hour, high-definition, wide-screen feature film requires  10 to the power of 12 bits (one terabit). To fit this 1 terabit  of data onto a small, already-marketed storage medium was the  challenge taken up by the Thomson CSF researchers. They  selected the Hi8 video cassette. Jean-Paul Castera, manager of  LCR's Magnetism Group stated: "We are convinced that the future  does not belong to optical film, whose recording capacity is  limited by the laser wavelengths, but to magnetic tape."    Conventional video systems use recording heads attached to  the periphery of a drum that revolves at high speed. This  enables the data to be recorded on thin tracks laid out across  the tape, and the relative speed between the head and the tape  to be increased. Both aspects have considerably increased the  recording capacity of video tape. In VHS, the track is 49  microns wide and the drum speed is 4.8 m/s [meters per second].  With the Hi8 system, the track width has been reduced to 18  microns for a speed of about 3 m/s.    However, with drum-based technologies, even if the track  width were reduced to 5 microns, high-definition recordings  would still require speeds in excess of 30 m/s. To follow such  a thin magnetic track at a cruising speed of 108 km/h  [kilometers per hour] would require extremely precise and  difficult-to-manufacture mechanics (drum and loading system).  Jean-Paul Castera stressed: "Not only does the revolving drum  pose a big headache at very high speeds, but it also generates  major maintenance and vibration resistance problems for the  on-board electronics." His team quickly fell back on a fixed  head system, as used in tape recorders.    This choice meant that a number of other decisions also had  to be made. Whereas conventional video recorders use a single  drum to read from and write to a tape, LCR separated these two  functions. The high-density device has two heads, one for  recording and one for playback. Splitting these two tasks had  two advantages. The first is of particular interest to film  professionals who are today forced, once footage has been shot,  to rewind the tape and play it back to check on the quality of  the recording. With the Thomson system, the cameraman can check  the recording "live." The second advantage is that a different  technology can be used for each of the two functions. This is  the aspect that researchers hastened to make use of.    While the principle is simple, it nonetheless took LCR three  years to manufacture the matrix head. Recording so many gaps  [preceding word in English] on such a small area is really quite  an exploit. The result is there for all to see, however: LCR  researchers have fitted 384 gaps in an area 8 millimeters wide  and just a little longer, each one of which writes a track 18  microns wide. Now the new model, designed for VHS-type tape, is  capable of recording 1,000 tracks 10 micron wide. This is  enough to give a data transfer rate of 500 megabits per second,  whereas the existing digital TV standard, MPEG [Moving Picture  Expert Group], requires a throughput of 1.5 megabits per second.  From a recording point of view, that is enough to store 333  films on one VHS videotape.    That is not all. It is not enough to simply record -- the  new system has to maintain the rate during playback. To meet  this second challenge, the Thomson researchers invented a device  that combined optical and magnetic modes. Jean-Paul Castera  revealed: "Actually, we were lucky enough to find two  conventional microelectronic components that corresponded  exactly to what we were looking for: The laser diode and the  charge coupled device (CCD). The former is widely used in  compact disk drives and the latter is used in camcorders."    By combining these modestly priced and now common-technology  components, the LCR team reached its goal of storing on one of  today's conventional video cassettes a data transfer rate  suitable for use with the television of tomorrow. In 1989, a  demonstration device was presented at the Geneva physics fair.  With electronics reduced for budgetary reasons to one-third of  the capacity of the heads, it was already capable of recording  three TV channels in a digital format on a Hi8 cassette. With  the new 1,000-track matrix head, this prototype is already  something of an ancestor.    This could be the start of a beautiful story. However, while  the LCR researchers continue with their work, marketing  constraints give them little hope of gaining their reward.  While recognizing the merits of the high-speed device,  Thomson's consumer electronics branch believes it to be a  professional "niche" product (detection, aviation, electronic  document management, etc.), rather than one destined for the  vast home video market. The arguments put forward are that the  system is not yet completely ready, optical memory has yet to  show all its potential, and, above all, the standards set for  the end of the nineties will very probably be for rotating head  technology.    Forty million VHS machines are sold in the world each year.  In this context it is difficult to impose a standard which,  even if it uses the storage media available on the market, is  not compatible with any other existing equipment. Moreover,  Japanese researchers have not given up trying to improve the  data transfer rate of VHS and other Hi8's.    All this explains why Thomson Consumer Electronics is taking  a cautious stance, although it continues to finance part of  Jean-Paul Castera's work. It is also true what they say about  once bitten, twice shy. The European electronics industry has  just come out of a bruising encounter with high-definition  television [HDTV], and certainly does not want a repeat of the  D2Mac [European transitional analog HDTV standard] syndrome.  The little technological miracle risks spending a long time  confined to those confidential places like the central computing  system of an aircraft, a submarine, or the space shuttle.  Patience is required.  <H5>  How It Works </H5> <H5>  Matrix Writing </H5>   The gaps are laid out in a grid like the pixels of a CCD. To  eliminate parasitic interference from neighboring points, the  data comes from two sources. The current passed through air gap  is the sum of the current coming down a column and the current  coming along a row. The magnetic field generated by a gap is  the sum of fields generated by these two currents. The field  then writes a data bit if its value is greater than the minimum  recording threshold for the tape. The trick lies in setting the  two currents to values separately less than this threshold but  whose sum exceeds it. Thus they leave no parasitic trace on the  neighboring heads when their sums record the piece of data on  the required place on the gap. This is the principle of  "multiplexed addressing."  <H5>  Read Process </H5>   The CCD consists of a grid of thousands of small pixels.  These pixels convert light into electricity. A device  regularly collects the electrical signals coming from each  pixel. The optical image is in this way converted into an  electrical signal.    To adapt this technique to magnetic reading, Thomson made  use  of the Kerr effect. Take laser light, for instance. It is  polarized, meaning that all the vibrations making it up are  synchronized and are moving in the same direction, unlike  sunlight. This is a bit like the difference between a  well-aligned battalion of soldiers marching in step and the  chaotic movement of the crowd in the subway. When laser light  is reflected off the tape through a Kerr effect transducer, the  polarization of the rays changes depending on the magnetic  orientation written onto each point on the tape. The soldiers  are still marching in step and in line, but some are leaning  forward and others are leaning back.    Then all that remains is to send the laser beam back to the  CCD sensor by placing a polarizing filter in its path. The  battalion's final destination is a large grid where each soldier  has his precisely assigned position -- but the ones that are  leaning backward are intercepted and sent down a hole. As a  result, the grid is an image of the magnetic signals recorded on  the tape. The operation is repeated several tens of times per  second. Once they have been decoded these signals represent  images and sounds.</p>

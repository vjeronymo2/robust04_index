			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Dmitriy Kholodov report: "People Do Not Sit Very Long in </F> Lubyanka. Will Sergey Stepashin Occupy the `Rickety' Chair?"]    [Text] General Golushko's resignation has long been awaited  -- ever since the reorganization of the Security Ministry and  even earlier -- immediately after the 3-4 October events when  the security bodies were charged with passivity. Still the  action came as a surprise.    The firing of the recently appointed Federal  Counterintelligence Service director can hardly be linked to the  arrest of the Ames couple in the United States. They worked for  the Foreign Intelligence Service. (In response to a request to  comment on the arrest of a Russian agent in the United States,  Viktor Zorin, chief of the Federal Counterintelligence Service's  Counterintelligence Operations Department, advised that we turn  to the Foreign Intelligence Service).    It is most likely that Golushko's resignation is closely  related to [General Prosecutor] Kazannik's resignation.  Noteworthy in this respect is a memorandum by presidential  security adviser Yuriy Baturin pointing out that the Duma has  issued an act of pardon and not of amnesty, thereby intruding  into the president's jurisdiction. This memorandum carried an  endorsement by Yeltsin himself to Kazannik, Yerin, and Golushko  to act in accordance with instructions. Yerin and Golushko are  directly concerned with the "instructions:" Lefortovo is a  Security Ministry prison and it is now in the process of being  transferred to the Ministry of Internal Affairs.    It is being suggested that Golushko refused to prevent the  release of the inmates. At an emergency conference on 25  February with Yeltsin, attended by Kazannik, Ilyushenko, Yerin,  and Baturin, the Federal Counterintelligence Service chief was  not present. Apparently dark clouds were already beginning to  loom over him. According to some reports, prior to signing the  edict on Golushko's resignation, Yeltsin had a talk with him  whereupon the rapid "resignation with no comment" followed. The  edict does not even indicate the reason for Nikolay Golushko's  departure: It was not until a little later that "family  circumstances" were brought up as a reason.</p>

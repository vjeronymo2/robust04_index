			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. NEIL SOLOMON: ACNE AND WASHING UP  </P> <P> Question: If a teen-ager has an acne condition, how important is it that the  face be washed? I have known adolescents who were far from clean and who were  never bothered with acne, and I have known others who appeared to be very clean  who had a bad condition. How important is cleanliness in this?  </P> <P> Answer: I recommend patients with acne wash two or three times day, using a  mild soap and water; however, scrubbing the skin is not recommended. Acne is  not caused by dirt. Scrubbing the skin will not improve the condition, and may  even tend to aggravate it.  </P> <P> If you have a medical question, write to Dr. Solomon, P.O. Box 36184,  Baltimore, Md. 21285-6184. Solomon cannot give personal replies but will answer  as many questions as possible in his column.  </P></p>

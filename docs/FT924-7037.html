			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Moonlight vigil for Christmas tree growers THE LAST full moon before Christmas has been carefully noted by a motley band of criminals intent on muscling in on the Pounds 40m UK market for Christmas trees. This year it falls on December 9, but members of the British Christmas Tree Growers Association said yesterday they would be taking all possible precautions. 'I have my compound floodlit, with a 24-hour security patrol,' Mr John Godwin, president of the association, said yesterday. Those with ambitions to sell stolen Christmas trees from the back of a lorry could have the European Single Market in mind. In summer the association met European growers to agree a system of standard measurements and quality. However, the Euro-Christmas tree is still some way off - the new rules remain 'advisory and voluntary.' 'Very few trees will match the specifications this year,' said Mr Godwin. 'But it's a start.' About 40 per cent of British homes are decorated with real Christmas trees - a market of 5m trees. In normal years about 1.5m trees are imported, mainly from Denmark and Belgium. However, this year sterling's devaluation is likely to make imports up to 20 per cent more expensive than they were last year, according to the association, while British trees are likely to be just 5 per cent up. Prices for a 6-foot to 7-foot tree will range from Pounds 10 to Pounds 25 'in the more expensive parts of London', according to Major General Tony Richardson, secretary of the association. He was expecting demand to be strong for British trees, which he said were 'in super form' after the wet summer. The association, which boasts 225 growers, points out that the trees are grown specifically for the Christmas market, so that people should not feel they are damaging the environment by buying a real tree. There are an estimated 40m trees growing in the UK, annually soaking up around 50,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. After Christmas the trees can be converted into woodchips. In contrast, artificial trees - about 1m are sold each year - 'are made from irreplaceable fossilised fuels and they contribute nothing to the improvement of our atmosphere', the association points out.</p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Pru slips to Pounds 242m at halfway stage: Underlying profits rise 14% - Interim dividend increased 10% PRUDENTIAL Corporation, the UK's largest life insurance company, yesterday reported an interim profit fall to Pounds 242m from Pounds 249m a year ago, but said underlying profits rose 14 per cent at current exchange rates. It raised its interim dividend almost 10 per cent to 4.5p per share. Profits for the 1992 period were boosted by a one-off gain of Pounds 52m resulting from a restructuring of assets in the shareholders' portfolio. The Prudential's general insurance business earned Pounds 18m in the six months ended June 30, against a loss last time of Pounds 21m. The company's Mercantile and General Reinsurance business pared its loss to Pounds 7m from Pounds 25m. The company has withdrawn from general insurance and has raised premiums in many of its personal lines. Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive, said the company will remain in personal lines. 'We are writing this business to give us access to UK households so we can sell them long-term business,' Mr Newmarch said, noting that under half of the Pru's personal lines customers have long-term savings products. Profits from long-term investment-related business were flat at Pounds 200m. The company has set aside an undisclosed sum to cover anticipated bonus reductions on its with-profits policies which are not set until the year-end. The Pru and other insurers have cut bonus rates in line with lower investment returns in recent years and Mr Newmarch has said he believes further reductions are necessary. In the UK, which accounts for 80 per cent of the Pru's sales, annual premium sales subsided reflecting a drop in so-called industrial branch business which requires house-to-house collections of premiums. However, single-premium business jumped to Pounds 1.4bn in new business from just over Pounds 1bn a year ago, largely due to hefty sales of the company's single-premium with-profits bond, the Prudence Bond. Mr Newmarch said he believes that the extensive cost-cutting efforts the company has made in its life division will help it gain market share once new rules on disclosure take effect next year. 'It's what the new disclosure regime is all about. You have got to demonstrate value to your customers,' he said. Lex, Page 26</p>

			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Brazil's most wanted man rests up in London MR PAULO Cesar Farias, Brazil's most wanted man because of his allegedly corrupt fund raising for disgraced former president Fernando Collor, was yesterday relaxing in a London appartment after four months on the run. Brazil's most wanted politician probably wished he was with him. Instead Mr Joao Alves, accused of masterminding a huge corruption scheme involving the government's budget, was giving evidence to a special congressional inquiry. The scheme, which was made public last weekend by a former government official, allegedly involved nearly 30 politicians. Money allegedly diverted to the individuals - probably several million dollars - is still being counted. Mr Alves, one of the 'seven dwarfs' who controlled Congress's budget committee until last year, denied all the allegations. Mr Farias's reapparance now was probably not entirely coincidental. After remaining silent since fleeing Brazil in June, he chose to give an interview to Brazil's main television station and even rang the leading Sao Paulo newspaper from London to confirm his whereabouts. His message was: Congressmen who found him guilty of corruption last year were themselves corrupt. Although the two corruption schemes appear unrelated, Mr Farias said he had further information on the budget scam which could be revealed 'at the right moment,' according to family members. Brazil is seeking Mr Farias' return through the British courts, although the abscence of an extradition treaty between the two countries is complicating matters. The 'great train robber' Mr Ronald Biggs, who escaped extradition in 1974, yesterday had some advice for Mr Farias: Don't miss Madame Tussauds, 'where all the world's villains are'.</p>

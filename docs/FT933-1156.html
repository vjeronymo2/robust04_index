			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Yeltsin example prods Ukraine towards polls UKRAINE yesterday provided a model of political harmony for Russia by deciding to hold early parliamentary and presidential elections to end crippling political in-fighting, Leyla Boulton writes. Inspired by Russian President Boris Yeltsin's forcible suspension of parliament this week, the parliament voted to hold parliamentary elections on March 27 and a presidential poll on June 26. 'If we take no decision today on elections, (President Leonid) Kravchuk will be left with no choice but to act like Yeltsin,' warned Mr Yevhen Sviderski, a liberal deputy. Mr Kravchuk agreed the dates from his car-telephone while in Moscow for a commonwealth summit during which he could not agree to full membership of an economic union pact without returning to Kiev for consultations with parliament. Parliament has opposed closer links with Russia and favoured keeping at least some of the nuclear weapons on its soil despite international pressure to give them up. But most damagingly, the republic has made no progress with economic reform because of resistance to it from both the president and among deputies. Opposition parties and trade unions had threatened to stage a general strike next week if parliament, elected in 1990 before Ukraine became independent, failed to take action. Mr Kravchuk, elected in December 1991 on the same day Ukrainians voted for independence, agreed to stand for re-election if parliament agreed to do the same. If he decides to run, a very strong candidate in the presidential poll could be Mr Leonid Kuchma, the former prime minister who resigned last week saying conservatives were preventing him carrying out reforms.</p>

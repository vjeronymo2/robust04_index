			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Special Report On Residential Property (9): Tee time for millionaires in spacious Provence ROBERT Trent Jones, the world's most prolific designer of golf courses (he has more than 500 courses to his credit) bought 2,500 acres of beautiful countryside in the south of France, outside Vidauban in Provence. That was about 20 years ago He wanted to build Europe's largest golf resort, where he could ensure that the best land would be used for golf. As he knew from experience: 'Developers too often want to take the best land for housing, and leave the dregs for the golf course.' Les Domaines de Vidauban, 15 miles inland from St Tropez and St Maxime, in the foothills of the mountains of Maures, is now taking shape. It will be not only Europe's largest but also its most expensive golfing resort. One of the first buyers of a Pounds 2m villa, Alain Prost, the former world motor-racing champion, has been made president of the Golf Club even before the first of three 18-hole golf courses is completed this autumn. Robert Trent Jones, now 85, has undertaken the design and construction at Les Domaines de Vidauban with his elder son Bobby. Bobby has 130 courses to his credit, including the new one at Wisley, Surrey. Though Robert Trent Jones bought the land at Vidauban with the help of Jaime Ortiz Patinho, a Bolivian tin magnate, they decided not to undertake the Pounds 600m development themselves. They brought in Pierre Schnebelen, who developed the ski resorts of Tignes, Val Thorens and Valfrejus. Schnebelen has been building international resorts for 30 years, but this is his largest project. At Les Domaines de Vidauban, he is associated with Malik Bencheghib, of Fonciere Malbe in Paris. Other backers include the French hotel group Accor, Interconstruction, the firm of contractors which built the Grand Arch at La Defense, Paris), and the Doliner group. In addition to its three challenging golf courses, Les Domaines de Vidauban will have six hotels, 225 shops and restaurants, a tennis ranch with 40 courts, a polo centre, two artificial lakes for water sports, botanical gardens, parkland, and three villages with a total of 2,000 villas and apartments. The first championship golf course, with wide, lush fairways threading through the elegant umbrella pines and cork oak of this part of Provence, will be ready for play in September 1992. The second course will open in 1993, the third in 1994. Accor, whose managing director, Sven Boinet, was French amateur golf champion, will open its first four-star hotel in 1993. Showhouses in the first of the three villages are for sale at prices ranging between Pounds 200,000 and Pounds 500,000. More than 60 of the 750 villa plots around the golf courses have already been sold; on these, houses will be built which will cost from a minimum of Pounds 600,000 for half an acre, up to Pounds 4m for eight acres. Many of those who have already bought villa plots are industrialists with businesses in Sophia Antipolis, the decentralised commercial centre about 25 minutes from Vidauban. It can take between one and two hours to get from Nice or Cannes to Sophia Antipolis in the summer - which is why one German industrialist, who has had a home in Theoule for 16 years, took only two days to decide to spend Pounds 1.3m on a villa at Vidauban. Pierre Schnebelen says: 'One of the great surprises is the number of people who want to live here all year. Our average price of property may be Dollars 1m, but for Dollars 1m here - which is the price of a small apartment in Nice or Cannes - one can get a villa with a swimming pool and half an acre of land.,' International businessmen are likely to be attracted by the fact that you can get to Vidauban on the A8 motorway from the airports at Nice or Marseilles in less than an hour, or from Toulon airport in 15-20 minutes. 'We are targeting the buyer who wants to play golf on a Robert Trent Jones course, dine in St Tropez, anchor his boat in Port Grimaud, spend a day on one of the beaches at Pampelone, ride on horseback through the Maures mountains, enjoy almost Californian spaciousness and yet be only a few minutes away from the motorways and the airports,' says Schnebelen. At present there are more than 300 golf courses in France. 100 more are being built, but the French Golf Federation says that more than 500 new courses are needed within the next five years to satisfy the demand. Schnebelen and Bencheghib (of Fonciere Malbe) see Les Domaines de Vidauban becoming the golfing capital of Europe, attracting those who go now to the Costa del Sol in Spain or the Algarve in Portugal. Robert Trent Jones says: 'When finished, Vidauban will rank high among my finest works, from the standpoint of marvellous golf courses as well as unparalleled facilities for the combination of golf and business.' Les Domaines de Vidauban has a sales office on site (telephone 010-33-94-7355-87). The agents in the UK are Don and Catherine Law, of Guildford, who specialise in the sale of property in France under the name Le Cl (telephone 0483-68846).</p>

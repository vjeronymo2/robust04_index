			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / ERM crisis vindicates UK monetary policy, says Major THE MAASTRICHT timetable for European monetary union is now 'totally unrealistic', Mr John Major said yesterday, as he claimed that the emergency steps taken to salvage the exchange rate mechanism vindicated his decision to suspend sterling's membership last September. As government loyalists and Euro-sceptics alike sought to draw comfort from the day's events, which also saw Britain become the eleventh European Community state to ratify Maastricht, the prime minister said he hoped the decision to allow wider fluctuation of currencies within the ERM would promote economic recovery in Europe. In the timetable, if a commencement date for stage three of monetary union has not been set by the end of 1997, then Emu must in any case go ahead by January 1999. In a remark later played down by Downing Street, Mr Major appeared to hold out the prospect that the changes could herald lower domestic interest rates. There remained 'no prospect' of Britain returning to the ERM 'in the near future', he said. The government would continue to set monetary policy by 'what's right for the United Kingdom'. But as senior ministers trumpeted the message that recent developments justified the government's European policy, their thunder was partly stolen by Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, who predicted there would be no single European currency and described Maastricht as 'a bit of a fossil'. Tory Euro-sceptics, meanwhile, pointed to the 'supreme irony' of Britain ratifying Maastricht on the day the ERM collapsed. Downing Street emphasised that 'relative currency stability' remained a desirable objective and looked ahead to a process of examining why the old system did not work and how existing fault-lines could be eradicated. It pinned the blame for the system's difficulties squarely on the strains resulting from German reunification. It indicated that an autumn summit of member states to discuss possible solutions was likely. In his forthright reaction to the decision to create a 15 per cent fluctuation band for all ERM currencies except the D-Mark and the guilder, Mr Lamont said: 'This does mean the end of a single currency, the end of monetary union in Europe. This makes the Maastricht treaty redundant.' It was 'extraordinary that we have spent so much time constructing this artificial creation and, frankly, it has gone out of the window', he said.

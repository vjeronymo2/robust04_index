			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME SIZE RAISES THE ROOF IN PALOS VERDES ESTATES  </P> <P> Jan Napolitan, a planning commissioner in Palos Verdes Estates, says she would  be the first to agree that everyone deserves to have a decent roof over his  head.  </P> <P> But does a family of seven (10 if you count the hired help) really need a  30,000-square-foot home with 16 toilets (20 if you count the pool house and  servants' quarters)?  </P> <P> Napolitan doesn't think so.  </P> <P> "Thirty thousand square feet is not a basic need," she says. "It is a basic  want."  </P> <P> Tongues are wagging, and a showdown appears to be brewing at City Hall over  plans by wealthy businessman Tei-Fu Chen to build such a house on a bluff in  Palos Verdes Estates. If Chen obtains city approval -- a public hearing on the  project is scheduled for Dec. 5 -- the house would be by far the biggest ever  built in the community.  </P> <P> Chen, following in the heavily trodden path of other well-heeled Southern  Californians, says he wants to start from scratch and build a home comfortable  enough for his wife and five young children.  </P> <P> To do that, Chen says he is prepared to tear down the 6,000-square-foot  Mediterranean-style mansion already on the property. The six-bedroom house was  once owned by former fitness queen Gloria Marshall and is still referred to by  some locals as "Gloria's house."  </P> <P> "I am a dreamer," said Chen, who owns a Torrance-based health and beauty  products company and who paid $4.3 million for the property on Via Visalia in  June. "This is our dream home."  </P> <P> Some city officials and residents, however, contend that Chen's dream would be  more of a nightmare for the community. In a city that prides itself on  maintaining abundant open space and a rural ambience, a 30,000-square-foot home  simply has no place, they contend.  </P> <P> "I don't believe we should have homes of this size in our community," said  Mayor Ruth Gralow, a council member for five years and, before that, a planning  commissioner.  </P> <P> "I have been serving this city for 10 years, and one of the reasons I have put  in the time I have is because I want to see the place preserved."  </P> <P> As in other Southern California neighborhoods where property values are  soaring, most notably in Beverly Hills and the West Side, the issue of larger  homes replacing smaller ones has been hotly debated in Palos Verdes Estates in  recent years.  </P> <P> Some residents are still sniffing over the construction several years ago of a  sprawling estate on Via Visalia coincidentally next door to the Chen property.  The 15,072-square-foot home, which resembles a European manor house, has been  nicknamed the "Visalia Sheraton" by neighbors.  </P> <P> To control the size of new homes and additions to existing ones, council  members last year passed a law forbidding anyone to build a home that would  cover more than 30% of the lot plus 1,000 square feet. Gralow, in early  October, tried to go a step further and outlaw the construction of any new  house in the city larger than 15,000 square feet, but she couldn't muster  enough support among her council colleagues.  </P> <P> At about the same time the 30% rule was adopted, the council also approved a  "neighborhood compatibility" ordinance requiring new or remodeled structures to  be compatible with existing homes in terms of square footage and design. The  ordinance also calls for building proposals to consider how the neighbors'  views and privacy would be affected.  </P> <P> City officials concede that Chen's proposed house easily conforms to the 30%  rule because it would cover less than 18% of the 2.3-acre lot. Indeed, Chen  says he believes his proposed structure is "quite a small house" given the lot  size.  </P> <P> But whether it conforms to the compatibility ordinance appears to be a  debatable issue, and one that probably will be decided by the City Council,  which must approve all building proposals. Although Chen's home would be at  least 30% larger than any other home in the area, the lot it would sit on is  far larger than any other.  </P> <P> Such facts don't sway Napolitan.  </P> <P> "I don't think when the city was planned and the lots were planned that anyone  ever thought a 30,000-square-foot building would be planted on one," she said.  </P> <P> Chen's architect, George Shaw, contends that the proposed house meets all the  criteria outlined in the compatibility ordinance. None of the neighbors' views  will be obstructed, and the house will be largely concealed by the existing  landscaping.  </P> <P> "Everyone who has had the opportunity to have the project explained to them  sees it is meeting the criteria of neighborhood compatibility and is not out of  line," said Shaw, who has talked to residents about his client's house at  previous public hearings.  </P> <P> Nan Harman, who with her husband, Reed, recently built a home next to Chen's  property, said her neighbors are "mostly uncomfortable" with the idea of such a  large house being built in the area.  </P> <P> Although Harman said she would prefer not to see such a big home built, she  said she is confident it would be done tastefully and have minimal impact on  the area. She wouldn't divulge the size of her home but said it's less than  12,000 square feet.  </P> <P> Linda Arkenberg, who lives on the street where the Chen house is planned, said  as long as Chen obeys the city's building codes, no one should prevent him from  building the house.  </P> <P> "As far as I am concerned, it is going to be off by itself in a secluded area  with other large homes," she said.  </P> <P> Chen, who moved to this country about 15 years ago from Taiwan, said he is  puzzled by all the fuss his dream house has caused. Explaining why he wants  such a large home, he said different people have different tastes and different  ways of living.  </P> <P> After all, he says, that's what this country is all about.  </P> <P> "Everybody has the freedom to live the way they want to live."  </P></p>

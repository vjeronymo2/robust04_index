			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: Ciga rescue package threatened CIGA, the Italian hotels group controlled by the Aga Khan, has agreed to suspend any independent action to resolve its severe financial difficulties pending a study by Mediobanca on how to reduce its debts. The decision, which followed a formal request from Ciga's creditor banks, makes virtually certain the collapse of the rescue package worked out by the company last December. Ciga then agreed to sell the majority of its Italian hotel-owning subsidiary to Situr, a fast-expanding private property and leisure group, for L301bn (Dollars 187m). The deal, which was subject to approval from Ciga's creditor banks, received a very cool response from the bankers. Separately, Situr, which recently made unspecified claims of irregularities in Ciga's accounts, threatened to pull out if agreement were not reached by the end of this month. Mediobanca is to study alternative plans for Ciga to reduce its debts, which amount to about L1,000bn, on behalf of the creditor banks. While that is under way, the company has agreed not to take any decisions other than those concerning its everyday activities. Preliminary results showed Ciga's group turnover rose by 10 per cent to L510bn last year, while the number of guests staying increased 8.9 per cent to 1.34m. Publications of figures for group earnings is likely to be delayed for some time, possibly until June. In 1991, group losses almost tripled to L98.9bn. The company firmly rejected the accusations of irregularities in its accounts made by Mr Luigi Clementi, Situr's managing director, and accused Situr of breaking the agreement on silence which the two sides had undertaken during the negotiations. Ciga said 'such false insinuations will be firmly refuted'.</p>

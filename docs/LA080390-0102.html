			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 8TH NAVIGATION SATELLITE ORBITED TO PINPOINT U.S. MILITARY UNITS  </P> <P> A navigation satellite boosted into orbit by a Delta rocket Thursday is the  latest in a series of spacecraft capable of pinpointing the location of U.S.  military units to within 50 feet.  </P> <P> The unmanned rocket thundered into a clear sky at 1:39 a.m., trailing fire as  it headed out over the Atlantic Ocean.  </P> <P> The $65-million Navstar satellite separated from the booster on schedule about  25 minutes into the flight and settled into an orbit 10,898 miles high.  </P> <P> The satellite is the eighth in a series of advanced Global Positioning System  spacecraft that guide U.S. and allied warplanes, ships, submarines and troops.  In some cases, it is accurate to within 10 feet.  </P> <P> The Air Force plans to send up 16 more satellites by early 1993, three of them  spares, under the $8.5-billion program. The first Navstar spacecraft was  launched in February, 1989.  </P> <P> The 3,675-pound Navstar satellites, good in any kind of weather, keep track of  the speed of military vehicles within a fraction of a mile per hour and the  time within a millionth of a second. They contain an atomic clock with an error  rate of one second every 300,000 years.  </P> <P> Military personnel tune in the network's coded radio signals with receivers as  small as a hand-held telephone. Boat and private aircraft operators also have  access to the system.  </P> <P> McDonnell Douglas of Huntington Beach, Calif., supplied the 128-foot Delta 2  launch rocket.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: VENICE;  </P> <P> MURAL GRANTS AVAILABLE  </P> <P> The Venice-based Social and Public Art Resource Center is offering creators of  city murals grants of $500 to repair their works.  </P> <P> "Los Angeles has long been acknowledged as the mural capital of the world, with  well over 1,000 murals within its borders," a spokesman for the group said.  "Many local murals have fallen into disrepair and are in need of restoration.  Artists have been the primary caretakers of these murals without financial  support." The program gives artists the opportunity to repair their own works  with money from the center's Emergency Relief Fund.  </P> <P> Artists should write to the Emergency Relief Fund, c/o SPARC, 685 Venice Blvd.,  Venice, Calif. 90291, describing the mural in need of repair. A photograph or  slide of the original mural, with its date of completion, should be submitted  along with a recent photograph or slide of the damaged work or section in need  of restoration. Submissions should be postmarked no later than Feb. 15.  </P> <P> SPARC is a nonprofit, community-based arts organization that promotes all  aspects of mural painting. It receives support from the National Endowment for  the Arts and the city's Cultural Affairs Department, among others.  </P> <P> Last year, the center gave nine awards to artists for the restoration of their  works.  </P></p>

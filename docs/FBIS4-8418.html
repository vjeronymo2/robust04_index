			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Petrovac, April 12 (TANJUG) -- Forces loyal to  radical Bosnian Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic and troops of  his rival, Fikret Abdic, on Tuesday fiercely clashed in the  region of the Cazin Krajina in northwestern Bosnia-Herzegovina.    This was announced by the 5th Corps of the Moslem army loyal  to Izetbegovic, which also said that Abdic's forces had launched  an offensive along the entire front line and that the heaviest  fighting was reported around Todorovo, Pecigrad, Skokovi,  Culumak, Jabukovac and Buzim. There was no immediate  information on casualties and on whether the front line had been  moved.    In the autumn of 1993, Cazin Krajina Moslems voted for  autonomy of their province in protest against Izetbegovic's  radical policy. They favored negotiations with Serbs and Croats,  with whom they subsequently signed peace agreements.  Izetbegovic then ordered his troops to crush the autonomy.    Radio Velkaton in Abdic's stronghold, Velika Kladusa,  reported a split between the local authorities, the command of  the Bosnian Moslem 5th Corps and the Bosnian Croat command in  Bihac, a town held by Izetbegovic's forces. The radio did not  elaborate.    The Moslem media in the Bihac region say the commissions for  prisoner exchanges of followers of Izetbegovic and Abdic have  met three times in the Cazin Krajina region without any success.</p>

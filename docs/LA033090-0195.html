			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JAPANESE PITCHER KUWATA SUSPENDED FOR MONTH FOR LEAKING INFORMATION  </P> <P> Pitcher Masumi Kuwata was fined $65,000 and suspended for one month today by  the Yomiuri Giants after he lied about leaking information that could help  gamblers.  </P> <P> Kuwata, 17-9 last year for the Japan league champion Giants, lied to the team  in its initial investigation of charges that he informed an acquaintance linked  to gambling circles of his pitching schedule.  </P> <P> The suspension covers the first month of the regular season, opening April 7,  the Giants said in a statement.  </P> <P> On March 16, the Giants said they had cleared Kuwata of charges that he leaked  confidential information. But the team said today that Kuwata later admitted  that he had received $6,500 and a watch from his acquaintance.  </P> <P> The Central League team said that these actions showed a lack of  self-discipline and that it had decided to take strict measures.  </P> <P> Yomiuri won the 1989 Japan World Series.  </P> <P> A book published in February alleged that Kuwata leaked his pitching schedule  to a person with a criminal record and received money from him.  </P> <P> In Japan, pitching schedules are kept secret until the last moment. Such  information is considered potentially valuable to gamblers.  </P></p>

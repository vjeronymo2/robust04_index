			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRASH LIKELY TO SPARK NEW DEBATE OVER PARK FLIGHTS  </P> <P> The crash of a Grand Canyon tour plane Wednesday is likely to spark new debate  over whether more restrictions should be imposed on aircraft flying over  national parks.  </P> <P> A deadly collision over the canyon in 1986 was responsible for the passage of a  law the following year prohibiting aircraft from flying below the canyon rim  and restricting planes to certain routes and altitudes.  </P> <P> But environmental groups have pressed for a complete flight ban over the canyon  to preserve its quiet and tranquility, and the National Park Service is  studying the possibility of putting more of the Grand Canyon and other national  parks off limits to aircraft.  </P> <P> Although Wednesday's crash, which killed 10 passengers, occurred at an airport  about seven miles from the park, it "once again raises questions of just how  safe this whole operation is," National Park Service spokesman Duncan Moore  said.  </P> <P> "If flights are going to be tightly controlled over the canyon, it may require  the investment of a major traffic control system at Grand Canyon Airport," he  said. "This crash will raise again the question of just how reliable the air  traffic control system is."  </P> <P> For years, the Park Service has wanted the Federal Aviation Administration to  build a radar system at the Grand Canyon Airport to regulate flights within the  park. Even though the absence of radar was not blamed for Wednesday's accident,  the crash gives opponents of the flights more ammunition.  </P> <P> "If I were a tourist, I would be asking some questions," said Maggie Fox,  southwest regional director of the Sierra Club, which favors a more tightly  "orchestrated" air traffic control system. "You have to find out why this plane  crashed, but I also would be asking what are the parameters of controls over  these flights. There is an unfortunate history here."  </P> <P> The FAA has rejected Park Service requests for radar.  </P> <P> "The traffic doesn't meet radar requirements," George Sullivan, an FAA manager  responsible for Grand Canyon air traffic, said Wednesday. "There just isn't  enough (traffic), and radar is very expensive. Now if Congress comes back and  says they want us to do that (install radar), we'll do it."  </P> <P> Sullivan refused to speculate on whether radar will be necessary if new  regulations are adopted to further restrict aircraft over the canyon. Those put  into effect after the 1986 crash have already squeezed more aircraft into a  smaller air space.  </P> <P> "We do compress them," Sullivan said. "There's no doubt about it."  </P> <P> The new rules have also made canyon flights safer, he added. Even though pilots  continue to operate under visual flight rules, which means "see and be seen,"  planes flying in different directions now must fly at different altitudes.  </P> <P> The Sierra Club wants aircraft banned from the canyon altogether and at a  minimum, supports more restrictions.  </P> <P> "If you determine you don't have any flights below the rim, and certain areas  are off limits, and you have a whole lot of tour operators that want to fly  over it, you are going to have to orchestrate exactly who takes off when and  exactly what patterns they take once they take off," the Sierra Club's Fox  said.  </P></p>

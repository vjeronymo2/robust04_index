			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Hong Kong group declares 43% stake in Dutch trader FIRST PACIFIC, the Hong Kong investment group, has built up a 43.2 per cent stake in Internatio-Muller, the Rotterdam-based trading and technical group, prompting the Dutch company to erect anti-takeover defences. The Hong Kong group yesterday proposed that Internatio merge with Hagemeyer, First Pacific's 69 per cent owned Dutch-based trading house. The deal would create an international group with annual sales of more than Fl 5.5bn (Pounds 2.8bn). Trading in all three companies' shares was suspended yesterday in Amsterdam and is due to resume today. First Pacific said it would pursue the merger only if the proposal won the full support of Internatio's board. Internatio rejected a merger but agreed to investigate the proposal. However, it also made an immediate issue of 5.59m preference shares to a friendly company foundation, a common takeover defence in the Netherlands. The move doubles its total share capital and halves the voting strength of First Pacific's stake to just 21.6 per cent. 'Internatio-Muller is of the opinion that a merger with Hagemeyer would result in no or hardly any benefits of synergy and that a merger with Hagemeyer is in direct conflict with (our) new strategy,' the Rotterdam company said. Hagemeyer and First Pacific insisted their intentions were friendly, although Internatio's response suggests that a battle may be brewing. Mr Derek Murphy, First Pacific's corporate communications director, said Internatio's issue of new preference shares was 'not surprising' and the company was 'not terribly put out'. Some attempt to maintain the status quo had been expected, he said. Mr Manuel Pangilinan, managing director, has said he regards Hagemeyer as a 'springboard for expansion' in Europe and the US, although the group's 'main focus' would remain in Asia, source of most of the company's capital, management and profits. With sales of Fl 2.5bn, Hagemeyer, has grown rapidly in recent years. Since First Pacific acquired a stake in 1983, the company has halted its manufacturing operations, pulled out of commodities and ended its presence in Africa. The company is now mainly a trader of consumer and professional brand name products, including those of Panasonic, JVC, Moulinex and Christian Dior. First Pacific recently reported a 28.4 per cent increase in after-tax profits for 1990 to HKDollars 366m (Pounds 27.1m), before extraordinary items.</p>

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour says benefit tax is planned TAXING invalidity benefit, which would raise Pounds 550m in a full year and affect 900,000 people, is being seriously considered by the government, Labour said yesterday. Mr Donald Dewar, the shadow social security secretary, said yesterday that internal government documents had been leaked to him which showed that ministers were considering taxation of the benefit from April 1994. This would be introduced either in a 'big bang' change or phased in over four years, he claimed. A more immediate change signalled in the documents is a review by the department of social security of the upper age limit for invalidity benefit, which looks set to be one of the casualties of the current public spending discussions. The documents published by Mr Dewar suggested that some 250,000 people on invalidity benefit would lose more than Pounds 15 a week in income once the taxation was fully in place. They also refer to the sensitivity of collecting small amounts of money from people dependent on benefit, and also to the high levels of manpower involved. Mr Dewar condemned the plans as an attack 'not on poverty but on the poor'. 'Those who are sick and unable to work are to be brought into the tax system by a government which claims that it wants to take the lowest income groups out of tax,' he said. While the Treasury refused to comment on the leaked papers, the department confirmed that bringing invalidity benefit within tax has been a government commitment since the early 1980s. Social security ministers are resigned to its being a tough year on spending but insist that some of the more radical suggestions being made are merely Treasury aspirations rather than plausible outcomes to the spending round. EDX, the public spending committee chaired by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is to meet again this week, and Cabinet is also expected to hold a general public spending discussion. The social security ministers, conscious of recent presentational errors, are intending to try to soften up opinion on the Tory back benches before the results of the spending round are announced.</p>

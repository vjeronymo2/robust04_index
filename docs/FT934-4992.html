			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Over-supply crumples newsprint: Turmoil sweeping the industry worldwide A group of 26 North American newsprint makers recently donated 480 tons of paper for a supplement on literacy and reading skills published by hundreds of newspapers across the US and Canada. The paper companies' generosity was laced with self-interest. Newsprint suppliers are desperately seeking ways to counter the threat posed by the growing number of North Americans - and increasingly Europeans - who rely on television and video for news and entertainment. The problem is that declining newspaper readership is just one facet of the unprecedented turmoil sweeping the newsprint industry. The newsprint market, which makes up about 13 per cent of total world paper consumption, is entering its fifth year of over-supply. North American prices, currently at about Dollars 430 (Pounds 290) a tonne, are still a third below the peaks reached in spring 1988. Each attempt by producers to raise prices over the past two years has proved short-lived. Some producers will try again in March to impose a Dollars 35-per-tonne hike. The glut has been caused partly by weak demand but also by a huge increase in capacity in the late 1980s. More recently, Russian mills have begun dumping newsprint in Europe. Although consumption will rise as the main industrial economies revive, there is a consensus that the industry's long-term future is not bright. Salomon Brothers predicted in a recent report that prices would peak during the next cycle, around 1997-98, at a level 20 per cent lower in real terms than they were in 1988. Salomon added that 'early in the next century, newsprint demand in developed countries actually could decline as interactive multimedia technologies, affecting classified advertising for example, become widespread'. Daily newspapers account for more than 70 per cent of newsprint consumption in North America. The upheaval is exacerbated by environmental pressures, which have forced financially strapped companies to spend heavily on new plant. Many governments in industrialised countries require newspapers to maintain a minimum content of recycled newsprint. But there are signs that demand for recycled material may be near a ceiling. Mr Martin Glass, a partner at Hawkins Wright, a UK consultancy, says mills are having difficulty maintaining quality as fibres are recycled over and over again. Furthermore, the sharp drop in Scandinavian currencies over the past two years has improved the competitiveness of Finnish and Swedish newsprint made from virgin fibres. The pressure to bring down costs in the face of fierce competition is forcing far-reaching structural changes on the industry. The market share of producers in Canada and Scandinavia, where trees grow slowly and mills are far from the main markets, has fallen sharply, in favour of modern lower-cost mills and recycled-paper facilities in such places as the southern US, the UK and Germany. Mr Bruce Kirk, analyst at SG Warburg in New York, counts a total of 21 newsprint and groundwood paper machines in Canada which have closed either permanently or temporarily over the past four years. Another three are due to be taken out of service next January. By contrast, three new machines are about to come on stream in Germany. Svenska Cellulosa is adding a new machine and rebuilding one at Aylesford in the UK. Many forest-products companies are reassessing their newsprint interests. Some - Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific for example - have withdrawn entirely from the newsprint market. Investment criteria are also being reviewed. One paper company executive says a newsprint mill will have to pay for itself much more quickly in future. The most promising markets are those where a combination of rising living standards, emerging democratic forces or a flourishing business sector will lift demand for newspapers. An official at Abitibi-Price, the world's biggest producer, singles out eastern Europe, Asia and Latin America. Canada's newsprint exports to Latin America were 15 per cent higher in the first nine months of this year than in the whole of 1992. Mr Glass says that the best-placed companies will be those with local production facilities, instead of trying to sell throughout the world from their home base. Finnish-owned United Paper Mills has become a rising force by building mills close to its customers in France and the UK. Similarly, New Zealand's Fletcher Challenge has stitched together an empire stretching from Canada, Brazil and Chile to Australia and New Zealand. Some industry stalwarts are unlikely to survive in their present form. Several companies are badly in need of capital; even less-weakened producers cannot afford a big acquisition. Yet the case for consolidation is such that the shake-up must be far from over.</p>

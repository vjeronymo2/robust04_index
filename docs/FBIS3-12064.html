			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rosie Ahuactzin from the "Radio ACIR News" </F> newscast]    [Text] Pedro Aspe Armella, secretary of finance and public  credit, was one of the first to congratulate the PRI  [Institutional Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate, like  he did last 28 November 1993. After greeting Zedillo and  wishing him success in his campaign for the Presidency, Aspe  Armella noted that if in fact it is a day of mourning, it must  also be a day of hope. Aspe Armella asked reporters to let him  make some statements. He said he had the privilege of working  with Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon in different areas for  several years, adding that Zedillo is a man with great talent,  an intelligent, honorable, decent man, and a man who knows  perfectly well the program of Luis Donaldo Colosio.    The secretary of finance and public credit had to wait in  line like other people who were at the PRI headquarters to greet  candidate Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon. Fernando Solana  Morales, secretary of public education, was also there. He said  that after leaving the Secretariat of Public Education, Zedillo  was fully devoted to Luis Donaldo Colosio's candidacy, adding  that this is a guarantee he is a unity candidate.    Emilio Lozoya Thalmann, secretary of energy, mines, and  parastate industry, was also there. He, like his fellow party  members, rallied for unity and solidarity behind Ernesto Zedillo  Ponce de Leon.    Regrettably, the Zedillo's speech to the members of the  Political Council and the National Executive Committee was not  heard by the first groups of supporters who arrived at the PRI  headquarters to express their support for the nominated  candidate. There were groups of [words indistinct] small  businessmen of the State of Mexico and the Federal District.    Guillermina Rico, leader the former street vendors, was  among  the first to greet Zedillo. Zedillo's speech lasted nearly 20  minutes, but some people did not hear it. Outside, calls of  Colosio, Colosio, could be heard. People outside then learned  from media representatives that the announcement had been made  official. People then asked for Zedillo come out to the plaza so  they could see his face. Some people said they wanted to see  and hear the candidate live and not on television.    After this official announcement was made, a master of  ceremonies presided over the salutation ceremony. Curiously,  this greeting did not take place outside the PRI headquarters  but inside a room of the PRI offices. Many people, including  secretaries of state, waited in line to enter the building.  Genaro Borrego Estrada, director of the Mexican Social Security  Institute, was also there.    Security around the candidate was tight. A metal fence was  placed outside to avoid overcrowding. During the reception,  those who wanted to shake hands with candidate Zedillo proceeded  in an orderly manner. At the end of the reception, which lasted  approximately two hours until 1500, Zedillo went up to his  office on the second floor of Building Two of the PRI National  Headquarters and that was the end of it. Then the people who  stood outside the PRI office walked away peacefully. The PRI is  in mourning, but, like Aspe Armella said, it has new hope in  Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon.</p>

			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Opening-day triumph for party's right wing: Houston may be seeing the birth of a new strain of conservatism WHEN this election is dead and buried, conservatives may well conclude that there never was a finer day than Monday August 17 in Houston, Texas. By mid-morning, abortion rights activists had conceded they could not change the Republican party platform; shortly after midday the convention had approved that platform, a testament to conservative ideology; in mid-afternoon the faithful and the vice-president gathered together in a 'God and Country' rally, unabashed in its religious patriotism. But the evening was the climax, as first Mr Patrick Buchanan and then Mr Ronald Reagan, present and past guardians of the flame, provided the verbal red meat that conservatives believe President George Bush must consume every day if he is to win re-election in November. It was the sort of day designed to banish the party's Doubting Thomases and political professionals who have problems with the notion that 1992 can be a repeat of the great conservative victories of 1980 and 1984, and even 1988. It was the sort of triumphal day that Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic candidate, never allowed Democratic liberals at his convention last month. Former President Reagan, in particular, did his part in a near-vintage performance that made light of the fact that the vast Astrodome is a tough arena in which even the most skilled public speaker finds problems. His was a message of endorsement of Mr Bush 'warmly, genuinely, wholeheartedly'; of excoriation of the Democrats  - 'to hear them talk you'd never know that the nightmare of nuclear annihilation has been lifted from our sleep'; and, very typically, of hope for the future. He ended what may well have been his valedictory address to a Republican convention much as he had begun his own quest for the presidency, with the words: 'May every dawn be a great new beginning for America and every evening bring us closer to that shining city upon a hill.' Mr Buchanan's speech was as much an encomium to Mr Reagan as anything else, though his endorsement of Mr Bush, whom he had challenged in the primaries in uncompromising terms, was all that the president could have expected. Its biting partisanship was conspicuous. 'There is a religious war going on in our country for the soul of America. It is a cultural war, as critical to the kind of nation we will one day be as was the cold war itself. And in that struggle Clinton and Clinton are on the other side and George Bush is on our side.' He savaged Mrs Hillary Clinton as the epitome of radical feminism and damned Mr Clinton for dodging the draft. Repeatedly invoking religious themes, he insisted that the Clintons' agenda 'is not the kind of change we can tolerate in a nation that we still call God's country'. The jam-packed 'God and Country' rally, presided over by the Rev Pat Robertson, the television evangelist/businessman and one-time presidential aspirant, with Vice President Dan Quayle in attendance, had heard much more of the same. Mr Robertson even allowed himself some musings, replete with biblical quotations, that Mr Clinton was under the illusion that he was the second Messiah. The religious right has been widely dismissed as a fading political force, weighed down by Mr Robertson's own failure in 1988, assorted scandals and the general decline in influence of the 'moral majority' lobby of the Rev Jerry Falwell. None of the leading items on its agenda  - an outright ban on abortion, help for religious education, mandatory prayer in schools, legal proscriptions against homosexuality, keeping women out of combat roles in the military  - are on the federal statute books. But the 60m Americans who profess themselves to be fundamentalists of differing sorts are a political market no candidate can ignore. Mr Clinton is not shy about professing his Baptist faith, quotes frequently from the Bible and called his social policy proposals the New Covenant. Senator Al Gore, his running mate, was much influenced by his religious education at an exclusive private school in Washington. Mr Bush's private doubts about religious absolutism have been well recorded, but for political purposes there is no doubt that he sees Mr Robertson and his cohorts as useful allies. There are other elements of the conservative agenda which make Mr Bush and the reviving band of Republican moderates profoundly uncomfortable. Though he diplomatically did not raise it in his speech, Mr Buchanan, under the protectionist 'America first' banner, has never retracted his demand that a fence be erected along the southern US border to keep Mexicans out. More serious in policy terms is the debate over tax cutting, a petard on which Mr Bush, who broke his notorious 'read my lips, no new taxes' promise of 1988 two short years later, is now thoroughly hoist. To conservatives, the president's repetition of the mantra of a balanced budget amendment and line item veto is simply not enough, even though Mr Reagan on Monday night faithfully endorsed both. It is possible this convention is present at the birth of a new strain of conservatism, whose most interesting advocate is Governor William Weld of Massachusetts. This combines conservative orthodoxy on tax-cutting with an almost libertarian approach to social issues, including no restrictions on abortion and no discrimination against homosexuality. But Mr Weld could not put together enough votes on Monday to challenge the party platform on abortion, indicating his time has not yet come. Indeed, the way the cards were stacked on the opening day of the convention neither God nor James Baker, were either of the mind, could have changed the script.</p>

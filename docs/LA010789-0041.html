			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES: HYPER HOLLYWOOD  </P> <P> Sean (Hollywood) Hamilton, the deejay of KIIS-FM's 7 p.m.-to-midnight shift,  says the success of his show -- KIIS has risen from ninth to fourth place in  that time slot since Hamilton took it over two years ago -- is due largely to  his willingness to "get out" and make public appearances. And Hamilton hopes  that these appearances, such as when he warmed up Sam Kinison's Universal  Amphitheatre audience on New Year's Eve, will have the additional impact of  bringing him a successful acting career.  </P> <P> Hamilton, 25, has undertaken a variety of projects to make himself known as  more than just a voice on the radio. Recent activities include commercials,  series pilots, a Saturday morning TV show and game show appearances, and, in  addition, Hamilton writes a gossip column for a monthly teen magazine and hosts  benefit concerts for Students Against Drunk Driving and Teen Safe Rides.  </P> <P> His teen-oriented, entertainment-magazine series, "Flip," is scheduled to go  back on CBS' Saturday morning lineup in March; and in April, Hamilton, who is  featured on the January covers of teen magazines Tiger Beat and Tiger Beat  Star,  </P> <P> will begin hosting a weekly cross-country radio show from KIIS.  </P> <P> "It's not going to be syndicated radio," he says of the program, "and all I can  say is that it's revolutionary; it's never been done before, and it will make  radio history."  </P> <P> In addition, Hamilton has just finished taping two half-hour television pilots,  which he hopes will air this fall. One is a MTV call-in show called "What's  Your Beef?," and the other a comedic, Siskel- and Ebert-type review show called  "Let's Talk About Movies," in which Hamilton stars with his KIIS sidekick  George Reyes (called Dr. George Brothers on the show).  </P> <P> "George's character is a 28-year-old virgin in a suit and tie who's . . . very  religious and very moral," Hamilton says. "And my character -- if there's no  sex, violence and car chases in the first three minutes (of the film), then I'm  walking out. We critique the movie in our characters (and) we battle at  opposite ends."  </P> <P> Hamilton, who in 1983 played Tommy on "One Life to Live," said he would like to  stay with radio as long as possible, but that television has always been his  goal. "(When) I'm trapped behind the mike (I) go insane," he says, "so I'm  going to do as many pilots as I can, in hopes that one will be picked up."  SHAUNA SNOW  </P></p>

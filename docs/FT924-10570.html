			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Arts: Today's Television Those who usually argue that a monarch is less troublesome than any other head of state, and of course handy for the tourist trade, may find themselves wondering tonight. 40 Glorious Years is a 90-minute extravaganza (7.30 BBC1) which appears to feature everybody except Madonna. We are promised that the first 40 years of the Queen's reign will be marked by 'the biggest indoor production ever staged in Britain' opening with Sir Ian McKellen, a choir of 500, two orchestras, the gold state coach, the Yeomen of the Guard and the guns of the King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery. The cast of 4,000 also includes Cilla Black, Lonnie Donegan, Dame Vera Lynn, Cliff Richard, Tommy Steele and the Tiller Girls. At 8.30 BBC2's series on Royal Gardens opens your eyes to just what a disproportionate quantity of land, property, and treasure has come the way of the British monarchy over the centuries. Best of the movies is Night Of The Hunter (11.50 BBC2). Charles Laughton's only work as a director, it is an odd thriller, with two young children at its centre, and Robert Mitchum playing a terrifying preacher.</p>

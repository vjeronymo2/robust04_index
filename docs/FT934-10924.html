			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: The fight to close an unacceptable pay gap Sir, Your article, 'Landmark equal pay ruling is welcomed' (October 28), highlights the immense difficulties faced by women who seek to bring equal pay cases. It is surely unacceptable that Dr Pamela Enderby has had to fight eight years even to establish her right to have her case heard by an industrial tribunal. Every year, women lose out because of sex bias in employment. Women's work remains undervalued and underpaid. Across the board, women earn only two-thirds of a man's average wage. Women continue to earn less than men in both low-paid, low-status jobs and higher paid jobs. Equal pay legislation has been in place for more than 20 years, yet the pay gap persists, encouraged by a government which chooses inactivity over equality.

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Keep ageing hippies in their place Sir, As a native New Englander who has favoured yours over American financial papers, I was horrified to find an incident of grievous geographic neglect. Someone had reversed the labels of New Hampshire and Vermont on the illustration accompanying the article 'Sainsbury makes a second US foray' (October 4). This may seem a minor gaffe, or even irrelevant. I would argue otherwise. Having been raised in the right-hand state, the one that stands upright and has consistently exhibited sound rightward-leaning, market-minded thinking, I cannot ignore such a blunder. New Hampshire, on (and in) the right in these so many ways, is home to America's first primary every four years. In it reside some of the nation's most libertarian thinkers and entrepreneurs. To its left, in Vermont, dwell ageing hippies and such environmentally conscious companies as Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream. It is quite likely that Vermonters read neither your paper, nor much of anything that displays support of free markets. Their single representative is the Congress's sole avowed socialist. Disparagement towards them, both in your geographic sleight and my own sweeping critiques, is deserved. If only the other victim were not my dear and beloved home.

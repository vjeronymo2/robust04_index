			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: All-round growth behind Fairey's rise to Pounds 12.9m Fairey Group, the industrial electronics and specialist engineering concern, boosted first-half pre-tax profits by 26 per cent from Pounds 10.2m to Pounds 12.9m, and is raising the interim dividend from 1.9p to 2.25p per share. Sales rose 15 per cent from Pounds 63.8m to Pounds 73.7m. Mr John Poulter, chief executive, said excellent growth from the main electronics sector - in spite of some weakness in the insulators business, continuing enhanced margins at aerospace and defence, and improved volume in filtration had combined to produce a 'very encouraging' result. All three business sectors showed improved profits. The electronics and electrical power business lifted operating profit from Pounds 7.18m to Pounds 8.76m, as turnover rose from Pounds 39.2m to Pounds 47.8m. Filtration and specialised ceramics increased operating profit from Pounds 1.58m to Pounds 1.8m on sales up slightly from Pounds 13.3m to Pounds 13.9m. Aerospace and defence had profit of Pounds 2.03m (Pounds 1.33m) on sales of Pounds 11.9m (Pounds 11.3m). Overall, said Mr Poulter, there had been an improvement in demand for Fairey's products in most geographic areas and all except one of its main companies was ahead of last year. The exception was the insulators business, which is facing reduced domestic demand. Its factory at Stafford is being rationalised to reduce its cost base in line with likely future requirements. In spite of this, however, and some seasonality in Fairey's business which favours the first half, Mr Poulter said 'we face the future with considerable confidence'. Net cash at July 2 was Pounds 19.1m, up from Pounds 10.2m at the end of 1993. The rise partly reflects Pounds 2.5m from a property disposal in Tamworth. Late last month, though, Fairey announced the Pounds 9.3m acquisition of Massachusetts-based Imaging Technology, which makes specialised modular computer boards for industrial image processing systems. This will be paid for out of existing resources. First-half earnings per share rose from 9.2p to 11.2p. Both these and the dividends for last year have been restated to reflect the 1-for-1 capitalisation issue this June.</p>

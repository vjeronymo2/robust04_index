			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Feltrim Names seek early ruling MEMBERS of the Feltrim syndicates at Lloyd's who are seeking compensation for more than Pounds 600m in insurance losses have applied for a summary judgment in their legal action against more than 50 agents at the London insurance market. The action is being taken by the Feltrim Names Association, formed by 1,500 Names - individuals whose wealth backs the market - who were members of Feltrim syndicates 540 and 847. They allege that negligence by agents was responsible for losses which could reach Pounds 600m. A summary judgment seeks to speed up court processes where the plaintiffs believe they can present a case to which there is no arguable defence. Through the normal process the case could take up to 18 months to reach court. Separately, 200 Names are pressing regulators to intervene over the rising cost of administering claims against syndicate 126 which stopped underwriting 10 years ago. About 3,000 Names originally joined syndicate 126 attracted by the record of its underwriter, Mr Ian Posgate. Losses on the 1982 year are about Pounds 40m - 154 per cent of the syndicate's original allowable premium income of Pounds 26.9m. Alexander Syndicate Management, a company specialising in run-off - managing the business of a syndicate which is no longer active - has been administering the syndicate's affairs. It has subcontracted claims-handling to AJ Archer, the listed agency group. Mr Chris Burton, a director of AJ Archer and secretary to ASM, said yesterday that fees charged by Archer to ASM contained 'no profit element'.</p>

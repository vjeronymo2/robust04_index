			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HAROLD W. ZANCANATA; PIONEER OF SPACE PROGRAM  </P> <P> Harold W. Zancanata, 70, a scientist and pioneer in the U.S. space program who  developed some of the first booster rockets for testing the atmosphere. For  more than 30 years, Zancanata developed rockets and launched them from sites in  several states, including Cape Canaveral in Florida and White Sands Missile  Range in New Mexico. "He was the project officer responsible for instrumenting  rockets used to study the physics and chemistry of the upper atmosphere," said  William Dean, a retired Army mathematician who worked closely with Zancanata.  In 1952, Zancanata combined a German V-2 rocket captured during World War II  with a U.S. Corporal rocket and fired the missile 250 miles, a record at the  time, said his son, Rodney. Zancanata and a team of scientists launched rockets  in the early 1960s from Christmas and Johnson islands in the Pacific Ocean to  study the effects of nuclear blasts on the atmosphere.

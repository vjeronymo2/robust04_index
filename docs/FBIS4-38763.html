			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Uzbekistan: Inaccessible Ostankino"] </F>   [Text] For several months now Uzbekistan has had to be  satisfied with a truncated Ostankino service and has been  virtually robbed of Russian TV. Russian viewers have been left  without sports, educational, cultural, and children's programs.  Their small screens only come on at 1800 hours. The local  authorities say that the two television companies owe the  republic's Ministry of Communications 1 billion rubles for the  use of 250 relay stations. Many Moscow newspapers stopped being  printed in Uzbekistan even earlier, and you cannot find anything  in the local kiosks now apart from TRUD and RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA.  The "literary monthly" journals are not arriving either. For  three years now there has not been a single theater, singer, or  group from Russia on tour even in Tashkent. Television was the  only salvation from a total cultural vacuum.    Ostankino undoubtedly still has the highest rating in the  republic. A recent sociological poll showed that the other  channels broadcasting in Uzbek and Turkish get just a third of  the viewers, at best. It is presumably the popularity of  Russian television that irritates the primitive jingoists who  see Ostankino as almost "subversive."    Another story has it that local television personnel are  interested in cutting Ostankino in order to "make a killing" out  of the advertising profits.    Typically the problem of Ostankino is not even being  discussed in the local press. This is a clear sign, as is the  custom in Uzbekistan, that top mandarins have had a hand in the  decision to cut back broadcasting.    Viewers in Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan] picketed the republic's  television and radio company, the government immediately  backpedaled and switched on Moscow television right away.</p>

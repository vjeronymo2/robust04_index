			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold tumbles while US backs are turned EUROPEAN SPECULATORS chose the US Columbus Day holiday for a relatively successful attempt to drive down the gold price, traders and analysts suggested. Gold closed in London at Dollars 345.80 a troy ounce, down Dollars 5.05 from Friday's close. Although the New York Commodity Exchange (Comex) was open, speculators knew it would be thinly-manned because of the holiday. 'It was the one day when Europe could sell without Comex buying in the afternoon,' suggested one trader. Ms Rhona O'Connell, analyst at Williams de Broe, part of the Banque Bruxelles Lambert group, suggested that 'because they (the speculators) failed recently to push the gold price up through resistance at Dollars 352 (an ounce), they decided to push the other way'. The Europeans hoped to spark selling by the US funds, she added, and some funds did liquidate their holdings. But the gold market fundamentals were sound, Ms O'Connell insisted, and yesterday's fall was 'just professionals having some fun and games'. Traders suggested the volume of gold traded yesterday was not large although some producer selling from South Africa and Australia took place as the price began to fall. The pace of gold's fall was also accelerated when some funds cut their losses at the Dollars 348 level. Some gold producers, notably Newmont Mining of the US, have recently unwound their forward sales and hedging, gestures meant to signal they were confident the price did not have much further to fall. However, American Barrick Resources, the Canadian group, announced at the weekend it had completed a 1m-ounce, ten-year gold hedging facility that allowed it to receive Dollars 450 an ounce for gold sold forward under spot deferred contracts. Mr Andy Smith, analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland, suggested that this news may not have helped the market psychologically. He suggested that the uncertainties associated with the US presidential election might help the gold price in the next few weeks, 'but after that you can't be too optimistic'. Ms O'Connell said that Dollars 345.50 was an important chart resistance point for gold and if the price broke through that level it might go to Dollars 343. Some traders went even further and suggested a fall below Dollars 345.50 might trigger substantial liquidation of US fund holdings and a drop to Dollars 338 an ounce. At Dollars 350 an ounce about one third of gold production outside the former eastern bloc is unprofitable, SG Warburg Securities, the financial services group, points out in its latest International Mining Outlook. It is forecasting 'only modest price improvement and volatility over the next two years'. Warburg suggests the gold price will average Dollars 345 an ounce this year, move up to Dollars 370 in the first half of 1993 and to Dollars 380 in the second half.</p>

			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SUPPORT FOR DUMPED FOREIGN SECRETARY;  </P> <P> PARLIAMENT CHEERS ARE JEERS AT THATCHER  </P> <P> At her last appearance in Parliament before its long summer break, Prime  Minister Margaret Thatcher sat stony-faced today through an extraordinary  demonstration of support for the man she had just dumped as foreign secretary.  </P> <P> When Sir Geoffrey Howe rose to answer questions in his new post as leader of  the House of Commons, Conservative members waved, cheered and roared their  welcome in a blunt signal to Thatcher of their disapproval at the way he had  been treated.  </P> <P> "This is the beginning of the end for Mrs. Thatcher," one said. "We are cocking  a snook (thumbing our noses) at her."  </P> <P> In the reshuffle, Britain's biggest since 1962, two ministers resigned,  Thatcher fired two others and made changes to 13 of the 21 Cabinet posts. It  was meant to wrest the political initiative back from the resurgent Labor  opposition.  </P> <P> Instead, it left critics mocking the reshuffle as a shambles and the government  wearing the "divided" tag it used to happily pin on Labor's frequent public  squabbles.  </P> <P> The way she handled the reshuffle, after a catastrophic performance by the  Conservatives in May's European elections, revived controversy over Thatcher's  domineering leadership style.  </P> <P> Just before Parliament rose, a senior Conservative member accused her of being  "dogma driven." In a speech, Nicholas Winterton warned the new Cabinet to  address "the great gulf which remains between government and electorate."  </P> <P> Thatcher's relations with Howe and Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson  have been strained for months over such issues as the battle against inflation  and economic issues involving Europe -- where she is at odds with her European  Community partners over monetary union, progress toward a single market and  workers' rights.  </P></p>

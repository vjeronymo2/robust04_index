According to the report of the central news unit from Kabul,  the forces opposed to the president claimed today that they had  dispatched hundreds of fresh forces to the battle fronts in the  south of Kabul. Meanwhile, on the eighth week after the start  of the clashes, the forces loyal to the president still control  all the major government centers in the capital and have  prevented the penetration of their opponents to the central  parts of Kabul.    On the other hand, on the eve of the arrival of Pakistan's  foreign minister in Kabul, Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami has  expressed its readiness to declare another temporary cease-fire.    According to the reports from the north of Afghanistan, the  central parts of Kondoz province have been the scenes of intense  fighting between the forces loyal to the president and the  forces of General Dostum. Kondoz Province, which is under the  control of the forces loyal to the president, enjoys an  important strategic position in the north of Afghanistan, near  Tajikistan.    On the other hand, the central council of Hezb-e Wahdat-e  Eslami [Islamic Unity Party], in a session convened recently in  order to investigate the political and military developments in  Afghanistan, once again declared its neutrality in the current  war in that country.</p>

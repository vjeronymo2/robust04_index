			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU urged to reduce sugar beet production The European Union should seize the opportunity of forthcoming reforms to of the sugar regime to cut beet output and help competing cane producers in developing nations, according to a London-based development agency. The Catholic Institute for International Relations said in a report* on the regime that the millions of tonnes of subsidised sugar the EU exported each year depressed world prices and deprived producers in developing countries of badly-needed foreign exchange. It urged the EU to phase out price support for beet production that exceeds domestic demand, compensating farmers for loss of revenue through other payments, for example linked to environmentally-friendly farming. The European Commission is due to unveil proposals for regime's reform in the next few weeks. The charity said that the Uruguay Round trade deal driving the reforms would do little to raise world prices and help developing nations. A fall in EU sugar exports of about 250,000 tonnes at most would be 'a drop in the ocean' compared with its exports of 5.7m tonnes last year and would unlikely raise world prices by more than 0.5 per cent. But cuts in EU support prices triggered by the Gatt requirement to reduce subsidised exports would have a disproportionate impact on former colonies which have preferential trade agreements with the EU under the Lome convention. 'For the high-cost ACP producers of the Caribbean, even a small price fall would have serious consequences,' it said. *Sugar: Europe's bittersweet policies.

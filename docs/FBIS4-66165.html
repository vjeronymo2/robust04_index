			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Problems in Developing Shareholding System and </F> Strategies"]    [Text] 1. Accelerate Law-Making. The promulgation of the  Company Law has been a powerful boost to the development of the  shareholding system. The Company Law, however, does not cover  the nation's entire shareholding system. Special laws and  regulations are urgently needed to regulate the conduct of the  principal players on the booming stock market, to tackle the  rapid growth of shareholding cooperative enterprises in  townships and rural areas, and to improve stock market  information disclosure, etc. The top priority right now is to  introduce a securities law without delay to meet a most pressing  need and better facilitate the implementation of the Company Law.    2. Accelerate Pilot Projects. Compared to a decade ago, the  shareholding system has developed significantly in the last two  years. However, it still falls short of objective requirements.  There is currently a strong demand among members of the public  for the shareholding system to be broadened, something that must  be given full attention by the pertinent agencies. Why was the  contract system widely adopted (not just experimented with)  almost overnight, while all broad-based pilot projects involving  the shareholding system have run into considerable difficulties?  If our exclusive preoccupation with stability causes us to let  opportunities slip by, it will ultimately militate against the  establishment of a socialist market economy in China.    3. Establishing a Regularized Shareholding Economy. The call  for regularization is as old as the first pilot projects in the  shareholding system. Yet the inertia of the planned economy has  distorted the content of regularization. There are rules that  say one cannot issue shares until after one has fulfilled the  commitment of purchasing treasury bonds and that mandate  examination and approval formalities level after level, not to  mention specifying the value of shares to be issued. All this is  typical of the way the planned economy operates and is most  irregular. Any particular economic model must operate by its own  rules and be supplemented by the corresponding management tools.  If we do otherwise, regularization would be out of the question.  And if we seek to correct the mistakes later, we will have to  pay a high price.    4. Imbalance in Pilot Projects. There are proportionately  more experiments in the shareholding system in the coastal  provinces and economically developed provinces than in the  border and remote provinces. Take, for instance, the ratio of  companies whose shares are being traded on the stock market.  Between them, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Guangdong, and Fujian have  something close to a monopoly, whereas southwest and northwest  China are clearly falling behind. Balance, it should be  realized, is the cornerstone of stability. If we locate every  shareholding pilot project in special economic zones [SEZ's],  leading to the large-scale movement of qualified personnel and  funds helter-skelter, we will necessarily upset the balance and  bring about social instability.    5. A Diversified Mix of Shares. No other nation has as  diverse a mix of shares as China does, including state shares,  legal-person shares, foreign-funded shares, personal shares,  collective enterprise shares, internal shares, A shares, B  shares, H shares, so on and so forth. Simply put, the mix is the  product of both a historical reason (a plethora of state  enterprises) and the planned economy (foreign exchange control).  It would be unfair to blame a single factor exclusively. If this  problem is not resolved soon, it will inevitably delay the  regularization of the shareholding system, hurt the interests of  every category of shareholders, and hinder the two-way  circulation of funds. However, it will take technology and, even  more important, time, to straighten out this problem.    6. Primary and Secondary Markets. The practice of issuing an  unlimited number of share purchasing forms greatly reduces  speculation and profiteering opportunities on the primary and  secondary markets. Capacity expansion also renders the secondary  market stable and orderly. Such a development, we must say, is  normal. The past phenomenon of making a fortune overnight was  precisely a sign of the peculiarity of the Chinese stock market.  Accordingly, we should fully endorse the issue method on the  primary market and capacity expansion on the secondary market  and pin our hopes for the maturing of the stock market in the  country on them.    7. Tighten the Regulation of Stockbrokers. The stockbroker  plays a crucial role as a middleman. At present, however, some  stockbrokers are inefficient in their work, charge arbitrary  fees, and offer poor services, even lining their own pockets  with ill-gotten gains by taking advantage of the opportunities  provided by their line of work. Their practices have left the  shareholders profoundly dissatisfied and there are frequent  disputes between them. Thus it is most important to educate  stockbrokers to make them comply with discipline and obey the  law and improve the quality of their services. When a  stockbroker breaks the law, he must be dealt with strictly. To  protect shareholders' legitimate rights and interests, it is  proposed that a special agency be created to monitor the  stockbrokers and a telephone hot-line be set up on which a  shareholder can make complaints about a stockbroker.    8. Step Up Prevention Of Stock Market Crime. Stock market  crime has now become a new kind of crime in society. A typical  analysis of stock market criminals shows that they include  leaders equipped with the power to allocate funds, to review and  approve shareholding pilot projects, and to issue shares. For  this reason, tightening the authorization and control of funds,  reinforcing ideological education, improving all sorts of  systems, launching multiple-rights restraint, and even  conducting stock market general inspections regularly (annually,  for instance) are all effective ways to prevent stock market  crime.    9. Share ownership should go hand in hand with rights,  profits, risks, and responsibilities. The "five-tong" issue  ("tong gu," "tong quan," "tong li," "tong xian," and "tong ze")  has never been satisfactorily resolved. For instance, when an  arbitrary decision is made not to match state shares, the right  of the state as shareholder is lost. State shares and most  legal-person shares cannot circulate, which translates into lost  interests and heightened risks. The department in charge at the  higher level wilfully intervenes in personnel appointments and  dismissals, in the distribution of dividends, and in business  decision-making. This infringes upon the shareholders' rights  and constitutes irresponsibility. Every category of shareholders  must learn to operate in accordance with the principles of the  shareholding system.    10. It is undeniable that the stock market fever has much to  do with the fact that some enterprises only see the advantages  of raising funds by issuing shares. As long as money paid for  shares is there, they could not care less how the shareholding  mechanism works. In some cases, it has become a mere formality.  The shareholders' meeting, for instance, is held perfunctorily.  The selection of the board chairman and general manager is  prearranged internally. The board of directors has become a  dumping ground for cadres about to retire. Shareholders are not  consulted on major decisions and changes. Information given out  on the enterprise's performance is less than truthful.  Fund-raising takes place in the guise of share allocation and  shareholders are issued IOU's. If these practices continue, one  fears one will hear slogans calling for the revitalization of  shareholding enterprises very soon. It is proposed that the  board of supervisors of the enterprise fully discharges its  duties and responsibilities by promptly examining the company's  financial data, monitoring the managerial conduct of the  directors and manager, and correcting it regularly. The board of  supervisors must be chosen democratically, comprising only  shareholders with no leadership responsibilities. Furthermore,  units at the higher level must support shareholding enterprises  in transforming their mechanism and cannot wilfully or  coercively dismiss a company leader or disrupt its  decision-making and management. Departments in charge of staff  functions (tax, finance) should operate in accordance with  shareholding policies and not impose on shareholding enterprises  the standards appropriate to other enterprises. With the  enterprises and departments in charge working together, changing  the mechanism of shareholding enterprises will not be a problem.    11. Regularize the Way in Which a Shareholding Enterprise  Buys Up Another. The three incidents of shareholding enterprises  buying up one another in 1993 were both a shock and a wake-up  call to the agencies concerned, to companies whose shares are  being traded on the stock market, and to shareholders. What the  shareholding enterprises in the cases did was basically normal.  Due to inexperience, the individual companies made some  technical errors and were duly punished. It is normal market  behavior for a company which has shares being traded on the  stock market to purchase a particular stock through the stock  market. This is an effective way to acquire or merge with  another enterprise. But the purchasing process must be open. If  an excess is acquired, it must be made public. Information  disclosure must be prompt and the purpose must be constructive.  Acquisition is inherently an act of property transfer. It is  conducive to resource reallocation and reorganization and helps  enterprises enhance their competitiveness. However, the existing  policies, laws, and regulations governing enterprise acquisition  are too general, which does nothing to facilitate the process of  buying up an enterprise whose shares are traded on the stock  market. Thus detailed, practical, and orderly rules are badly  needed.    12. Crack down on bogus and inaccurate information. Both  shareholders and the stock market were badly burned by the  several incidents in 1993 involving bogus or inaccurate  information. Preventing the dissemination of such information is  essential to protecting shareholders and the stock market.  Accordingly, media that disclose information must operate  strictly in accordance with the "Implementation Regulations on  the Disclosure of Information Relating to Companies With  Publicly-Traded Shares." Violators should be sternly handled.  (Already some publications were disciplined in 1993.) Detailed  penal regulations must be formulated and people who fabricate  information must be severely punished. Information consulting  points should be set up everywhere to disseminate information  regularly and squelch bogus information.    13. The issue and circulation of state shares and  legal-person shares is inevitable. Whether you like it or not,  state shares were traded on several occasions in 1993. This  shows that it is only a matter of time before state shares are  traded and circulate on the market. For now we must promptly  decide who should be the agent for state properties to  accelerate the personalization of the trading of state shares.  No time should be wasted in formulating rules for the trading of  state shares so that there is a law to go by. The trading of  quasi-state shares, that is, legal-person shares, should also be  handled as described above. Managing the issue and trading of  these shares artificially by resorting to planned quotas would  not work. If state shares and legal-person shares are not traded  on the open market, rights and interests would remain stagnant  at the existing level and the state would then be stuck with the  risk. In the end, state properties would suffer.    14. Intensify Stock Market Risk-Consciousness. The  shareholding system in China is still in its infancy, with many  people having no basic knowledge of the system. They labor under  the one-sided view that one makes a profit the moment one buys  some shares and are hardly conscious of the risks involved.  Consequently they are more likely to feel distraught when they  lose money. Thus we must strengthen the shareholders'  risk-awareness even as we organize all sorts of lectures showing  people how to play it smart on the stock market and hire stock  experts to tell us their experiences.</p>

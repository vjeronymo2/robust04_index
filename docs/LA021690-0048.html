			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES : LA CIENEGA  </P> <P> Detritus of Culture: Innumerable paintings lumped together with word-puzzle  texts and deceased movie-star photos make Andrew Masullo's art as complicated  and self-contradictory as life, personal experience and the art world itself.  Along with his own simply lettered "message" paintings, Masullo obsessively  displays as his art an eclectic collection of scavenged images, framed and hung  meticulously on the walls a la Allan McCollum.  </P> <P> This detritus of culture is absorbed pretty much wholesale into his process via  the addition of a narrow vertical line of patterning or a block of solid color.  Then each piece is dutifully signed and numbered like entries in a crudely  efficient mental reference book.  </P> <P> This is not work that explains itself. Repeatedly, words and images bounce off  one another, breeding a sketchy kind of mental construct that questions as much  as it explains. Alongside tributes to Bette Davis and bright pink enshrined  photo enlargements of the artist are mirrors obscured by black painted  splotches, literary quotes that breathe with Angst and fancy framed canvasses  that dumbly read "Art." If meaning can be ferreted out of fragmentation by  sheer dogged questioning and repositioning, then Masullo has the modern system  for information assimilation by the tail. (Asher/Faure, 612 N. Almont Drive, to  March 10.) SUVAN GEER  </P></p>

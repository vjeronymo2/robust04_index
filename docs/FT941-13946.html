			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Television Despite the competition worries aired by the Office of Fair Trading, Mr Michael Heseltine is clearly keen to avoid referring any of the television sector bids to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. It would, of course, be extraordinary if he were to act otherwise, given that it was Mr Peter Brooke who lifted the regulatory obstacles to industry consolidation. Some fudge is therefore inevitable, and partial divestments may result. Doubtless, the definition of the television advertising market will be widened to include Channel 4 and satellite and cable. The Independent Television Commission has already sketched a temporary solution, suggesting that a combined Granada and LWT could own one advertising sales house and half of another as long as strict Chinese walls were in place. That, though, would hardly satisfy advertisers. Media buyers fear it would be difficult for sales houses to remain truly independent  - especially as LWT's sales house has been aggressively selling Yorkshire-Tyne Tees' air time against Granada's. One way to avoid conflicts of interest in advertising while permitting consolidation of franchise ownership would be to force ITV companies to sell sales houses to independent operators. That would also help clarify the real worth of TV franchises. Publisher broadcasters, at least, would simply own the right to a reasonably predictable fixed-term stream of income, dependent on the level of original franchise bid. Whatever the precise value, it would be nowhere near current bid levels.</p>

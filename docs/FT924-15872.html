			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Brazil on schedule with tariff reductions BRAZIL'S latest round of import tariff reductions took place on schedule yesterday, despite the paralysis of the government during the transition of power from President Fernando Collor, who faces impeachment proceedings on corruption charges, to Vice-President Itamar Franco. Average tariffs were reduced from 21.2 per cent to 17.1 per cent. No government action was necessary to implement the changes, made under a gradual scheme begun in 1990. The maximum tariff, for toys, fell from 65 per cent to 55 per cent. Vehicle imports will be subject to duties of 40 per cent, down from 50 per cent. Tariffs for petrochemical products dropped to 15 per cent from 20 per cent. New rounds of reductions are scheduled for January and July 1993. By the later date, average tariffs are to reach 14.2 per cent. However, opinions were divided about whether the opening of the economy would be continued under Mr Franco, or rolled back. Important national business interests, led by the National Confederation of Industry (CNI), are already lobbying him to slow the pace of import liberalisation. Similar pleas to Economy Minister Marclio Marques Moreira, soon to leave the government, fell on deaf ears. 'It is business people, not the left, who are going to put an end to the opening,' predicted Mr Jose Dirceu, federal deputy from the leftist Workers party (PT). 'Some sectors are still opposed to the plan, opposed to modernisation,' noted Mr Gilberto Galan, director of external relations for Kodak Brasileira. 'But I believe that Itamar won't change the schedule.' 'I am quite confident that it will continue, though maybe not at the same speed,' said Mr Lawrence Pih, head of Moinho Pacifico, a flour milling company.</p>

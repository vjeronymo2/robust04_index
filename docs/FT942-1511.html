			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / GE replaces top man at troubled Kidder Peabody General Electric yesterday replaced Mr Michael Carpenter as chairman and chief executive of Kidder Peabody, its troubled securities subsidiary, in a move intended to shore up sagging confidence in the firm on Wall Street. Mr Dennis Dammerman, GE's finance director, has taken over full-time management of Kidder. GE has also created the post of president and chief operating officer at the securities company for Mr Denis Nayden, an executive vice-president at GE Capital, the group's financial services arm. In a further attempt to restore confidence in the firm, Mr Jack Welch, GE's chairman, took the unusual step of announcing that Kidder was likely to report a loss of Dollars 25m-Dollars 30m for the three months to June 30. The firm has been beset by reports that it had taken far bigger losses in recent weeks on mortgage-backed bonds, a market which it dominates in the US. Mr Welch added that GE expected to report second-quarter earnings of Dollars 1.5bn. The management shake-up at Kidder comes two months after Mr Welch expressed confidence in Mr Carpenter and his management team in the wake of a phantom profits scheme which rocked the Wall Street firm. Kidder has claimed that the head of its government bond trading desk, Mr Joseph Jett, created fictitious profits of Dollars 350m to boost his bonus, although Mr Jett has said that he acted under instruction from senior Kidder executives. Mr Welch said yesterday's management changes were being made to demonstrate GE's continuing commitment to Kidder. The company came close to selling Kidder two years ago, and the recent troubles have led to speculation that it may try again to dispose of the business. 'Kidder's fundamentals are strong and we intend to provide whatever financial and human resources are appropriate for the firm to realise its potential,' Mr Welch said. British-born Mr Carpenter had also been appointed by Mr Welch to run Kidder after a troubled period at the firm. In 1989, when he was made chairman, the firm had been rocked by insider trading allegations and poor profitability after the 1987 crash. GE called Mr Dammerman's involvement at Kidder 'a transition role', and said he would return to his position as chief financial officer at the parent.</p>

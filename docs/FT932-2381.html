			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of North American Business Travel (6): Americans may also be provincials - Some tips for a happier and safer visit WHILE COMFORTABLY ensconced at the home office, be it London, Bonn, Tokyo or Paris, and looking at a map of North America, your business travel can look easy. Don't be fooled. But here are some tips to bear in mind to make it less vexing and safer. First, remember that the distances are always bigger than you think. If you believe that Minneapolis is just up the road from Chicago, think again. It is roughly a 1 1/2 -hour flight, and because there is less airline competition on the route the fare probably costs more than many transatlantic flights. And while Austin, Texas looks like just a short drive from Houston, it is 3 1/2 hours of solid freeway. Be prepared for a language barrier in the United States. Americans tend to believe that everyone should speak English and, outside major cities, relatively few speak a foreign language. Moreover, American regional accents can confound even English speakers. However, Spanish is widely spoken in the US South-west and Florida; and, of course, French rules in Quebec. AT&amp;T offers a special language line with a toll-free '800' number, which can be used for third-party interpreting by phone or translation of documents. Don't expect Americans to be cosmopolitan. Although the US is a world power, Americans can be shockingly provincial. As Joe Brancatelli, the executive editor of Frequent Flyer magazine, says: 'Good luck finding the World Service in St Louis.' Even at major hotels, staff may only vaguely know what the BBC is, and will not have the foggiest idea about its frequencies. American insularity can also make a mess of your trip. If in Atlanta, for example, and in need of sending a fax to Rome, be careful that it doesn't land in the small north-western Georgia city of the same name. Regarding travel arrangements, try to plan carefully, and make them in advance if you don't want to break your company's travel budget. Reasonable air fares can be had with some advance planning. But if your head office suddenly wants you to grab the next flight to Vancouver or Miami, they must be prepared for a huge bill. According to a 1992 survey of Frequent Flyer readers, most of whom travel for their jobs, some 42 per cent usually used discounted, advance-purchase coach tickets. Security is always a concern for travellers, but recently in the US it has become a serious issue. The most well known problems were in the Miami area, where several foreign tourists driving rental cars have been killed and attacked. If you hire a car, be sure to have clear directions and a map of how to arrive at your destination or hotel. Lock your car doors while driving, and do not stop for strangers or cars flashing theirs lights or bumping your fenders. If you need to stop for directions or for car trouble, go to a well-lighted public place, such as a gasoline station or a store. If you must leave suitcases or briefcases in the car while on the road, place them in the trunk (boot) and lock it. Also, do not wear expensive jewellery; do not display large amounts of cash or your hotel keys; use the main entrance of your hotel; and never open your room's door to someone unless you have verified with the desk who it is. Bring some type of health insurance certificate for international use. The US health care system is notoriously expensive, and even a brief stay in hospital will mean astronomical bills. A bed at a large hospital costs roughly Dollars 1,500 per day. If you should decide to take a holiday while in the US, perhaps extending your business trip, buy a special limited-time policy for travellers. The rate may seem high, but it is worth it. Carry a telephone credit card that is valid in North America. Hotels can tack on a very high surcharge for long-distance calls placed without one. If your plans require travel between New York and Washington or Philadelphia, take the train. It is faster, cheaper and more convenient than flying. Tipping is customary. Taxi drivers and waiters expect a minimum of 15 per cent, and 20 per cent or more would signal appreciation for a good job. Some restaurants include service, however, so be sure to check your bill. Smoking is prohibited in most US and Canadian public places and office buildings. If you smoke, it is best to check on where it is allowed. Most restaurants still have smoking sections, and some hotels divide their rooms into smoking and non-smoking. Smoking is prohibited on all US domestic flights. Try to pack light, and use a carry-on garment bag. If checking luggage, take a cautionary set of underwear, medications if you take them, a toothbrush, personal hygiene items and clean shirt or blouse in your hand luggage. Suitcases are too often lost or delayed. In late autumn, winter and early spring, going north to south in North America can unfortunately require two sets of clothes, for hot and cold climates. For business services, such as secretarial help, your hotel should be able to assist you with referrals. But for these practical business chores, as well as recommendations for restaurants and hotels, a travel guide-book such as Birnbaum's United States 1993 for Business Travellers is useful.</p>

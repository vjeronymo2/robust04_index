Up until now, the UN has always ruled out troops from  nations  bordering on the former Yugoslavia and the Balkan states taking  part in the UN Protection Forces (UNPROFOR). However, UNPROFOR  commander, General Michael Rose, this past week asked for new  reinforcements (at least 10,500 men) to help enforce the truce  at Sarajevo and to strengthen the protection of the security  zone.    The United Kingdom, which along with France, has provided  most of the some 12,000 UN troops currently in Bosnia,  reportedly stands ready to send in another 1,200 soldiers, but  on condition that other European states respond to General  Rose's call, these same NATO sources said. London has  reportedly proposed that bordering states like Italy and Turkey  send troops to relieve UN troops at other hot spots around the  world so they, in turn, can be sent to the Balkans. In this way,  some 5,500 UN troops could be freed to go to Bosnia, according  to British estimates.    Meanwhile, in Rome, Italian Defense Undersecretary Antonio  Patuelli, intervened in the debate Sunday by underscoring the  "strong validity" of the UN's determination to keep troops of  neighboring countries out the former Yugoslav territory. He  said he was certain that the United Nations should and would  continue to adhere to this line.    Italy is already doing its part by furnishing the air bases  for the UN initiatives and by taking part in the naval blockade  in the lower Adriatic, Patuelli said.    In Italy, as general elections move closer, the matter has  become a campaign issue.    General Luigi Caligaris, running for a seat in the Chamber  of  Deputies on the Forza Italia ticket, told a campaign rally in  Trieste today that he was sharply against the sending of Italian  soldiers to Bosnia as part of the UN force there, for both  practical and political reasons. Should a UN decision call for  Italian troops to be sent to Bosnia, it would be Italy's duty to  comply, according to Mario Segni, the Pact for Italy champion.    The leader of Democratic Alliance, Ferdinando Adornato  concurred, saying that the indifference to Bosnia so far shown  by the European states was a disgrace. However, the matter of  sending in Italian troops should be carefully weighed by both  Italy and the United Nations, he said, because of the difficult  history of relations between Italy and the Balkan states.    It is certainly an issue to be considered with great care,  agreed Environment Minister Valdo Spini during a campaign rally  for the Socialist Party in Ancona.    These thoughts were echoed by People's Party deputy Carlo  Fracanzani, chairman of the House Commission for Community  Policies. He noted the risk of producing "contradictory results"  for historical-political-geographical reasons.    However, any such initiative should be considered only under  at least four conditions, Francanzani said: 1) that the UN  overrides its general principle not to send in protection forces  from states neighboring on the trouble spots; 2) that all sides  to the conflict give their explicit assent; 3) that the Italian  contingent be given an exclusively logistical role; and 4) that  any such decision not be taken by the government alone but be  endorsed by the new parliament as well.    "If the United Nations asks us it will be useful and  opportune to deploy Italian Blue Helmets to Bosnia," said  Roberto Formigoni, the coordinator for the People's Party in  Lombardy today.    The president of the Venezia Giulia and Dalmazia  Association,  Lucio Toth, Sunday said that as exiles those in his organization  knew from direct experience the high level of conflict that  exists among Croats, Serbs and Muslims and for this reason are  very concerned about any intervention of Italian troops in  Bosnia, even though "we call for a more active political role  for Italy in finding a solution to the crisis."    He pointed out that tens of thousands of Italians live along  the Istrian-Dalmation coast and could well fall hostage to  various warring forces in the field.</p>

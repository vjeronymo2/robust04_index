			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH: SPIRITED DEBATE OVER WHAT TO DO AFTER A QUAKE  </P> <P> My daughter-in-law's humanitarian foresight in adding a bottle of cognac to our  earthquake kit has brought mixed comment about booze and disasters in general.  </P> <P> Lois R. Koch of Santa Maria doubts that a snifter of the genuine French article  would sharpen my senses in dealing with the emergencies caused by the Big One.  </P> <P> "Just how aware and in contact with what is going on around you would you be  with the liquor in your system?" she asks. "I assume during and after an  earthquake you would want your senses to be as sharp as they could be so you  could deal with whatever situation you are in."  </P> <P> There is no argument against Mrs. Koch's thesis. One ought to face up to any  emergency sober. However, I think she goes too far in her interdiction:  </P> <P> "I have admonished you before about your liking for a drink in order to enjoy  the view, the country or whatever else you are doing at the moment. . . .  Because I think so much of you I want you to be in total control in any given  emergency or difficult time."  </P> <P> Still, I can hardly ignore that sort of concern, and I promise Mrs. Koch that  when the Big One comes I won't touch the cognac until after my wife has shut  off the gas valve and taken whatever other security measures one must take.  </P> <P> As for Jay L. Ambrose's recollection that during the 1921 Pueblo (Colorado)  flood the government passed out free bourbon to its victims, I am corrected in  my assumption that, since Prohibition was then the law of the land, and  distilling spirits was illegal, the government must have drawn on confiscated  supplies of contraband.  </P> <P> Not so, according to Lawrence S. Dietz, whose father was in the business; when  Prohibition came in, many distillers had large stocks of bottled-in-bond  spirits in warehouses labeled "for medical purposes only." Rather than put such  valuable public assets to the ax, our humane bureaucrats saved them for such  disasters as Pueblo.  </P> <P> Col. Edward J. Costello recalls that he was a 6-year-old in Pueblo when the  flood struck. "At the age of 6, there was no reason why I should have been  aware of the suspension of Prohibition for the 30-day period. Yet, for me,  there is an odd twist to this unusual moratorium. The story was that for many  weeks after the flood there was no potable water available, and the workers  involved in the cleanup were forced to drink whatever was available while on  the job. Some years later my father was forced to resign from the Santa Fe  because of a 'drinking problem' and the family came to believe that it all  began with the aftermath of the flood. . . ."  </P> <P> Surely that sad tale reflects the wisdom of Mrs. Koch's warning.  </P> <P> Dirck Z. Meengs of Westlake Village recalls that the distillation of whiskey  and other spirits "for medicinal purposes" was allowed during Prohibition.  Small amounts could be obtained from drug stores by prescription. (Doctors must  have been as much in demand as bootleggers.)  </P> <P> Even after Prohibition ended, Meengs says, "my father's parishioners would  explain the presence of alcohol in their homes during his visits as being 'for  medicinal purposes only,' accompanied by a sly grin."  </P> <P> Georgia Seibert of San Francisco reports that on Oct. 17, 1989, at 5:04 p.m.,  she was stranded in the underground at Powell Street Station.  </P> <P> "Before the first aftershock, at approximately 5:45 p.m., I was poured three  glasses of Chandon Brut in The Compass Rose in the lobby of the Hotel St.  Francis on Powell Street. I was not charged for the champagne.  </P> <P> "Moses, a gentleman patron of The Compass Rose, had told me on a previous  occasion that the room had survived the fire/quake of 1906. With the help of  the Chandon Brut, we survived the aftershock nicely that day also."  </P> <P> You see, in San Francisco they know what to do after an earthquake.  </P> <P> At the foot of her letter, Mrs. Seibert notes that she sent a copy of it to  Herb Caen, the bard of the San Francisco Chronicle. I'm sure it didn't tell him  anything he didn't already know.  </P> <P> I must confess that after I discovered the cognac in our earthquake kit, I  opened it and took a snort just before retiring. Helps one sleep.  </P> <P> Surely Mrs. Koch can't have any objections to that.  </P></p>

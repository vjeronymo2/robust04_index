			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Muharrem Sarikaya: "First Official Contact With </F> Iraq"]    [Text] Ankara--The Turkish Grand National Assembly passed  the government bill on the extension of the Hammer Force mandate  yesterday. Meanwhile, the government conveyed a message to the  Baghdad administration informing it that Ankara is prepared to  receive a delegation from Iraq headed by an under secretary.  Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin said: "They have asked for talks  for a long time. We have responded to their request. The  matter is not very important. The question of the oil pipeline  between the two countries will be discussed."    According to Foreign Ministry circles, for a long time the  Baghdad administration had asked Turkey at every opportunity to  agree to an official visit. However, considering the UN embargo  on Iraq, Ankara has rejected the request so far.  <H5>  The Oil in the Pipeline Will Be Withdrawn </H5>   The Foreign Ministry officials have said that the main topic  at the talks with the visiting delegation, which will be headed  by an under secretary, will be the pipeline. They recalled that  Prime Minister Tansu Ciller convinced the U.S. Administration  when she visited the United States of the need to withdraw the  oil in the pipeline between Karkuk and Yumurtalik and said:  "The only problem on the matter is the question of sharing the  oil that will be withdrawn from the pipeline. The UN officials  have proposed that the sides concerned each receive one-third of  the oil in the pipeline. However, we have proposed that Turkey  receive 50 percent of that oil. We shall discuss the matter  with the Baghdad administration. Iraq maintains an approach in  Turkey's favor. We are trying to convince the UN officials to  agree. The United States is involved in the matter. Meanwhile,  the UN secretary general's decision has to be considered. If he  agrees, then Turkey will receive 50 percent of the oil in the  pipeline."    The officials also said that the developments in northern  Iraq will be discussed with the visiting delegation. They  asserted: "We have said at every opportunity that Iraq must not  be divided. We shall outline our views on the developments in  northern Iraq and the need for Baghdad's compliance with the UN  resolutions."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bangkok -- Thailand has affirmed the liberalization  of the kingdom's money market, but there will be some limitation  on foreign banks operating as Bangkok International Banking  Facilities [BIBF], said Tharin Nimmanhemin, Finance Minister.    Tharin said he will affirm the proposals at the coming GATT  meeting to be held in Morocco on April 12-15. Foreign banks  will be allowed to open only 5 branches in 1997 as BIBFs in  Thailand, Tharin said. Tharin said the GATT talk will seek  agreement on trade issues which could not be resolved in the  last meeting. He said as a representative of Thailand he will  confirm the same proposals which were raised in the last GATT  meeting. The minister disclosed Thailand will allow some part  of the monetary market to be open to foreign banks.    Tharin said Thailand will allow foreign banks to open only  five branches to conduct BIBF business in the country within  1997 and will specify the commercial banks which will benefit  Thailand most.    Apart from that, the Finance Ministry will consider the  relaxation of some regulations used for foreign commercial  banks, such as the regulations for services.    For instance, foreign commercial banks will be allowed to  install ATMs, and given the right to form joint-ventures with  Thai companies in the businesses of financial and securities  companies.    "I believe that we will be the one country to propose the  free monetary market most at the GATT meeting in Morocco and the  proposals are larger than the limitation of GATT on the issue,"  Tharin said.</p>

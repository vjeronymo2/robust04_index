			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Televised debates to go ahead EC AMBASSADORS yesterday voted unanimously to accept television cameras into three EC ministerial debates next Monday and Tuesday in Luxembourg. Their vote follows the vetoing of three requests earlier this month by the current Danish presidency of the EC, for the broadcast of debates on global warming, transport policy, and the common fisheries policy. Belgium, Luxembourg and Portugal were the main objectors. Monday's and Tuesday's televised debates will cover the opening of negotiations on Norway's entry to the EC; how to make the internal market work, and the role of trade unions and employers in shaping a strategy to create jobs. Denmark is fighting hard to demonstrate to its own people that the EC is opening up its secretive decision-making to public scrutiny, in a bid to sway Danes who voted against Maastricht last June to endorse it in a second referendum due on May 18. The Commission also distanced itself from a public relations report, commissioned after the Edinburgh summit and published yesterday, which calls for the centralisation of EC information policy.</p>

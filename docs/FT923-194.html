			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / International Company News: NZ denies it had Fletcher offers MRS Ruth Richardson, the New Zealand finance minister, yesterday denied she had received a number of offers in June to buy the government's 104.5m shares in Fletcher Challenge, the country's leading forestry group. Mr Michael Cullen, opposition Labour finance spokesman, had earlier said the government received offers valuing its stake at NZDollars 400m (USDollars 215m)now worth about half this figure. 'The government's lack of action has cost the taxpayers NZDollars 200m,' he said. Fletcher Challenge shares have come under sustained selling pressure since they hit a 1992 peak of Dollars 3.80 in June because of concern over its high debt level, and whether it would be able to sell assets in the current market. Investors are also concerned over the company's loans to its employee unit trust, which controls 12 per cent of its capital. Under arrangements with banks, the company must top up loans by NZDollars 1m for every cent the share price falls below NZDollars 2.30. Its shares dropped a further 9 cents yesterday to NZDollars 1.91, a six-year low. Mr Cullen said the government had received a number of offers for the shares, which would have netted it approximately what they had cost. The government paid NZDollars 3.83 a share last March for its stake as part of a complex deal agreed in 1988 when Fletcher Challenge bought the state-owned resources group Petrocorp. It paid NZDollars 3.83 a share in March. However, Mrs Richardson told parliament the government had received 'no serious offer' for the shares. Of the offers made to treasury none could be considered 'firm'. One had been a faxed message from Ord Minnett, the New Zealand firm of brokers, which gave the government only three hours to accept, she said. This would have been unbusinesslike, she added.</p>

			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Revenue staff urged to end overtime ban TAX STAFF have been recommended by their union to end their overtime ban and 'work-to-charter' after concessions from the Inland Revenue on a disputed performance-pay system. Members of the Inland Revenue Staff Federation voted early in December by more than 3-1 to concentrate on tasks of immediate benefit to the public, in the spirit of the government's Citizen's Charter, rather than those of benefit to the Revenue. The 'work-to-charter' started in the middle of last month and was backed at the end of the month by an overtime ban. Mr Clive Brooke, federation general secretary, said there had been enough progress in talks on the performance-pay system for the union to recommend suspension of the action until talks were completed. He warned, however, that his executive's recommendation to suspend the action might not be heeded by staff. They will start voting on the issue on Friday. Federation members felt aggrieved that the performance-pay system for the Revenue had tougher performance conditions than systems used in other parts of the Civil Service. For example, tax staff categorised as merely satisfactory were given nothing. The Revenue has now agreed to give a one-off Pounds 300 payment to workers who have been categorised as satisfactory for five years or more. Talks will now take place on whether such staff will also receive an annual award. The union also says the Revenue has agreed to make its system of performance classification more open and to recruit an extra 600 staff to help deliver the tax element of the Citizen's Charter. Mr Brooke said: 'We have not got everything we wanted, but a few important breakthroughs have been made and there is now a more level playing field.' The existing performance pay systems throughout the Civil Service are due to be replaced after March 31. The new systems are likely to increase the element of performance pay in total pay packages and to extend individual contracts farther down the Civil Service hierarchy.</p>

			<p><P> November 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 EX-CAPTIVE FRENCH SOLDIERS FLY HOME  </P> <P> Three French military personnel captured recently near the Saudi-Iraqi border  while on a scouting mission arrived in Paris early Sunday after Iraq handed  them over to the French Embassy in Baghdad, officials said.  </P> <P> The three, a captain and two noncommissioned officers, were in a jeep on a  reconnaissance patrol when they bumped into Iraqi troops. No shots were fired,  the French army said.  </P> <P> "It is not clear yet if they will face charges and punishment for allowing  themselves to be captured," a French diplomat in the Middle East said.  </P> <P> The incident, a week ago, embarrassed Paris when Iraq revealed it Friday and  then said it was freeing them in appreciation of a special relationship with  France.  </P></p>

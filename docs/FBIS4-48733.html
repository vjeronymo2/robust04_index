			<p>BFN     [Text] Talks between Angola and Brazil on bilateral  relations ended yesterday. The Brazilian delegation, headed by  Ambassador Jose Aparecido, left Angolan yesterday. Earlier,  Angolan Finance Minister Alvaro Craveiro, who took part in the  talks, said negotiations with Brazil are on right track. He  said a degree of understanding has been reached and further  meetings have been scheduled to smooth the edges.    [Begin Craveiro recording] The negotiations go beyond mere  financial relations. The negotiations are linked to petroleum  issues and a number of financial facilities, in addition to the  problem of Angola's debt. There is a degree of understanding  and we are on the right track to settle that issue. [end  recording]    The Angolan minister noted that bilateral trade exchanges  have not yet been formalized, though they are being considered  as part of wide-ranging cooperation.    [Begin recording] [Craveiro] Such relations have not yet  been  formalized. They are being considered as part of wide-ranging  cooperation. We will hold further meetings in the near future  to formalize such relations.    [Reporter] Has agreement been reached on the rescheduling of  the debt?    [Craveiro] Well, that is a [words indistinct] element. [end  recording]    Jose Aparecido de Oliveira says his country has opened a  credit facility to pay for the supply of medicines and  foodstuffs.    [Begin Oliveira recording] It has already been agreed. We  took the initiative of informing Minister Craveiro and the  Angolan delegation that President Itamar Franco has recommended  the Bank of Brazil to open a credit facility for the supply of  foodstuffs and medicines to Angola. Actually, that is the first  time for Brazil to take such an initiative. There were no  recent impediments on the part of Brazil regarding the supply of  perishables. It is the first time that that has happened. It  is something new. [end recording]    Trade exchanges between the two countries amount to some  $200  million.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kepala Batas, Sunday [26 June] -- The Government is  unaware of a plan by a local non-governmental organisation to  hold a forum on East Timor in Kuala Lumpur, Foreign Minister  Datuk Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said today.    He emphasised that the Government was not involved and would  not give its blessings to the organisers.    "Our stand on the East Timor issue is clear. It is an  Indonesian problem and it is up to the Indonesian authorities to  resolve it," he said.    Abdullah was talking to reporters after attending the Bertam  UMNO [United Malays National Organization] branch meeting which  he heads.    He said the move to initiate such a forum was bound to occur  as Malaysia practiced a democratic system that allowed freedom  of speech.    "But we are hopeful it will not complicate the strong  relationship between the two countries," he added.    According to the ANTARA news agency from Jakarta yesterday,  Indonesia had expressed displeasure over the forum planned by  the Malaysian Action Front.</p>

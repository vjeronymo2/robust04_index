			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Observer: Gold digger British inventors, arise - you have nothing to lose but your overdrafts. Sir Anthony Bamford, chairman of JCB - manufacturer of the ubiquitous yellow earth-digger - is considering offering venture capital to assist British inventors and entrepreneurs who need backing for practical, innovative projects in design and engineering. Sir Anthony, a champion of all things British, will also plough in the considerable back-up skills of his company in marketing and distribution. He says there is a nucleus of knowledge and skill - and a modest pot of gold - at JCB. All of which might just set a young British inventor on the road to success  -so emulating 'Mr JCB,' his father Joe Bamford.</p>

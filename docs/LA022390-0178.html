			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> IRS CITES FOXX EXPENDITURES  </P> <P> Comedian Redd Foxx was paid $500,000 for his role in the movie "Harlem Nights"  and spent $373,000 of it on "wine, women, song and gambling," the Internal  Revenue Service says.  </P> <P> Such expenditures make it unlikely that the IRS can reach agreement with Foxx  on his tax troubles, IRS attorney Rollin Thorley told a federal bankruptcy  judge Thursday.  </P> <P> Foxx, who gained fame playing a junk dealer on the TV show "Sanford and Son"  and who now performs at a Las Vegas resort, filed for protection from creditors  under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy law in 1983. He owes the IRS more than  $900,000 in taxes, penalties and interest.  </P> <P> The earnings on the recent movie were revealed as Foxx appeared in court to try  to block a public auction of more than 400 items of personal property seized in  an IRS raid in November.  </P> <P> The items, including his Las Vegas home, several cars and jewelry, were to be  sold last month. The sale was delayed while a federal judge tried to decide  whether the IRS or the bankruptcy court had first claim on the property.  </P> <P> Bankruptcy Judge Clive Jones ordered the property seized by the IRS to be held  "in limbo" for 60 days while lawyers try to reach agreement.  </P> <P> Foxx failed in bids to block the IRS from seizing his paychecks for back taxes.  </P></p>

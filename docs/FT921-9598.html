			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Gateway plans up to 3,000 job losses GATEWAY Foodmarkets, the supermarket chain, is planning to make up to 3,000 people redundant, the Usdaw shopworkers' union claimed last night. Gateway said that it was planning to cut the equivalent of 2,000 full-time jobs from its 43,000 workforce. The company said sales were down at the halfway stage and since then the 'trading pressures have not abated'. It added: 'We are talking about a combination of a freeze on overtime, a freeze on recruitment, an additional shift from full-timers to part-timers and some redundancies.' The precise cuts will be decided at store and local level at the end of the month, but the move to more part-timers is aimed at allowing higher staffing at peak times for 'an improved level of service together with gains in productivity'. The company criticised the union for making what it described as an 'irresponsible' political decision to announce the cuts. 'Jumping the gun is only going to cause apprehension among staff,' it said.</p>

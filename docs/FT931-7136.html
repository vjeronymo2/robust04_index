			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Spending power in UK below EC average BRITISH people's real spending power fell well below the average of continental Europeans in 1991, according to Eurostat, the EC statistics office in Luxembourg. The UK thus joined Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Greece at below the average per capita income of the Community - but without being poor enough to get the heavy funding earmarked for these member states to enable them to catch up. Nevertheless, the European Commission proposed on Wednesday that the Merseyside and Highlands and Islands regions of the UK be made eligible for the highest levels of EC regional aid. These are devoted to Europe's most backward areas - and put the two UK regions on a par with the south of Italy, Spain and Portugal, western Ireland and northern Greece. Eurostat calculates that gross domestic product (GDP) per head in the UK in 1991 was 95.5 per cent of the EC average, based on purchasing power parities. This is obtained through adjusting GDP by the ratio between prices for comparable goods in different countries. In 'real' or purchasing power terms, therefore, the UK income per head in 1991 was Ecu14,732 (Pounds 12,168.63), against an EC average of Ecu15,432. Top of the list was Luxembourg at Ecu19,636 per head, followed by Germany (Ecu18,345), and France (Ecu17,250 per head). Italy as a whole was substantially above the UK at Ecu15,890 per head. Of the four poorest countries below the average line, Spain, the best off, is well below the UK at Ecu11,964 per capita - or 77.6 per cent of the EC average - with the very poorest, Greece, at Ecu7,397, or 48 per cent, according to Eurostat. In international terms, no individual EC country exceeds the average US per capita income of Ecu20,847, at 1991 purchasing power standards, and only Luxembourg and Germany exceeded Japanese income levels of Ecu17,941. The explanation for the British plunge in relative purchasing power was that in 1991, UK GDP contracted by 2.2 per cent, according to Eurostat, against average EC growth of 1.8 per cent.</p>

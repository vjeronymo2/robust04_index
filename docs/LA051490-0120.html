			<p><P> May 14, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: FLUORIDE HELD UNLIKELY TO INCREASE BREAST CANCER RISK  </P> <P> Question: Seven years ago at menopause, I was told by my doctor to start taking  Florical (calcium carbonate and sodium fluoride). It is supposed to keep my  bones from getting brittle and to keep me from getting stooped over.  </P> <P> Now I have read that fluoride might cause cancer. Two of my sisters have had  breast cancer -- my twin died at 35, and my younger sister had her breast  removed 11 years ago.  </P> <P> I am worried about doing anything that would increase my risk of cancer. Is the  Florical a problem?  </P> <P> Answer: Fluoride has been in the news recently because a study for the National  Toxicology Program turned up a rare form of bone cancer in some of the rats  getting high doses of fluoride in their water. Scientists are uncertain how  this may apply to humans, so further studies are in order.  </P> <P> It is extremely unlikely that the fluoride you are taking would increase your  risk of breast cancer, but there is little likelihood it is protecting your  bones from osteoporosis. New research indicates that fluoride treatments do not  prevent fractures in post menopausal women.  </P> <P> There is, however, an experimental treatment for osteoporosis that looks very  promising. A Danish study recently found that women taking Didronel  (etidronate) had stronger bones and fewer fractures than those on a placebo.  Perhaps it is time to discuss your osteoporosis prevention program with your  physician.  </P> <P> Q. My grandson, age 10, has frequent urinary infections. My daughter would like  to able to check his urine when she suspects there is a problem.  </P> <P> I remember reading in your column about a test that can be done at home. My  pharmacist didn't know anything about it. What is the name of the product, and  will she need a prescription?  </P> <P> A. Microstix-Nitrite Reagent Strips or Biotel u.t.i. home screening tests for  urinary tract infections are available without prescription. These little  strips change color when dipped in a urine sample. Such home tests can be  helpful in alerting a parent to the need for treatment.  </P> <P> Q. I've been taking Mevacor to lower cholesterol for two years. Not long ago I  read that after 15 months on Mevacor, a person should have a liver biopsy. When  I asked my doctor about this, he said there was no need for it. He does a blood  test on me twice a year.  </P> <P> Now I am afraid of this drug. Do I need to have my liver tested or is my doctor  right?  </P> <P> A. The risk of liver damage from Mevacor (lovastatin) is low. Nevertheless,  blood tests (not a biopsy) should be performed every four to six weeks during  the first year and a half of treatment.  </P></p>

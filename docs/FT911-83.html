			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / B&amp;Q appeal starts THE House of Lords yesterday began hearing the case in which the DIY chain B&amp;Q is seeking to establish that the Sunday trading laws in England and Wales are no longer valid. B&amp;Q is appealing against a High Court ruling last July. It is arguing that the 1950 Shops Act, which restricts the goods that can be sold on Sundays, has been superseded by European free-trade laws. The hearing continues tomorrow.</p>

The talks were aimed at reaching a new trade  framework between the two countries with attention focused on  improving American access to Japan's auto and auto parts  markets, an official at the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry [MITI] told a press conference.    The official declined to disclose the contents of the talks,  saying both parties agreed to keep silent for now. But he  described the atmosphere of the meeting as "friendly but  serious."    After emerging from the meeting, Kantor told reporters the  talks were "interesting."    After the press conference, another MITI official said the  trade stance by both Tokyo and Washington basically remained  unchanged throughout the meeting, hinting that the two nations  failed to bridge a gap over the framework talks.    The Kumagai-Kantor meeting followed talks held earlier in  the  day between Kantor and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, results of  which were also withheld in a briefing for reporters.    Kantor arrived in Tokyo on Tuesday in an effort to break a  stalemate in the bilateral trade talks ahead of the February 11  summit between Japan's Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S.  President Bill Clinton.    The most contentious part of the new framework is how to  define "objective criteria" as a way to gauge foreign  penetration of Japan's market. Tokyo says it is against any  setting of numerical targets as it would lead to managed trade,  while Washington is pushing for a framework based on an accord  reached between Clinton and then Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi  Miyazawa in July 1993, which called for the introduction of  "sets of objective criteria, either qualitative or quantitative  or both."    The official at the briefing said Kumagai and Kantor are  unlikely to resume talks during Kantor's stay in Japan. It is  not known when Kantor will leave Tokyo.    He said he is not certain whether or not subcabinet-level  trade talks between the two countries will be held over the  weekend as reported.</p>

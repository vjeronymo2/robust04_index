"There should not be unilateral measures under the framework  of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade," the official  said.    He criticized Kantor for making "inappropriate" comments in  the middle of Japan-U.S. trade framework negotiations.    Kantor told Japanese reporters in Washington on Wednesday  that revival of the clause is "an option" for the United States.</p>

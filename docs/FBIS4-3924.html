			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Resolution Adopted by the Second Session of the Eighth </F> Anhui Provincial People's Congress on 12 April 1994 Concerning  the Work Report Submitted by the Anhui Provincial People's  Congress Standing Committee"]    [Text] The Second Session of the Eighth Anhui Provincial  People's Congress has examined the work report submitted by the  Eighth Anhui Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee.  The report was presented by Vice Chairman Shao Ming on behalf  of the Eighth Anhui Provincial People's Congress Standing  Committee. The session maintains that the Standing Committee,  in light of the requirements adopted in the resolution of the  First Session of the Eighth Anhui Provincial People's Congress,  has earnestly discharged its constitutional and lawful  responsibilities and made new headway in all sectors on the  basis of the work accomplished by the Seventh Anhui Provincial  People's Congress Standing Committee. The work accomplished in  1993 as summarized in the report is factual, and the assignments  set for this year are realistic and practical. The meeting has  decided to approve the report.    The meeting maintains that the Standing Committee should  continue to adhere to the guidance provided by the party's basic  line as well as by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics; should follow through  with the guidelines laid down by the 14th party congress, the  Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the  Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress, and the  10th Plenary (Enlarged) Session of the Fifth Anhui Provincial  Party Committee; and should earnestly implement the party  Central Committee's basic principle for this year's assignments.  Focusing on economic construction, the Standing Committee  should consider it its basic task to promote socialist democracy  and build a legal system; should exert positive efforts in  discharging all its constitutional and lawful responsibilities  and authority; and should obey and serve the prevalent  requirement of "seizing opportunities, deepening reform, opening  up wider to the outside world, expediting development, and  maintaining stability" so that its role as a permanent  organization of the local state power organ can be brought into  full play. The Standing Committee should consider it its top  priority to intensify economic legislation, to display the  spirit of reform, to promptly and efficiently draw up local laws  and regulations, and to earnestly implement the province's  five-year plan for legislation. The Standing Committee should  intensify its supervision over the implementation of laws and  other work, attaching special importance to inspecting and  supervising law enforcement so as to safeguard the dignity of  the law and uphold the authority of the law. The Standing  Committee must continue to intensify the publicity and education  of the legal system so the public will become more law  conscious. It should forge closer ties with the deputies and  the people, build the Standing Committee into a stronger body,  work earnestly, and proceed with an exploratory spirit so as to  make new contributions to Anhui's reform, opening up, and  modernization.</p>

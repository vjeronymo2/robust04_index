			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / International Company News: Euro Disney faces claim for unpaid accounts EURO DISNEY, the US theme park operator, was yesterday facing a claim for FFr850m (Dollars 157.4m) in allegedly unpaid accounts from 16 disgruntled French building contractors. The group, due to open its 5,000-acre leisure complex east of Paris on April 12, emphasised that it expects to settle practically all the claims amicably. It stressed that negotiations of this kind are not surprising in a project of this size - the largest of its type in Europe  - it is estimated the complex will swallow FFr35bn by the time a second theme park is open on the site in 1995-96. A Euro Disney spokesman said the claims were 'outrageous and exaggerated' and deplored the threats by the contractors to try to stop the opening of the park. The row is unwelcome publicity so soon before the opening. Euro Disney's share price slipped FFr2.20 to FFr146.30. The French building contractors, a small minority of the 700 companies working on the site, have formed an action group to present their demands, but they have not yet resorted to joint legal action. The companies leading the group, which also represents 300 sub-contractors, are Chagnaud, CGCE, Torno and Gabo. Euro Disney said it was reaching the final stages of the first phase of the project, including handing over and inspection of the works, in which it and the contractors were drawing up accounts for any extra sums to be paid to contractors for modifications during the contracts. Nestle, the Swiss food company, confirmed that it had wanted to bid for Source Perrier, the French mineral water leader, but was thwarted by Italy's Agnelli family, Reuter reports. 'I can confirm we had the intention of making an offer for Perrier,' a Nestle spokesman said. However, the hold the Agnelli family had built up over Perrier now made it 'impossible for that intention to be realised'.</p>

Submission of Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. The Rollover Crash Problem  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rollover crashes occur for many reasons, and involve the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interaction of a variety of factors including the driver, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> roadway, the vehicle, and environmental conditions. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relationship of these various factors to rollover crashes can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be examined by analyzing data from various sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency estimates that there were 220,000 rollover  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> crashes involving passenger cars, and multipurpose passenger  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles and trucks under 4,536 kilograms (10,000 pounds)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gross vehicle weight rating (collectively, ``light trucks'') in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1991. These resulted in 9,186 fatalities; 56,000 occupants of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these vehicles received serious, incapacitating injuries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These numbers have remained relatively constant over the past  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> six years. Ejections are responsible for 63 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fatalities. Safety belts are used by only 13 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fatally injured occupants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the 220,000 rollover crashes, 207,000, or 94 percent,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were single vehicle crashes and 192,000 of these, or 93  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent, occurred off the road. Various accident studies have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicated that loss of vehicle directional control is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prelude to rollover in 50 percent to 80 percent of all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rollover crashes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the years 1985&hyph;1991, small cars had the greatest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of rollover fatalities, followed by standard-size  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pickup trucks. However, pickup trucks and sport utility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles have fatality rates per million registered vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between two and three times as great as that of passenger  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cars. The difference between the numbers of rollover  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fatalities and the rollover fatality rates for particular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle types is a result of the relative proportions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> various types of vehicles in the fleet. There are currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> many more small cars than pickup trucks and sport utility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles on the road today.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A more extensive discussion of rollover statistics, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the sources for this information, can be found in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Addendum to Technical Assessment Paper,'' NHTSA 1994, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is in Docket No. 91&hyph;68, Notice 03.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II.

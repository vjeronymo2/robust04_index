			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POLICE COMMITMENT STIRS APPRECIATION  </P> <P> On June 26, officer Tommy De La Rosa was laid to rest. I didn't know him that  well. Those who did used phrases such as "tough cop," "tender family man,"  "loyal friend and police officer."  </P> <P> He was eulogized as a "good cop" committed to the welfare of others and the  enforcement of the law.  </P> <P> Peace officers swear an oath that involves the possibility of death -- they  place the community's welfare above their own.  </P> <P> Our society's support of individual freedom and self-determinism is a magnet to  many in the world community. Though it is difficult, we constantly seek a  balance between individual rights and majoritarian rights (public protection).  </P> <P> Where millions of people coexist, the law defines the boundaries of individual  freedom. Peace officers enforce these laws -- laws that allow us freedom yet  restrict the infringement by others on that freedom.  </P> <P> Police officers are cohesive force in our community -- laws and their  enforcement make our quality of life possible. Peace officers help to hold our  society together.  </P> <P> After attending Tommy De La Rosa's memorial service, I was impressed by more  than the familiar presence of authority. As the son of a retired Fullerton  police officer, I've known cops all of my life. During the grieving and  mourning, men and women -- as bighearted and human as any I've known -- said  goodby to a fellow officer and reaffirmed their commitment to their duties.  </P> <P> I appreciate that commitment, as do many others.  </P> <P> DAN SCHAUPERL  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P></p>

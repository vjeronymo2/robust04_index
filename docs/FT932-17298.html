			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Test case over ICI shares ICI said yesterday that it was trying to clarify the legal situation surrounding the status of shares issued as a result of its planned demerger and the creation of Zeneca, a new publicly listed company. Trustees with ICI shares may find that the Zeneca shares are regarded as income of a trust rather than as capital, which will cause problems for trustees having to balance the distribution of income for the life tenant against the need to preserve the capital for those entitled to it after the life tenant's death. A test case, assisted by ICI and brought by solicitors Berwin Leighton, is expected to be heard later this month with a judgment expected in early May.</p>

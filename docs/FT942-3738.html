			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Hopes rise for EU-Russia pact Hopes of wrapping up a new political and trade agreement between the European Union and Russia rose last night after European foreign ministers came within an ace of resolving the remaining obstacles. Barring last-minute reservations from the Netherlands, ministers rallied round an agreed text which keeps alive Greek plans to host President Boris Yeltsin at next week's European summit in Corfu. At the Luxembourg meeting, ministers were seeking to respond positively to a Franco-German call for the EU to agree on measures to reform Ukraine's nuclear industry and meet part of the cost of shutting the Chernobyl reactor. President Leonid Kravchuk is expected to sign a new partnership agreement with the EU in Luxembourg tomorrow, a sign of a more even-handed EU strategy toward Ukraine and Russia. The EU-Russia pact has been beset with difficulties, but divisions have narrowed to Russia's treatment of foreign banks and how the EU handles Moscow's exports of enriched uranium. Equally sensitive is Mr Yeltsin's demands that he personally sign the agreement. He has refused to initial it, even though Brussels has warned it may be hard to translate the texts into the requisite 10 languages in time for Corfu. On foreign banking, Mr Yeltsin announced a new decree last Friday which appeared to ease fears that western banks would be subject to strict new capital requirements. The Dutch, with two banks in Russia, want to see proof in writing and have therefore reserved approval of the final treaty text. The picture on uranium exports improved after France obtained safeguards to protect its position as a leading supplier to the rest of the Union. Yesterday, the European Commission was able to satisfy reservations by Portugal which has a small uranium industry. Nuclear safety in Ukraine will be high on the agenda of the Group of Seven industrialised nations in Naples next month. As the international outcry over Chernobyl has mounted, Ukraine raised its price for shutting it from Dollars 2bn to Dollars 14bn. A Commission official said the EU was seeking to balance its interest in promoting Ukraine's policy toward energy self-sufficiency - which includes building five new nuclear reactors - with the need to shut down Chernobyl.</p>

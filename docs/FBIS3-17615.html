			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Simferopol, 26 March -- The Ukrainian Civil Congress  of Crimea, the Crimea with Ukraine committee, the Party of  Crimea's Economic Revival, and the Crimean-Tatar National  Movement Organization published a joint statement in connection  with the upcoming poll of Crimean citizens. The statement says,  in particular: "... Paying no attention to the fact that the  president of Ukraine has revoked Clauses 1 and 2 of Article 2 in  Yuriy Meshkov's decree on conducting a poll of Republic of  Crimea citizens on 27 March 1994, as counter to the Constitution  and the laws of Ukraine, the poll is about to be held under the  pressure of chauvinist forces. We consider a poll on the issues  referring to the jurisdiction of Ukraine's Supreme Council as a  step towards dangerous confrontation in the relations between  Crimea and the central power bodies, as a call for continuing  separatism. The poll will not be conducive to the ideas of  interethnic concord, friendship and mutual trust, and to  resolving the problems of the Crimean-Tatar people, but will  become a serious weapon in the political struggle and will lead  to even greater deterioration of the situation in Crimea.  Moreover, any poll without the participation of native  Crimeans, the Crimean Tatars, cannot be regarded as valid. The  poll's initiators aim to distract attention from the critical  situation, from the economic and social problems... The fact of  conducting a poll itself ... is pushing the people of Crimea  towards a dangerous borderline.    "Therefore, we who stand firm on the foundations of unity  between Crimea and Ukraine, appeal to Crimeans against taking  part in the poll and urge local executive power bodies to  strictly adhere to the Constitution and the laws of Ukraine."</p>

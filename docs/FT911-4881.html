			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Senior Soviet industrialist sees bluer skies ahead THE Soviet Union's senior industrial figure yesterday broke with newly-established Soviet tradition and professed optimism about his country's future, write John Lloyd in Tokyo and Leyla Boulton in Moscow. Mr Arkady Volsky, president of the Science and Industrial Union which groups the heads of major enterprises in the Soviet Union, told industrialists in Tokyo that output in the semi-privatised sector of the Soviet economy had risen by 4.5 per cent in the first quarter. 'It should be a matter of some joy that this is happening,' he said, stressing that this was an unofficial view. The semi-privatised sector involves enterprises operating on leases or on a co-operative basis, and is thus the closest to private enterprise. Its rise compares with a 10 per cent drop in state sector output. Mr Volsky said the new managers of Soviet enterprises were often young and talented. 'It's a young power structure that's coming up, and they think they can do something. There is a left and a right in our country  - but there is a third force, and that is the directors of the enterprises. That is the real force.' Conceding that 'if you look at the situation in our country today, any company would be cautious', he nevertheless maintained that 'this is the best time to do business there . . . . We have the cheapest real estate. You must enter the Soviet market today'. Mr Volsky, whom some see as the next prime minister, has forged his association into a powerful lobby. It contributes significantly to new legislation on industrial and enterprise matters, including the law on entrepreneurship and the forthcoming laws on privatisation and investments which will allow foreigners to own 100 per cent of companies set up in the Soviet Union. He said the anti-crisis plan, to be introduced shortly by Mr Pavlov in the Supreme Soviet, was relatively unimportant. 'We have lots of programmes: the point is to get some action going.' The domestic turmoil in the Soviet Union continued yesterday as Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia, leader of Georgia, issued his first presidential decree to call for a co-ordinated civil disobedience campaign across the southern republic. Mr Gamsakhurdia is trying to force the Kremlin to withdraw troops from the strife-torn enclave of South Ossetia and to grant Georgia independence. He has already managed to trigger a republican-wide rail strike to back these demands. The Soviet parliament, meeting in closed session, was yesterday reported to have given preliminary approval to a bill outlawing political strikes, in a bid to help crush the industrial action engulfing the country. Independent unions from all over the Russian Federation are due to gather in Moscow today to consider a one-day strike on April 26 to express solidarity with the economic and political demands of striking coal miners.</p>

			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Tribunal is not best means of resolving City abuses Sir, Lord Alexander of Weedon, in his address to the 1994 Commercial Bar Association, suggests the collapse of the second Guinness trial (among others) gave 'rise to a sceptical view of the City' ('Bank chief presses for City battle on crime', June 16). He goes on to advocate a tribunal of City regulators without juries to deal with 'market abuse'. Lord Alexander can be forgiven for his relative inexperience in the City and for his lack of knowledge of the facts of the Guinness trials; indeed I wonder if he is aware that what he recommends is exactly what occurred in those trials. Unknown to all but a few, a 'Roskill' type tribunal was convened in December 1988 with a distinguished QC as chairman or judge and two equally distinguished lay assessors drawn from the senior ranks of City lawyers and accountants. The purpose of this tribunal was to hear an appeal under the then Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act 1958 from an order of the secretary of state removing the dealing licence from a registered licensed dealer who dealt for me in a number of transactions. Included in these transactions was the so-called Guinness transaction with which I was later to be indicted on charges of 'creating a false market' and 'breaching S151 of the Companies Act 1985'. The evidence and judgment of this tribunal were kept secret by the government for some three years (for reasons that will become abundantly clear) and not revealed to the defence in the second Guinness trial until forced out of the prosecution on the evening of the 54th day (the last working day before Christmas 1991). This fundamental and utterly relevant evidence showed that the 1988 tribunal had found that no false market had been created and no breach of S151 had been effected. Evidence under oath had been taken from the then director of the Takeover Panel (something that did not happen in the first Guinness trial). What is still, to me, surprising is that this evidence had not been disclosed to the inspectors investigating the Guinness affair nor to the Bank of England - both were in total ignorance, apparently, of this judgment and its affiliated evidence. I am satisfied that, had this evidence been made available to the first Guinness trial, it too would have collapsed and none of those defendants would have been convicted. The scandal of the Guinness trials lay in the almost total ignorance of City mechanisms displayed by the trial judge and prosecution barristers in fundamental areas such as stock exchange regulations and the Talisman settlement system. Indeed, in so far as the Takeover Code was concerned, the trial judge was to interpret these rules himself with no regard to established precedents. He even went so far as to rule that the stock exchange definition of a 'false market' was quite incorrect. Lord Alexander should not be so sure that his system would come up with the 'right' result - he might well be surprised. Spens, Gould, Frittenden, Kent TN17 2DT</p>

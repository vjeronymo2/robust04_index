			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: ICI warns of Pounds 30m in charges IMPERIAL CHEMICAL Industries yesterday warned it might incur a further Pounds 30m in exceptional charges this year following difficulties in its indirectly-owned Argentinian PVC manufacturer. The shares edged down 7p to 682p as analysts reduced their forecasts for ICI's annual results due out in February from about Pounds 258m to Pounds 228m. The market had already factored in restructuring provisions of between Pounds 60m and Pounds 70m. The latest charges arise from the decision to wind up Electroclor, one of Argentina's leading quoted companies which has been hard hit by the dismantling of trade barriers in 1991. Shares have fallen from a high of Dollars 14 in recent years to 59 cents last night. The company, which is 60 per cent held by the ICI subsidiary Duperial, has incurred losses estimated at about Pounds 10m a year since 1991. Electroclor has been hampered by high raw material costs and has been unable to compete with cheaper PVC imports, mainly from the Gulf states. ICI said yesterday that the directors of Electroclor had recommended that shareholders consider a liquidation of the company. A meeting would be held within the next 30 days. Analysts in London welcomed the announcement as further evidence of ICI's refocusing.</p>

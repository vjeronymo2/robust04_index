			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Reorganisation moves help put L&amp;G Pounds 74m back in black LEGAL &amp; GENERAL, the life assurance group, reported a turnround to pre-tax profits of Pounds 74m in the first half to June 30, from a Pounds 56.1m previous loss. The shares added 24p to 323p. There was some disappointment that the group failed to increase its interim dividend. The unchanged figure of 6.2p was paid from earnings per share of 11.58p (11.8p loss). Two exceptional factors buoyed the profits. The UK investment business was transferred to the life fund, producing an exceptional profit of Pounds 31.5m. Also, the restructuring of the US subsidiary's investment portfolio, meant that investment gains of Pounds 12.1m were realised, up from Pounds 2.4m. The general insurance business cut its operating losses from Pounds 116m to Pounds 33m. Lower subsidence claims and the absence of severe weather conditions were the main factors. Interest centred on the mortgage guarantee insurance business, which has depressed the group's performance and share price for the last two years. The loss on this business was reduced to Pounds 26.4m (Pounds 88.9m). However, provisions against losses were raised to Pounds 185m (Pounds 158m). Mr David Prosser, chief executive, urged further base rate cuts. COMMENT It is easy to see why Legal &amp; General wants base rates back down to 8 per cent in the hope of triggering a recovery in the housing market. Its shares are trading off a historic yield of about 8 per cent, suggesting that the market is treating it as a composite insurer, rather than a life company. Its exposure to mortgage indemnity insurance is the culprit. Analysts are happy that L&amp;G's policy on reserves for losses on the business has been much more conservative than some of its rivals. Its loss rate has also been lower than others. But re-rating is unlikely until the housing market stages an unambiguous recovery. On the positive side, L&amp;G has halted the slide in its market share for general life products - once the significant market for with-profits bonds is excluded - and streamlined its distribution channels. Nonetheless, forecasts for its full-year profits range widely, suggesting the stock should be treated cautiously until prospects for recovery are clearer.</p>

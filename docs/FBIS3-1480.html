Lewis] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg March 28 SAPA -- The Azanian Peoples  Organisation [Azapo] on Monday blamed the mayhem in Johannesburg  earlier in the day on the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP], saying  its members should return to their senses.    It added, however, that the African National Congress was  also to blame for the general political rivalry as both it and  the IFP did not adhere to the democracy they often preached.  "The IFP has acted irresponsibly and cowardly by killing  innocent black people, especially children and pensioners. The  power struggle between the IFP and the ANC is causing many black  lives to be lost. What they are doing is not benefiting black  people but dividing them," said Azapo Central Wits  [Witwatersrand] region Chairman Jeff Seitshiro.</p>

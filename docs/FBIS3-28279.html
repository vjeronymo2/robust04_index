			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Revised Points in Political Reform </F> Bills"]    [Text] One cannot deny the feeling that the revisions  agreed to at the 28 January Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa-Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] President Yohei Kono  summit on substance of the political reform bills have distorted  the bills' original intent to establish a political system based  on the political parties' charaters and policies. This is a  product of bargaining on interests between the ruling and  opposition parties. Meanwhile, the first election to be  conducted under the new system is not likely to come until next  year even when the revised bills are passed at the next regular  session of the Diet.  <H5>  Zone Apportioning </H5>   At LDP's demand, the number of people to be elected from the  single-seat districts was raised to 300 while reducing the  number elected from the proportional representation to 200. The  outcome will probably mean increased "reflection of popular  will" and increased "possibility of choosing new government,"  but, for the LDP, this means less likelihood of the incumbent  Diet members being excluded from hometown constituencies and  being forced to "run in foreign countries" [constituencies].    As far as the coalition parties are concerned, it is clear  that they will benefit if they join hands and put up only one  joint candidate to counter a candidate fielded by the LDP. In  future, it is possible that political world reorganization  toward a two-party system will speed up.    Once the reform bills are passed by the next regular session  of the Diet, the focus of attention will shift to the  apportionment of the single-seat districts. The prime minister  will recommend seven members to the Electoral District  Demarcation Review Council, and the members will be formally  appointed with the approval by the Diet. The Review Council is  expected to come up with its draft on apportionment of districts  and to make a recommendation to the government within six  months. Based on the recommendation, the government will draft  the "Electoral District Law" and submit it to the regular  session of the Diet next year. Enactment of the law is not  likely to come until late next year.    When the LDP's Kaifu government prepared its political  reform  package, it proposed giving three months for the enforcement of  the law, but the Ministry of Home Affairs at present thinks such  educational period is not necessary in view of the six-month  period the Review Council will have to come up with its draft on  the district apportionment. All that taken into account, the  new election system will still not be ready until next year at  the earliest.  <H5>  Proportional Representation </H5>   The system adopted is a product of compromise between the  government proposal to count proportional representation votes  with the nation as a single constituency and the LDP proposal to  count proportional representation votes on a regional basis with  all metropolis and prefectures as separate blocks. The system  divides the whole country into 11 blocks, which is the same  number of blocks recommended by the Eighth Election System  Review Council in 1990. For the LDP, this is an arrangement  which enables its members, who will be excluded from single-seat  districts [and will have to run on the proportional  representation tickets], to maintain some "ties with their  regional bases."    With the blocks of the proportional representation having  become smaller in size, larger parties have more to gain than  smaller parties do. For smaller parties which could have gained  more seats if votes for the parties had been counted nationally  as a whole, this arrangment means a tougher hurdle to cross.    The anticipated zoning of the 11 blocks and the number of  seats assigned to them are as follows (based on the 1990  recommendation by the Eighth Election System Review Council):    Hokkaido = 9; Tohoku covering Aomori, Iwate, Miyagi, Akida,  Yamagata, and Fukushima prefectures = 16; Kita-Kanto covering  Ibaraki, Tochiki, Gunma, and Saitama prefectures = 21;  Minami-Kanto covering Chiba, Kanagawa, and Yamanashi prefectures  = 23; Tokyo = 19; Hokuriku-Shinetsu covering Niigata, Toyama,  Ishikawa, Fukui, and Nagano prefectures = 13; Tokai covering  Gifu, Shizuoka, Aichi, and Mie prefectures = 23; Kinki covering  Shiga, Kyoto, Osaka, Hyogo, Nara, and Wakayama prefectures = 33;  Chukoku covering Tottori, Shimane, Okayama, Hiroshima, and  Yamaguchi prefectures = 13; Shikoku covering Kagawa, Tokushima,  Ehime, and Kochi prefectures = 7; Kyushu covering Fukuoka, Saga,  Nagasaki, Kumamoto, Oita, Miyazaki, Kagoshima, and Okinawa  prefectures = 23.  <H5>  Corporate Donations </H5>   While the original government-proposed bills sought to ban  donations by corporations and business organizations to  politician- representing agencies, the revision will allow each  politician to designate one political agency to receive such  corporate donations -- up to 500,000 yen a year -- even though  all donations of more than 50,000 yen (at present, 1 million  yen) will be required to be made public. It can be said that  some progress has been made where transparancy of political  funds is concerned.    But there are said to be some "loopholes." For instance, if  the names of existing politician supporting groups [goenkai] are  changed into chapters of party youth departments or women's  departments, these groups can continue to receive corporate  donations. "Donations with strings attached" -- donations to  political parties, specifying the politicians to receive the  donations -- are also thought to be possible as are under the  current law.  <H5>  Public Subsidies for Parties </H5>   While it may be something the two top leaders did not  intend,  some new problems are arising with respect to the bills -- from  the perspective of the spirit of, and compatibility with, law.  One of them is that the justification for collecting public  subsidies of 250 yen per head nationally -- or a total of 30.9  billion yen -- has become even more ambiguous than before. The  government initially justified the collectiion of the subsidies,  saying they will "take place of corporate donations." But now  that corporate donations of up to a certain amount have been  admitted, it is likely that demands for lowering the subsidies  will rise.    On the other hand, because vote counting in the proportional  representation will be done on a regional basis, it will become  difficult for small existing parties and newly formed parties to  get their people elected. Consequently, it is likely that  demands on revising the "impediment clauses" -- providing  qualifications for political parties and requiring candidates to  deposit 3 to 6 million yen in security [with the government] in  order to prevent many splinter parties from arising -- will  arise as well.</p>

The sources told AL-HAYAH that Talal al-Hasan, minister of  state for foreign affairs, had summoned the Iranian ambassador  and informed him of the Jordanian request to reduce the number  of Iranian diplomats at the embassy as a result of the attack on  the Jordanian ambassador's house some two months ago. The  sources pointed out that among the other reasons for the  Jordanian request is that the number of Iranian diplomats in  Amman "exceeds by far the number of Jordanian diplomats in  Tehran."    Well-informed sources have said that there are more than 30  Iranian diplomats in Amman, compared with three Jordanian  diplomats in Tehran. It was not possible to learn the name of  the Iranian ambassador in Amman. When AL-HAYAH contacted the  embassy, the employee on duty told AL-HAYAH to contact the  embassy again on Saturday because he did not have the authority  to reveal the ambassador's name. The authoritative sources said  that the Jordanian Government "was not satisfied with the way  Iranian authorities handled the attack on the Jordanian  ambassador's house." They pointed out that the ambassador's  house in Tehran was burgled two months ago. The sources also  emphasized that Jordan has been seeking to improve relations  with Iran since diplomatic relations were restored in 1991, 10  years after their severance following the breakout of the  Iraq-Iran war.

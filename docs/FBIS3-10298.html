Meanwhile Fernando Egana, deputy minister of the secretariat  of the presidency, said "the government hopes the local  community's many sectors and especially the business sector will  exercise common sense and a sense of responsibility and support  the measure implemented by the government, which is aimed at  inspiring greater security and confidence in the country's  economic recovery."    The deputy minister added that the decision to suspend  economic guarantees is not "one of ideology but of practicality,  given the serious economic and financial circumstances the  country is experiencing. It is the Executive Branch's duty to  deal with the situation and to take safe and prompt action."    The business sector's negative reaction contrasts with the  reaction of the consumers because, according to the government  spokesman, "the measure has been very well received by the  Venezuelan people in general, who hope the government will act  responsibly and look after the people's interests, especially  those involving the VAT [Value Added Tax], which is an unfair  and regressive tax." This opinion was supported by a poll  conducted by the official news agency VENPRES.    Egana likewise denied that foreign investors may be affected  by the new measures, going on the assumption that to provide  security in this area, in the midst of the difficult situation  the country is experiencing, "the government must have  extraordinary powers."    Regarding the duration of the suspension of economic  guarantees, Egana warned that it will be restored "as soon as  possible" after economic recovery is achieved. Meanwhile,  President [Caldera] stressed during his speech on the 20th  anniversary of the National Experimental University of Tachira,  that the government will send to Congress a tax reform bill  whereby the VAT will be replaced with a tax on luxury items,  income taxes will be increased, and taxes will be imposed on  "certain wholesale transactions."    Regarding the financial system's precarious condition,  President Caldera has warned that "at present, through the  Finance Ministry and other presidency offices, we are  maintaining a very fluid relationship with the commissions that  are working on the subject so that the situation created by the  Banco Latino crisis and the threats on the financial system may  be resolved harmoniously with the cooperation of various  branches of government."</p>

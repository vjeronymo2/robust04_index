BRIEFING;  </P> <P> SHEARSON TO TRIM COMMISSIONS;  </P> <P> MONEY-STRAPPED SHEARSON TO TRIM STOCKBROKER COMMISSIONS  </P> <P> Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. is cutting stockbrokers' commissions for the first  time in 15 years, the investment company confirmed today.  </P> <P> The portion of the commission that a broker gets for selling investment  products, called the payout rate, will be trimmed by 1 to 2 percentage points  in 1990, Shearson spokesman Michael O'Neill said.  </P> <P> Shearson, the country's second-biggest securities firm after Merrill Lynch  &amp; Co., has been contemplating trimming the payout rate by 4 to 5 percentage  points over the next four to five years, O'Neill said.  </P> <P> The average Shearson retail broker brought in commissions of $228,000 this  year, and Shearson paid out 46.5% of the total back to brokers and their  supervisors in direct payments, employee benefits and deferred payments.  </P> <P> The reduction in the payout rate is intended to increase revenue at Shearson,  which is facing a threat from Moody's Investors Service Inc. to lower the  investment rating on its commercial paper.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GETTING ALONG ON THE ROAD  </P> <P> Bad road habits only worsen the already contentious relationship between  cyclists and motorists. Here are a few complaints from each camp.  </P> <P> Bicyclists hate when motorists:  </P> <P> * Suddenly make right turns across bike lanes without so much as a glance over  their shoulders for cyclists cruising along next to them.  </P> <P> * Back out of driveways without looking for bike traffic.  </P> <P> * Suddenly open driver's side doors into bike lanes (often done after a  motorist has slowly cruised in a bike lane looking for a parking space, forcing  cyclists to brake or stop).  </P> <P> * Cruise up a few feet behind cyclists and blast their horns to announce their  presence -- or just for the fun of it.  </P> <P> Motorists hate when cyclists:  </P> <P> * Blow through stop signs and red lights into heavily traveled intersections,  without even pausing to look for traffic.  </P> <P> * Ride abreast or in large groups, spilling out of bike lanes and taking up  roadways.  </P> <P> * Ride against traffic, especially on roads with no bike lanes.  </P></p>

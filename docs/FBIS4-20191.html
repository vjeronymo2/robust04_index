			<p>BFN     [Text] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said the  Albanian Government's decision not to reduce the number of  staffers at the Greek Embassy in Tirana is considered to be a  positive development. For this reason, he added, the Greek  Government did not make a corresponding reduction of Albanian  diplomatic personnel in Athens. The spokesman made this  statement in response to a question on the status of relations  between Greece and Albania before the meeting between the  foreign ministers of the two countries, Karolos Papoulias and  Alfred Serreqi, on 3 May in Geneva.    Venizelos also referred to the recent statements by Albanian  officials, which have contributed to the artificial tension. We  do not pay attention to these statements, he said, because we  wish for the improvement of Greek-Albanian relations; we are a  country that accepts a large number of Albanians who, either  legally or illegally, work in our country; and we feel our  responsibility as a country trying to achieve stability in the  Balkans.    Finally, the government spokesman said that respect for  international law and the rights of the [Greek] minority in  Albania does not depend on the meeting between Papoulias and  Serreqi, and its outcome.</p>

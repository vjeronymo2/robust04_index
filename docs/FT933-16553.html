			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Argentina aims to cash in on mineral wealth: Law changes designed to attract investors to under-explored areas ARGENTINA OWNS half the mineral-rich southern Andes but its mining industry accounts for a mere 1.5 per cent of its GDP. Unlike Chile, which owns the other half of the southern Andes and has built up a multi-billion dollar mining industry, mining in Argentina has never caught on. Political instability, unpredictable shifts in government policy, complex and xenophobic regulations have actually discouraged mining. For instance, the Andean border region was declared a security zone and closed to foreign investment, while exports were taxed. The government says this is all changing, however, with the approval a few weeks ago of new investor-friendly mining laws that it hopes will open up Argentina's vast and under-explored interior to local and especially to foreign companies. These new laws follow Argentina's introduction four years ago of free market reforms that have transformed the country into one of the fastest-growing economies in the region. The government is offering mining companies a generous tax regime that includes a promise not to change the tax structure of investment projects for 30 years and allows them to import machinery duty free. Companies can write off all their exploration costs against future corporate tax once a project begins generating profits. The laws will also allow companies to set up free trade zones in which remaining tax and import restrictions will be waived. The intention is to attract international companies based on the Chilean side of the Andes to cross into Argentina. Argentina badly needs to attract foreign investment because it lacks home-grown mining expertise. As a result of the endemic indifference to mining, only 17 per cent of its territory has been adequately surveyed. Major mining companies began sniffing around Argentina well before the new mining policies came into effect. The government's mining secretariat reports that 20 companies, nearly all of them foreign, have already committed USDollars 103m in investments to study 64 mining projects. This may be small change by international standards, but it represents a hefty capital influx for an industry that turns over barely Dollars 400m a year. Argentina's great attraction is its virgin geology and consequently the chance of finding major undeveloped deposits with quick payback periods. Some, like Canada's Musto, claim they have already found highly attractive properties. Musto is working on an 18-month, USDollars 7m feasibility study of what it claims to be an exceptionally rich, world-class gold deposit in the Andean foothills. The company says the Bajo de la Alumbrera deposit is 'one of the largest proven unexploited porphyry copper/gold deposits in South America'. It believes the deposit could produce 140m lb of copper and 200,000 ounces of gold a year for 20 years. Mr Jorge Jones, Musto's Argentine general manager, says that if Musto takes up an option to develop Bajo de la Alumbrera, the project will need at least Dollars 450m in investments and would therefore require co-financing from other joint venture partners. The mining secretariat says international companies have at least four other major gold, copper, lithium and potassium projects under consideration, which would be worth over Dollars 500m in investments if taken beyond their present exploration stages. Argentina is so anxious to attract investment that the government has even reassured companies that they have little to fear from its feeble environmental laws. At an international mining conference in Denver in June, Mining Secretary Angel Maza was quoted as saying: 'We would not think of subordinating the interests of development to those of the environment'. Despite its fiscal and geological attractions, Argentina is far from becoming a mining paradise. To start with, its geology is less favourable than Chile's, where rich mineral veins are closer to the surface and therefore cheap to mine. And companies already operating Argentina, like RTZ affiliate Minera Aguilar, which produces lead, silver and zinc close to the Bolivian border, are losing money because prices are low, while their costs are high. Operating costs are high because the currency is overvalued, labour productivity is low and inputs are overpriced. For example, Aguilar has to import items ranging from explosives to spare parts because locally-made products are so expensive. Finding financial backing for mining projects is both difficult and expensive. Local banks are unwilling to lend for long periods, while international banks are unhappy lending for mining projects in a country with little mining tradition. Deficient infrastructure also adds heavily to development costs. Roads and power supplies, especially in remote mountain locations are inadequate. Transport and port facilities are also poor, although the government has recently privatised the rail network and drastically reduced port charges. The government is also negotiating with Chile a series of agreements which would enable companies operating in Argentina's sector of the Andes to buy Chilean electricity and ship minerals to Chilean Pacific ports. Not only are Chile's ports closer, but its road and rail network is far superior to Argentina's. But Mr David Ancieta, Aguilar's executive director, says he is optimistic that Argentina is overcoming what was once seen as its greatest single deterrent - political turbulence. 'There is a determination to change and I think that Argentina will become a politically stable country,' he says. 'Periodic adjustments to economic policy will be necessary, but there is confidence that Argentina will stay with these economic policies.'</p>

This information was released by  Finance Minister Julio Cesar Rodriguez after the Council of  Ministers meeting, which was held at the Presidential Palace,  ended. He observed that the taking over of Venezuelan private  banks by the government was not proposed at the meeting.  Rodriguez added that the Council of Ministers decided to  appoint a management council to reinforce the  government-appointed administration council, renew the Banco  Latino's assets, improve communications between the bank and the  people interested in Banco Latino's recovery process, and  identify the people who led the bank to its current critical  situation.    Finance Minister Julio Cesar Rodriguez said the National  Executive had also decided to implement measures that will  guarantee the liquidity and standard operations of the entire  banking system. This, he said, will require that the private  financial sector increase its allocations to Fogade [Deposit  Guarantee Fund] from 0.25 percent to 1 percent of the public's  total deposits. The government will also bolster Fogade's  assets, speed the process to exchange the organization's assets  in order to increase its liquidity, and reorganize Fogade. The  Executive will also strengthen the supervision of financial  institutions once the General Bank Superintendency and Fogade  have been reorganized and their management changed, he said.    [Begin Rodriguez recording] The government alerts citizens  to  rumors aimed at increasing the unease and social uncertainty  created by the Banco Latino crisis. The measures to strengthen  assets, provide liquidity, improve management, and increase  effective supervision assure the normal operations of the  banking system and guarantee that people's savings will be  secure. [end recording]    Additionally, the finance minister commented that the  Council  of Ministers will take up the tax issue next week. He added,  however, that the general income tax will be implemented this  year if it is approved by Congress. The income tax reforms, he  said, will go into effect in 1995.</p>

			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lead prices steady as two more smelters cut output TWO MORE lead smelters announced production cuts yesterday, forced on them by prices that in real terms are the lowest on record. Analysts pointed out that, in recent weeks, refined lead producers had ordered annual cuts of between 160,000 and 200,000 tonnes, and such moves were bound to have an impact on market sentiment and prices before long. 'Western lead producers have finally capitulated. They are having to stand aside to make way for metal from the former eastern bloc,' said Mr Nick Moore, an analyst at Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group. However, yesterday the market seemed unimpressed as Nuova Samim, the Italian state-owned group, said it would close its Portovesme smelter for two months at a cost of 30,000 tonnes of production, and MIM Holdings, the Australian company, said it would cut 3,000 tonnes from output by shutting secondary (scrap) furnaces at its Britannia Refined Metals plant in Northfleet, UK. On the London Metal Exchange, lead for delivery in three months closed at Pounds 267.50 a tonne, up only Pounds 1.75, and that rise almost exactly reflected the day's fall in the value of sterling against the US dollar. Mr Moore suggested: 'The market is sometimes a bit of a dinosaur. You bite its tail and it takes a while for the message to reach the sharp end.' He pointed out that the price was equivalent to roughly 18 US cents a pound  -well below the 30 cents required to encourage new production capacity. 'This is an anomaly that can't be sustained.' In recent weeks, lead smelter production cuts have been made in Canada by Cominco, in France and Germany by Metaleurop and Metallgesellschaft, in Sweden by Boliden and in Japan by a number of companies. Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, insisted that cuts in lead production were likely to have an impact much more quickly than cuts in zinc. 'When demand from the US replacement battery sector begins to pick up over the next few months, we might well start to see the lead market tightening, particularly in the US,' he said. 'Although there might not be a marked resurgence in prices, we are certainly less pessimistic for lead in the second half of this year than we are for zinc or, indeed, for other base metals.' Last year, the lead market was shocked by a huge increase in net imports from the former eastern bloc, up from 63,000 to 173,000 tonnes. The rise left the market with a 163,000 tonnes supply surplus, according to the International Lead and Zinc Study Group. In the first quarter of 1993 there was a surplus of nearly 50,000 tonnes.</p>

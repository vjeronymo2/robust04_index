			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Ireland to build up its industrial base THE Irish government is to reorganise its Industrial Development Authority (IDA) - which spends about IPounds 120m (Pounds 114m) a year in grants and subsidies to overseas and local manufacturing companies - to give more emphasis to the development of Irish industry. Mr Des O'Malley, industry and commerce minister, said this week the reorganisation followed criticisms in an industrial policy review published earlier this year that Ireland had become over-dependent on foreign-owned enterprises in developing its industrial base. 'The balance needs to be redressed to achieve greater output and employment growth in the indigenous sector. Existing policies and promotional arrangements have not succeeded in doing this,' he said. He announced the IDA was to be merged with two manpower training agencies - FAS and EOLAS - and would then be split into two divisions, one promoting overseas investment and the other promoting local industry. Each would have its own boards and management, budgets and performance targets. The intention was to develop 'a clear and separate focus of policies and organisational effort on the promotion of both indigenous industry and inward investment'. Mr O'Malley also emphasised the need to adopt other recommendations made under the policy review, which included sweeping tax reform, increased emphasis on vocational training, and more investment in transport infrastructure. The recommendations have yet to be considered by the government.</p>

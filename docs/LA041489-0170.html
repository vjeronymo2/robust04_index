			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U. S. TAKES OVER LINCOLN S &amp; L;  </P> <P> SEIZURE FOLLOWS BANKRUPTCY FILING BY PARENT FIRM  </P> <P> Just one day after its parent company filed for bankruptcy, federal regulators  seized Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn. today because it had  "dissipated its assets through violations of regulations and laws."  </P> <P> The thrift's management, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board said, "appeared to  operate Lincoln mainly for the benefit of (its parent company, American  Continental Corp.) at the expense of (Lincoln)."  </P> <P> The thrift's 29 Southern California offices remained open, and depositors can  transact business as usual. Deposits up to $100,000 are insured by the Federal  Savings &amp; Loan Insurance Corp. Lincoln has total deposits of $4.4 billion  in 176,323 accounts.  </P> <P> An oversight team led by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. began operating  the $5.5-billion thrift at 7 a.m. today to "minimize losses, limit growth and  ensure that operations are conducted in a safe and sound manner."  </P> <P> Investors who own about $200 million worth of bonds may, however, lose some or  all of their money as a result of American Continental's filing Thursday for  protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws.  </P> <P> The company sold the bonds to customers in Lincoln's branches.  </P> <P> Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, which represents about 85% of American's assets,  was not included in Thursday's bankruptcy filing. But federal regulators said  the filing did include substantial assets in subsidiary operations of Lincoln.  </P> <P> American Chairman Charles H. Keating Jr. said he filed for bankruptcy after  federal regulators demanded he relinquish control of Lincoln.  </P> <P> American Continental has tried to sell Lincoln three times since last year.  Federal regulators opposed the latest plan to sell Lincoln for $200 million to  a group of investors led by John H. Rousselot, a former congressman from  Arcadia, because the offer did not include sufficient cash.  </P> <P> Rousselot, named Lincoln's chairman earlier this week, resigned today,  regulators said.  </P> <P> The bank board named F. Roger Clark to serve as Lincoln's chief executive.  Clark ran Montfort Savings in Dallas after it was seized by regulators.  </P></p>

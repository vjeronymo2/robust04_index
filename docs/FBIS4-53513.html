			<p>BFN     [Text] Japan and the United States are set to hold vice  ministerial talks on 19 May to discuss ways to resume the  stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. The vice  ministerial talks will focus on coordinating the views of the  two countries on tax cuts, the implementation of a new  macroeconomic policy, and the establishment of objective  criteria to measure the openness of the Japanese market, which  the United States has set as preconditions for resuming the  stalled framework talks. The vice ministerial talks are likely  to broadly examine Japan's compromise proposal that objective  criteria apply only to the government procurement sector.  Meanwhile, working-level talks also are expected to coordinate  views of the two countries in an effort to have the stalled  framework talks resumed prior to another round of Japan-U.S.  summit talks scheduled for July.    The government has sent Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy minister of  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Suzaburo Okamatsu, deputy  minister of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI], to Washington to attend the vice ministerial talks.  They will hold talks with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey  Kantor and Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Barshevsky to  discuss ways to resume the stalled framework talks. The  Japanese officials intend to make specific requests of their  U.S. counterparts concerning three preconditions the United  States has set for resuming the stalled framework talks, and  then present them with Japan's response. They also intend to  present a flexible macroeconomic policy to their U.S.  counterparts and then feel out their response.    Their focus is to seek out a compromise on the establishment  of objective criteria. President Clinton has definitely said,  "the United States will not seek any numerical targets."  Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Kakizawa has stated, "it is  necessary to set some quantitative criteria that do not actually  result in establishing objective criteria." The Japanese and  U.S. negotiators will discuss the possibility of establishing  such quantitative criteria to expand the access of foreign  manufactured goods and services to the Japanese market.    Of three sectors at issue -- government procurement,  automobiles and auto parts, and insurance -- the Japanese  negotiators are likely to present U.S. negotiators with a  proposal for applying quantitative criteria toward the  government procurement sector. Regulations on foreign access to  the government procurement sector have been largely relaxed, and  it is highly possible that both Japan and the United States can  reach an agreement on this sector. The Japanese negotiators  intend to urge their U.S. counterparts to make concessions by  proposing a "phased formula" under which the criteria will be  gradually applied to the insurance sector and the automobile and  auto parts sectors.    Regarding macroeconomic policy, the Japanese officials will  explain to their U.S. counterparts that Japan will continue  cutting income taxes after 1995 and then seek their  understanding of Japan's plan. The U.S. Government fears that a  delay in breaking the deadlock between Japan and the United  States could trigger a fall in the international value of the  dollar and a rise in long-term interest rates. For that reason,  the United States is softening its tough trade stance toward  Japan. Japan intends to listen to "real" U.S. trade demands  from U.S. officials and exchange information with the United  States to examine whether those trade demands are acceptable.</p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Protest and celebration awaiting Arafat in Gaza Strip 'In the name of God the compassionate, the merciful - brother citizen please help to clean the streets and whitewash the walls for the visit of our leader.' Palestinians in Gaza hurriedly picked up broom and paintbrush yesterday in answer to the plea broadcast by loudspeaker vans after Mr Yassir Arafat, the veteran Palestinian leader, decided that today would be the day of his triumphant visit after decades of struggle and exile. Mr Arafat, who brought forward his plans after a request by Israel's chief Sephardic rabbi that the visit should not take place on Saturday during the Jewish sabbath, also jolted the Israeli right wing into a frenzy of activity. Rightwing leaders, some threatening Mr Arafat's life, were last night co-ordinating a nationwide effort to muster demonstrators against a man who one rabbi called a 'modern-day Hitler'. The government put 8,000 policemen on alert to deal with Israeli protests. Officials described the move as one of the biggest mobilisations ever carried out to thwart the threat of civil disorder. Even the most senior PLO security officials were caught off guard by Mr Arafat's decision. He is scheduled to pass through the Israeli-Egyptian Rafah crossing at 2.30pm and travel in a long convoy to Gaza City to a hero's welcome. Up to 350,000 Palestinians are expected to turn out for their first glimpse of the legendary figure who has embodied the spirit of Palestinian resistance and nationalism. Roadsweepers and repairmen were busy cleaning away dust and filling in pot holes outside beachfront hotels where Mr Arafat and his party are expected to stay. Mr Arafat's supporters in Gaza mixed awe with disbelief at the impending visit of a man many Palestinians believe has superhuman powers. 'It will be the most important day in Palestinian history,' said Mr Hamdi Abu Sultan, a shopkeeper in the Jabalya refugee camp. But opponents, who believe Mr Arafat has sold out Palestinian rights and aspirations to Israel in return for limited local powers, said they would boycott the visit. The Islamic resistance movement Hamas said it was considering raising black flags as a sign of mourning for the Palestinian cause. In Israel, Mr Arafat's visit has ignited similarly high emotions. The Yesha, the council of some 100,000 Jews who have settled on Israeli-occupied Palestinian land, offered a reward for Mr Arafat's capture alive. Aid pledges, Page 6</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Following recent remarks by Shaykh Hamdan, the UAE's  minister of state for foreign affairs, which once again  reiterated that country's baseless claims, the spokesman of our  country's Foreign Affairs Ministry has stressed Iran's  sovereignty over the three Iranian islands [in the Gulf].    Mr Mohammadi said: Repeating such baseless issues, which  undermine the process of consolidation of stability in the  region, serves only the interests of foreigners and helps the  Zionist regime spread its influence in the region.    He added: Expansion of ties and cooperation does not mean  serving one-sided interests. Instead, such a process embraces  the mutual interests of the two neighboring Muslim countries,  and in the opinion of the Islamic Republic of Iran, expansion of  ties requires that one should refrain from making territorial  claims, and should instead pay respect to the issues of  sovereignty and established frontiers.    Furthermore, he stressed: Instead of attention to propaganda  issues, it is better for the UAE to accept the Islamic Republic  of Iran's invitation to hold bilateral talks.</p>

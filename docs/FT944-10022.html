			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei breaks four day losing streak A late recovery on Japanese institutional investment buying allowed equities to break a four-day losing streak, but the gain was a token one, writes Our Markets Staff. The Nikkei 225 index rose 19.51 to 19,284.36, 2.7 per cent lower on the week, and only a fraction off its high of 19,288.6 for the day. Earlier, bearish foreign and individual investors had taken it to a morning low of 19,132.23. Volume was estimated at 380m shares, up from 292.9m; the rise was partly due to a special quotation to settle prices for November option contracts. Declines outnumbered advances by 582 to 417 with 172 unchanged. The Nikkei 300 rose 0.10 to 278.50, and the Topix index of all first section issues fell 2.36 to 1,517.67. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.13 to 1248.35. Foreign selling was triggered partly by growing anxiety about the lack of domestic interest in Japanese shares; in contrast, said a dealer, individuals had been sellers for weeks on disappointment over the weakness of privatisation stocks, and the newly-listed Japan Tobacco in particular. Sectors moved both ways. The weakest was shipping, which fell 1.2 per cent, while foodstuffs and airlines were also emphatically lower; meanwhile, the mining, miscellaneous manufacturing and warehouse sectors were decidedly higher. The mining sector was the day's strongest and ended 1.6 per cent ahead. Among individual issues, steels were the day's most heavily traded, and ended mixed. Fortunes were mixed elsewhere, too. The market leader, NTT, jumped Y14,000 to Y865,000 but Japan Tobacco, listed at the end of last month, fell another Y5,000 to Y962,000, down 33 per cent from its initial sales price of Y1.438m. Roundup The region was generally preoccupied with next Tuesday's FOMC meeting in the US. SYDNEY closed at a 14-month low on weakness in the resources sector. The All Ordinaries index fell 19.3 to 1,952.0, off 2.3 per cent this week. Turnover was ADollars 670m. BHP fell 24 cents to ADollars 19.46 after announcing a Dollars 400m USsteel mill joint venture, and News Corp lost 14 cents to ADollars 5.56 on reports that it planned to form a pay television joint venture with the telecommunications carrier, Telstra, in Australia for launch early next year. HONG KONG retreated in the absence of any major buying from overseas investors. The Hang Seng index lost 22.91 to 9,367.85, for a week's fall of 1.7 per cent. Turnover rose to HKDollars 2.5bn from Thursday's HKDollars 1.7bn, mainly as a result of buying interest in Shanghai Haixing Shipping, a newly listed H share. The company, which ships coal and crude oil along China's eastern seaboard, ended at HKDollars 1.65, up 19 cents from its issue price. SEOUL continued to consolidate in weak trading. The composite index slipped 4.30 to 1,122.57, barely changed on the week. Turnover was Won990.12bn, compared Thursday's Won1,010bn. Trading companies and contractors declined on news that North Korea had rejected Seoul's proposal for bilateral economic co-operation. TAIPEI was led higher by the financial sector, although late profit-taking in industrials eroded some of the earlier gains. The weighted index improved 38.00 to 6,482.68, off an intra-day high of 6,521.93, for a week's rise of 1.7 per cent. Turnover was light at TDollars 41.6bn. MANILA's composite index fell 41.60 to 2,926.61, off 5.4 per cent on a week affected by strength in the peso against the dollar, with companies whose earnings are tied to dollar movements particularly vulnerable: PLDT, for instance, lost 15 pesos to 1,305 pesos and Philippine National Bank 2.50 pesos to 330 pesos. JAKARTA concentrated on the debut of pharmaceutical company Darya Varia which closed with a 17 per cent premium at Rp7,250. The official index slipped 0.53 to 513.38.</p>

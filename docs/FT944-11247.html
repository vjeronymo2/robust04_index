			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (1): Reform momentum slows down - As China proceeds further down the road of economic reform, the task is becoming more complicated After two years of spectacular economic progress, China is entering a winter of unease. The reform momentum is slowing, there are worries about inflation and worker unrest, and the prospect of transition to a new leadership when Deng Xiaoping dies, is weighing more heavily. Officials insist that there will be no let-up in the reforms, but it is clear that China has embarked on a period of consolidation in its economic transformation following recent advances. Concern about the deteriorating health of Deng is casting a long shadow. China is now enmeshed in the transition to a post-Deng era, re-inforcing a mood of caution among the leadership group. In the short-term, however, worries about inflation are proving the most burdensome for the authorities, who have made the fight against rising prices their main priority. Chinese leaders have been predicting for much of 1994 that price increases would slow, but in spite of a stiffening of price controls earlier this year the underlying inflation rate remains stubbornly high. Consumer prices leapt by 27.4 per cent in the twelve months to September, and were up by two percentage points on August. The government is also finding the task of reforming state enterprises more challenging and politically riskier than expected. The planned implementation this year of a programme to rationalise 100 enterprises in 18 cities, including a pilot bankruptcy scheme, has been postponed until next year, because of fears of worker unrest, especially in China's restive north-east industrial heartland. The official jobless rate among industrial workers stands at 2.4 per cent, but this vastly understates the problem of both unemployment and under-employment, which is running as high as 20 per cent in some urban areas. Sluggish activity in the state sector, which accounts for about 45 per cent of industrial production, has raised the spectre of 'stagflation' in an economy that is decelerating. Real GDP growth is projected to slow to about 10 per cent next year, compared with 13.4 per cent in 1993 and an expected 11.5 per cent this year. Since the introduction of a 16-point stabilisation programme in July 1993, the government has instituted a series of stop-go attempts at restraining monetary growth to calm an overheating economy, loosening and tightening credit in alternate three-month cycles. Persistent demands for working capital from ailing state enterprises, half of which are operating in the red, have greatly complicated efforts to restrain monetary growth. But while China faces enormous challenges in managing its transition, from a centrally-planned monolith to a market-oriented system, the economic news is far from being uniformly poor. Foreign investors continued to target China, pledging some US Dollars 57bn worth of new investment in the first nine months of the year. Actual investment totalled Dollars 22.72bn, an increase of 49 per cent over last year. China now absorbs about half of all foreign direct investment to developing countries worldwide. Trade figures so far for 1994 are no less impressive. Exports rebounded strongly after growth slowed last year. In the first three-quarters of 1994, exports exceeded imports by Dollars 1.38bn, compared with last year's trade deficit of Dollars 12.2bn. In line with its much-improved trading performance, China's foreign exchange reserves grew strongly in the first half of the year, to stand at Dollars 39.83bn at the end of September, a 87 per cent increase on 1993. The continued buoyant performance of township and village enterprises was another bright spot. Yet, although economic issues have dominated the public agenda this year, it is concern about Mr Deng's health which is preoccupying the leadership, and deepening the new mood of caution. Heirs to the throne wish to avoid any false steps in this delicate transitional phase. At the fourth plenary session of the 14th central committee held in September, the Communist Party emphasised themes of stability rather than reform in a resolution titled 'Major Issues on Strengthening Party Building.' This was hardly a ringing endorsement of the reform process: instead it indicated that the leadership was preparing for difficult times expected ahead. The fourth plenum resolution stood in marked contrast to that of the third plenum of November, 1993 which approved a blueprint for sweeping economic changes, including reforms of the financial sector and guidance for the corporatisation - a Chinese half-way house to privatisation - of state enterprises. Slow progress in these areas in the 12 months since the third plenum reflects a new, more hesitant mood which has been prompted by concerns about rising prices, unrest among the unemployed, agitation by peasants whose incomes have been squeezed by rising costs, greater incidence of crime across the country, and worries about the leadership transition. Added to that is the fact that as China proceeds further down the road of economic reform and in the process seeks closer integration with the world economy, the task becomes more complicated. Not least of the difficulties is marrying the country's own evolving trading laws and regulations with those of the outside world. Presiding over this extraordinarily complex transition, in place of Mr Deng's generation of revolutionaries, will be a new, more technocratic cadre whose capacity to deal with the serious challenges which lie ahead in governing the world's most populous state is largely untested. China's new generation of leaders may be able to defer for the time being consideration of contentious issues such as the need for greater accountability, but continued economic liberalisation is certain to increase demands for a more representative system. Real political reform, as opposed to tinkering with party institutions, cannot be excluded indefinitely from the debate. While progress in economic reform has been patchy, there have been some impressive advances in foreign policy. President Clinton's decision in May to uncouple human rights issues from an extension of China's most favoured nation trading status in the US represented a victory for Chinese diplomacy, though human rights lobby groups were outraged. Relations with the US have improved markedly in the past six months, with frequent exchanges of high level visitors and growing collaboration in a range of areas - from regional security to global arms control. The agreement reached in October between the US and China to co-operate in efforts aimed at halting the spread of missile technology and fissionable nuclear materials was a significant development. Chinese officials regard 1994 as a year during which Beijing placed greater distance between itself and the massacre of pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen square in 1989. Sanctions are still in place in the West against the sale of military hardware, but the Tiananmen issue as an irritant to relations with the international community has receded into the background. China's foreign policy aspirations for the year would be more than fulfilled if success were achieved in its difficult negotiations on re-entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, (see page five in this survey). Gatt-entry, and the benefits which would accrue in consequence, would provide a fillip for a regime seeking positive economic news to counter some of the less positive developments of the latter part of the year.</p>

			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE WEEK: SHIRLEY MACLAINE'S STAGE INCARNATION  </P> <P> Hey, you out there. Shirley MacLaine wants to talk with you.  </P> <P> "I'm finding I want to break the proscenium more and more," said the  Oscar-winning actress, whose new song-and-dance show, "Out There Tonight,"  opens at the Pantages Tuesday. "Maybe it's a natural evolution of advanced  years: feeling the need to communicate, never knowing what I'm going to say,  learning to work spontaneously, getting past the fear, the expectation of  disaster. There's a lot of freedom in that."  </P> <P> And film?  </P> <P> "Film is a much cooler medium," said MacLaine, who's currently at work on a new  book -- of course about her ("Can you see me writing about anybody else?").  "You know you can take it from the top or fix it in the editing room. On stage,  the audience feeds you. It comes in waves of sound -- and waves of silence.  When they're really rapt, you can feel the silence. It's immediacy, it's in the  moment. Every time I go out there, I feel the barriers evaporating a little  more."  </P> <P> Yet when it comes to analyzing her Pied Piper appeal -- whether as a performer  or proponent of New Age beliefs -- MacLaine believes her unabashed public life  has created a certain intimacy with audiences. "My life is a literal open  book," she said wryly. "So why shouldn't it be on stage or in a seminar? I  can't hide. And I don't know that sharing is even a choice; I think it's a  necessity in life."  </P> <P> In this show -- patterned after her successful outing at the Wilshire Theatre  in '84 -- the informal sharing coexists with a very physical workout: a  collection of songs (some original, some from her films: "Can-Can," "Sweet  Charity" and "Irma La Douce") and a "great big" dance tribute to  choreographers. "It's not easy getting this together," she noted. "I have to  get back in shape, get the right exercises, the right moves. I don't know  what's going to happen when I get really old and can't lift my leg."  </P> <P> THEATER BUZZ: Buddy, can you spare a penny? The Mark Taper Forum and Doolittle  Theatre are rolling in change lately, thanks to two ticket discount programs:  the month-old Public Rush (whereby patrons showing up 10 minutes before curtain  may pay $10 -- cash -- for remaining seats) and its less structured  counterpart, the ongoing "Pay What You Can" plan.  </P> <P> Typical "Pay What You Can" contributions are said to hover around the $7 mark  (or the price of a movie), although box-office employees report that fur-clad  ladies have been known to proffer small change. And not long ago, one  well-heeled couple sprang for a penny . . . for two seats.  </P> <P> TASTY TIDBIT: Actress Maylou Sullivan makes an encore appearance's at Venice's  Sculpture Gardens restaurant tonight with a reading of three "mini-stories" by  Irishman Bernard MacLaverty, followed by a dinner choice of duck breast,  shrimps and nopales or eggplant casserole -- plus appetizer, sorbet, dessert  and coffee. For reservations: (213) 396-5809.  </P> <P> CRITICAL CROSSFIRE: Pierre Corneille's 17th-Century romance-comedy, "The  Illusion," gets a face lift in Tony Kushner's new adaptation at Los Angeles  Theatre Center. David Schweizer directs.  </P> <P> Cheered The Times' Sylvie Drake: "This 'Illusion' is a fascinating hybrid of  fantasy and humor, with the magic remembering that it has feet of clay. It's  not 'The Wizard of Oz' exactly, but . . . "  </P> <P> Said Daryl H. Miller in the Daily News: "The show is fresh and invigorating,  due to the timelessness of Corneille's dramatic vision and the timeliness of  Kushner's adaptation. Schweizer's staging also adds zest, as do the inventive  performances."  </P> <P> Daily Variety's Kathleen O'Steen found it "lives up to a good deal of the  play's comical potential while also substantially investigating the darker  realms, thanks in good part to Schweizer's vision. Add to that Douglas D.  Smith's wondrous settings."  </P> <P> From the Orange County Register's Thomas O'Connor "Schweizer's engaging staging  plays magic tricks with our perceptions and with Corneille's cautionary comedy  about love's illusion. Yet it never toys or cloys . . . Almost everything  suggests a surprisingly happy marriage of classic French style to hip '90s  sensibilities."  </P></p>

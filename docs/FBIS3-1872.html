He added that the  Chinese side was quite disappointed and regretful about what the  British side had done to undermine the talks.    When answering reporters' questions today, Lu Ping said:  From the material published by the Foreign Ministry, everyone  can see that the Chinese Government was really sincere and  honest in the talks and that the Chinese side made the greatest  efforts to reach an agreement with the British side. From the  materials, everyone can see that the British side had no  sincerity since the beginning of the talks. The Chinese side  was willing to talk with the British side on the 1994/95  electoral arrangements because it hoped that China and Britain  could cooperate on the question of a steady transition and bring  about a steady transition in 1997. This was the "through train"  concept.    Lu Ping criticized the British side lack of sincerity and  for  causing the talks to break down. Therefore, the Chinese side is  quite disappointed and regretful about this. He stressed that  under this situation--a situation in which the British side is  not cooperating--the Chinese side will make efforts to carry out  Hong Kong's steady transition in 1997, adding that this was also  the Chinese side's objective in its future work.</p>

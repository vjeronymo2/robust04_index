			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Trafalgar House-Bouygues contest Two of Britain's and France's largest construction companies are leading rival consortia which have been short-listed to bid for one of Europe's largest private infrastructure projects. Trafalgar House of Britain and Bouygues of France are competing to build the Pounds 500m privately-financed toll road bridge across the river Tagus close to the Portuguese capital, Lisbon. French and Portuguese authorities established good relations during the recent Gatt trade negotiations when both countries adopted similar policies on agriculture. Trafalgar House, however, is understood to have stressed in negotiations that its consortium commands a higher proportion of independent Portuguese companies than the Bouygues-led bid. Trafalgar holds just under 25 per cent of its Lusoponte consortium. It also has a French partner, Campenon Bernard, which holds a similar stake. Five Portuguese companies own the remaining 50 per cent. Bouygues's bid is supported by Dragados, the Spanish construction company. Both groups are understood to have stressed the importance of their local Portuguese operations. The contract is viewed as an important potential stepping stone to other projects as European countries increasingly look to private companies to finance developments which previously would have been funded by the public sector. Bouygues and Trafalgar House have led the way in building private infrastructure projects in their own countries. The concession to operate the new bridge, due to start operating in 1998, is expected to run for 30 years. Contracts are expected to be signed with the successful bidder by March. The two consortia have been short-listed from an original list of six bidders. The 18km toll viaduct and cable bridge proposed by Trafalgar would become part of the city's northern regional highway system. Financial backing for Trafalgar's bid comes from five Portuguese financial institutions and 11 international banks.</p>

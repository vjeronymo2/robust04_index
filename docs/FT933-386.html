			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Siebe forms new control systems side in reshuffle SIEBE, the international controls and engineering group, has announced a reorganisation which will increase its focus on the high-technology end of the automated controls market. The reshuffle follows the success of Siebe's Dollars 650m acquisition in 1990 of Foxboro, the US industrial controls group which has given it a significant share of the lucrative market for complete automated control systems, as well as individual components. Mr Stanley Shaffran, president of Foxboro, is leaving the group to pursue other interests. Foxboro will become part of a new division, control systems, to be based in Massachusetts and run by Mr George Sarney, who recently joined Siebe from Raytheon, the US defence group. The group's temperature and appliance controls division, based in Ohio, will be run by Mr James Mueller, previously president of Ranco, Siebe's temperature control subsidiary. He succeeds Mr Sarney. Siebe's third division, diversified products, will be based at Windsor in the UK and be led by Mr Brian McMahon, previously chief executive of the group's compressed air businesses. He succeeds Mr John Prohaska. All three divisional presidents will report to Mr Allen Yurko, Siebe's managing director and chief operating officer. At the end of the year Mr Barrie Stephens, Siebe's veteran chairman and chief executive, will hand over the chief executive's role to Mr Yurko. Mr Stephens said Mr Yurko should be given most of the credit for the reorganisation, which would realign the company's structure and particularly its controls business to mirror the marketplace. About 50 per cent of group sales are in the US. He said all three operating divisions would be roughly equal in size, but emphasised that under this structure Siebe's traditional 'four pillars' - controls, specialist mechanical engineering, compressed air plus safety and life support products - remained intact.

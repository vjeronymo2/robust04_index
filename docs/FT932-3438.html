			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Question mark over Nato The writing is on the wall. It says: 'Too bad about Bosnia'. All doubt has disappeared. The west has now conclusively advertised its refusal to do anything effective about the tragic war in Bosnia. In a last, minimalist gesture, the United Nations voted 10 days ago to authorise the use of troops to defend Sarajevo and five other towns as 'safe havens' for the Moslems. Last week, Nato foreign ministers duly endorsed the new UN policy. Only one thing was missing - any willingness to provide the minimum number of 5,000 extra troops needed to carry it out. In preference, Nato governments agreed on a three-point strategy which signalled clearly that they have virtually written off this bloody conflict. First, Nato aircraft will patrol the skies. In theory, this is to protect UN troops in the safe havens but, in reality, air strikes cannot substitute for inadequate troops because they are as likely to kill civilians as Serb soldiers. Second, the US will make the cost-free gesture of sending a little company of 300 soldiers to Macedonia, where there is no fighting, as a symbolic deterrent to any wider ambitions by the Serbs. And third, Nato will hold a special summit meeting towards the end of the year to try to work out how to do better in future. In plain English, Nato's three-point strategy can be summed up in three words: gesticulation, containment, obfuscation. Each of these elements is understandable in its own terms. The trouble is that, cumulatively, they are deeply damaging for the west - never mind the terrible sufferings of the people of Bosnia. They are damaging to the political and moral authority of the west, damaging to relations between Europe and the US, and damaging to the credibility of Nato. This damage will not be put right by yet another summit. The ostensible purpose of the meeting is to plan for Nato's future. The real purpose is to try to patch up the transatlantic rift exposed by the war in Bosnia. The Clinton administration will hope to impress the Europeans with the president's leadership and commitment to the alliance. But the war in Bosnia has demonstrated a profound divide in strategic interests between Europe and the US, and it will not be erased by any summit communique. From the US point of view, there may be very good reasons for not wanting to get involved in a small civil war on the southern fringe of Europe. But the US's critical mass is such that its refusal has hobbled the rest of the alliance. Of course, it is unreasonable to lay all the blame on the US. From the beginning of the Yugoslav crisis, European governments repeatedly advertised their reluctance to use military force, thus renouncing the option of intimidating the warring parties. But US reluctance further undermined the military option for Europe. As it is, France and Britain are by far the biggest contributors of troops to the UN humanitarian protection force in Bosnia. But a shift from humanitarian protection to the active use of military force would require a large increase in troop strengths, which could come only through the mobilisation of resources across the breadth of the alliance. Thus, the US refusal virtually amounted to a veto. After this, there must now be a serious question mark over Nato's future. Nato has lost its original unifying raison d'etre with the disintegration of the massive military threat from the Soviet Union, though it is possible that the political turmoil in Russia may again confront the west with a serious military threat. Meanwhile, all alliance governments, including the French, want to keep Nato going; at the Rome Summit of 1991, they drafted a new strategy for peace, based on dialogue and co-operation between east and west. Unfortunately, they skirted round the central probability - that the most immediate threats to the stability and security of Europe would be likely to come from smaller and less predictable regional conflicts. The war in Bosnia is only one of several conflicts detonated by the break-up of the Soviet bloc. Others include the war in Georgia and that between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The new Nato strategy recommends 'crisis management' and 'conflict prevention'; but it does not say how these admirable functions would be carried out by an essentially military alliance like Nato. That uncertainty has been made more acute by the war in Bosnia, because it has revealed profound differences in strategic appreciation between Europe and America. The Bosnian war, and the west's inability to stop it by force, provide the motivation behind the French proposal for a 'pact for security and stability in Europe', put forward by Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister. The French objective is to prevent a repetition of the Yugoslav tragedy, by some sort of collective management of potential conflicts over frontiers and ethnic minorities. Exactly how these conflicts are to be defused is far from clear. But the French seem to envisage some sort of diplomatic-security negotiation conducted by the European Community. The first problem is that ethnic conflicts are liable to beingdriven by blind emotion. As in Bosnia, they may not be susceptible to rational negotiation by outsiders. The second problem is that the French scheme will need to be very ambitious if it is to measure up to the two most serious crises in the former Soviet Union: Russia's claim to a right to intervene in neighbouring states; and the potential for conflict in the tension between Russia and Ukraine over Ukrainian territory, Ukrainian nuclear weapons, and even Ukrainian independence.</p>

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Election fears and bad data prompt selling Wall Street CONTINUED uncertainty about next week's presidential election and bad news on home sales and from Chicago purchasing managers prompted selling of US shares, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 19.99 at 3,226.28, and the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 down 2.18 at 418.68. The Amex composite, however, gained 0.43 at 381.72 but the Nasdaq composite eased 0.66 to 605.16. NYSE turnover was heavy at 198m shares, and declines marginally outpaced rises by 875 to 855. Share prices opened slightly firmer, but investors began to sell stocks soon after the Chicago Purchasing Management Association reported that its index of business activity in October had plummeted from 59.5 per cent in September to 49.7 per cent. A reading below 50 per cent indicates that manufacturing industry is contracting. The decline steepened when the commerce department reported that single-family new home sales fell 0.1 per cent in September, the first monthly decline since April. The market had been expecting a solid rise in home sales, so the sell-off after the figures was rapid. Both sets of data cast a gloomy cloud over the market, which was already unsettled by the ups and downs of the presidential election campaign. Although the latest national polls showed President George Bush catching up with Governor Bill Clinton, the more revealing state-by-state polls of electoral college votes showed the Democratic contenders still maintained a decent lead. Among individual stocks, General Motors weakened further in the wake of its third-quarter losses and the upheaval at the company's top management. GM shares slipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 30 3/4 in turnover of 1.7m shares. Ford, which also announced a big quarterly loss this week, eased Dollars 3/4 to Dollars 36 1/2 , while Chrysler, the only one of the big three car manufacturers to report a profit, was unchanged at Dollars 27 1/8 . Aetna Life firmed early on but ended unchanged at Dollars 42 1/8 after the insurer announced earnings from continuing operations of Dollars 127m for the third quarter, up sharply from the Dollars 72m earned a year ago. The ADRs in Glaxo fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 25 in turnover of 3.1m shares after three US doctors linked the UK company's Zofran drug, used to reduce nausea after cancer chemotherapy, to the deaths of two patients and the non-fatal cardiac arrest of another. Glaxo officials later rejected the findings. Imo Industries plunged Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 7 after the company, which reported a third-quarter loss following a charge and suspended its quarterly dividend, announced it would divest between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of its assets. Atlanta Gas Light fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 34 5/8 on a ratings downgrade from the broking house Smith Barney, which also reduced its earnings forecast for 1993 from Dollars 2.50 a share to Dollars 2.35 a share.</p>

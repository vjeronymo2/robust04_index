			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUNSET LEAGUE;  </P> <P> MARINA GETS ON THE BALL, BEATS SANTA ANA  </P> <P> You can call it good defense. Or you can call it inept offense. But what you  can't call it is nail-biting football.  </P> <P> For the better part of 3 1/2 quarters, neither visiting Santa Ana nor Marina  high schools could put together enough offense to score.  </P> <P> So the Marina defense decided to pick up the slack and, combined with an  ill-timed pitchout by Santa Ana quarterback Albert Perez, finally scored with 3  minutes 14 seconds left in the game for a 7-0 victory Friday night in the  Sunset League opening game for both teams in front of 1,500 at Westminster High  School.  </P> <P> The play that buried Santa Ana (0-4, 0-1) came on a second-and-nine from the  Saints' 28-yard line when Perez, under heavy pressure from the Viking defense,  tried to pitch the ball to fullback Kevin Pola. The ball sailed past Pola and  was kicked, pushed and generally manhandled by a host of players from both  sides, until senior defensive end Frank Marvitz fell on it in the end zone.  </P> <P> "I can't say enough about our defense," Marina Coach John Seeley said. "They  bailed us out quarter after quarter."  </P> <P> Marina (3-1, 1-0) stayed mostly on the ground by rushing senior fullback Shawn  Fulford 22 times for 92 yards, including nine times for 41 yards in a 12-play  drive midway through the second period.  </P> <P> For Santa Ana, it was a bitter return to the Sunset League and Division I play  after 16 years in the Century League, where they won the championship last  season.  </P> <P> The deepest the Saints could move the ball was to the Viking 25-yard line  midway through the third quarter. The drive stalled, however, and a 42-yard  field goal attempt by Gustavo Plasencia was partially blocked by a Marina  defender.  </P> <P> Seeley wasn't pleased with his team's offensive output.  </P> <P> "We had out chances in the ballgame to put it away and just didn't do it," he  said.  </P></p>

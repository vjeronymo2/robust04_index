			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Best quarter at Texas Instruments Texas Instruments, the US semiconductor and electronics manufacturer, yesterday reported its best ever quarterly results while announcing a broad restructuring of its European operations and the sale of some its software product lines. In all, about 1,064 jobs will be eliminated, most of them in Europe. Net income for the quarter jumped to Dollars 134m, or Dollars 1.41 per share, from Dollars 81m or 85 cents for the first quarter of 1993. Strong growth in semiconductor sales produced a 30 per cent jump in first-quarter revenues to Dollars 2.45bn from Dollars 1.88bn in the same period last year. The company said it would create business centres with pan-European responsibilities to replace its traditional country-by-country approach. The restructuring is expected to result eventually in annual savings of about Dollars 54m. The first-quarter 1994 results include a pre-tax charge of Dollars 83m for the costs of restructuring the European operations. An additional pre-tax charge of Dollars 49m was taken for the costs of divesting 'non-strategic product lines' primarily in information technology, the company said. Excluding the effect of charges and one-time royalty gains, profit from operations for the quarter would have been Dollars 256m and net income would have been Dollars 165m, or Dollars 1.74 per share, the company said. Wall Street analysts had been anticipating net income of about Dollars 1.39 per share. TI's share price gained Dollars 3 1/2 to trade at Dollars 68 1/4 in mid-session yesterday, up from Wednesday's close of Dollars 64 3/4 . At the annual meeting, Mr Jerry Junkins, TI chairman, announced plans to raise the stock dividend to Dollars 1.00 per share from 72 cents. TI said that most of its profit increase in the quarter came from higher royalties on semiconductor patents and improved semiconductor operations. Semiconductor orders and revenues reached an all-time high in the quarter, the company said. Without the effect of restructuring charges, semiconductor operating profit more than doubled over the first quarter of 1993. Even with the effect of the charges, semiconductor profits were up significantly over the first quarter of 1993.</p>

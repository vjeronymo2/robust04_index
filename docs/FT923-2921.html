			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Survey of Kyushu (3): Washlet creator tries new tricks / Profile of Toto THE CLAY soil of Kyushu has for centuries yielded the raw material used to produce ceramics and to this day it is turned by the craftsmen of Arita into exquisitely fashioned bowls and ornaments. More recently, Kyushu's status as 'silicon island' derived in part from the availability of the ceramics which went into semiconductors. But in between high art and high-tech, for the past 75 years one Kyushu company has been supplying the nation with a more prosaic form of ceramic and its products are used almost every day by almost every Japanese. Toto, based in Kita-Kyushu, is the country's biggest manufacturer of toilets, with annual sales of Y417.5bn and a domestic market share of more than 60 per cent. It was the creator 12 years ago of the Washlet, a microcomputer-controlled combination toilet-bidet which has been featured on numerous western television shows. Tied closely to the domestic economy, its profits dipped last year, amid the downturn in construction activity, to Y30.2bn before tax, down 13 per cent. But it has been expanding in Asia, Europe and this year the US, and analysts argue that its dominant position at home means it can set the industry's pricing terms and will be well placed for a revival in housing starts. Japanese take their bathrooms and kitchens (units for which the company also supplies) seriously. And Toto takes its products seriously - the executive washroom next to the office of Mr Shigeru Ezoe, who took over as president in June, is ripped out every year to accommodate its latest models. He says that Japan's ageing society, putting a greater emphasis on living standards, is prompting new demand. Business comes two thirds from new homes and the rest from renovations. 'In the US the reverse is true, and we foresee the same happening here,' he adds. Toto has just opened a Y17bn factory near its head office which came fully on stream in June. It employs just 380 of Toto's nearly 11,000 staff. A fleet of unmanned vehicles whisks units from the end of the production line, while robots methodically lift and lower toilet seats while they put the final touches in place. In spite of the less than glamorous nature of the work, Mr Ezoe says the company did not suffer from Japan's labour shortage of the early 1990s, 'thanks to our Kyushu base' where good quality labour has remained in ready supply. While Toto has plants elsewhere in Japan, the island remains its main production centre. Abroad, meanwhile, it has stakes in sanitary ware producers in South Korea, Thailand, Taiwan and Indonesia as well as in Allia of France and Keramag in Germany. Overseas sales account for over 10 per cent of total revenues, of which direct exports form barely 2 per cent. After opening a California sales outlet, US manufacturing will begin this autumn from a plant in Atlanta. American sanitary ware makers may baulk at the arrival of a competitor from a country where the sector's three biggest producers together account for more than 90 per cent of the market. But Mr Ezoe stresses that Toto does not intend to take US makers of conventional toilets head-on: rather, the Atlanta facility, which will initially employ just 65, will make only those using water-saving flushing systems. Toto has some 1,200 employees engaged in research and development and is seeking to expand into related areas. 'Our business is to do with water,' says Mr Ezoe, who rose through the company's technological division and now has several dozen people working in purely biological research. The number of technical staff overall has trebled in the last seven years. This has enabled it to put into production, for example, ceramic parts for optical fibre connectors. But the product for which it is best known is not being neglected. Next year's low-noise Washlet will have an ozone-friendly deodorant dispenser built in, while the company has been working with Omron and NTT, the electronics and telecommunications groups, to produce a 'health management toilet system' which measures glucose and protein levels and can take the user's pulse and blood pressure too.</p>

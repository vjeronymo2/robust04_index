As  everyone knows, the significance of that meeting stems from the  fact that it was the first meeting after the three-year official  boycott between the two sides as a result of the position taken  by the PLO in support and in defense of the Iraqi occupation of  Kuwait.    As the announcement is made of the closure of the dispute  file, it is wise to talk about ways of maintaining special  relations which could deteriorate if not kept at the right  temperature.    The golden advice given to the PLO at the beginning of the  crisis after Iraq occupied an entire country and displaced its  people in a serious precedent, still stands. It is that the PLO  should adopt one of two lines: Adhere to the Arab League's  bylaws which condemn such acts, or take a neutral stand and  choose isolation that would spare it embarrassment.    One could understand the Sudanese president standing up and  insulting an afflicted fraternal state at the summit conference  held in Cairo after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, for the Sudanese  Government was then and is now a military government whose hands  were smeared in blood of the coup which toppled a civilian  government not long before that. At that conference, the  Sudanese president deliberately ignored the legitimate call by  Kuwait and nine other Arab states for the condemnation of the  occupation in principle and for an end to that occupation, and  instead called for the formation of a committee to study the  matter and to visit Baghdad (?), finding the condemnation call  too much. One could understand this, coming from a man whose  action in his own country was equal to the Iraqi president's  crime, but 'Arafat committed an even worse act when he raised  his hand in support of the Sudanese request, to the amazement of  the majority. But in 'Arafat's case, his [Palestinian]  territory is occupied and his people displaced. Before anyone  else, he should have immediately condemned the occupation  instead of supporting the call for the formation of a committee  to study the matter. No Arab had called for the formation of a  committee before Israel was condemned.    This is not the day of reckoning but the PLO might find  itself in similar difficult political situations in the future,  whether after it has its own state on its own territory or while  still an airborne government, as the Libyan leader calls it. If  the PLO has complex interests it fears for, the least it can do  in such a case is to take a neutral stand, the best known  diplomatic invention in politics.    The PLO lost its honor, its resources, and many friends in  that crisis and the situation reached a dangerous point for the  Palestinian cause because of the PLO's impartiality. Now it is  urged to stay out of the whirlpool of regional alliances because  it is the only party whose cause everyone has agreed to support.</p>

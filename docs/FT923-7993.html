			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Management: A heavy scent of power and lilies - Lucy Kellaway visits Eve Pollard's room by the Thames TO SIT outside the office of Eve Pollard, editor of the Sunday Express, is rather like waiting to see the headmistress. The bench outside her room is visible right across the busy newsroom, so that those waiting for an audience are in full view of the rabble of journalists and secretaries, who look on with undisguised curiosity. And wait is precisely what one has to do. The first woman editor in Fleet Street is booked ahead for months - her next free lunch is on October 31 - and all dates are liable to be rescheduled at least once. On the Friday afternoon I visited Express Newspapers' glass and marble palace on Blackfriar's Bridge, Pollard was still having lunch. Eventually she appears, sweeping across the newsroom waving her arms at the journalists who run after her. 'Not now, not now,' she says. Travelling at great speed, she reaches her office, full of welcoming smiles. She promptly disappears into the adjoining conference room clutching a large make-up bag, to smarten herself up for the photograph. She explains that the previous night she was out late celebrating the newspaper's transformation into a tabloid, and bemoans the necessity for make-up. Pollard's style is not what one expects from a women who has made it in a man's world. Others may behave as token men, but she makes no apology for her sex: she is aggressively feminine. Her suit is tight and distractingly low-cut. On her desk is a vase of heavily scented white lilies, and behind her is a silver champagne bucket full of dried flowers. On the walls are pictures of her daughters, and trophies marking her considerable achievements as editor of a long line of magazines. The television, which faces her desk, is tuned permanently to Sky News with the volume off. By the door is a safe, used for extra sensitive scoops, but apparently empty at the moment. In pride of place is an intimate photo of Pollard sitting with John Major on a chinzy suite during the last election. 'That was rather hairy,' she says, giggling, but declining to elaborate. The breathtaking view of St Paul's Cathedral shouts power - but otherwise there is no sign that Pollard is trying to intimidate. The office itself is fairly small - her predecessor had a grander one, but she prefers it that way. When receiving visitors she places herself behind her desk, in order to prevent men 'spending all their time examining if your heels are scuffed'. The remark is typical of her chummy, girly tone. 'You know how awful men are,' she says. Indeed she reckons that when dealing with them a quite different style is required. 'I can't just talk like this. I have to assert myself, and say this amplified 17 times, or they don't listen.' Apart from the need to speak up, what other managerial tricks has she learnt in her successful first year as editor? Pollard thinks, and decides that her primary job is not to manage. Instead she sees her role as 'making the difference - thinking of the stories, of ideas - being innovating, challenging'. To help with those ideas, she has on her desk copies of the Wall Street Journal and Liberation, the left-of-centre French daily - surprising choices given that her paper favours such stories as 'Diana beats her bulimia'. Pollard admits to not fully understanding the French paper, although she says she likes the way it looks. She reads all the other newspapers before arriving at work in her chauffeur-driven jag soon after 10am. The car is 'a luxury, a treat', and the journey itself gives her time to speak to at least three people on the mobile phone. Once at work, the days take a predictable shape. 'You have conferences, meetings, you think of ideas, and if you are lucky you don't have lunch.' But Pollard, it seems, is always unlucky, constantly dining with 'politicians, publishers, contacts, even sometimes with advertising people'  -she rolls her eyes. When in the office, she is at home to whoever should come and see her. 'Most of the time the door is open, and people put their heads round.' She likes to rely on old-fashioned means of communication - 'the blower' is her favourite. She discourages people from sending memos, and dislikes computer messages. Instead she wanders around 'visiting the art desk, looking at the dummies, and talking to people'. As the day of publication draws closer, she becomes more involved, eventually moving out of her office altogether to sit on the desk with the other journalists. On these days she does not go home until the night is well advanced - on others she is rarely out of the office before 9.30pm. It is a long week. What keeps her doing it? Her reply shares the qualities of tabloid newspapers: less than complete truth delivered with an appealing directness. 'It's the money,' she says.</p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Vodafone At some stage Vodafone will doubtless reap the benefit of UK economic recovery. The timing, however, appears more elusive than it did when the company announced its interim results in November. Average revenue per customer was Pounds 711 at the end of the financial year, above its nadir of Pounds 700 last summer but down on the Pounds 730 recorded a year earlier. The number of subscribers rose by 44,000 to 715,000 for the year as a whole, but the proportion who failed to renew their subscription increased to 24 per cent from 21 per cent. Against that background, Vodafone could claim to have done well in increasing annual profits by 11 per cent to Pounds 272m. There was a Pounds 6m boost from higher interest income, though, in turn a function of unusually low capital spend. On a historic multiple of more than 20, the shares seem to be discounting an implausibly strong recovery.</p>

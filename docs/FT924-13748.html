			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Jobs: How universities fared - St Andrews pips Durham to top employment league WHEN free to choose, the Jobs column likes to give readers at least a fortnight to recover between doses of data about graduates. But alas, as the official number-crunchers brook no delay, last week's dollop of same is being followed today by another - as witness the table to the right which is this year apt to be particularly controversial. Before telling why, though, I'd better explain how the table goes about its task of ranking United Kingdom higher educational institutions by the jobs-market performance of their graduates. As was the case a week ago, the graduates in question are those who gained first degrees, as opposed to the higher kind such as doctorates, in the summer of 1991 which is the latest year for which statistics are available. Since then, as is all too well known, the jobs market has gone from bad to evil. One difference from last week is that we are concerned solely with British graduates, in the sense of being deemed domiciled in the UK as distinct from coming to study from other countries. Another difference is that the table refers only to largely state-funded universities which held that status in 1991. Former polytechnics newly translated into universities are left out of account, as are other types of higher educational institutions including the Open University. The first column of figures gives the total number of new UK graduates such universities produced in the summer of last year. The second shows the percentages of same who had vanished from their Alma Mater's purview by December 31, six months after taking their degree. The next section of the table, consisting of five columns, looks at the 1991 graduates whose whereabouts were known. After the numbers thereof, we have four sets of percentages. The first denotes those who obtained a job with longer-term prospects, and the second those continuing in full-time study or training. Both those sets might be said to have found regular occupations for their highly educated talents. But the other two groups are different. One is the people who declared themselves not available for employment at all, as distinct from those who returned to some organisation which had kept them on its books while they studied. The next lumps together those unemployed at the year-end, and those in a temporary job lasting at most three months. So much for the graduates of the single year 1991. It is the table's final section that raises the controversy. For it provides the basis of the ranking of the universities by job-market performance, which is as fair as the statistics available permit. The criterion is the number of graduates in the category that lumps together the unemployed and those in temporary jobs only. But instead of taking a single year's performance which may be skewed by odd events, the last section takes the graduate outputs of the three years 1989-91. Moreover it compensates for variances in the mix of subjects taught from one campus to another. Otherwise, since engineers are normally more in demand than historians and such, universities strong in engineering would have an unfair start over those more concentrated on the arts. So the last section begins by giving each campus a 'target' representing the number of its graduates who would have been in the unemployed-and-temporary category if they'd conformed to the all-universities average for their respective subjects. Then comes the number who actually ended in that category. And the final column shows the percentage by which each place either bettered its target or fell short, which decides its rank. What ushers in controversy is that judgments on such matters vary. In particular, on Monday the Times newspaper (no relation of the FT) printed a league table of universities which was more ambitious than my effort, being based on a range of criteria. But one of them was employment, and by that gauge the Times's ranking differs much from mine. For example, although its top performer in the shape of Bath is only two notches lower in my list, it gave third place to Sussex which is bottom by my measure - which is supported by the 22.5 per cent of Sussex's 1991 crop in the unemployed-temporary slot. Even so, since there is likely to be argument, I'd better specify the source of the data on which my ranking is based. It is the official document, University Management Statistics and Performance Indicators in the UK, just published by the Universities Funding Council jointly with the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals.</p>

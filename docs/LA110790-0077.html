			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> ELECTIONS: SCHOOL BOARDS;  </P> <P> INCUMBENTS APPEAR TO OUTPOLL CHALLENGERS  </P> <P> Incumbents in school board races across the county appeared in early returns to  be overcoming anti-incumbent sentiment to take the lead over their challengers.  </P> <P> Teachers from Ojai to Camarillo spent last weekend canvassing neighborhoods for  candidates endorsed by their unions, but their aid didn't appear to help  challengers in races where many of the names on the ballot were unknown.  </P> <P> Fifty-three candidates vied for seats in nine districts.  </P> <P> In three crowded contests -- Hueneme Elementary School District, Oxnard Union  High School District and Oxnard Elementary School District -- only one  incumbent in each race received endorsements from teachers.  </P> <P> Two Latino candidates were seeking seats on the Oxnard elementary board. Some  Latino teachers charged last year that the board was insensitive to Latinos  after an incident in which board member Jack T. Fowler requested that a Latina  parent address the board in English, not Spanish.  </P> <P> Fowler, who was seeking his fourth term, appeared to be leading in early  returns.  </P> <P> "I feel I will be reelected," Fowler said. "The absentee ballots are a good  indicator." He said his mission is to educate students, "to teach them to read,  write and compute -- in English."  </P> <P> Board members William D. Hill and Dorothie J. Sterling were trailing  challengers Mary Barreto and Jim Suter. Hill was the only incumbent to receive  a teachers union endorsement.  </P> <P> Sterling said she is a firm believer that there is a reason for all things. "If  I'm not reelected there are other things for me to be doing."  </P> <P> She said it was a fair campaign and "it's up to the voters." She has served  five years on the board and was a teacher in the district for 32 years.  </P> <P> Suter, who was ahead in early returns, said, "I guess I knocked on a lot of  doors. I covered the whole city." He also targeted 4,000 absentee voters, he  said. "It cost me a fortune in stamps."  </P> <P> In Oxnard Union High School District, incumbents Janet Lindgren and Jean Daily  Underwood appeared to be keeping their seats. Challenger Nancy F. Koch, a  housewife whose four children have attended Rio Mesa High, appeared to be  leading the six-person race in early returns. Other challengers were Thomas D.  Ragan, Roy W. Lockwood and Angie P. Varela.  </P> <P> In the Hueneme district, the last time a new board member was elected was in  1973, sparking the chief complaint that the entire board, including the three  incumbents seeking reelection, has been in office too long.  </P> <P> Elaine K. Garber, an incumbent since 1959, received an endorsement from the  Hueneme Education Assn. She was the only incumbent who appeared to be keeping  her seat. Challengers Cheryl Hamilton and Darlene A. Bruno were out-polling  incumbents Jose C. Babauta and James K. Tipton. In the Ojai Unified School  District, where all three incumbents won endorsements from the teachers union,  only one challenger, Alan D. Fletcher, entered the race.  </P> <P> The Ojai incumbents were Robert Emhardt, a retired actor, who sought a third  term; Vincent W. France, a commander with the county Sheriff's Department who  has served on the board since 1979; and Muriel Sharkey Lavender, a real estate  broker first elected in 1977.  </P> <P> In other races, including Camarillo's Pleasant Valley Unified School District  and the Simi Valley Unified School District, few incumbents received union  endorsements.  </P> <P> In the Pleasant Valley district, discontent has been widespread among teachers  -- who say that they are underpaid and are not given respect -- and among some  parents, who say eastern Camarillo schools are overcrowded. Three seats were  available.  </P> <P> The teachers union did not endorse either incumbent, Barbara Ballard Miller or  Dolores (Val) Rains.  </P> <P> The incumbents were challenged by Jeanette L. (Jan) McDonald, who was supported  by a parents group upset by crowded schools in eastern Camarillo. Four other  challengers also entered the race.  </P> <P> In the Simi Valley district, five candidates, including six-term incumbent Lew  Roth, battled for two seats. Challengers were Douglas Crosse, Carla Kurachi,  Don Otto, and Karolyn J. Searight.  </P> <P> Kurachi, a newcomer to Simi Valley, appeared to be the top vote-getter in early  return. "I'm surprised at that big of a lead," she said. "I've lived out here  for 2 1/2 years. . . . I think I probably represent change."  </P> <P> Roth appeared to be maintaining his seat on the board.  </P> <P> Three seats were available in the Santa Paula Union High School District, where  some challengers had complained that the high turnover among the administrative  and teaching staff is hurting schools. The two incumbents, Donna Nelson and  Shirley Hendren, faced three challengers, including Robert J. Villa, the  district's former superintendent and a 20-year employee of Santa Paula schools.  </P> <P> In the 300-student Briggs Elementary School District in Santa Paula, Karen  MacConell, was the only of three incumbents running for reelection. Challengers  were Elizabeth Ikeda, Greg Patterson, Lloyd G. Simpson Jr. and Jeff Williams.  </P> <P> In Somis' Mesa Union Elementary School District, Patricia Fontes, a vice  principal, was the only incumbent seeking reelection. Challengers Fred J.  Ferro, Ralph A. Marchioni, Tomas Miranda Jr. and Barbara Tweedy Patten also  sought election in the one-school, 350-student district.  </P> <P> Stephanie Stassel, Joel Brand, Carol Weinstock and Thia Bell contributed to  this story.  </P></p>

			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Ofsted criticises maths and science teaching Mathematics and science teaching in the schools of England and Wales are 'not as strong as they should be', says a report published yesterday by Ofsted, the education watchdog. The popularity of science subjects among A-level pupils has declined and 'there is no room for complacency over the supply of well-qualified young adults for employment in engineering or science-related fields', it says. The proportion of those studying for science and mathematics A-levels only has fallen from 27.6 per cent in the early 1980s to 16.7 per cent this year. According to the Joint Mathematical Council this means that the proportion of the age group potentially qualified to study a science subject or engineering at university has fallen 40 per cent over the decade. Two-thirds of those studying science A-levels are doing so in combination with non-science subjects. The report says they are increasingly likely to choose accountancy, law or business studies courses in higher education, rather than science or engineering. A fall in the number of school-leavers is partly to blame, it adds. The proportion of all 18-year-olds taking science A-levels rose slightly over the last decade, with the proportion taking maths A-level rising from 6.5 per cent in 1983 to 7.7 per cent in 1993. But over the same period, the proportion attempting A-levels in English rose from 5.9 to 14.4 per cent. Ofsted said teaching of mathematics for children aged seven to 11, and of science for those from 11 to 14, needed to be improved. The narrowness of the three-subject A-level curriculum in the sixth form meant that most primary teachers did not have mathematics qualifications beyond GCSE, the level normally attained by the age of 16. As a result there was a problem with teachers' confidence in mathematics. Many had 'little theoretical understanding' about how progress in learning numbers occurs. In-service teacher-training should be expanded to meet this problem, the inspectors say. Mr Mike Tomlinson, Ofsted's director of inspection, said an expansion in spending on better teaching facilities, which last saw heavy investment in 1988 during the introduction of GCSE exams, might persuade more scientists to become teachers. He suggested this could be as much as Pounds 100m. Vandalism, theft and malicious fire cost schools in England and Wales Pounds 49m in the 1992-93 financial year, the Department for Education said yesterday. This represented a fall of 32 per cent from the costs created by crime the previous year, but insurance costs were estimated to have increased by 38 per cent to more than Pounds 66m - or about Pounds 3,000 per school.

			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EVERT, SUFFERING FROM EAR INFECTION, MAY BE FORCED TO MISS WIMBLEDON  </P> <P> Chris Evert withdrew Wednesday from a Wimbledon warm-up tournament because of  an ear infection that may force her to miss next week's Grand Slam event.  </P> <P> Evert's infection left her dizzy and nauseous. A doctor who examined her said  it could take anywhere from two days to a week for the illness to clear up.  </P> <P> Wimbledon starts its two-week run Monday, with Evert scheduled to play her  first-round match against Peanut Harper on Tuesday.  </P> <P> Asked if Evert would be able to play by then, Dr. Geoffrey Wilson said, "That I  cannot say. . . . No one can be sure."  </P> <P> Andy Mill, the 34-year-old tennis star's husband, said Evert still hoped to  play at Wimbledon, where she has reached at least the semifinals in all but one  of her 17 appearances.  </P> <P> "She has had two weeks' practice on grass, but obviously she had been hoping to  have a lot of match practice at Eastbourne this week," Mill said. "Now that is  out."  </P> <P> Evert was resting at her hotel in Eastbourne, and unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> The illness, which flared overnight after Evert beat Sara Gomer of Britain,  6-2, 6-0, in the second round of the Pilkington Ladies' Grass-Court  Championships, was the latest twist in the her quest to play at the All England  Lawn Tennis Club at least one more time.  </P> <P> Aiming to play in the French Open, where she has won a record seven singles  titles, Evert returned to the European clay-court circuit in mid-May but lost a  first-round match in Geneva to Barbara Paulus of Austria.  </P> <P> She flew home to Florida and announced she was skipping the French Open because  she lacked the motivation to win.  </P> <P> But saying Wimbledon was her favorite tournament, Evert flew to England to  prepare for the grass-court event.  </P></p>

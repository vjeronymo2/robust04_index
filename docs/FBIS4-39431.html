			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Pacific Ocean" Program] </F>   [Text] Kim Yong-sam, president of the Republic of Korea,  arrived in Vladivostok today after concluding bilateral talks in  Moscow. He was met at the airport by representatives of the  mass media of Russia and a number of foreign countries. Our  correspondent, Oleg Padenko, was present at the meeting, and  here is his report.    [Begin recording] The brief visit by Kim Yong-sam, president  of the Republic of Korea, took place immediately after his talks  with Boris Yeltsin and the signing of the joint Russo-Korean  declaration on economic, political, and cultural cooperation  between Moscow and Seoul. And here I will note that Kim  Yong-sam is the first president of the Republic of Korea to  visit Maritime Kray where 60,000 of his countrymen currently  reside having, in one way or another, settled here after the  Second World War. Thus, not only is Maritime Kray close to  South Korea geographically, but it also has special historical  significance for the Koreans. As was highlighted at this  meeting, Korean immigration to the Maritime Kray began over 100  years ago. Some settled here for reasons of poverty and war,  others with the aim of continuing the struggle for national  independence. For them, the Maritime Kray was the promised  land, a firm base for the struggle for independence.    It was also noted that the Maritime Kray now is  progressively  turning into a center for Russo-Korean cooperation.  Specifically, work on a joint fishing program is already being  actively carried out here. Our kray is directly associated with  the Yakutia, Republic of Sakha, gas project, and a new plan for  the development of natural resources of the Russian Far East.  Industrial cooperation is developing, evidenced as we know by  the creation of the Nakhodka Technical Park, comprised of Korean  enterprises; the establishment of sea routes connecting  Vladivostok and the port of Pusan; the commissioning of the  first direct Vladivostok-Seoul satellite telephone link here in  Vladivostok; and finally, the opening of regular air services  this year between Vladivostok and Seoul, the capital of South  Korea.    Today, the South Korean leader visited the Pacific Fleet's  combat ship Admiral Vinogradov, where he specifically noted that  such a visit is also a demonstration of partnership and mutual  cooperation in assuring international security, specifically on  the high seas.    During the brief talks with the high-ranking guest, Yevgeniy  Nazdratenko, governor of Maritime Kray, discussed the  possibility of mutually profitable ties and guarantees from  Seoul in attracting South Korean investment into the kray  economy, primarily capital investment in the coal producing  enterprises of the kray.

			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOODWILL GAMES;  </P> <P> IT'S MUCH CLOSER THIS TIME, BUT U.S. LOSES AGAIN;  </P> <P> ICE HOCKEY: SOVIET UNION, WHICH BEAT THE AMERICANS, 10-1, IN THE PRELIMINARY  ROUND, NEEDS A PENALTY-SHOT SHOOTOUT TO WIN GOLD-MEDAL GAME, 4-3.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union needed a penalty-shot shootout to beat the United States, 4-3,  at the Tacoma Dome and win the Goodwill Games hockey gold medal.  </P> <P> It was the closest the Americans have come to beating a Soviet national team in  an international event since 1980 and the Miracle on Ice in the Lake Placid  Olympics.  </P> <P> The United States led, 3-2, in the final minute, but Valeri Kamensky sent the  game into overtime with his third goal with 21 seconds left.  </P> <P> In the shootout used for the Goodwill Games after a scoreless 10-minute  overtime, the Soviets outscored the U.S. team, 2-0, through four shots.  Alexander Semak and Dimitri Khristich beat goaltender Guy Hebert, who made four  saves to preserve the shootout win over Canada Saturday.  </P> <P> The Americans were trying to protect their slim lead late in the third period  when Kamensky took a cross-ice pass and fired a slap shot past Hebert to  complete his hat trick. Both teams were down a man.  </P> <P> The Soviets stepped up offensive pressure in the overtime, taking the kind of  clear, hard shots on goal largely denied them in regulation. Several  spectacular saves by Hebert prevented a score.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union had scored first on a goal by Kamensky 4:29 into the game.  </P> <P> But the Americans, routed, 10-1, by the Soviets in the preliminary round,  played tough defense, seldom allowing the Soviets a clear shot at Hebert. The  Soviets had 36 shots in regulation to just 17 by the United States, but few of  the shots were from close-range.  </P> <P> The United States bounced back in the second period, scoring twice in quick  succession, to the delight of a capacity crowd of 17,442, which chanted  "U.S.A., U.S.A.!" waved American flags and booed loudly at every perceived  Soviet infraction.  </P> <P> Tim Sweeney's slapshot after he was fed the puck from the corner behind the  Soviet net tied the game at 6:23.  </P> <P> Less than a minute later, David Emma of Boston College passed to C.J. Young of  Harvard, whose shot from in front of the net got past goaltender Artur Irbe.  </P> <P> With both teams short a man, Kamensky tied it 2-2 at 15:09, taking the puck  down the ice and firing it past Hebert from the left.  </P> <P> But 33 seconds later, Emma beat the Soviet defenders down the middle of the ice  after blocking a shot and beat Irbe at short range.  </P></p>

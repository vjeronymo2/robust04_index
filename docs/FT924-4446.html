			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / The bittersweet task of taking Amstrad private: Alan Sugar tells Tony Jackson there is no hidden agenda in his buy-out proposal Mr Alan Sugar has been talking to the newspapers a lot lately. This is not in character, but he has his reasons. He has until next Wednesday to persuade his shareholders to sell his company back to him. He is pretty sure the institutions will play ball. He is a good deal less sure about his army of private investors. In spite of his supposed aversion to publicity, Mr Sugar is a master of the media. The general press comes away with a portrait of Essex Man, aggressive and profane. The financial press is confronted by the sober and thoughtful businessman. However, either way, the main nagging question for shareholders remains: why does he really want to take Amstrad private? The answer seems in two parts. First, Mr Sugar is a proud man: if Amstrad is finished, its demise will be a private affair. Second, he has an insatiable thirst for cash: not wealth tied up in the business, but the stuff itself. The first point is not as obvious as it looks. There is nothing diffident about Mr Sugar. In spite of Amstrad's fall from grace, his self-belief seems unshakeable. But he is deeply touchy about being beholden to anyone, the City in particular. It is revealing that throughout the weeks of argument over the buy-out, he has not once visited the City to put his case to the institutions. 'I don't want to convince anyone of anything,' he said this week. 'I don't want to go down there and have to talk my heart out to them. They've got the figures, they've got the money on the table, and they'll make their own minds up.' But this is, after all, a straightforward commercial transaction. If it involved the supply of electronics instead of shares, he would travel to Taiwan or Hong Kong at the drop of a hat. The City is just 30 minutes from his office by train. Is he too proud to ask? 'Maybe. But I'm not asking their permission, I'm suggesting it to them.' He is also prompted by a broader sense of ego. 'I don't want to be considered one of the failing entrepreneurs of the '80s. I want to gracefully bow out - temporarily, short-term, long-term or whatever.' This suggests he is not necessarily turning his back on the City for ever. This is where the thirst for cash comes in. As a public company, Amstrad has made very little call on shareholders' money. But for Mr Sugar, this is not the point. 'Being public was a great advantage for me. How? Because I've sold lots of shares and made a personal fortune.' But surely the company would have been worth as much private? Not to him, he explains patiently. 'Look, in 1980 I had a company which was worth nothing. I sold 25 per cent of it for Pounds 2m. So in the first year I had Pounds 2m, didn't I, which I didn't have before. Two years later I sold another Pounds 2m worth, and two years after that I sold Pounds 4m worth, and a few years after that I sold Pounds 25m worth, and then last year I sold Pounds 34m worth. That all went into my pocket.' What did he want the money for? 'To buy property, for example. That's what I've done in the past five or six years. That's a form of insurance in a very stable and safe, boring investment: reasonably yielding, safe covenant, freehold commercial properties.' Mr Sugar's view of life begins to sound like that of a footballer or rock star, squirrelling the money away while the good times last. 'I don't see how you make that out,' he says. 'What's the point in owning shares in a public company if you can't sell them?' The question lies at the heart of the buy-out. 'I got criticised for selling my shares, and now I'm getting criticised for trying to buy them. So I'm stuck in the middle with 205m shares. What the bloody hell am I allowed to do? You ask me why I want to do the buy-out. One of the major reasons is to be able to realise my investment one day. OK?' There is a seeming paradox here. At the offer price of 30p a share, his one-third holding in the company is worth Pounds 62m. The remaining two thirds will cost Pounds 113m. Thus, to realise Pounds 62m of assets the debt-averse Mr Sugar is borrowing Pounds 93m and paying another Pounds 20m of his own cash on top. But the paradox is easily resolved. More than half the borrowing will be from Amstrad itself. The rest will be repaid next summer, presumably through the partial liquidation of the business if necessary. This is the answer to shareholders who suspect that Mr Sugar has some grand plan up his sleeve. When he goes private, he says, he will do little different from now. 'Except, if I want to, one day I can close the company down, liquidate it in a nice orderly fashion and put the money in the bank. Or perhaps I can find someone to buy it off me in a couple of years' time - not try to pass it on and make a quick buck, as people are accusing me of now.' The accusation plainly rankles. 'If the shareholders were to turn me down, one has to take it quite bluntly that they think I've been lying to them. I've told them it's best for them to get out. If they don't believe me, it's because they think I'm trying to trick them. That's the most hurtful thing at the moment.' But if it did happen? 'I would have to protect my investment. I've said I would sell today at 31p so long as someone offered all the shareholders the same deal. If they turned me down, I'm not saying I would do the same in the future. 'Suppose someone came along and offered me 30p for all my shares. It's obvious that these people don't want 30p, so I might take it and go. No one will ever tie me down to anything. At the moment, the shareholders come first in my mind. They don't believe it, but they do. If the offer is turned down, I come first.' Since Amstrad is Mr Sugar, the idea of someone offering him 30p a share for the company on its own seems unlikely. There is also rather an ugly air of threat about the whole argument. But Mr Sugar's contention is only that he is an honest man. Probably not even he would insist that he is a nice one as well.</p>

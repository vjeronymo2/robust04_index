			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / International Company News: QVC raises objections to Paramount auction rules QVC Network, the television shopping company making a hostile Dollars 10bn takeover bid for Paramount Communications, yesterday raised a string of objections to the ground-rules announced by Paramount for an auction of the company. Paramount retorted that it believed its plan 'will provide the best value to Paramount shareholders, will provide a level playing field for all bidders and, ultimately, will permit the Paramount shareholders to make their own choice if all the bidders co-operate'. The exchange follows Paramount's announcement on Tuesday of the procedures it will adopt to comply with an order by the Delaware Supreme Court that it create a level playing field between bids for the company from QVC and cable company Viacom. Paramount, having reached a friendly Dollars 9.5bn takeover agreement with Viacom, had previously refused to consider seriously QVC's higher offer. Paramount announced on Tuesday that it would hold a single round of bidding, with each bidder submitting its best and highest offer by next Monday, December 20. QVC complained that the procedures provided 'no assurance of fair treatment'. Mr Martin Lipton, QVC's legal adviser, said in a letter to Lazard Freres, Paramount's financial adviser, that the past record of the Paramount board 'does nothing to inspire QVC's confidence that the board will be objective in exercising the unbridled discretion it has reserved to itself - particularly in that those who orchestrated the past violations are going to continue to be intimately involved in the process'. He complained that the procedures purported to reserve to the board the power to extend the submission date for bids; to 'negotiate' the bid of one bidder with the other; and to 'change the procedures at any time without prior notice'. He said if QVC were the higher bidder on December 20, the Paramount board might 'negotiate' the QVC bid with Viacom, 'extend' the submission date and elicit a higher Viacom bid. On the other hand, if Viacom were the higher bidder, the board could close the bidding and block any subsequent, higher QVC offer. Mr Lipton proposed a series of changes to the procedures, and added that QVC would have preferred a system of 'open and public bidding until the highest offer is received'. Paramount said it would review his ideas and make any adjustment to its procedures necessary to make the process work effectively.</p>

			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / West ponders how to aid Russia: Tight economic policies needed to stop waste AS President Boris Yeltsin's political troubles help focus western minds on the need to accelerate assistance for his economic reforms, the question of how to deliver help becomes more urgent than ever. One reason why the west has not produced large-scale finance for Russian economic reform is because of doubts that it would achieve its purpose. The banking and distribution systems are extremely primitive, capital flight and corruption are big problems, and the bureaucracy is slow and inept. Even Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy prime minister for economics and finance who arrives in Hong Kong today for talks with the Group of Seven industrialised countries, agrees that stopping aid from being wasted is the biggest headache. Without tight economic policies, all would be lost. The stakes are high. If the aid does not reach its targets, the risk of a political backlash against reform in Russia is heightened. If aid is not controlled, it might just provide a financial cushion to delay reform. There is also pressure for aid to go beyond new loans. Much of the Dollars 24bn (Pounds 17bn) package promised by the west last year was limited to loans guaranteed by western governments for imports of western goods and equipment. A new emphasis would target western cash at projects to show concrete benefits and even help Russia generate hard currency. The World Bank would lead such efforts, which include, for example, a plan to finance equipment to cap gas flares in Russia's oil industry. This thinking is even being applied to the International Monetary Fund, last year charged with administering western financial assistance to Russia in return for reforms which never materialised. Diplomats say the G7 is now considering the creation of a special fund, to be run by the IMF, to finance specific programmes. One - approved by the Russian premier, Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin - would organise five model bankruptcies in key sectors. This would send a warning to enterprises squandering state support and instruct officials and judges on how to implement Russia's first bankruptcy law in 70 years. Another idea is for the IMF to take on the burden of subsidies at present provided by Moscow to the former Soviet republics through the issue of credits from the Russian Central Bank. Mr Fyodorov says that last year Russia spent the equivalent of Dollars 18bn subsidising the former republics. Technical assistance might also draw more on examples which have worked well so far. One model is the work of the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private sector development arm, which is working in the provinces to help local authorities privatise shops, big enterprises, and even land. Mr Mikhail Gurtovoi, who last year headed a government commission to fight corruption until it was disbanded, suggests that plants equipped with western machinery but not completed under inefficient state management should simply be given to western companies. Completed and run by westerners, they would provide models of efficiency and jobs.</p>

			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: THE AD CAMPAIGN  </P> <P> The race: Governor. Whose ad: Republican Pete Wilson.  </P> <P> In his third television ad unveiled since formally winning the GOP  gubernatorial primary over little opposition last Tuesday, Sen. Pete Wilson  presents himself as the best candidate on environmental issues. At the same  time, the ad attacks campaign tactics used by his Democratic opponent, former  San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, in defeating state Atty. Gen. John K. Van  de Kamp -- the closest ally to environmental groups -- in the Democratic  primary election.  </P> <P> Environmental leaders say that Feinstein has made "strong positive campaign  pledges" on environmental issues, but her mayoral job did not give her the  opportunity to build a comprehensive record on statewide issues. The League of  Conservation Voters credited Wilson with a strong record in some areas, but  said he was notably weak in others. It gave the strongest assessment to Van de  Kamp.  </P> <P> Ad: "If you supported John Van de Kamp in the primary, remember how Dianne  Feinstein beat him. The Times said Feinstein's brutal negative ad 'tastelessly  exploits film of a murdered woman's body' to make 'false accusations' against  Van de Kamp."  </P> <P> Analysis: The ad quotes an editorial from June 2 editions of the Los Angeles  Times that criticized the Feinstein commercial for claiming that Van de Kamp  "tried to drop murder charges against the Hillside Strangler." In fact, as Los  Angeles County district attorney, Van de Kamp declined to prosecute Angelo  Buono on murder charges because he thought the case was too weak and he instead  planned to bring sex charges against Buono while investigators sought more  evidence to support a murder charge. Buono was convicted of murder in a trial  on charges brought by the attorney general's office under now-Gov. George  Deukmejian. The same Times editorial also criticized Van de Kamp for unfairly  claiming that Feinstein was "a pawn of the insurance industry."  </P> <P> Ad: "But you can still vote for a candidate who has won praise from the Sierra  Club on his fight for clean air, whose environmental record was judged better  than Feinstein's by the League of Conservation Voters and who fought three  national administrations to stop offshore drilling."  </P> <P> Analysis: Wilson did receive strong praise in a letter from Sierra Club  President Richard Cellerius this spring for "your overwhelming support for  strengthening amendments to the Senate version of the Clean Air Act." Cellerius  expressed thanks for Wilson's "consistent support of strong legislation for  clean air as well as other environmental protection measures."  </P> <P> While the League of Conservation Voters did not rank the candidates in any  order, its assessment of their records gave the strongest marks in seven  categories to Van de Kamp followed by Wilson and then Feinstein. It was  difficult to compare Feinstein's record to those of Wilson and Van de Kamp, but  the league commended her for support of coastal protection, sewage pollution  control and San Francisco's municipal transit system; said she had a moderate  record on toxics but no leadership role, and gave her mixed, but generally  negative, marks on growth control in downtown San Francisco.  </P> <P> Wilson has been a consistent leader in the Senate in opposition to additional  offshore oil exploration and drilling in federal waters off the California  coast, putting him in direct opposition to the policies of the Reagan and Bush  administrations.  </P></p>

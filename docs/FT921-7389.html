			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Food: Designer ladles can be costly - Philippa Davenport and Giles MacDonogh and their tasters try commercial stocks and supermarket soups - with surprising results LEFT TO my own devices I should be quite happy with a bowl or two of soup at lunchtime. Unfortunately, my life does not always allow for such simple solutions; but there are generally three or four days a week when I get away with it, writes Giles MacDonogh. Over the years a good deal of agony has gone into finding the right solution to the problem of lunchtime soup. These days I tend to keep over some cooked vegetables from the night before and ally them to something fresh that I can mince up fine. Some stock (if nothing else the pots from Sainsbury will do) activates the mix. The process has taken ten minutes so far, and in ten minutes I will have wholesome soup. I use no thickeners apart from a tot of cream if that is to hand. These soups can be simple or eccentric, occasionally even baroque; but I like them and only I have to eat them. It was not always so: in the old days I used to peruse the supermarket shelves for commercial offerings. Tinned soups do not tempt me. Occasionally I have bought jars of French fish soup but these work out expensive and half has to be put back into the fridge to be eaten the next day at the latest. It was for this reason that I was originally excited by the chilled soups produced in cartons by the New Covent Garden Soup Company: the soups filled two bowls; monthly specials added to a range which grew ever broader; the packaging looked nice. In short, the producers led you to believe that this was soup as mother made it. But it was not. Since the soups were launched I have tasted virtually all of them with the exception of high-octane blends such as brussels sprouts and chestnuts. The soups are sticky with flour and lacking in flavour. An obsession with vegetarians has meant that meat stocks are often shunned. When they are used (in the chicken and coriander, for example) they tend to be greasy and unappetising. More recently, I have tried a couple of fish soups and found neither of these exceptional. Covent Garden drove me back to the chopping board; for this reason alone I offer thanks. The New Covent Garden Soup Company has been a runaway success. Rare is the sandwich shop that cannot offer its soups for the office kitchen. Naturally, the supermarkets would also like to cash in on the chilled soup business but something has prevented them from making a go of it. For a while Sainsbury joined Waitrose in putting out an own-label soup bought in from Covent Garden but they have since abandoned the practice. Will Sainsbury's and other supermarkets make a come-back with soups of their own? Watch this space. For the time being there are just Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer, with the latter buying in soups from other suppliers. Last week, I obtained samples of the ranges offered by both supermarkets and, assembling a team to taste them with me, I gave myself over to chilled soup. Both Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer produced a tomato soup. The Waitrose came with (dried) basil. Neither had a fresh tomato taste. M &amp; S was billed as a cream and advertised some fancy ingredients such as Mascarpone cheese. People were chiefly put off by the 'day-glow orange' colour of the soup. The M &amp; S nonetheless won by a head. Waitrose's French-style fish soup was similar to Covent Garden's offering in this line. My jury found it watery and I found one of them poking at a sad, rubbery piece of crab she had found at the bottom. A professional chef described it as 'weak court bouillon.' The M &amp; S bisque was the colour of plaster. The floury texture found few takers but it was a mite more popular than the Waitrose soup. The Waitrose scotch broth with its peas, carrots and barley seemed indistinguishable from a canned soup; while an oxtail soup from M &amp; S reminded everyone of gravy. More positive criticism was meted out for the Waitrose winter vegetable although there were grumbles about 'dried garlic' and stock-cube stock. Genuine enthusiasm greeted the M &amp; S minestrone. It looked impressive in the pan and neither pasta nor vegetables were overcooked. No one detected the parmesan announced on the pot but the garlic found favour. The M &amp; S mushroom was also well received. One of the jury went so far as to say that: 'It's like mushroom soup you make yourself.' M &amp; S leek and potato also scored over half marks with the caveat that it could be 'leekier.' 'Might be better cold,' wrote one. All the soups produced two scant servings. This made them suitable for lunch or as a preamble to a meal for two. Prices started at Pounds 1.30 so it would make no financial sense buying two pots for four; especially given how cheap and easy to make soup is. The only soup in the range which could not have been quickly produced was the oxtail, but nobody liked this anyway.</p>

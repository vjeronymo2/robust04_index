But the U.S. bellicose elements are making a  mistake.    Socialism of Korea is an invincible socialism which cannot  be  destroyed with anything.    The kernel of the invincibility of the DPRK is the great  singlehearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses.  The community of destiny, an integral whole of ideology and  purpose in which ideology is one, and the destiny and weal and  woe are shared by all -- this is the singlehearted unity of  Korea. This singlehearted unity in which the leader, the party  and the masses form a harmonious whole is a unity which is  hardened like steel in a grim test. In March last year a  touch-and-go crisis was created, which might trigger off a war  any moment, due to the reckless war manoeuvres of the U.S.  imperialists and the South Korean authorities. In a few days  more than 1.5 million young people volunteered to the Korean  People's Army. Five million youths and students vowed to defend  their leader, their party and the socialist homeland with their  lives, becoming 5 million rifles and 5 million bombs. Hundreds  of thousands of veterans rose up like a giant, shouting "we will  take charge of defence." The entire people effected a great  upswing in socialist construction with a rifle in one hand and a  sickle or a hammer in the other. This is the strength of  singlehearted unity mightier than thousands of nuclear bombs.    With this singlehearted unity, the Korean people are afraid  of nothing and have no unconquerable fortress.    The DPRK is invincible as it has a matchless army which has  grown under the guidance of the great brilliant commander.    The People's Army is mighty Armed Forces with both modern  offensive and defensive means. Each man of it is prepared to be  the match for a hundred. He is an indomitable soldier with  faith and will to defend with his life the leader, the party and  the motherland under any circumstances.    The entire people are armed and the whole country is  fortified in Korea. The Worker-Peasant Red Guards and Young Red  Guards are fully ready for defending the country. The defence  industry guarantees the military equipment needed for the  defence of the country.    Though the imperialists put pressure upon Korea, threatening  economic "sanctions", the independent national economy remains  unshaken. This is another source of the invincibility of the  DPRK.    The Korean people have lived and are prepared to live on  rice  produced by them, clothes produced by them and daily necessities  produced by them.    The U.S. imperialists must not run wild. They may dispatch 6  million troops, not 600,000, and may deploy much more formidable  missiles than Patriot. But they cannot frighten the Korean  people.    The United States must ponder over the matter. If one likes  fire he is bound to get burnt.</p>

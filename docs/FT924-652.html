			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Arts: Prisoner of Zenda camps it up - Theatre Dungeons, swordfights, true love, intrigue and - best of all  - a hero who looks so like Prince Rudolph of Ruritania that he can impersonate him to all and sundry - yes, The Prisoner of Zenda has them all. Anthony Hope's novel is the most glorious trash ever written; you can snicker at Georgette Heyer but woe betide the smart Alec who thinks himself above The Prisoner of Zenda  -not to mention the sequel, Rupert of Hentzau. The best that can be said for this Greenwich staging is that it is a tolerable introduction to the joys of Zenda, and is surely excellent seasonal fare for office parties composed of people who have not read the original. And, since I was in a post-works-outing glow myself, I enjoyed myself a fair deal. Lez Brotherston has designed an ideal set, with crossbridges and staircases and walls that summon up all the various perilous locales. Mark Lockyer has much of the right dark daredevil allure for Rupert of Hentzau, and Melanie Jessop is as commanding and glamorous as Antoinette de Mauban should be. But Hope's novel and the Ronald Colman movie are both dear to my heart, and I incline to purism in Zenda matters. Matthew Francis's adaptation and staging not only hang fire, but they also encourage both players and audience to chuckle at the contrivances of this Ruritanian romance. The intoxicating story keeps tipping over into camp; and this is hard to forgive. As the two Rudolphs, David Haig lacks both virile beauty and heroic ardour; and what is The Prisoner of Zenda without those? Leonie Mellinger, a talented actress, underplays the nobility and high romance of the Princess Flavia. Nicholas Gecks is too mild for Black Michael (I found myself missing Raymond Massey in this role more than anyone from the 1937 Selznick movie). The production will undoubtedly improve in due course; injury robbed us of the swashbuckling we had been hoping for. But not only more swordfighting is needed. More seriousness is required too. At the Greenwich Theatre, until February 6</p>

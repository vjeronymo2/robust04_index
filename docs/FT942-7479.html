			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Lep may partly float US arm to cut debt Lep Group, the lossmaking freight forwarding and security group restructured by its banks in 1992, is considering a partial US flotation of its American security business to reduce its Pounds 400m of debt. Mr David James, the company doctor who was brought in as chairman by the banks, said he was 'mindful of the opportunity for a major refinancing' of National Guardian given the 'very favourable market conditions'. He said that electronic security companies, of which National Guardian is one of the top four in the US, have been accorded high share ratings on Wall Street, partly because of strong market growth following the bombing of the World Trade Centre. He stressed that the group would not consider floating off the whole of the subsidiary and had turned away potential trade buyers. National Guardian increased its operating profit from Pounds 13m to Pounds 19.9m last year, on turnover of Pounds 127.9m (Pounds 100.2m), helping to push the group operating figure to Pounds 29.9m (Pounds 24.9m). The banks' debt-for-equity swap in 1992 cut Lep's interest bill to Pounds 37.4m (Pounds 48.1m), reducing the pre-tax loss from Pounds 38.3m to Pounds 15.6m. The freight forwarding division made its first net profit since 1988 with the North American and Asia Pacific businesses performing well and signs of recovery in Europe. The company repeated previous warnings that there would be no return to dividend payments for the foreseeable future. Losses per share were cut to 2.1p (9.7p). Group borrowings rose to Pounds 410m (Pounds 386m) because of crystallisation of bank guarantees, the rise in the dollar and acquisitions by National Guardian. But debt will be reduced by Pounds 87.5m following January's sale of Swiss Bank House. Shareholders' funds fell to Pounds 40.8m (Pounds 45.3m) compared with a market value of Pounds 43.8m with the shares unchanged at 4 3/4 p. Mr James said that the subsidiaries' profits would have to advance further for their realisation price to make 'a significant impact on core debt'.</p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Overhaul of pensions proposed UK PENSIONS need a radical overhaul including sharp increases in the basic state pension and the introduction of a new national personal pension scheme which will invest in a new class of government bond, the Institute for Public Policy Research urges. In a review of UK state and private pension provision, the left-of-centre think tank argues that the government's increasing reliance on personal pensions for retirement provision is badly misguided. The cost of operating a personal pension is about four times that of state schemes and can offer a reasonable level of benefit to a very limited percentage of the population, the institute says. It adds that personal pensions are not practical for those earning less than Pounds 8,000 to Pounds 9,000 a year because they cannot contribute enough to make the contract worthwhile. The average salary for those without an occupational pension scheme, for whom personal pensions are advised, is about Pounds 8,750. Instead of relying on private pensions, the government should substantially increase state pension benefit, at a minimum, to the income support level for pensioners and also pay a minimum housing benefit, the institute proposes. It says the increases could be financed by restoration of the Treasury supplement to the National Insurance Fund and the cost be covered in part by the abolition of the existing income tax age allowance. Necessary tax increases among the working population could be phased in sufficiently slowly to have minimal effects on workers' take-home pay. The IPPR also urges an overhaul of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme, with the government creating a new National Personal Pension Scheme to be funded by member contributions which will effectively be long-term savings. It suggests the investment of these contributions in a new government security - 'national insurance pension bonds' - with the capital value linked to an index of national average earnings. Interest would be in line with the assumptions underlying calculations of tax incentives offered to those who contract out of this type of provision. The IPPR is further urging an overhaul of occupational pensions regulation which would include rules protecting the benefits of those who switch jobs, among other things. And for those whose employer makes no pension provision, there should be industry schemes. Better Pensions for All, Bryn Davies.

			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / North-east England quoted company sector gains momentum The importance of the quoted company sector in north-east England increased significantly last year, demonstrating that the region's economy has regained momentum, a survey by accountancy firm Price Waterhouse has found, Chris Tighe writes. The north-east's quoted companies recorded turnover of Pounds 3.5bn last year, up 12 per cent on 1992. Pre-tax profits grew 30 per cent to Pounds 326m. In the 1980s, 23 of the quoted companies disappeared because of takeovers, receiverships and relocations but the survey says this trend now appears to have been reversed. At the end of last year the region had 29 quoted companies, two more than a year before. There are now 30 and another flotation is planned this summer.</p>

			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: Low prices take toll on Kaiser Kaiser Aluminum, the US aluminium smelter and producer of aluminium products, suffered a fourth-quarter operating loss of Dollars 82m, or Dollars 1.42 a share. This compares with an operating gain of Dollars 4.4m or 7 cents per share in the previous fourth quarter. Sales for the quarter dipped to Dollars 415.9m, from Dollars 496m a year ago. For the year, Kaiser recorded an operating loss of Dollars 123.4m, or Dollars 2.15, compared with operating income of Dollars 89.9m, or Dollars 1.57, in fiscal 1992. Sales for the year were Dollars 1.7bn, down from Dollars 1.9bn a year ago. Although Kaiser, like most other US aluminium producers, reduced plant capacity and engaged in other cost-cutting measures in 1993, low prices, created by worldwide oversupply, battered the company's results, said Mr George Haymaker, chairman. Kaiser is 67-per cent owned by the Houston-based natural resources company, Maxxam. Although Maxxam's forest products division made Dollars 12.9m profits in the fourth quarter, overall results were swamped by Kaiser's losses. Maxxam reported a net fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 63.4m, or Dollars 6.71, on sales of Dollars 503m, compared with a loss of Dollars 10.3m, or Dollars 1.09, on sales of Dollars 576.5m a year ago.</p>

Separating the entrepreneurs' blocks (C and F) from all other blocks entails little loss of efficiency because most firms are likely to be interested in licenses in either the entrepreneurs' blocks or the non-restricted blocks, but not both. Large firms cannot bid on entrepreneurs' licenses, although they may partner with firms that can. Small firms can bid on all blocks, but are likely to be most interested in the entrepreneurs' blocks because on these blocks they would not be placed in the position of bidding against large firms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 39. In addition to reducing the complexity of the auctions, auctioning block C licenses after the block A and B licenses is likely to further another objective of auction design_fostering designated entity participation_by enabling designated entities to more easily attract partners. Many potential partners may be unwilling to commit themselves to a partnership arrangement with designated entities prior to the auction of licenses on the A and B blocks. So, designated entities that are unable to raise independent financing for at least the required upfront and down payments may have difficulty participating in an auction in which block C is put up for bid simultaneously with blocks A and B. If, however, block C is auctioned after blocks A and B, we expect that non-designated entities who are unsuccessful in acquiring MTA licenses on blocks A and B will want to become partners with or make investments in designated entities so as to gain an interest in 30 MHz licenses on block C. In addition, the auction on blocks A and B will produce price information that would be valuable to designated entities in their business planning. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40. The efficiency loss associated with separating the large unrestricted blocks (A and B) from the small ones (D and E) depends on the degree of substitutability and complementarity between licenses in these two groups. Auctioning licenses on the D and E blocks separately from those on the A and B blocks may make it more difficult for bidders to pursue a back-up strategy of combining two 10 MHz licenses in the same geographic areas as an alternative to acquiring 30 MHz licenses in the A or B blocks. We believe, however, that this is not likely to be a widely used strategy, because the licenses are defined on a BTA basis while the licenses on the A and B blocks are defined on a MTA basis. It is also possible that some bidders may wish to combine a 10 MHz license with a 30 MHz license in the same geographic area. Although this approach would be easier to pursue if blocks A, B, D and E were auctioned together, we believe that in most cases the amount bidders would be willing to pay for a block A or B license would not be strongly affected by whether they were able to acquire a complementary block D or E license. So auctioning blocks D and E after blocks A and B would not significantly hinder combining 30 MHz and 10 MHz licenses. We conclude that the benefits of administrative simplicity from auctioning license on blocks A and B separately from those on blocks D and E are likely to outweigh the possible loss of efficiency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Bid Increments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 41. In using simultaneous multiple round auctions to award broadband PCS licenses, it is important to specify minimum bid increments. <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  The bid increment is the amount or percentage by which the bid must be raised above the previous round's high bid in order to be accepted as a valid bid in the current bidding round. The application of a minimum bid increment speeds the progress of the auction and, along with activity and stopping rules, helps to ensure that the auction comes to closure within a reasonable period of time. Establishing an appropriate minimum bid increment is especially important in a simultaneous auction with a simultaneous closing rule. In that case, all markets remain open until there is no bidding on any license, and a delay in closing one market will delay the closing of all markets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Second Report and Order at &para;&para;124&hyph;126.

Because we plan to use simultaneous multiple round auctions to award broadband PCS licenses, we believe that it is necessary to impose a minimum bid increment to ensure that the broadband PCS auctions conclude within a reasonable period of time. Commenters addressing the issue generally supported a minimum bid increment of 5 percent. PacTel, for example, argues that this amount will provide a reasonable compromise between the goal of completing the auction quickly and that of revealing information about the distribution of valuations among bidders. <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  As we recognized in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Second Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , it is important in establishing the amount of the minimum bid increment to express such increment as the greater of a percentage and fixed dollar amount.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Second Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at &para;126. This will ensure a timely completion of the auction even if bidding begins at a very low dollar amount. Accordingly, we will impose a minimum bid increment of some percentage of the high bid from the previous round or a dollar amount per MHz per pop, whichever is greater, in broadband PCS auctions where multiple round bidding is used. <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  comments of PacTel, Exhibit by R. Preston McAfee, Auction Design for Personal Communications Services at 16. Milgrom and Wilson also recommend a minimum bid increment of 5 percent (subject to a dollar minimum and maximum) for stage I of the auction, and smaller percentages for stages II and III.

For example, for a 30 MHz license with a population of 10 million, if the minimum bid increment were the greater of 5 percent or $0.02 per MHz per pop, the minimum bid increment would be $6 million ($0.02&times;30 MHz&times;10,000,000) when the high bid from the previous round is less than $120 million. If the high bid from the previous round exceeds $120 million, the minimum bid would be 5 percent of the value of that bid (since 5 percent of a bid over $120 million is greater than $6 million). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

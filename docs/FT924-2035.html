			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Anglo United Pounds 22.7m in red ANGLO UNITED, owner of the Coalite smokeless fuel business, yesterday confirmed details of a restructuring plan which was mainly responsible for a Pounds 22.7m pre-tax loss for the half year to September 30. Last year's Pounds 3m pre-tax profit was wiped out by the cost of restructuring, included in an exceptional charge of Pounds 11.2m, compared to a gain of Pounds 6.2m from disposals. Only six months after Anglo won approval from its banks to pay off short-term borrowings from disposals, it was forced to reschedule its debts after customers cut their orders and Pounds 50m of disposals fell through at the last moment. Anglo was faced with a Pounds 16.3m interest bill and Pounds 7m outstanding from this year's debt repayment, as operating profits fell from Pounds 13.4m to Pounds 4.68m. Sales declined to Pounds 243.5m (Pounds 269.1m). The group had expected to sell Liquid Fuels to a regional electricity company for Pounds 42m in August. The day before contracts were to be signed the electricity company said it would only pay Pounds 23m, which Anglo refused to accept. A week later further disposals, worth Pounds 8.5m, fell through. Mr David McErlain, chairman, said: 'This was a very clear signal, if we needed one, that selling businesses in the current climate is impossible. It was at this point we decided to go straight back to the banks to restructure our debts.' Under the terms of the proposed agreement Anglo's debt of Pounds 250m - which includes Pounds 10m of interest payments due in February - would be reduced to Pounds 180m of which Pounds 50m would have deferred interest payments. Pounds 45m would be converted into new ordinary shares at a premium to Anglo's share price, which yesterday closed 1 1/2 p down at 6p. Pounds 25m would be issued in zero coupon convertible loan notes which could be converted between now and within ten years at a premium to the existing share price. Warrants would also be issued to shareholders on the same terms. Interest payments on Pounds 50m of debt would be deferred for up to 10 years. Existing preference shares would be converted into new ordinary shares on enhanced conversion terms. Losses per share were 7.1p (earnings 1.3p). The interim dividend is passed (0.2p). COMMENT Even back in the good old days of the late eighties borrowing Pounds 440m debt to acquire a company for Pounds 500m was not without its risks. But the combination of three years of recession and last year's exceptional mild winter has finally scuppered Anglo's hopes of keeping to its debt repayment schedule. In the circumstances its proposed deal with its banks does not look too bad. If the loan notes and warrants are not converted, shareholders will keep control of the company, unlike at Heron, for example, where the banks and bondholders are being offered 95 per cent of the equity. Anglo's banks are only likely to convert their loan notes if there is a big increase in the share price - which pre-supposes a bid or a very cold winter.</p>

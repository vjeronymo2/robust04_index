			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / UK Company News: BM dismisses 'ill-conceived' petition BM Group, the engineering company, hit back yesterday at the petition filed at the High Court by three of the preference shareholders of Blackwood Hodge, the company it acquired in 1990. Describing the petition as 'ill-conceived', Mr Alun Hicks, group finance director, said: 'BM remains firmly of the view, with the benefit of robust legal advice, that the petition has no legal merit.' The petition, which was filed on November 30, alleges that the affairs of Blackwood Hodge have been conducted in a manner prejudicial to the interests of its preference shareholders.</p>

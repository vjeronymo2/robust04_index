			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / CBS chief in talks on rescue bid for Canary Wharf MR LARRY TISCH, the billionaire US chairman of the CBS television network, has had talks with Mr Paul Reichmann about making a joint rescue bid for Canary Wharf, the financially troubled east London property development. Financiers with a close knowledge both of Mr Reichmann, who created the 4.5m sq ft Docklands development, and Mr Tisch confirmed that discussions have been taking place. Canary Wharf is in administration under UK insolvency procedures. Bankers to the project fear it will be liquidated unless a successful takeover bid can be made before the end of September. Mr Tisch's net worth has been estimated by Forbes, the US financial magazine, at Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 730m). Apart from controlling CBS, Mr Tisch is also chairman of Loews Corporation, the family group that had Dollars 13.6bn of turnover last year and has interests in insurance, cigarettes, hotels, watchmaking, shipping and oil and gas drilling. However, a final decision on whether to participate has not yet been taken by Mr Tisch. He is thought to be concerned about committing his capital while it remains uncertain whether the Jubilee line extension into Docklands will be built. Like other potential investors in Canary Wharf, he believes that the prospect for the development will be vastly improved if the line is built. But he is reluctant to make the Pounds 170m private sector contribution to the line's costs which has been demanded by the UK government. However, Mr Reichmann is understood to be hopeful that a deal can be struck. In a separate development, it also emerged that Britain's second biggest property company, MEPC, had contemplated and then decided against participating in a bid for Canary Wharf. Potential bidders who remain interested in joining a consortium bid include Richardson Brothers, the Midlands-based property developer. Other possible participants in any bid, with or without Mr Reichmann, are Hanson, the UK conglomerate, and British Land, the property company. The deadline for putting together a takeover package is probably the date of any decision by the government on whether to build the Jubilee line extension, since without the extension there is a greater prospect of Canary Wharf being liquidated, according to bankers.</p>

			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFING: EVENTS IN THE NEWS THIS WEEK  </P> <P> On Monday, the Costa Mesa Planning Commission will hear arguments for and  against a proposed 24-bed halfway house for recovering alcoholics and drug  addicts in the city's College Park neighborhood. The planned expansion of an  existing six-bed halfway house operated by a father-and-son team, both  recovering alcoholics, has drawn opposition from nearby residents who fear that  the facility would attract drunks and homeless people.  </P></p>

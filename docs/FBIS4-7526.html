			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report]  <H5>  Vukovar Officials Visit Exiles in </H5> Croatia    Vukovar Mayor Dr. Jure Kolak, Deputy Mayor Grgo Plenkovic,  and secretary of the Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ] city  council Petar Mlinaric reportedly visited Vukovar exiles in the  Makarska littoral region of Croatia to examine housing  accommodations and problems. According to the 13 March Split  daily SLOBODNA DALMACIJA, the exiles were "increasingly  disappointed with empty promises," and "felt abandoned." They  complained about "food, health services, and various types of  harassment." The major topic of conversation in the Alga Hotel,  where most of the Vukovar exiles are housed, was an impending  transfer of 170 exiles from Vukovar and about 90 from Slavonia  and Drnis in order to prepare the hotel for the tourist season.  However, the Vukovar exiles have already been moved as many as  six times and are refusing to consider another transfer, the  paper states. They also refuse to be moved into weekend houses  belonging to Serbs or into other facilities on the coast,  insisting on remaining in the Alga Hotel. The paper cites Mayor  Kolak as promising the exiles that no one would force them to  leave the hotel and that he would insist that the Croatian  Government improve their standard of living. The members of the  Vukovar leadership found "an even worse situation" among 180  sick and elderly Vukovar exiles housed in the Djuro Salaj resort  center in Grac. The delegation from Vukovar was also received  by Makarska Mayor Ivan Ivanda and other local officials. During  that meeting, Kolak expressed his gratitude to the city of  Makarska for taking such good care of the Vukovar exiles,  SLOBODNA DALMACIJA reports.  <H5>  Possible Violation of Sanctions Against Serbia </H5>   In an article titled "Is Western Bosnia a Banana Republic of  the Voce [Fruit] Enterprise?" the Zagreb weekly GLOBUS on 10  March reports that Fikret Abdic, president of the so-called  autonomous province of western Bosnia, and Croatian President  Franjo Tudjman held a "regular" meeting at the presidential  palace in Zagreb on 7 March, immediately after which Abdic, in  "his Mercedes with Vienna tags, accompanied by police vehicles,  drove to the main office of the Voce Import-Export enterprise,  which is today his most important, and perhaps only, business  partner." GLOBUS explains that Voce, based in Zagreb, "in just  a few months," had dispatched 30 million German marks' worth of  goods in the direction of Velika Kladusa in the autonomous  province of western Bosnia. The weekly maintains that the goods  were transported in about 100 convoys of trucks belonging to  Agrokomerc, a large agricultural and industrial firm located in  Velika Kladusa and headed by Abdic. Each of the convoys  transported about 400 metric tons of goods, GLOBUS reports, and,  in the last four months, tanker trucks had been transporting  about 200 tons of crude oil each. Voce bought the goods from  the Zagreb-based petroleum processor INA, other Croatian firms,  and "a few" Slovene firms, reselling them to the local  government in Velika Kladusa. All the convoys passed through  Serb-held Croatian territory, from Turanj, a suburb of Karlovac,  via Vojnici to Velika Kladusa. Since the quantity of goods  transported would be sufficient for a population three times  that of western Bosnia, "it is clear that Fikret Abdic is buying  the free passage of his convoys by reserving a portion of the  goods for Serbs in the occupied Croatian territories," GLOBUS  asserts. The weekly states that since all the goods sent to  Velika Kladusa came from Voce, the following questions should be  asked: "Has the firm violated the embargo against Serbia by  helping Fikret Abdic, whom the Government of Bosnia-Herzegovina  in Sarajevo has declared a traitor because of his trade with the  Serbs? Has Voce, with the blessing of the Croatian Government,  been selling the goods to Fikret Abdic...? Has Voce, once the  largest export firm in the former Yugoslavia, which lost the  majority of its partners after the disintegration of that former  state, created, in the autonomous province of western Bosnia, an  indispensable market for the sale of its goods?" GLOBUS cites  Jure Klaric, director of Voce, as admitting that "even today, we  are using the contacts that Fikret Abdic has established with  the Serbs."  <H5>  HDZ Conflicts Linked To Cement Factory Deal </H5>   Herceg-Bosna is not the only controversial topic among  leading Croatian politicians, says the 25 February GLOBUS. The  weekly comments that the case of the unsuccessful attempt in  1991 to sell the Split Dalmacijacement cement factory to the  Italian firm Calcestruzzi shows that the most intense political  conflicts in the Croatian Democratic Community are linked to  important economic issues. In the case of Dalmacijacement, the  weekly notes, a grave conflict emerged between the present chief  of the intelligence service, Hrvoje Sarinic, who was the head of  the Office of the President in 1991, and current Minister of  Trade Nadan Vidosevic, who was director of Dalmacijacement at  that time. GLOBUS publishes the minutes of a heated quarrel in  1991 between Sarinic and Vidosevic on the issue of the sale of  Dalmacijacement, commenting that the minutes, in addition to  revealing the extent of the previously unknown conflicts in the  HDZ leadership, also indicate how business decisions are made in  Croatia: "The minutes from Sarinic's office plainly show that  even today the main decisions in Croatia are made just as they  were during the communist regime.... The office of the  president tried to make the decision on a business deal worth  hundreds of millions of German marks [DM], against the will of  the Dalmacijacement management! Hrvoje Sarinic tried  two-and-a-half years ago to persuade, at all costs, the director  of Dalmacijacement to sell the enterprise to the Italians as  quickly as possible." Another significant issue, GLOBUS states,  is an alleged commission of $12.5 million, which, according to  the director of Calcestruzzi, was paid in 1991. The weekly adds  that it is believed in Croatian political circles that the money  was spent for government needs.  <H5>  Denationalization of Housing </H5>   The Croatian Government has drafted a proposal for the  return  of apartments and houses that the communist government  confiscated and nationalized after World War II, reports the 10  March GLOBUS. The owners, however, would be able to take  possession of them only after a period of three to 10 years.  GLOBUS points out that Croatian and foreign citizens who  participated in the "aggression against the Republic of Croatia"  would not have the right to retake possession of their  properties. About 43,000 apartments will have to be returned to  the owners from whom they were confiscated, and 150,000 current  occupants will therefore be looking for new homes, GLOBUS states.  <H5>  Apartments for Government Workers </H5>   The 15 March edition of the Zagreb weekly DANAS reports that  the Croatian Government, as part of its housing reform program,  plans to build 8,600 apartments for government workers in the  next 10 years. The construction cost of the apartments will  amount to DM670,800,000.  <H5>  Hotel Shares Sold </H5>   The sale of shares of the Solitudo tourist hotel enterprise  on the Adriatic island of Lastovo has been completed, says the  13 March SLOBODNA DALMACIJA. According to a decision by the  Croatian Privatization Fund, the enterprise has become a  shareholding company. The value of the enterprise has been  assessed at 25,557,873,600 Croatian dinars, or DM6,811,800. The  shareholders have bought 11 percent of the enterprise, paying a  total of DM758,600. Of the 44 shareholders, 20 are from Lastovo  and the remainder from other parts of Croatia.  <H5>  DM1 Million for Zadar Enterprise </H5>   At a 17 March public auction at the Zagreb stock market,  1,139 shares in three enterprises were sold for a total of  DM1,062,000, or 3.884 billion Croatian dinars. The report in the  18 March SLOBODNA DALMACIJA says that the largest number of  shares traded at this auction, the year's eleventh, was for the  Mehanizacija firm. The Croatia Bank purchased 999 shares of this  Zadar enterprise for approximately DM999,000. Ten shares of  Zagrebgradnja [Zagreb Construction] were sold to the Investco  brokerage company for DM50,000, while the Rijeka Bank bought 130  shares of the Rijeka Usluga [Services] enterprise for DM13,000.  <H5>  Shares of Solta Island Firm Sold </H5>   The 15 March issue of SLOBODNA DALMACIJA reports that the  entire offering of 51,325 shares, priced at DM100 each, in the  largest HTP [Hotel-Tourist Enterprise] firm on the Adriatic  island of Solta was sold in the last few days. The shares sold  represent half the enterprise's value. Shares constituting the  other half will be transferred to the Croatian Privatization  Fund, which will retain 10,400 of them, with a value of  DM1,040,000, for possible owner restitution and offer the  rest--40,925 shares--for public sale in the next 30 to 40 days.</p>

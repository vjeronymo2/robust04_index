			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: HOW ADJUSTABLE-RATE MORTGAGES DIFFER  </P> <P> QUESTION: Our adjustable mortgage payment has recently been increased due to  rising interest rates. But despite our higher monthly payment, the amount that  is actually allocated to the repayment of our loan principal has decreased. Is  this common with adjustable mortgages? -- M. A. A.  </P> <P> ANSWER: It can be; it all depends on the type of adjustable-rate mortgage you  have and the conditions governing it. According to our advisers, some  adjustable-rate mortgages limit the amount that monthly charges can be raised.  So if interest rates rise steeply, it is possible that the required increase in  your monthly payment would be greater than your mortgage agreement allows.  </P> <P> What happens? Your lender gets the money -- or at least some of it -- but it's  shifted from the principal repayment portion of the monthly payment to the  interest side. In an extreme case of rising interest rates and an  adjustable-rate mortgage with a ceiling on allowable increases, you could end  up with a large balloon payment or payments in the final years of the mortgage  to catch up with the principal repayment.  </P> <P> Even more dramatic would be "negative amortization." Here, instead of paying  off some of the principal each month -- even a slight amount -- you actually  end up owing a greater amount because your monthly payments do not cover the  full costs of the interest charges accrued by your loan.  </P> <P> The bottom line? Read the terms of your loan carefully to see what you sign and  how the loan will be administered over its full life. Even though you may think  you will sell your house well before the 30-year mortgage runs its full course,  you can never be sure.  </P> <P> </P> <P> IRS Allows Discount on Family Rentals  </P> <P> Q: We wish to rent a house to our son for an amount less than what we are  currently receiving for this unit. However, our tax consultant says we will be  taxed as though we had received the amount we had previously gotten. Is this  true, or can we charge our son a reasonable rental price based on the fact that  the house is next door to ours and that our son will eventually be required to  care of us as we become older? -- N. C. F.  </P> <P> A: Relax, say our advisers. You may rent the house to your son at a discount so  long as the rent you do charge is "reasonable."  </P> <P> What does that mean? Well, our advisers say the Internal Revenue Service  scrutinizes such deals carefully. A 20% discount below prevailing rental rates  is generally considered reasonable. Above that, they say, and you court  questions, although you can't be sure that the IRS would challenge an  arrangement with a discount greater than 20%.  </P> <P> Why does the IRS accept a discount for rentals to family members at all? It's a  good question. Our advisers say it is generally accepted that renting to a  family member poses less risk than renting to a total stranger, a factor that  takes some of the uncertainity out of being a landlord.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Do Homework Before Investing Abroad  </P> <P> Q: Can you tell me if interest earned from a foreign bank account is taxable? I  know it has to be reported, but I'm not sure if it's taxable each year or if  it's taxable only when it is withdrawn. -- A. G.  </P> <P> A: If you are a resident of the United States, the interest is probably  taxable, whether or not you actually withdraw the money. However, this subject  is quite complicated and fraught with ambiguity, intrigue and intense interest  by the IRS.  </P> <P> The actual application of U.S. tax laws on this interest depends on where your  foreign bank account is located and the exact terms of the treaties between the  U.S. and the foreign country. Offshore bank accounts are a well-known tax  dodge, and the IRS is aware of them. You would be advised to research  applicable agreements thoroughly before making any offshore deposits.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Another Point on IRA Withdrawals  </P> <P> Q: I am 68 years old and plan to retire soon. My individual retirement account  now allows me to reinvest any capital gains and dividends in additional shares  of stock. But what if I should direct that these distributions be paid directly  to me, rather than reinvested in new shares? Would the payments I receive be  treated as withdrawals from the account? -- H. F. B.  </P> <P> A: Yes, the Internal Revenue Service considers such payments account  withdrawals. And as such, they are subject to taxation. However, because you  are already over age 59 1/2 -- the minimum age at which withdrawals from  individual retirement accounts can be made -- no early withdrawal penalty is  assessed.  </P> <P> If you had not yet reached age 59 1/2, these distributions would be subject to  taxation as well as a 10% penalty for early withdrawal from your individual  retirement account.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Personal Expenses Can't Be Deducted  </P> <P> Q: I rent out my house at the beach during the summer. During these months, I  have to rent an apartment in which to live. Because my home mortgage is fully  paid, I have no monthly housing expenses during the year except the rent I pay  on the apartment during the summer. May I deduct my apartment rent as a  business expense to offset some of the income I receive from renting my beach  house out? -- A. M. W.  </P> <P> A: No. The Internal Revenue Service does not allow taxpayers to deduct personal  expenses as a business cost. It's just that simple.  </P> <P> Carla Lazzareschi cannot answer mail individually but will respond in this  column to financial questions of general interest. Please do not telephone.

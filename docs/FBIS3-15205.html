The Russian delegation  included the Russian president's envoy Vladimir Kazimirov and  Deputy Russian Defense Military Georgiy Kondratyev.    According to well-informed sources close to the president's  office, the Azerbaijani party pointed out that the formula of  settlement being worked out during the negotiations did not pay  appropriate attention to the Azerbaijani position. For  instance, no concrete terms for withdrawal of the Armenian  troops from the occupied Azerbaijani territories were mentioned.    The Azerbaijani president stressed that Baku stood for  immediate ceasefire in Nagorno-Karabakh, for troop withdrawal  and for negotiations. However, he believes this must be carried  out along with the Armenian troop withdrawal and return of  refugees to these regions. Azerbaijani also seeks guarantees  for security of returning refugees.</p>

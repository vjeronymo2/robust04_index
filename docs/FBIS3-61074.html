			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Colonel General Andrey Ivanovich Nikolayev, </F> newly appointed minister and commander-in-chief of the Border  Forces, by military observer Vladimir Klimov; date, place not  given: "We Are All Border Workers" -- first paragraph is  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA introduction]    [Text] The new minister, Colonel General Andrey Ivanovich  Nikolayev, commander in chief of the Border Forces, is a  third-generation soldier who has passed through all the trials  of service to achieve the big stars on his shoulder boards:  From being a platoon commander, he proceeded up each rung of  the command ladder. Industriousness and efficiency, knowledge  and an unconventional way of thinking -- resulting in not just  reprimands, but early promotions and two academies behind him.  He accepted as his destiny the move from the General Staff to  the Border Forces. A new stage in the border guards' life began  with the presidential Edict on the Creation of the Federal  Border Service (FBS). We offer for your attention an interview  by our military observer Vladimir Klimov with Col. Gen. A.  Nikolayev.  <H5>  How To Equip the Border </H5>   [Klimov] What is fundamentally new in the Border Forces'  tasks and functions?    [Nikolayev] First and foremost the separation of the Border  Forces into an independent structure with the rights of a  ministry can in no way be regarded as a repetition of the story  of the creation of the Committee for the Protection of State  Borders, which left the KGB. The amorphousness of that  committee and the fact that is belonged to everyone and no one  predetermined its failure. The subordination of the present FBS  is clear -- it is subordinate to the president and the  government. The Border Forces are henceforth implementers of  Russian foreign policy. In subordinating a number of structures  in the state security system to himself and introducing the post  of assistant for national security, the Russian Federation  president is creating a well-integrated system for safeguarding  the country's security in which each of the structures has a  clearly prescribed role.    This not only raises the border forces' status. We are  moving away, as it were, from the notion that we are purely  military people. From an international viewpoint this is a very  important fact. The edict encapsulates the reality dictated by  life. The future may possibly be different. But today we have  a clear awareNess of our role and place in the country's  security system.    [Klimov] Protecting the border remains one of the main  tasks. Andrey Ivanovich, when will the Russian border be  equipped, and how?    [Nikolayev] Our border with Kazakhstan, for example,  stretches for 7,500 km. If we started equipping it we would  spend so much money that we would be left not only without  jackets on our backs, but even without pants. Why should the  Russian people be deprived of shoes if we are in a position to  safeguard their interests in not only political but purely  practical border-protection terms on Turkmenistan's border with  Iran, Kyrgyzstan's border with China, and so forth. It is along  these borders that Russia's strategic interests lie.  Politicians in the Commonwealth countries have now come close  to understanding that the border of their state is the border of  the entire CIS. That is the first point. The second is that it  is economically much more advantageous to protect the former  Union borders: Russia's share of the cost is 50-50 in terms of  money and 50-50 in terms of personnel.    It is a different matter if some people in the CIS disagree  with our approach or if Russia is not confident about the  safeguarding of its security or the protection of its interests.  This would spark a counter-reaction, and Russia would get  involved in equipping the border. At the first stage this would  mean border checks, at the second stage -- searches, at the  third stage -- protection involving troops. But we will not be  the initiators of this kind of approach. Our states' peoples  wish to move freely around the territory of the Commonwealth.  If we build fences on our national borders there can be no  question of such free movement.    [Klimov] Andrey Ivanovich, you were in Azerbaijan recently.  You cannot talk about a reliably protected border there.  Mojahedin are coming in via Iran and participating in the  fighting against Armenian troops. Arms and drugs come from  there, and our border with Azerbaijan is transparent. How is  this?    [Nikolayev] We have a special approach to the Caucasus  region. Border protection in the Caucasus is built along two  boundaries. The first, the former USSR border, coincides with  CIS countries' borders with Iran and Turkey. The second is the  line of the Russian state border. It is necessary to guard this  border and at the same time to create a protection system and  build housing for officers, barracks, parks, stables, and so  forth.    By no means everything has gone smoothly. A particularly  difficult situation developed in the Dagestan sector and on the  territory of Karachayevo-Cherkessia on the border with Georgia.  The arrival of border troop units here met with active  resistance both from certain local residents and also from power  structures. Around 150 criminal acts have been committed against  North Caucasus District border troops on Georgian territory  alone; three border troopers have been killed and over 20  wounded.    However I can say that on the second border we are ensuring  the protection of our interests. Let me cite a few figures.  Around 700 intruders were detained and dozens of weapons and  large quantities of ammunition were confiscated on Russia's  border with Georgia and Azerbaijan last year.    In Azerbaijan we said: If Russia can be confident that its  interests are reliably protected on the Azerbaijan-Iran and  Azerbaijan-Turkey borders, protection of Russia's borders in the  Dagestan sector can be carried out jointly -- that is, the  border posts are all in one line and Russians and Azerbaijanis  serve together. This represents a special degree of trust.    We have the same approach with Belarus and Ukraine. They and  Russia are three independent states, but they cannot be divided  by a border. Therefore we are proposing to Ukraine, for  example: We will operate in the Bryansk sector and Ukrainian  border troopers will operate in the Kursk sector. This is a  fundamentally new attitude stemming from Russian foreign policy.  <H5>  Border Post Lessons </H5>   [Klimov] Your first trip as head of the Border Forces,  Andrey Ivanovich, was to the Tajik-Afghan border. What lessons  have been learned from the fighting in that distant border post  sector, where Russian border troopers have died?    [Nikolayev] The Tajik-Afghan border is an acid test of the  Commonwealth's solidity. The fighting on the border marked the  beginning of efforts by the Commonwealth countries to safeguard  their security. This is most probably the main lesson of that  fighting in the border post sector.    On the other hand, there is no problem with the border  there.  What we have there is bandits who break through the border.  There is no military solution to the problems of the  Tajik-Afghan border. Its stability can be safeguarded only by  peaceful means involving negotiations between the country's  leadership and the opposition.    [Klimov] In times past the border sometimes "spawned" new  weapons. The Damanskiy island incident was followed by the  appearance of automatic grenade launchers among the troops. Is  the experience of hostilities in border post sectors still  heeded now?    [Nikolayev] The Border Forces have specific weapons, of  course. Our aircraft and helicopters differ from military ones  and carry the identifier "P." There is also other combat  equipment intended solely for border protection. Nevertheless  the Border Forces need to change. Not to copy the Armed Forces  but to be powerful and capable enough, when required, to fulfill  a task involving the use of weapons.    What we should be is the subject of great research. The next  two or maybe three years will be a period of transition for the  creation of virtually new Russian border forces. As we  determine the Border Forces' role and place in the country's  security system we are also determining its specific operational  methods. Combat equipment and weapons must be produced to suit  these methods.  <H5>  Dispensing Apartments With a Lordly Gesture </H5>   [Klimov] Border Force officers have a difficult, nomadic  life. What is being done for their social protection, Andrey  Ivanovich? Have you personally helped any border trooper's  family?    [Nikolayev] In terms of "personally" I'm not going to  answer. If I say "no," you won't believe me. If I say "yes,"  you'll demand that I give their name. But why is this  necessary? I get many letters asking for help with an apartment.  This is probably best quiet, but let me say that never in my  life have I personally tried to solve a housing issue. Although  many people have approached me both now and when I was serving  with the troops. The conversation would start: "Comrade  commander, you are such a good commander to us...." And it  would end: "Give me an apartment."    I know some commanders have responded to blandishments and  indulged their charges: "There, have one." But I am neither  lord nor king. I cannot hand out apartments with a lordly  gesture. We have a system that provides people with housing.  If I see someone who is really in need, I can instruct the  housing commission to examine the matter. It is up to the  commission what it decides. Any other approach would destroy the  entire system of social justice.    We have 7,000 people without accommodation at the moment. We  will be building 2,200 apartments this year. In the next  three-four years we can provide housing for all. But only with  specific support from state structures. It is time it was  recognized that the servicemen should not have to face a housing  problem.    I believe too that incentives in service must only be given  for specific deeds. And what do we do: Holiday coming up --  draw up a detail. An unhealthy approach that has corrupted us  all. If a man does something good, say to him: "Well done."  If you cannot decorate him, give him 10,000 rubles [R]. Not  much money, but a concrete incentive that works. Write about  the soldier in the district newspaper and he will remember it  the rest of his life. Because all of us -- from commander in  chief to common soldier -- are normal people with normal  reactions.    I once asked our officers: What do you get more of in a  border unit -- military or family ethos? I must say that many  found it an incredible question. In the Army the barracks are  the model, the motorized rifle company in which everything is by  the book. But you have a quite different, family atmosphere in  a border unit. The commander is not figuratively, but literally  like a father. He is always there for his charges to see and  can instill in them only what he himself exemplifies.    And they do not want to rely on directives from Moscow. We  have around 1,000 border units and no two are the same. How can  someone in Moscow decide how one is to work with people in a  border unit. All that is rubbish. We have made a mess of this  work so far. Many people are scratching their heads now and  wondering how to rectify matters.    We have lost our points of reference, they say. Hang on, did  a state leader ever say that patriotism was obsolete? Or that  internationalism does not exist? We are not building ethnic  Russian border forces, we are building the Border Forces of  Russia. If I were in charge, I would abolish paragraph five on  nationality [in Russian passports] today. What is needed is  citizenship, not nationality. We are the people of Russia, the  most multinational people. We will destroy Russia if we do not  raise internationalists.</p>

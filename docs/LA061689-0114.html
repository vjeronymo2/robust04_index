			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HIGHLIGHTS OF HOUSE S&amp;L BILL  </P> <P> 1. $50 billion in bonds will be sold over three years, with the funds used to  pay off depositors when ailing thrifts are closed.  </P> <P> 2. A new Resolution Trust Corp. will dismantle the financially crippled  S&amp;Ls and dispose of $400 billion in repossessed real estate -- homes,  apartments, shopping centers, office buildings and land -- owned by the failed  thrifts.  </P> <P> 3. An S&amp;L's owners will be required to supply the institution with $1.50 in  cash for every $100 in loans it makes, beginning in June, 1990. This capital  standard rises to 3% in 1995.  </P> <P> 4. S&amp;L payments to the federal insurance fund will rise from $2.10 per  $1,000 of deposits to $2.30. Bank premiums will climb from 8 cents per $1,000  to 15 cents.  </P> <P> 5. The Justice Department will receive $75 million to investigate and prosecute  fraud at financial institutions.  </P> <P> 6. The home loan banks owned by the S&amp;L industry will supply $75 million a  year to help subsidize housing for people with low or moderate incomes.  </P> <P> 7. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which regulates banks, will become the  new overseer of S&amp;Ls.  </P> <P> The total cost of the package is estimated at $157 billion over 10 years. This  includes the $50 billion in bonds for future S&amp;L shutdowns, the expenses  associated with previous closings and the rebuilding of the federal insurance  fund.  </P> <P> The bonds will be paying interest for 30 years, and the final cost of the  bailout is estimated at $275 billion to $300 billion. The taxpayers will  furnish about 75% of the total cost, with the balance coming from premiums on  the savings and loan industry. ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT  </P></p>

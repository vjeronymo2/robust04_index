			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Survey of Luxembourg (1): Mighty EC micro-state - Its economic performance makes the Grand Duchy the only EC member state to fulfil all five 'convergence criteria' required under the Maastricht treaty to join a European monetary union. Threats to its EC status will be stoutly resisted IN the 35 years since the foundation of the European Community, Luxembourg has earned a justified reputation as a mighty micro-state. A mixture of Rutland and Ruritania, the Grand Duchy packs an economic punch quite out of proportion with its size and population. It has exploited deftly the opportunities offered by open borders, free trade and steady progress toward deeper European integration. Over the past 12 months, the EC has been shaken by a series of political, economic and financial crises which have raised questions about its identity, its future development, perhaps even the historic inevitability of integration. In the Roaring Eighties, when Europe's economy boomed, the Grand Duchy's population of 400,000 benefited enormously from its geographical position near the centre of a single European market of 340m people. But these are hard times for the EC, and the slump in the economies of neighbouring Germany and Belgium has left Luxembourg looking more exposed. The extent of its vulnerability should not be exaggerated. In 1992, Luxembourg's banking sector increased its profits by 18.5 per cent - on top of a growth rate of 24.1 per cent in 1991. Unemployment remains at less than 2 per cent, compared to an EC average of between 10 and 15 per cent. This summer, Luxembourg was the only member state in the EC which met all the Maastricht treaty's economic convergence criteria - the targets set for membership of a future European monetary union. The most pressing concern centres on the economic downturn in Germany, together with the currency crises which have swept through the Community since Danish voters rejected the Maastricht treaty in June 1992. The initial targets for international financial speculators were 'soft-core' currencies such as the British pound and the Italian lira; but in the spring and summer of 1993, the assault shifted to the 'hard-core' grouping including the French franc, the Danish krone and the Belgian franc, which remains linked in a 71-year-old currency association to the Luxembourg franc. The recent weakness of the Belgian franc has touched a raw nerve because it evoked memories of the 1982 currency crisis in which the Brussels authorities devalued their currency unilaterally, without consulting Luxembourg. Fearing a possible re-run, Luxembourg has sent messages to the Dehaene coalition government in Belgium that it expects every effort to be made to preserve the value of the currency through a tight link with the D-mark. At the same time, internal studies have been drawn up, examining the impact of a future devaluation and assessing the Schmerzensgrenzen - pain barriers - beyond which Luxembourg might have to re-examine its currency association. This would be a big step into the unknown. In the meantime, Mr Jacques Santer, Luxembourg's long-serving prime minister, remains adamant that he believes the currency association (which was renewed last year) will continue: 'It is not the Luxembourg tradition unilaterally to denounce treaties,' he said in a speech earlier this month. Behind these worries about Belgium's economic strength and its political cohesion lies a more general worry about Luxembourg's position in a Community on the brink of a new phase of enlargement; it is supposed to take in Finland, Norway, Austria and Sweden by January 1 1995. One, perhaps even two of the candidates within this group may well fail in their bid for admission. But Luxembourg still faces a dilution of power; disconcerting for a founder member of the EC which has long enjoyed an influence greater than its size. Recent reports that France, Germany and the UK are toying with the idea of cutting down the size of the European Commission to 10 members are unsettling; so is the notion that an enlarged EC should adapt the system of qualified majority voting, to defend the position of the bigger states. One senior Luxembourg official says he was 'appalled'. He suggests that this would spell not only the loss of Luxembourg's right to send its own Commissioner to Brussels, but also an EC dominated by the bigger member states, following the principle of 19th century balance of power politics. 'The efficiency of the EC is important, but you must not go back to the Congress of Vienna,' he says. For Luxembourg, preservation of the status quo touches on the question of national identity. 'Luxembourg has always been very favourable toward Europe,' says Mr Jim Cloos, chef du cabinet to Mr Rene Steichen, Luxembourger commissioner in Brussels, responsible for agriculture. 'But we are often afraid of being submerged or swamped.' He adds: 'We are emotionally closer to France and economically linked to Germany, but we are neither French, nor German, nor Belgian. We are something in between.' It is wrong to speak of an upsurge in nationalism; but, like neighbouring Germany, Luxembourg has lost its uncritical attitude toward the EC. Politicians such as Mr Fernand Rau have made mileage out of running against the Maastricht treaty, singling out its concept of EC citizenship which provides for the extension of voting rights for foreigners. Mr Rau, 52, is the Ross Perot of Luxembourg politics. His campaign to curb public spending and raise private pensions to the generous level of state employees failed to take off in the recent local elections, where the Green Party fared better; but he remains a threat to the establishment because he has spotted the dangers of pursuing European integration beyond reasonable limits. In the post-second world war era, Luxembourg has brilliantly exploited EC legislation to carve out a position as a leading European banking financial centre, breaking its earlier dependence on the steel industry. For example, when the European Commission issued its directive on European-wide investment funds in 1988, Luxembourg's parliament responded with appropriate legislation within four weeks. This nimble approach anticipated future EC legislation, paving the way for the Grand Duchy to attract more than 1,000 investment funds. On the other hand, the Community's drive to harmonise tax legislation - notably the withholding tax - constitute a direct threat to Luxembourg's status as a financial centre. Savings running into billions of francs would switch to tax havens in Europe such as the Channel Islands or Monaco. Similarly, Luxembourg has no intention of sacrificing its other chief advantage in the financial sector: banking secrecy. Any change in either the withholding tax or banking secrecy would amount to a significant blow to an industry which itself accounts for between 10 and 12 per cent of the Grand Duchy's gross domestic product. Leading executives such as Mr Charles Ruppert, president of the Luxembourg Banking Association, argue that the financial sector's strength has more to do with intellectual agility and high-quality training than favourable tax laws. He points to the successful expansion of Luxembourg's commercial satellite and television sector as prime examples. But Mr Ruppert cautions that new arrangements for enlargement and integration should preserve member states' national assets such as banking and finance, even at the expense of European-wide harmonisation. In this respect, Luxembourg speaks for many of the bigger members of the EC, including the UK.</p>

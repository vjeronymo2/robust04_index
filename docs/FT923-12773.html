			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Sharp rise in Lloyd's open years THE NUMBER of syndicates at the Lloyd's insurance market unable to close their accounts nearly doubled last year, it emerged yesterday. The increase, from 53 to 103, is further bad news for Names - the individuals whose capital supports underwriting. They are unable to resign their membership of Lloyd's if they are members of syndicates with 'open years'. Lloyd's reported its worst-ever losses of Pounds 2.06bn last month for the 1989 year. The market's governing council faces fierce criticism from dissidents at an extraordinary general meeting scheduled this month. Syndicates - annual joint ventures of Names - leave their accounts open when there is uncertainty about the size of future claims. Those specialising in US long-tail liability business, in which claims are made sometimes many years after the inception of the policy, have been worst affected. Last year 68 of the 401 syndicates trading in the 1989 year left their accounts open, bringing the total of open years to 162 compared with 97 for the end of the previous year. At the end of 1991 a total of 103 syndicates had one or more open years, compared with 53 at the end of 1990. Officially, Lloyd's is optimistic about the trend in US court cases, where insurers are contesting their liability for the cost of cleaning up polluted sites and removing asbestos from buildings. Mr Val Powell, chief executive of the Association of Lloyd's Members, which represents more than 9,000 Names, said the news underlined the importance of the Lloyd's initiative to set up Centrewrite, a reinsurer which ultimately hopes to be able to offer to assume the open-year liabilities of Names for a premium. Separately, Lloyd's said yesterday that its council had approved in principle a measure allowing syndicates to make more use of reinsurance policies offered by companies trading outside Lloyd's. The change would allow syndicates to increase their capacity to underwrite new business in a market where rates are increasing sharply.</p>

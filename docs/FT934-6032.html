			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Faced with a very tricky balancing ACT - Some problems facing the chancellor in his Budget next week When Mr Kenneth Clarke stands up next Tuesday to deliver his first budget, companies will be straining to hear what he plans to do about surplus advance corporation tax and the foreign income dividend scheme proposed by his predecessor in March. The FID scheme was initially enthusiastically received, and welcomed publicly by the 100 Group of Finance Directors, but has found some critics. Says one finance director, 'I would like it to go ahead and I think we would like to implement it. It's not perfect, but half a loaf . . .' A corporate tax expert agrees, although he thinks the FID scheme hangs in the balance. 'I sincerely hope it does go ahead. But in a manner that is practical and effective.' However, the depth of feeling is illustrated by one finance director of a Footsie company who not only refuses to be named speaking on the subject, but insists that no comment he makes should be traceable to him or his company. 'It is a very divisive subject,' he explains, saying that it has pitted company against company, and shareholder against shareholder. Some even hope, he says, that the scheme will be dropped altogether. Further, the debate is inextricably entwined with the question of whether pension funds will be taxed, itself a fraught topic. Under the proposed FID scheme, pension funds would lose their tax credit on dividends, cutting their income. That could have serious knock-on effects. Lower income would cut pension funds' values. All companies, not just those with a surplus ACT problem, could find that rather than a surplus on their pension fund they have a deficit. That would mean the end of contributions holidays, depressing profits, in turn lowering the tax take and possibly squeezing dividends. Companies may be pressured by tax-exempt shareholders to make up the loss of their tax credits through higher dividends, so gains made by avoiding ACT would be lost through increased pay-outs. Any which did not make up the dividend shortfall could see their share prices fall, further reducing pension fund valuations. The anonymous finance director admits to the unpopular view: 'I wouldn't mind if pension funds were taxed. Our scheme is generously funded.' Under the existing tax regime, companies pay ACT on dividends and can then offset that against their mainstream corporation tax bill. Tax-exempt investors, such as pension funds, can reclaim the tax on the dividend, while tax-paying shareholders are treated as having already paid basic rate tax on the dividend. Companies suffer if they have too small a UK mainstream tax liability against which the ACT can be offset, in which case they end up paying surplus ACT, raising their tax charge. There are two main reasons why this happens. A company which derives most or all of its profits from the UK, but pays higher dividends than it can afford, will be hit. This is usually considered a cyclical problem, for instance where a company does not cut its dividend when profits fall, and is expected to lessen when profits recover after the recession. More serious is the case of companies with a structural problem - those which earn a high proportion of their profits overseas. They cannot offset ACT against their overseas tax bills, and pay insufficient UK tax to use up their ACT. The March budget did two things. First, Mr Norman Lamont cut the ACT rate from 25 per cent to 20 per cent over two years, in an attempt to reduce the amount of surplus ACT. While this appeared helpful, and gave a cashflow benefit to companies, it soon became apparent that it would actually increase the government's tax take. The second was Mr Lamont's proposal of the FID scheme. Essentially this would allow companies to pay dividends free of ACT out of their foreign income. The scheme was detailed in an Inland Revenue consultative document. It is this scheme which Mr Clarke is expected to elaborate on in the budget, and perhaps put into effect in the new year. The Inland Revenue is understood to have received numerous negative comments about the scheme. It is a complicated system, and has many restrictions which companies feel will constrain its use. Cynics even suggest that since the FID scheme will cut the government's tax take, the Treasury would actually prefer companies not to use it. The FID scheme involves a company paying ACT as normal, but identifying which dividends it regards as being paid out of foreign income and reclaiming any surplus ACT on those after proving the dividend was paid from foreign profits. It cannot use foreign income from earlier or later years. As well as the many technical concerns about the scheme, the main bone of contention is the question of tax credits. Any dividend paid as a FID would not entitle a tax-exempt shareholder to reclaim tax. It would make no difference to a tax-paying shareholder. Thus one class of shareholders would benefit from a company paying FIDs  - because the company would save surplus tax - but another class would lose. Under the scheme, companies cannot 'stream' dividends, directing FIDs towards tax payers and tax-credit bearing dividends to pension funds. One leading accounting firm described this rule as 'unduly harsh' in its submission on the scheme to the Inland Revenue. Companies are in danger of upsetting one or other class of shareholder whatever they do. 'It drives a wedge between the two types of shareholder,' says a finance director, 'and puts the directors in a very nasty position. FIDs take away one problem but they leave another which is almost worse.' The Revenue is unlikely to heed calls from some finance directors and tax experts to abolish ACT altogether. One suggestion is that ACT be removed but corporation tax payments brought forward from the current due date of nine months after the year end. That would give the government a substantial one-off cashflow benefit in a year when it needs every penny it can raise. The same problem of lost tax credits would arise for tax-exempt investors and hence for companies' pension funding costs. But, proponents argue, the government could in return lessen the tax burden for all companies, which would be fairer than the current system which penalises some through surplus ACT. Whatever Mr Clarke does on Tuesday, it looks certain that he will offend some companies and some shareholders. Companies, fearing they will have to alienate some shareholders, may have little sympathy for him.</p>

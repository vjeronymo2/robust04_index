			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPAN TRADE SURPLUS RISES IN DECEMBER BUT DIPS FOR YEAR  </P> <P> Japan said Friday that its trade surplus in December was nearly $1 billion more  than the same month in 1987, but for the year slipped 2% to $94.79 billion.  </P> <P> The December trade surplus rose to $10.93 billion from $9.96 billion in the  year-earlier month, the government said.  </P> <P> The broader-based December current account surplus, which includes trade in  both goods and services, fell to $9.27 billion from $9.44 billion in the  year-earlier month. This was still above the previous month's $6.76 billion.  </P> <P> For the whole year, Japan's trade surplus in goods and services fell nearly 9%,  but economists see little hope for any cut in the surplus in 1989.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MILITARY'S PHYSICAL PRESENCE IN COUNTY REMAINS STRONG  </P> <P> While the flow of defense contracting dollars into San Diego County has slowed,  the military's physical presence remains strong.  </P> <P> "There are still about 140,000 active-duty military in San Diego, and, with  dependents and retirees, the figure goes up to 400,000," according to U. S.  Navy Chief Craig Huebler. "The military continues to be the single largest  employer in San Diego."  </P> <P> The Navy accounts for slightly more than 100,000 of the county's active-duty  personnel. Most of the rest are Marines. San Diego's military bases are  increasingly being used to train service personnel, Huebler said. About 15,000  military personnel are now in the county for training. And much of the  military's construction program in the county has been dedicated to classroom  and training facilities, Huebler said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Number of Ships Based in S.D. Is Stable  </P> <P> The number of Navy ships based in San Diego has remained stable in recent  years, despite fears that several ships would be lost to the controversial  home-porting program that transferred many to new ports.  </P> <P> The aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk, one of three based in San Diego, was  transferred to Florida. But, in October, it was replaced by the carrier  Independence.  </P> <P> The only other notable arrival in recent months was the Aegis class cruiser  Lake Champlain, Huebler said.  </P> <P> "A few years ago we thought that we'd settle at about 100 ships, and we're  evidently going to stay at 102 if we don't lose or gain anything else," Huebler  said.  </P> <P> San Diego's military bases also were untouched by Congress' recent  controversial decision to close more than 90 military bases around the United  States, Huebler said.  </P> <P> Home-porting and the base-closing campaign have "basically been a wash for us,"  Huebler said. "We didn't lose anything and, while it's possible that we could  gain a ship or a new function, it's probably only a couple of hundred people  that we're talking about." GREG JOHNSON  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IF THE LAND BUBBLE POPS, WILL WHOLE WORLD FEEL IT?;  </P> <P> JAPAN: OVERVALUED REAL ESTATE HAS BECOME THE TOP DOMESTIC PROBLEM. BUT A FREEZE  MAY NOT BE THE ANSWER.  </P> <P> The Japanese stock market has fallen 25% in the first three months of this  year. The astounding loss of nearly $1 trillion has been felt not just in Japan  but also by investors around the world. Inevitably, financial markets  everywhere are nervous about spillover effects on other stock markets.  </P> <P> But the cause for worry doesn't stop with the stock market. Financial markets  now fear a similar collapse in the Japanese real estate market, which could  cause widespread damage to the entire Japanese financial system.  </P> <P> Since the real estate assets of Japanese corporations help to justify high  Japanese stock prices, a collapse of the real estate market could cause a new  round of declines in share prices. To the extent that inflated real estate  values serve as security for bank loans, the Japanese banking system is also  vulnerable to a real estate collapse.  </P> <P> While the overvaluation of Japanese land prices is legendary, the present  situation has become a major political problem. The vast fortunes created by  the surge in real estate values has disturbed the traditional income  distribution and Japanese social values. At present levels, prices are so high  that very few Japanese can ever expect to purchase a home.  </P> <P> Land prices have risen throughout the past decade at rates that are much  greater than the increases in the consumer price level. Just in the last year,  the average price of residential land has jumped 17% while overall consumer  price inflation has been only about 3%.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, concerned about the increasing discontent among  the voters, recently declared the high price of land to be Japan's most serious  domestic problem. He endorsed a proposal to freeze the price of land in certain  urban areas.  </P> <P> But preventing land prices from rising could actually trigger a real estate  collapse.  </P> <P> The key problem is that today's prices cannot be justified by current rental  levels. A Japanese real estate owner is lucky if the rent that he receives  equals 2% of the market price of his property. Compare that with the 7%  interest that he could receive on perfectly safe investments in Japanese  government bonds.  </P> <P> An investment in real estate makes sense only if its value is expected to keep  increasing by at least enough to compensate the investor for the loss of  interest income and the greater risk of investing in property rather than  government bonds. Just to keep pace with a 7% return on government bonds, the  real estate investor must expect his property to appreciate by at least 5%.  With a 2% rental return, the investor can then just match the 7% return on  government bonds. More realistically, the investor must expect a further price  rise to compensate for the extra risk associated with real estate investment.  </P> <P> What happens if the government freezes real estate prices? The entire return to  the investor must then come from rental income. Think about a property that now  has a value of 100 million yen and an annual rental income of 2 million yen. If  the rental income alone must yield a return of at least 7% to compete with the  return on government bonds, then the price must fall from 100 million yen to  less than 30 million yen.  </P> <P> In actual practice, such a drastic fall is unlikely. Investors might gamble  that the freeze would only be temporary and that the government would step in  to offset such a severe decline in property values. That kind of speculation  would encourage property investors to accept a temporary lower rate of return.  </P> <P> But there can be no doubt that the rapid rise of Japanese land prices in recent  years has created a financially dangerous situation. Even without government  intervention, real estate prices cannot continue to rise at the rates of the  recent past. And when the price increase slows, the investor's need to maintain  the required return on property will force a fall in land prices.  </P> <P> Thus, the financial shock waves from Tokyo may just be beginning.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The results of a March poll conducted by  the ALKO organization on behalf of the SKY radio station  appeared in the 22 May Athens daily I KATHIMERINI. Respondents  were asked whether the present Panhellenic Socialist Movement  [PASOK] government's image is better or worse than that of the  previous New Democracy [ND]. Some 36.6 percent thought it  better, while 28.8 percent considered it worse. Another 30.7  percent thought it is the same, and 3.9 percent did not know or  did not answer. The next question centered on whether the  government is trusted to confront the current economic crisis  and was asked over several consecutive months. In December 1993,  positive answers amounted to 23.6 percent, compared with 37.8  percent negative answers and 38.7 percent who did not know or  who thought it was too early to judge. The percentages for 30-31  March were 39.6 percent positive, 53.9 percent negative, and 4.5  percent who did not know. On 8-9 April, there were 43.3 percent  positive answers, 52 percent negative ones, and 4.2 percent who  did not know. Finally, on 9-10 May, 33.7 percent said they  trusted the government, compared with 64.6 percent who said they  did not, and 1.7 percent who did not know.    A 16 March MARTEL poll asked respondents to indicate which,  in their opinion, is the government's principal quality. Some  27.4 percent chose simply the fact that the present government  is better than the previous one. A total of 18.2 percent said  that it is "moderate," 10.0 percent thought that it conducts a  "successful foreign policy," and 7.6 percent that it is  "socially just." Some 4 percent thought that its economic policy  inspires trust, 21.5 percent said that the government possesses  no special attributes, and 11.3 percent did not know.    Another question centered on the popularity of political  leaders. ND leader Miltiadhis Evert had a positive balance of 11  percent, followed by Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou with a  positive balance of 9 percent, and Coalition of the Left for  Progress leader Nikos Konstandopoulos with 2 percent. On the  contrary, Political Spring leader Andonis Samaras had a negative  balance of 11 percent and Communist Party [KKE] leader Aleka  Papariga a negative balance of 46 percent.</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Queens Moat shares suspended SHARES in Queens Moat Houses, the UK's second biggest hotel group, were suspended yesterday at the company's request as it announced it was postponing a Pounds 7m dividend payment. Queens Moat had been due to report results next Wednesday. and yesterday's move raised fears in the market about them. A statement from the company said that the share suspension was 'pending clarification of the company's financial position'. The group has heavy debts, taken on to finance expansion. They are given as Pounds 927m in the accounts for 1991, but forecast to go over Pounds 1bn for 1992 by some analysts. This would give gearing close to 100 per cent. The company has a large amount of D-Mark denominated debt which has been affected by sterling's devaluation. Analysts had been forecasting final pre-tax profits of around Pounds 85m. Queens Moat shares have mirrored the fall in the leisure sector. They hit an all-time low of 27.5p in August after its debt levels surprised the City and have since climbed to yesterday's suspension level of 47 1/2 p. Ten months ago they were 92p. At the beginning of February Mr Martin Marcus, Queens Moat's deputy chairman, sold 1.1m shares for Pounds 629,500, the day before the company went into its closed period ahead of the results. Mr Marcus said then that he had sold the shares to fulfil personal obligations and that the transaction was not related to any aspect of the group's performance. Queens Moat Houses recently extended an agreement with Bass under which the former will convert four of its UK hotels and four on the European continent into Holiday Inns. Yesterday's dividend payment was deferred on the 7.5 per cent convertible cumulative redeemable preference shares. Trading was also halted in all classes of convertible and debenture stock. Investors expressed concern yesterday about a further interest payment of Pounds 11m due today on the company's Pounds 215m 10 1/4 per cent debenture stock. At the last independent valuation, in December 1991, the properties backing the debenture were valued at Pounds 377m, though UK hotel prices are estimated to have fallen by 20-30 per cent since then.

"We are not bothered by the idea that other Central European  states will do the same. On the contrary. Moreover, we hope  that the simultaneous endeavors of all the countries in our area  to increase, in every respect, their compatibility with NATO,  will trigger a somehow lacking disposition to reproduce -- in  their mutual relations -- the viable pattern set in Washington,  45 years ago, by the Alliance. If fulfilled by each of the new  Central European democracies, the very objectives of the new  practical programme will lead them in this direction. Likewise,  to earlier NATO membership.    "Both the spirit and the letter of the declaration adopted  by  the NATO summit do strongly reconfirm this valuable outlook.  Its first paragraph underlines that the alliance 'is reaching  out to establish new patterns of cooperation throughout Europe'.  The West and the Russian Federation could decisively help the  alliance in fulfilling this task. Inclusively by overcoming the  parochial attitudes that have traditionally governed their  mutual behavior.    "This is exactly why, we in Romania find it important -- at  this historical juncture -- to suggest to our peers in Central  Europe not to ignore a precious security resource which is  within our grasp: the establishment and consolidation,  throughout our area, of good neighborly relations.    "I hope the constructive thrust of this proposal will be  correctly understood by all the countries in our area. The more  so, because Romania does not embark herself barehanded on the  historical Euro-Atlantic journey to strengthened European  stability and security opened by the partnership for peace. Our  country disposes of certain -- even unique -- geostrategic and  geopolitical assets. Properly used, they could help the alliance  in fulfilling its new role of projecting stability and democracy  beyond its current area, thereby increasing Romania's direct  contribution to 'lasting peace, stability and well-being in  Europe'. The significance of those assets is substantially  enhanced by Romania's belonging to the group of like-minded  countries which enjoy closer relations with the main Western  European structures.    "In connection with this, I would like to remind to all  those  who still think that 'Visegrad membership' is a sine qua non for  closer relations with the West, that Romania's status with the  cardinal Western European structures -- the European Union, the  Western European Union and the Council of Europe -- is identical  with that enjoyed by the countries in that sub-regional grouping.    "This is a most convincing recognition of the fact that, in  spite of the heavier communist legacy Romania has had to get rid  of, our political will to irreversibly enshrine the Western  values and practices in our society, and to solidly anchor the  country in the Western structures is as genuine as the one  expressed by 'the Visegrad four'. At the same time, this  situation clearly indicates that the Western European  institutions' attitude towards our respective countries is not  biased by parochial considerations."</p>

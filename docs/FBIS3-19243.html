The  release of Anthony Gorman follows the recent decision by the  High Court not to extradite Joseph Magee to England for the same  offense. Our legal affairs correspondent Kieron Wood reports.    [Wood] Twenty-four-year-old Anthony Gorman and 27-year-old  Joseph Magee, both from Armagh city, are wanted in England for  the murder of Sgt. Michael Newman outside an army recruiting  office in Derby in 1992. Two weeks ago Magee was freed by the  High Court. The judge said the shooting of Sgt. Newman with a  nonautomatic weapon was a political offense. He also ruled that  the district court order was invalid and that Magee wouldn't get  a fair trial in England because of the prejudicial pretrial  publicity. Following that decision, in the district court,  sitting this morning in Green Street courthouse, counsel for the  attorney general, Mr. Eamonn Leahy, said he was offering no  evidence in the case of Gorman. Judge Gerard Horton said he'd  make an order discharging the accused man. The entire hearing  lasted just two minutes. Gorman was told by garda [police] he  could leave. After speaking briefly to his lawyers he gave a  clenched fist salute and shouted "let's go." He told reporters  afterwards that he should never have been held. He said there  was no justice for Irishmen in England, and he called for the  release of other prisoners awaiting extradition. Kieron Wood,  RTE News, the district court.</p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Hands off Iraq A YEAR ago the world went to war to re-establish the frontier between Iraq and Kuwait, which President Saddam Hussein had presumed to remove. It did so on the basis of UN resolutions calling on Iraq to withdraw its forces 'to the positions in which they were located on 1 August 1990'. It is reasonable to assume that almost all those involved in the war, on the coalition side, believed they were fighting to restore Kuwait's territorial integrity as of that date, and not to assert any Kuwaiti claim to territory until then held by Iraq. After the war, however, the UN Security Council became 'conscious of the need for demarcation of the said boundary', and set up a commission to demarcate it. That commission is now reported to be about to award to Kuwait several oilfields hitherto owned and exploited by Iraq, and part of the Iraqi naval base at Umm Qasr. Whatever the historical basis for this finding, no Iraqi, irrespective of his or her feelings about Mr Saddam and his policies, is likely to regard it as other than an assertion of jus victoris, in clear violation of the much-vaunted UN principle that the acquisition of territory by war is inadmissible. No Iraqi government will voluntarily accept it, and if the Security Council imposes it by force it will, in effect, be inviting Iraq to try the fortunes of war again, choosing a more opportune moment.</p>

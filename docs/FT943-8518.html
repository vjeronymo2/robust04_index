			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Universities expect 'bunfight' after reform of admissions: With A-level results out tomorrow, John Authers finds colleges confused Publication of A-level results in England and Wales tomorrow signals the start of a new university admissions system. The separate admissions systems of Ucca for universities and Pcas for polytechnics have been merged, two years after the distinction between the two sectors was abolished, to form the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service. The reform makes sense but it has already had unforeseen consequences - creating extra work for university admissions departments. Vice-chancellors fear admissions could develop into a 'bunfight', while clearance system officials refer to a 'guessing game' by universities. Middle-ranking universities fear they will have many more places left unfilled at this stage than usual, and that there will be an increased drop-out rate among the students they eventually take, many of whom will find themselves in a university they had not previously considered. Each sixth-former has applied for more courses this year, with an average of seven courses being named on each Ucas form - the maximum allowed is eight. Last year students were limited to five choices by Ucca, and to four by Pcas. It was possible to apply through both systems simultaneously, producing a maximum of nine possible applications, although barely half of all applicants bothered to do this. The number of applications to universities via Ucas this year was almost 15 per cent higher than the number applying through the two systems last year. But the number of potential students applying is much the same, meaning more offers by universities will be rejected. Admissions tutors cannot forecast how big the effect will be even though the overall standards required of successful candidates this year are likely to be much the same as last year. Government funding restrictions, which aim to see student numbers consolidated at their current levels for the next three years, are a further complication. The funding councils which control university finances will 'cap' their funding this year so that institutions will receive no money at all for students they admit in excess of target numbers. This funding policy was only announced in March, even though universities had been processing applications since September last year. According to the Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals several universities have tried to ensure that they are not capped by being stricter than usual in the A-level grades they require. If the universities have miscalculated it could mean they have more places than usual to offer through the clearing system, used by students who have not accepted and fulfilled conditional A-level offers. Mr Tony Higgins, joint chief executive of Ucas, said: 'Because there is no historical precedent to work on, admissions tutors do not know how many offers to make. In the past they were able to get some idea of the ratio of offers they had to make to the number of places available, bearing in mind how many were likely or unlikely to meet the offer requirements. Now it is getting close to guesswork.' His best guess, however, is that the system, which allows students to keep only two offers at this stage in the process, will cause a standstill in applications to middle-ranking universities. This is because most applicants keep one harder offer from their favoured university while maintaining a much easier 'insurance' offer from a former polytechnic or college of higher education. Hence middle-ranking universities - which benefited from 'insurance' offers under Ucca - could find themselves with places to fill. Welfare officers believe students who come through clearing, and are therefore not attending the university of their choice, are more likely to drop out. According to the vice-chancellors' committee: 'Colleges believe there will be more potential drop-outs this year and are training up more counsellors to try and help.'</p>

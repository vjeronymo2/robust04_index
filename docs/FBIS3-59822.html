Is there a chance that the result will bring about  stability in the system of relations between Israel and the  Palestinians? In my estimation, no.    The agreement of principals was signed with 'Arafat alone,  and 'Arafat does not have a majority on this issue in the  Palestinian National Council. Most of the Palestinian  organizations represented in it, including significant parts of  Fatah, are opposed to the agreement of principals and stand for  a continuation of the armed struggle against Israel, in  accordance to the Palestinian Convention. They all have a  smashing majority in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza, especially among  the young generation, which is the leader. A new generation has  arisen that cannot reconcile with a co-existence with Israel,  even in the borders of the Green Line. Most of them are steeped  in, and believe in, the righteousness of the Palestinian  Convention as it is, without change.    'Arafat, as chairman of the Palestine Liberation  Organization  (PLO), succeeded in surviving only by right of compromises with  the extremists in his camp. In other words, he enabled them to  continue on a practical, extremist line and did not go out  against them with weapons. He cannot and would not want to  absolutely prevent terrorist acts. We saw how he operated in  Lebanon at the end of the 1970's and the early 1980's: The PLO  reached a series of repeatedly changing agreements on  co-existence with the Christians and Shi'ites; 'Arafat did not  honor a single one of them. There is no reason that he would  change his ways now.    The future Palestinian police, whose job it will be to  preserve the peace and the citizens of Israel, according to that  which is indicated up to now, will be comprised of a loyal  section of the Palestinian population. That is, there will also  be elements that formally or informally belong to extremist  camps. To this day, these elements have few weapons, and,  despite this, the acts of terrorism and shootings are relatively  many. The weapons that will be given to the Palestinian police  will increase their arsenal, intentionally as well--under the  guidance of Yasir 'Arafat, in order to preserve his position, as  well as by officers and individuals in the police--because of  organizational or emotional involvement with terrorist  organizations, as well as by means of acquisition or theft.    Under these conditions, how will the economic vision of the  architect of the agreement of principals, Shim'on Peres, be  realized, when Israeli businessmen who will have to meet  colleagues in Ramallah or Gaza will have to risk their lives?    And on the matter of the settlers. The settlers of Judaea,  Samaria, and the Gaza district, by the authority of the  decisions of the governments of the left and right, feel that  they are in danger. Our sages of blessed memory said that the  duty of saving life overrides everything, and from the aspect of  one who sees himself as a potential sacrifice--he overrides  democracy as well as the "rule of law." Anyone who feels that  his life is forsaken in any case will be astonished--where is  the law [sentence as published]. The settlers, who suddenly  stand before a wave of hatred, whose barricades were burst in  the wake of the agreement of principals, cannot not avoid  defending themselves. It should be remembered that the Israel  Defense Forces is also made up of fathers and sons whose  position on Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza district is not  necessarily that of the Israeli government. If so, Israel is at  risk of a civil war.    All of these factors, and many others, when they accumulate  at the moment of crisis, like around the division of Jerusalem  or the removal of a settlement or a severe attack, have no  chance that they will make possible the realization of the  agreement as it stands.    So, what is the solution? In the situation that has been  created, it seems to me that the only possible solution is "the  separation of the mosaic." The Israeli Government must adopt the  slogan that every Jew, wherever, "is holy, holy in his place,  and his land is holy." That which was holy to al-Sadat in the  Sinai, is all the more holy to us in the land of Israel. The  agreement must be undermined, and, in the event that it cannot  be reached, it must be effected unilaterally. Leaving under  Israeli sovereignty all of the Jewish settlements, including  open access roads. By a rough calculation, we are speaking of  about 3,500 square km for the autonomy and about 2,500 for  complete Israeli rule. There would be a separation between them,  and a fence if need be, giving Palestinians free passage to  adjacent countries and between different regions. This is a hard  separation, necessitating efforts and the investment of  resources, but, in my estimation, only this can succeed, and  only it should be achieved on the basis of a national consensus.

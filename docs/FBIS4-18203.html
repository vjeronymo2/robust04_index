			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [EC Document No DOC/IP/94/261: "Signature in Brussels on </F> Tuesday 29 March 1994 of the 1994-1995 PHARE indicative  programme for the cooperation between the European Union and the  Republic of Hungary"]    [Text] The 1994-95 indicative programme was signed today,  29 March 1994, by Dr.Laszlo Bogar, state secretary, Ministry of  International economic relations, on behalf of the government of  the Republic of Hungary, and by Mr. Alan Mayhew, principal  adviser, directorate general for external relations, on behalf  of the European Commission.    Since 1990 Hungary has received substantial assistance (to  the tune of ECU417 million) from the European Union to support  its transition to a market economy and to promote civic society  goals.    The indicative programme (IP) has been drawn up against the  background of important developments, notably the signing of the  Europe Agreement in December 1991, and its entering into force  on 1 February 1994, the PHARE [Economic and Reconstruction Aid  for Poland and Hungary] guidelines for 1993-97 approved by the  EU member states in November 1992, and the conclusions of the  European Council of June 1993 in Copenhagen.    For Hungary, the PHARE 93-97 guidelines and the conclusions  of the EU council of Copenhagen, have had a number of  implications which were already incorporated in the 1993-1994  indicative programme, including: (a) a continuing strong  emphasis on institutional development, and concentration of  efforts on a limited number of core areas of activity; and (b)  adapting the assistance framework to promote directly  growth-oriented objectives by drawing on the range of PHARE  instruments available, as well as through close donor  coordination and (where appropriate) co-financing with external  and domestic sources of finance.    In light of the government's priorities and taking into  account the principles guiding the PHARE assistance, the  following three main areas of assistance have been agreed by the  government of Hungary and the European Commission:    (i) private sector development including financial sector  reform, enterprise restructuring, investment and trade  promotion, agricultural reform, sme development and regional  development.    (ii) infrastructure development including development of  transport infrastructure, improvements of border crossing,  environment and energy.    (iii) human resources development including support to the  TEMPUS programme and public administration reform.    In addition support will be provided for the implementation  of the Europe Agreement.</p>

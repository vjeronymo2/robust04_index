			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / International Company News: Texas Instruments makes strong return to profits TEXAS Instruments, the US semiconductor and electronics manufacturer, unveiled improved third-quarter earnings and said its semiconductor operations returned to profitability after 10 consecutive quarters of losses. Net income for the quarter was Dollars 57m, or 58 cents a share, compared with a net loss of Dollars 113m or Dollars 1.45 per share in the third quarter a year ago. Net revenues were Dollars 1.9bn, up from Dollars 1.7bn. The results for this year's third quarter include a pre-tax charge of Dollars 10m related to the sale of TI's multi-user minicomputer systems and services operations to Hewlett-Packard. Last year's third quarter included restructuring charges of Dollars 55m. The turnround reflects the success of TI's efforts to increase the proportion of 'differentiated' or non-commodity types of chip products it makes and so reduce its vulnerability to the volatilities of the memory chip market. TI noted there has been significant improvement in the US semiconductor market this year, but growth in the world market continued to be restrained by sluggish economies, especially in Japan. Revenues for the first nine months of 1992 rose to Dollars 5.4bn from Dollars 5bn. Net income was Dollars 170m, or 54 cents, against a loss of Dollars 324m last year.</p>

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / International Company News: SE-Banken recovers to post profit of SKr357m Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, the leading Swedish commercial bank which 12 months ago was on the brink of disaster, yesterday revealed a dramatic recovery in underlying earnings. SE-Banken, historically the financial pillar of the Wallenberg family industrial dynasty, reported an operating profit of SKr357m (Dollars 44.67m), compared with a 1992 loss of SKr5.37bn caused by huge loan losses that had forced it to seek government aid. It withdrew the aid request last August as conditions improved and opted instead to recapitalise through a SKr5.3bn rights issue. The extent of the improvement became fully clear yesterday with operating profits up 81 per cent before loan losses to SKr10.5bn, due in large part to lower interest rates. But the group continues to carry large lending losses, mostly related to the property, finance and insurance sectors. Incurred loan losses and provisions totalled SKr10.17bn, compared with SKr11.18bn. But the total of problem loans was down more sharply, to SKr16.86bn from SKr25.9bn, accounting for 5.7 per cent of the total loan portfolio, compared with 7.53 per cent. 'We have passed the peak of credit losses,' said Mr Bjorn Svedberg, chief executive. He unequivocally declared the crisis that hit all Swedish banks in 1992 to be over, but declined to say how long it would take to get loan loss levels down to normal levels. The bank is again not paying a dividend. Underlining the continued drag exerted by loan losses, Foreningsbanken, Sweden's fifth largest bank, meanwhile reported an operating loss in 1993 of SKr2.09bn, compared with SKr1.34bn, as loan losses grew 26 per cent to SKr4.4bn. It said loan losses would tumble and income rise this year, but was uncertain of a return to profit in 1994. At SE-Banken, net interest earnings rose 49 per cent to SKr9.78bn. Commissions, fees and foreign exchange earnings were ahead by 11 per cent at SKr6.8bn and other income rose 87 per cent to SKr1.8bn. SE-Banken's total capital ratio stood at 13 per cent at the year end, compared with a low point of 8.4 per cent at the end of 1992.</p>

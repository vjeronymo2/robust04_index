			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GM EXECUTIVE AND WIFE FOUND SLAIN  </P> <P> A General Motors Corp. executive and his wife were found shot to death, their  bodies dumped in a park, after their home was ransacked and looted Friday,  police and FBI agents said.  </P> <P> Glenn E. and Wanda Tarr's neighbors reported a possible break-in about 5:30  a.m. Friday. The couple were not there, and police said it appeared they had  been abducted.  </P> <P> Their bodies were discovered by a woman walking her dog in a park in nearby  Pontiac later Friday. Each had been shot several times.  </P> <P> "We do not believe they were shot at the home," said Hal Helterhoff, who heads  FBI operations in Michigan. Helterhoff said money was taken from the couple's  account at a 24-hour bank machine at 9:06 p.m. Thursday, but that two other  attempts to get cash shortly afterward failed. The FBI believes Mrs. Tarr was  forced back to her home, which was then robbed and ransacked. The couple later  were shot.  </P> <P> The couple's two cars, a 1989 Geo Prizm and a 1988 Chevrolet Cavalier, were  missing. Guns, liquor, jewelry and part of a coin collection were believed  taken from the home, Helterhoff added.  </P> <P> Glenn Tarr is assistant manager of marketing information and research for GM's  Chevrolet Division headquarters in Warren.  </P></p>

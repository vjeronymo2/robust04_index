			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FEWER STUDENTS WALK OUT IN DRESS CODE PROTEST  </P> <P> A new dress code at Peary Junior High School in Gardena triggered a walkout by  nearly 180 students Tuesday, but the protest appeared to have lost some steam  Wednesday when only 11 students walked out.  </P> <P> Principal Alvin L. Hayes Sr. said he saw the students leaving the campus at 9  a.m. Wednesday. He said they were joined off campus by four other students who  had not reported to school.  </P> <P> The new dress code, which went into effect Monday, was imposed by the school's  leadership council, a 16-member group that includes faculty, parents, community  members, a student and the principal.  </P> <P> A previous dress code barred gang-oriented clothing in general, but the new  rules specifically prohibit items such as hats, hair nets, bandannas, gloves, a  single earring and gang colors. Students who walked out argued that the rules  limit their personal freedom.  </P></p>

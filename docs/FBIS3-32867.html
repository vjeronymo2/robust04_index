			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] Recent Mexican press coverage of the  rebellion in Chiapas, which includes commentaries and reports of  official and local views, touches on a broad range of topics,  including the rebellion's ideological and organizational  origins, political and economic factors promoting it, guerrilla  methods of operation, viability of the movement, and the  national political ramifications of the uprising.  <H5>  Paz Stresses Particularity </H5>   Poet and Nobel laureate Octavio Paz characterizes the revolt  as a manifestation of problems peculiar to Chiapas, rendering it  unlikely to spread to other states. In his view, the Chiapas  rebellion bears traits more akin to Guatemala and El Salvador  than to other parts of Mexico. Paz observes that the guerrillas'  statements reflect a mix of elements: Maoism, liberation  theology, and ideas borrowed from Peru's Shining Path, and  Central American revolutionary movements, "in sum, the remains  of the great shipwreck of 20th-century revolutionary  ideologies." He pronounces the uprising "unreal and...doomed to  failure...[and out of touch] with our country's situation and  its needs and current aspirations." He adds that "the Indian  communities have been deceived by a group of irresponsible  demagogues, and these are the ones who should be held  accountable before the law and the nation." He retreats somewhat  in his conclusion, however, saying that the leaders of the  rebellion "are not the only ones responsible. A big share of the  blame--perhaps the biggest, in historical and moral terms--rests  with the well-off classes in Chiapas and many state politicians.  What has happened should serve notice that if there is any place  in Mexico where social, political, economic, and moral reform is  necessary, that place is Chiapas." (Mexico City LA JORNADA 5 Jan  94)  <H5>  Modernization Need Seen </H5>   Historian, novelist, and editor of the Mexico City monthly  NEXOS Hector Aguilar Camin similarly criticizes the intellectual  underpinnings of the revolt as remnants of Cold War leftist  thinking, attributing special responsibility to church base  communities and "groups of religious" inspired by liberation  theology and the Catholic Church's "option for the poor." He  declares "the Catholic Church as a whole and the Church in  Chiapas in particular have some explaining to do to Mexican  society about its radicalized wing, which appears to be the  central actor in the makeup of the conflagration in Chiapas."  Aguilar Camin concludes that "the explosion in Chiapas appears  more like the last chapter of the now past Central American wars  than the first chapter of any future violent instability in  Mexico," adding that the rebellion's "cathartic eruption does  not deny, but rather confirms, the process of  internationalization in the country: the end of its proud  insularity; the permeability of all its borders to the fair and  ill winds of the world. And rather than refute, the rebellion  ratifies the urgency of the modernization already undertaken,  bringing to the fore the essential modernizations of the  future," which he identifies as (1) a "political agreement that  completes the pending democratic transition and sets aside  violence as an alternative for public action," and (2) an  "awareness that galvanizes the national will once and for all to  confront the evils of poverty as the leading challenge and  inescapable condition for the modernity that Mexicans neither  can nor should abandon." (Mexico City PROCESO 10 Jan 94)  <H5>  Chiapas Official Assessment </H5>   A Chiapas State document, identified by LA JORNADA as a  confidential report to high levels of government in Mexico City,  voices state government concerns over possible future violence  in 42 "high risk" municipalities, as occurred in Ocosingo,  Altamirano, Las Margaritas, and San Cristobal de las Casas. The  list includes: Yajalon, Chilon, Tila, Tumbala, Citala,  Sabanilla, Salto de Agua, Palenque, Nicolas Ruiz, Chiapilla, San  Lucas, Venustiano Carranza, Villa de las Rosas, Socoltenango,  Teopizca, Simojovel, El Bosque, Huitiuipan, Pueblo Nuevo,  Bochil, Jitotol, Pantepec, Tapalapea, Rayon, Tapilula, Ocotopec,  Coapilla, Tecpatan, Copainala, Francisco Leon, Chenhalon,  Larrainzer, Chalchihuetan, Pantelho, Sinacatan, Tenejapa,  Chamula, Chanal, Huixtan, Oxchuc, Angel Albino Corzo, and La  Concordia.    The 16-page document, titled "Political Diagnosis of the  Conflict Zone," also names 13 areas in various other  municipalities requiring what LA JORNADA calls "special  surveillance": In Cacahuatan, the municipality's main town of  Agustin Iturbide and Salvador Urbina; in Union Juarez, the Santo  Domingo ejido and Once de Abril; in Tapachula, the ejidos of  Manacal, Chespal, Mexiquito, Toquiancito and Toquian; in  Motozintla, the ejidos of Belisario Dominguez and Male Cuaresma;  in Amatenango de la Frontera, Pajayal ejido; and in Ciltepec,  the municipality's main town.    According to the LA JORNADA account, the document devotes  considerable attention to the economic and political problems it  sees as the root of the conflict. It notes that the  "considerable investments" made by the federal government have  been "insufficient in comparison with the needs of the region"  and notes that rural residents have been hurt by tight credit  that has affected coffee, corn, and cattle operations;  inadequate supply and marketing systems; the burden of past due  loans; and a government decree "that makes the region an  ecological reserve and blocks cattle and forestry operations  without offering alternative means to survival." The document  identifies other serious problems as the drop in coffee and  cattle prices, the presence in the state of large numbers of  Guatemalan refugees and workers, a high rate of alcoholism, the  activities of middlemen, drug trafficking, and racial  discrimination. Also seen as contributing to the unrest is the  "activism...of social organizations and the religious activism"  of priests, deacons, catechists, and, particularly, the bishop  of San Cristobal de las Casas, Samuel Ruiz.    The document urges the cancellation of past due debts  accumulated by impoverished coffee growers and cattle ranchers,  and a change in the government's attitude toward peasants to  demonstrate, in LA JORNADA's words, "a treatment respectful of  their dignity as humans, taking care that individuals assigned  to the region are socially committed, with special attention  being given to securing and administering justice." It further  recommends establishing a single, microregional governmental  point of contact in each municipality, as well as the creation  of additional municipalities out of what are now the  municipalities of Ocosingo and Las Margaritas. The document also  recommends a policy of cooperation with the churches,  particularly the Catholic Church.    LA JORNADA notes in passing that the document reports the  area affected by the rebellion as inhabited not only by  Tojolabal, Tzeltal, and Chol Indians, but also "mestizos from  Michoacan, Guerrero, Puebla, and Oaxaca." (LA JORNADA 9 Jan 94)  <H5>  Indian Support Cited </H5>   In two interviews, Carlos Montemayor, author of the novel  "Guerra en el Paraiso" ("War in Paradise," set during the  insurgency in Guerrero in the 1960's and 1970's) and specialist  in guerrilla affairs, characterizes the rebellion as the "tip of  the iceberg" of discontent, asserting that it is supported by a  vast network that has discreetly supplied food, money,  information, and protection to the guerrillas through a complex  Indian social and familial organization. He asserts that "Indian  family structure is at once very simple and very complex.  Deep-running communication, social organization, and economic  networks run up and down the mountains, rivers, and forests of  Mexico's various regions. It is very hard for groups, movements,  or individuals from outside the area to pass unnoticed. My  experience has been that whether one is talking about rural,  mestizo, or creole areas, the mountains and forests have more  eyes than the cities. It is impossible not only for vehicles but  even for individuals to move about undetected."    Montemayor appeals to federal and state governments to enter  into negotiations with the Indian communities in which for the  first time concessions would be made not only by the authorities  but also by Chiapas's large land, cattle, and timber interests,  and the rights of the Indian communities would be protected. He  then cautions that these negotiations will be fruitless "if  there is no will among Chiapas's creoles and mestizos,  landholders and politicians to stop thinking like 17th-century  encomenderos [Spanish royal Indian labor grantees] and if the  government and the army do not refrain from seeing these  negotiations as a defeat rather than a social victory in the  very evolution of the country." Montemayor warns against seeking  a strictly military solution to the rebellion; such movements,  bred over a long period, are "very resistant" to suppression,  and seeking only a military solution "could lead us to a Central  Americanization" of the situation. (LA JORNADA 4 Jan 94, PROCESO  10 Jan 94)  <H5>  Antecedents Reviewed </H5>   In a wide-ranging review of the rebellion's antecedents,  Luis  Hernandez Navarro, an adviser to the National Coordinating Board  of Coffee Grower Organizations, asserts in the 9 January LA  JORNADA that while colonization of the Lacandon Forest region  was begun by lumber companies, area settlement received a major  impetus in the 1940's from the many migrants who arrived there  after unsuccessful efforts elsewhere in the country to secure a  piece of land through the nation's agrarian reform program.    Discussing the role of the Church, he adds that, as part of  the "enterprise of building communities and lives where there  had been none before," the settlers came to rely upon the  presence and sympathy of the Catholic Church, while at the same  time there was a "notable absence of government institutions,"  making "religion" one of the "key foundations upon which the new  communities were built." According to Hernandez Navarro,  catechists not only provided religious instruction but also  became key elements in linking communities with the outside  world. Educated and mobile, many of them having a mastery of  Spanish, they unquestionably became the "organic intellectuals"  of their congregations.    Observing how the struggle for regularization of land claims  and the delivery of government services also marked the area's  development, Hernandez Navarro points out that a division of  opinion arose as how best to seek improvements: "democratic  organizations" sought to promote "peasant self-development";  others felt that only systemic change brought about through  armed force could solve the problem. He says groups like the  Rural Associations of Collective Interest-Union of Unions are an  example of the first approach, and that what is today known as  the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) is an expression of  the second. Hernandez Navarro writes that the main arena of  activity for years was occupied by the self-development groups,  despite resistance from state governments; but some three years  ago this approach began gradually to lose influence among the  region's inhabitants, owing to years of conflict with  landholders and their "white guards," who monopolized state  government institutions and resources and blocked the flow of  resources (itself inadequate) the federal government sought to  channel into Indian communities through its programs.  Elaborating on the federal programs, he claims that for "many of  those initiatives it had been intended to use the local elites  as promoters of modernization; and on top of this, the ongoing  dismantling of government institutions that was part of the  reform of the state has created a vacuum which has been only  partially filled by democratic organizations." (With respect to  one such program, the National Solidarity Program, Pronasol,  journalist Miguel Angel Granados Chapa notes in a 9 January  Monterrey EL NORTE commentary the Pronasol claim that prior to  1993 its funding for Chiapas was obliged to submit to  traditional, inefficient state government controls under then  Governor Patrocinio Gonzalez Blanco Garrido.)    These problems were compounded by a drop in earnings from  the  state's key products, writes Hernandez Navarro. Timber,  protected since 1989 by conservation regulations, ceased to be a  source of income. Coffee growers were hurt not only by the fall  in international coffee prices from $120/140 per 100 pounds to  $60/70, but also by the disappearance of government marketing  and technical assistance. A decline in corn productivity  resulted from population pressures and a contraction of the  slash-and-burn cycle from 30 years to only two years. Also cited  is the declining profitability of the cattle industry.  <H5>  Catechists' Role Noted </H5>   A Tzotzil Indian interviewed in Huixtan (Chiapas) by LA  JORNADA, who asked to have his identity withheld, addressed the  role of catechists in the rebellion. Without identifying them,  the Indian says that catechists who had taught him 20 years  earlier were the ones who "tried to convince us to join the  guerrillas" the morning of 1 January, when 300 EZLN members  occupied the town's main square. He identifies the catechists  turned guerrillas as current residents of the town who had once  held "positions of authority" in the ruling Institutional  Revolutionary Party (PRI). He also says that most of the rebel  force, consisting of both men and women, ranges between the ages  of 16 and 20, and that in talking with the guerrillas he learned  that they communicate with each other by using skyrockets and  red lanterns. (LA JORNADA 7 and 8 Jan 94)  <H5>  Political Aspects Emphasized </H5>   While maintaining that economic injustice played a crucial  part in fomenting the rebellion, four prominent commentators  emphatically stress in separate commentaries that inadequate  political reform was an equally important factor, one that, if  neglected, threatens unrest during the August presidential  elections.    Linking Chiapan developments with the prospects for societal  peace nationally, PRI member of the Federal District Assembly of  Representatives and political reform advocate Demetrio Sodi de  la Tijera writes that the rebellion "is not just about changing  social conditions, nor is it a problem of resources or  solidarity." He argues that it is "basically a rebellion over  political conditions, government corruption, electoral fraud,  and the imposition of officials from above, a response to  plotting by officials and caciques, injustices, lawbreaking, and  repression that Indian communities suffer every day, and  infringements of the law that occur in many parts of the country  and that affect the majority of Mexicans." In the aftermath of  the rebellion, "the danger of social explosions occurring in  other parts of the country and becoming generalized" has "risen  immensely," especially if the upcoming election's results are  "unacceptable" to "political forces" in the country. (LA JORNADA  7 Jan 94)    Drawing heavily on Thomas Benjamin's 1989 historical study  "A  Rich Land, A Poor People: Politics and Society in Modern  Chiapas" to document his case that unjust social and economic  structures dominate Chiapas, Colegio de Mexico international  relations specialist Lorenzo Meyer argues that "the challenge  facing Mexico as a whole and her political class in particular  is deeper and more serious than that which brought the  government to negotiate the free trade agreement with the United  States." What is involved, he said, is "negotiating, under  difficult circumstances, a new political pact between those who  govern and a majority of the governed" that recognizes "their  status as citizens and redistributes in a less unjust manner the  burden of economic development, without any of the irresponsible  acts, chicanery, corruption, and shams that have made the  Mexican political class world famous (`the perfect  dictatorship')." (Mexico City EXCELSIOR 6 Jan 94)    National Autonomous University of Mexico political scientist  Jorge Castaneda similarly criticizes the political as well as  economic roots of the rebellion during an interview and then  asserts that "the problems of poverty are not resolved with  money alone, because the problem is not one of expenditures but  rather one of structures, of organization, for [Indians] to  participate in decisions concerning their communities, jobs,  decent treatment by officials, the return of lands, etc." On  account of this, Castaneda sees the political system facing a  dilemma, a "political crisis," because to carry out the needed  reform, the government will have to weaken the powerful economic  and social interests upon which the system is built and which  remain outside the control of elected officials. For him, the  rebellion signals that citizens have reached their "limit," and  that if there is a failure to achieve an "electoral process that  is clean and acceptable to everyone, there is a danger of  violence." (PROCESO 10 Jan 94)    In a Spanish-language version of his NEW YORK TIMES  Syndicate  column carried by LA JORNADA, novelist Carlos Fuentes stresses  the importance of democratic political reform as a prerequisite  for a successful and just economic reform undertaken by the  government. He emphasizes that propagation of democracy must  start at the most elemental level, "in the smallest villages,  where the inhabitants know each other and know how to choose the  best persons. All democracy starts by being local.... On the  other hand, the central authorities almost always impose the  worst officials [upon communities].... Only they are able to  work with the Chiapan oligarchy." In his view, the "Mexican  political and economic system, antidemocratic and unjust, shares  responsibility for the explosion in Chiapas." Fuentes sees  achievement of parallel political and economic reforms in  Chiapas as a necessary first step in the genuine "economic,  political, and cultural transformation" of the country.

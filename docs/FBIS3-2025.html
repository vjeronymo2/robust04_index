Addressing a press conference held in Zagreb, Akashi said  4,600 soldiers are needed for Sarajevo and 6,050 for other  regions of Bosnia.    He stressed that the international community must guarantee  the increase if it sincerely hopes for a peace in the war-torn  former Yugoslav republic.    If the request is not met, he warned, all the achievements  of  the peace efforts made in Sarajevo will be lost again.    According to Jean Cote, former commander of the UN  protection  force in Bosnia, Turkey, Malaysia, Egypt and Jordan are willing  to join the protection force in Bosnia. But whether these  countries will be invited to send their troops will be decided  by the United Nations.    Cote said the United States, Britain and France should  contribute the most to the protection force.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Cabinet Approves 6.78 Trillion </F> Supplementary Budget"]    [Text] Rome, 29 Dec (ANSA) -- The cabinet this evening  approved a supplementary budget expected to bring in 6.78  trillion lire next year by a series of measures including hikes  on Value-Added Tax, spirits and petrol and two new state  lotteries: a " scratch-and-win" game, and a new version of the  soccer pools in which punters have to guess the highest-scoring  matches.    The package contains no increase in the price of cigarettes,  although Finance Minister Franco Gallo said certain fixed taxes  including that on tobacco "might be reviewed before the end of  April."    According to ministerial estimates, the measures will bring  in 6 trillion lire in 1995 and 6.29 trillion the year after. The  package will only boost inflation by 0.2 percent next year,  ministers said.    In wider moves attached to the mini-budget, the cabinet  exempted Treasury bond transactions from bourse taxes and  approved a capital gains package -- in the form of a bill --  including incentives to give firms greater access to risk  capital. It also authorised the Treasury's deposits and loans  department to issue bonds that may be underwritten by its  joint-stock subsidiaries -- a move seen as aimed at helping the  IRI [Institute for Industrial reconstruction] engineering  conglomerate get its runaway debt under control.    The mini-budget adds 50 lire onto the price of lead-free  petrol and 70 lire onto that of normal petrol, taking them up to  1,550 lire per litre and 1,655 lire per litre respectively:  widening the eco-friendly difference between the two from 85 to  105 lire per litre.    VAT [value-added tax] rises from 4 to 9 percent for the sale  of restructured buildings and the granting of licenses to  cooperatives; from 12 to 13 percent for clothing, footwear,  fabrics, wines and certain foodstuffs; and from 9 to 13 percent  -- from 1995 -- for telephone services. But it falls from 19 to  13 percent for deluxe hotel charges.    The price of a large bottle of spirits will rise by about  250  lire, bringing Italy's VAT on liquor into line with European  Union standards.    Ministers said VAT revenue would rise by 2.51 trillion lire  next year, 90 billion in 1995, and 100 billion the year after  that. The lapse between VAT registration and payment was  shortened by 15 days.    The package retains through 1994 last summer's extraordinary  levy on powerful cars and motorcycles. It also targeted second  homes in the country -- many of which have escaped heavy  taxation by calling themselves farms -- by requiring all  so-called rural buildings which are not in fact farmhouses to be  registered at land offices in the nearest town.    But it abolishes a 500-lire levy on credit card transactions  and replaces cheque and receipt levies with a surcharge on bank  statements, so as to favour the use of current accounts for most  payments.    The capital gains bill, linked to the mini-budget but  requiring separate parlimanetary approval, widens the tax base  of financial activities, reintroduces taxation of profits via  anonymous detractions on overall results, offers an optional  system of lump-sum detractions from dividends, and offers a  range of tax breaks for investors in private companies.    Enlarging on the capital gains package, Gallo explained that  the government "intends to reclaim also capital gains on bourse  earnings: but the tax must be applied on the net result and  levied in an anonymous form."    He said the Finance Ministry is in favour of cutting capital  gains tax rates to just three, between 10 and 25 percent.    "We are obviously thinking of cutting the levy on bank  deposits from 30 to 25 percent. But I think the detraction on  state bonds should stay at 12.5 percent," he said.    There would also be the option of the "straight coupon  payment" on dividends, he said.    Amid a range of separate measures aimed at making it more  difficult to dodge VAT and other direct tax payments, the  cabinet cut from 2/3rds to 1/10th the proportion of taxes on  entertainers' publicity costs that can be paid in a lump sum  rather than a percentage of overall earnings.    It also lowered from 15 to 10 percent the floor above which  shareholdings in limited companies are subject to a separate 25  percent levy rather than a percentage payment.    Gallo also said that, despite the tight limits set by the  budget, the government had also tried to produce a fiscal policy  that was not an "end unto itself," but rather represented a  step towards "simplification by bringing order to legislative  chaos and setting the administrative machine in motion again."</p>

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Brazil spending doubts President Itamar Franco of Brazil (pictured above) looks set to order a pay rise for military and government employees early next week, raising serious concern about the government's ability to control spending before the presidential election due in October, reports Angus Foster in Sao Paulo. Mr Franco has asked finance ministry officials to assess the government's scope to raise salaries. A decision is likely on Monday or Tuesday. 'The president wants an increase; it is the size which is being discussed,' said his spokesman, Mr Fernando Costa. The president has come under pressure from the military, who complain their salaries have not kept pace with inflation for many years. Mr Romildo Canhim, a minister with close military links and who has been reviewing pay levels, has suggested an average 28 per cent rise for most government employees. That would lift government spending by the equivalent of about Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.6bn) this year. Analysts said the request was optimistic but that any increase at this stage would damage the government's credibility. The current anti-inflation economic plan needs a balanced budget to help convince markets that the government will not start printing money to pay its bills. The president has already proposed an 8 per cent increase in the minimum wage, to take effect this year, and a package of emergency spending in Brazil's north-east, together likely to cost more than Dollars 800m.</p>

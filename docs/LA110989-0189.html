			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HERDMAN, ANDERSON LEAD UCI'S EXHIBITION VICTORY  </P> <P> The UC Irvine basketball team, led by the outside shooting of Jeff Herdman and  Justin Anderson, shot past High Five America in the second half for a 99-96  exhibition victory Wednesday at Irvine's Bren Center.  </P> <P> Herdman and Anderson, who figure to be the Anteaters' three-point specialists  this season, looked in midseason form as they combined for 21 second-half  points. They also made six three-point shots between them, Anderson making  four.  </P> <P> Sparked by their performance, UCI outscored High Five America, 41-19, in the  game's final 14 minutes.  </P> <P> "You've got to be encouraged when you're able to come back from 18 down against  some pretty good ball players," UC Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan said.  </P> <P> High Five America, an anti-drug club team that had defeated such teams as  Villanova and Wichita State, featured Eric White (Pepperdine, Clippers) and  John Hatten, who played for Cal State Long Beach last season.  </P> <P> Irvine trailed, 76-58, with 14 minutes to play. High Five America led by five  at halftime and outscored Irvine, 22-9, in the first six minutes of the second  half, building that lead with the help of five three-point shots.  </P> <P> "That happened because one of their guys would beat one of ours, and when  another one of our guys came to help they just dished off to the open man for  the shot," said Mulligan.  </P> <P> Mulligan was pleased with his team's offensive effort, but said the defense  still leaves much to be desired.  </P> <P> Herdman, Anderson and Rod Palmer each had 18 points to lead UC Irvine. High  Five America was led by Doug Spradley, who had 21, and Pat Hamilton, who had  20.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: HUMAN RIGHTS HEROES  </P> <P> The whole world watched the drama that unfolded during the student-led  pro-democracy demonstrations and ensuing massacre in Beijing's Tian An Men  Square. Will it watch again -- through Hollywood's eyes? A number of producers  hope so.  </P> <P> So does HBO -- an insider there tells us the cable network is hungry for a  China project, if the right one comes along.  </P> <P> Michael Manheim (TV's "Roe vs. Wade"), who's pursuing dramatic rights, said  he's "in direct touch with the dissident student leaders in China -- and  elsewhere." Meaning Paris, where eight student leaders triumphantly surfaced on  Bastille Day.  </P> <P> The project will be part of "The Human Rights Project" -- a series of  features/TV projects about "human rights heroes around the world." Manheim's  company is partnered in the venture -- "in the works long before China  transpired" -- with RAI, Italy's premiere TV network, and producer Alex Ponti,  with the support of several human rights organizations.  </P> <P> Other contenders include David Rintels, who's "kicking some ideas around with  some people." And Mike Farrell, who'd like to find "an American hook. There are  Americans who were there and involved. We'd like to make an agreement with the  right individual."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, author and China expert Orville Schelle is trying to raise $800,000  for a 90-minute documentary on the China uprising that would use existing  footage from China and other locales. China's Chen Kaige ("Yellow Earth," "King  of the Children"), in the United States when the protests exploded, would  direct. Peter Kovler ("Hotel Terminus") will produce.  </P> <P> Schelle said he is also being pursued as a consultant on several projects being  developed by others.  </P> <P> "The subject has universal appeal," Schelle surmised. "If you can believe in  L.A. detective heroes, you can believe in human rights heroes. They really put  their lives on the line." Pat H. Broeske  </P></p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Peso falls as Nafta vote nears in US MEXICO'S peso came under heavy selling pressure yesterday as foreign and domestic investors became increasingly nervous over prospects for the North American Free Trade Agreement. The exchange rate fell at one time almost to its lowest permitted level of 3.31 pesos to the dollar, 5.1 per cent below the opening rate of 3.15. At the close the rate was 3.27 pesos, 3.8 per cent down on the day. The decline came after the central bank decided it would no longer intervene to stabilise the currency at the previous informal limit of 3.15 pesos. Government officials said this was done to make speculation more difficult because there is now a greater chance of appreciation of the currency. Uncertainty has mounted in the past week ahead of the scheduled vote on Nafta in the US House of Representatives on November 17. Nervousness increased last night ahead of the televised debate on Nafta between US vice-president Al Gore and Texan billionaire Ross Perot. 'The market is very nervous about Nafta and the debate between Gore and Perot,' said Mr Antonio Gonzalez of Estrategia Monetaria, an exchange rate house in Mexico City. 'By letting the exchange rate rise to the upper band, the central bank is raising the costs of speculation.' Mexico's peso is allowed to float within a band, currently between 3.056 and 3.309 to the dollar, the floor of which devalues fractionally every day. The peso, remarkably stable throughout the year, started weakening last Wednesday, when foreign and domestic investors began to sell the currency to lock in gains made over the year on Mexico's high-yielding government paper. 'The risk is that if Nafta does not pass the peso will break out of the band,' said Mr Ashwin Vasan, who manages global bond portfolios at Oppenheimer Management in New York. 'There is a 20 per cent chance this will happen.' A devaluation would be a serious blow to President Carlos Salinas's administration, which has made price stability and a strong currency the centrepiece of policy. Mexico's central bank bought government paper in the secondary market yesterday, pushing up overnight interest rates to 18 per cent from 14 per cent the day before. The stock market closed up 1.3 per cent, after falling sharply on Friday and Monday.</p>

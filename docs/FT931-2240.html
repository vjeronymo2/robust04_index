			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Books: Mistress of Menabilly DAPHNE DU MAURIER by Margaret Forster Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 17.99, 455 pages LETTERS FROM MENABILLY by Oriel Malet Orion Pounds 18.99, 303 pages DAPHNE du Maurier, who always valued her privacy, was virtually a recluse towards the end of her life. Instead of an autobiography, she wrote an account of her youth, ending with her marriage in 1932, which concentrated on her development as a writer. Margaret Forster's biography can be said to concentrate on the emotional crises behind that development: her relationship with her father, the famous actor-manager Sir Gerald du Maurier; her passionate friendship with a teacher at her Parisian finishing school; her pre-marital affair with Carol Reed; the highs and lows of her long marriage; the births of her three children; her 'crush' on Ellen Doubleday, the wife of her American publisher; and a brief fling with Gertrude Lawrence. In a working life spanning over 50 years, Daphne du Maurier published some 25 volumes of novels and stories and 10 works of non-fiction and biography. Her sales were quite phenomenal: even with wartime paper rationing, she commanded print runs of 50,000 and 100,000. Film versions of her early novels and later of her stories, The Birds and Don't Look Now, brought her name to a wider audience and boosted an already-considerable income. To the young Daphne du Maurier, the idea of deliberately writing for a particular 'market' would have been anathema. When writing Jamaica Inn, Rebecca, Frenchman's Creek and My Cousin Rachel, she was driven by the same 'hidden prompter' (vide Saul Bellow) as weightier and more ambitious novelists. She was a natural, one of those who turn into a neurotic wreck if not writing and whose lives are therefore dominated by the need to fulfil this urge. Given her highly-respectable old age (she was made a Dame of the British Empire in 1969), it is easy to forget that as a young woman Daphne du Maurier had a raffish reputation. Her father may have been a knight but he was still 'a theatrical' and therefore not quite top-drawer. She herself recounts (but Forster does not) how she shocked the people of Fowey in the late 1920s by walking around the town not only hatless but in shorts. Her first lover, the young film director Carol Reed, the illegitimate son of Herbert Beerbohm Tree, would have made a good match. Instead, she married a handsome martinet who had already fought in the First World War and ended the Second as Major-General Sir Frederick Browning. There have long been rumours about the unhappiness of this marriage, citing Browning's philandering and later his drinking. The biography reveals that sexual relations (known as 'Cairo' in du Maurier code as opposed to lesbian ones, which were 'Venice') were never resumed after the war - more from inertia and shyness than anything else. Sir Frederick's work as Royal Equerry kept him in London all week and his demeanour at Menabilly on weekends earned him the nickname Moper. Because of her writing - now their main source of income - and her love of the seclusion offered by her Cornish home, Lady Browning could seldom be tempted to London, so it is not surprising that things fell apart. But, with typical loyalty, she forgave him his peccadilloes and nursed him to the end. Menabilly was the biggest folly in her life, a dark and dilapidated house which she acquired in 1943 on a two-year lease and into which she poured money - Pounds 30,000 on the roof alone - as if she owned it. She refers to it as 'my rat-ridden ruin', and the myth of a Rebecca-like life of elegant luxury is shattered. She was oblivious to domestic chaos, never bothered with central heating, and when she finally moved to the dower house at Kilmarth in 1969 she was amazed by its warm, sunny rooms. Ms Forster's revelation that Daphne enjoyed 'Venice' with Gertrude Lawrence  -if only during one care-free weekend in Florida - and fell in love with Ellen Doubleday, will not surprise those who have always thought of her as first and foremost a writer with a cavalier attitude to domestic duties and motherhood. A far livelier, if less comprehensive, portrait of the writer can be found in Letters from Menabilly, written to her friend, the novelist Oriel Malet, who adds her own commentary (to be published in May). They are full of irritating Du Maurier slang and half-baked philosophy but there is nothing in the 'official' biography to match these vivid and sometimes irreverent pictures of her curious existence at Menabilly and Kilmarth. 'Do tell me,' she asked Oriel Malet wistfully in her dotage, 'did I write Gone With The Wind, or was it someone else?' Margaret Forster is reluctant to take Daphne du Maurier seriously as a writer; if she has any opinions about the quality of the work, she keeps them to herself. I suspect that she is not a fan. She is certainly wary of making judgments and seems to consider that the fiction is adequately dealt with by old-fashioned psychological readings. Knowing that Rebecca was sparked off by Daphne's jealousy of her husband's previous fiancee does not help us to understand the novel's extraordinary and enduring appeal. Not only has Margaret Forster produced a strangely muted portrait of a particularly colourful character, she makes no suggestions as to how and why the best of these books became and remain so popular. Daphne du Maurier's diction is alternately clumsy and wooden; she has no ear for dialogue, an erratic sense of history and a weakness for stereotypes. Yet, in her best work, the superb story-telling, her dramatic use of nature, her strong sense of place and her ability to evoke evil, put her in a Romantic tradition that goes back to the Brontes. It is surely the business of a major biography to address these contradictions and place the work of its subject in an appropriate cultural context.</p>

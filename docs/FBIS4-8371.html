			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The Bratislava STV 1 Television Network  in Slovak at 1905 GMT on 12 April, on its regular Tuesday "Press  Club" program, carries a 55-minute discussion with Slovak Deputy  Prime Minister Roman Kovac, Interior Minister Ladislav Pittner,  and Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan.    The Cabinet members take turns in answering journalists'  questions. Topics include crime, social welfare, unemployment,  foreign relations, the Slovak Government's appeal to heads of  district offices, and the progress of parliamentary debate on  the government's policy statement.    On the subject of Slovakia's relations with Hungary, Foreign  Minister Eduard Kukan is asked about an election campaign speech  by Hungarian Prime Minister Peter Boross, in which Boross says  he is the spiritual prime minister of 15 million Hungarians. A  journalist asks Kukan: "What is your view of this stance, this  statement, when considering the prospects of the development of  our neighborly relations with Hungary?"    Kukan gives the following response: "This is one of the  easier questions. Elections in Hungary are approaching, and,  thus, all opportunities are being used to attract votes, and the  issue you spoke about is naturally very topical, given the  internal political situation in Hungary.    "We have said several times that we are interested in an  uninterrupted dialogue with Hungary, in a calm and  matter-of-fact dialogue, not an emotional one. I heard about  the Hungarian prime minister's statement, and my understanding  is that he really means some sort of a spiritual leadership of  the Hungarians living abroad. As far as I know, in the same  speech, he also said Hungary recognized the existing current  borders. From our point of view, this is the decisive thing.    "Our view is that the issue of the borders' inviolability is  the fundamental question as regards development of our normal,  good-neighborly relationship with Hungary. All other questions  will start from there. In our diplomatic relations, we have  consistently returned to this issue, and we will insist on  resolving it in a way satisfactory to Slovakia's interests. We  believe we will succeed in resolving this issue in the future,  on condition, naturally, that Hungary will meet us halfway  because this is what Slovakia is doing--showing willingness to  hold talks and not closing communication channels.    "If we succeed in resolving the issue of the inviolability  of  the borders in a way satisfactory to Slovakia's interests, I  believe our relations with our Hungarian neighbor will have the  space to develop in a normal way."

Peng Huai-nan, general manager of the Foreign Exchange  Department of the Central Bank of China, made the statement  after meeting with American delegates who were here for tariff  reduction talks with Taiwan trade officials under the GATT  framework.    Peng said Taiwan is prepared to sign the GATT special  exchange agreement, which is a necessity for GATT membership if  a contracting party is not a member of the International  Monetary Fund (IMF). Taiwan is not an IMF member.    Under the special exchange agreement, a contracting party is  required to avoid payment restrictions on current account trade  and discriminative currency practices, to provide currency  exchange information, to allow exchange of a national currency  held in foreign countries and to hold consultations with other  contracting parties on existing international financial accords.    During his talks with the U.S. officials, Peng expressed the  ROC's willingness to abide by all GATT and IMF currency exchange  regulations.    Peng also asked the U.S. to allow Taiwan to adopt temporary  foreign exchange controls under certain special conditions. "The  U.S. negotiators have agreed to our request," Peng said.    Taiwan applied to join GATT in 1990 and is expected to be  admitted to the body by the end of this year.    The 14-member American delegation, headed by Dorothy  Dwoskin,  an assistant U.S. trade representative, is scheduled to end  three days of talks with Taiwan negotiators on tariff  reductions, market opening and other GATT-related issues later  this evening.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Marat Ospanov, deputy chairman of the </F> Supreme Kenges, by an unidentified correspondent in Almaty on 31  May--recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] In your opinion, what results will  follow the adoption of the parliament statement? In particular,  how will the government react?    [Ospanov] I participated in the Cabinet of Ministers session  yesterday. The prime minister has made correct conclusions.  This is a quite normal phenomenon. Maybe it is unusual from  the view point of our [word indistinct] committees. The Cabinet  of Ministers should aim at establishing contacts with us, and we  all should cooperate very closely.    I personally can forecast that everything will be aimed at  reaching mutual understanding and constructive cooperation.    [Correspondent] The statement talks about the necessity for  a  dialogue between all three branches of power. What do you  think? How can this dialogue be technically possible?    [Ospanov] First of all, this dialogue should be built on the  basis of working contacts during preparation of draft laws.</p>

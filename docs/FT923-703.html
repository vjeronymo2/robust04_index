			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei closes lower on profit-taking PROFIT-taking and arbitrage-related index selling depressed share prices as investment trusts moved to realise profits ahead of the September interim book closing, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average closed down 215.19 at 18,394.76, falling for the first time in four trading days. It hit a high of 18,610.85 in the morning but remained lower throughout most of the day, dipping to a low of 18,393.96 just before the close. Volume eased from 376m shares to 350m. Declines outpaced advances by 543 to 443 with 139 unchanged, the Topix index of all first section stocks fell 9.65 to 1,371.53 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.37 to 1,096.49. Institutional investors stayed inactive as dealers liquidated positions ahead of the weekend. Activity centered on speculative trading by individuals. Despite yesterday's fall, traders said that underlying sentiment remained firm on hopes that an inflow of public funds into the equity market, expected early next week, will support shares. Itoman, the Osaka based textile trader, fell Y14 to Y124. Investors rushed to place sell orders in Itoman after the announcement that five Itoman shares will be exchanged for one share of Sumikin Bussan, which is unlisted, and the shares have fallen by 64 per cent since last Friday's merger announcement. Mitsui Mining &amp; Smelting, the most active issue of the day, fell Y4 to Y519 on profit taking. Nippon Mining, on the other hand, rose Y10 to Y513 on individual buying. Export-oriented high-technology issues were easier on fears of the rise in the yen hurting profits. NEC lost Y20 to Y731 and Fujitsu fell Y10 to Y600. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 32.83 points to 19,790.07 in volume of 21.9m shares. Roundup THERE was a relatively lacklustre performance among the region's markets yesterday. HONG KONG rebounded on bargain hunting by local and Chinese investors, but Cheung Kong and Hutchison Whampoa both slid on a rumour that Li Ka-shing was trimming Cheung Kong's stake in Hopewell Holdings through a private placing. Cheung Kong fell 40 cents to HKDollars 21.20, Hutchison 10 cents to HKDollars 15.40 and Hopewell 2.5 cents to HKDollars 4.975 as the Hang Seng index ended 27.43 higher at 5,686.16, virtually flat on the week. AUSTRALIA continued to fall on worries about Westpac's rights issue which was not fully subscribed. The All Ordinaries index closed 10.8 lower at 1,496.4, a decline of 1.8 per cent over the week. Turnover was ADollars 296m. The banking index closed 29.1 lower at 2480.9 with Westpac striking a day's low of ADollars 2.79 before regaining some ground to close down 5 cents at ADollars 2.86 with 5.6m shares traded. KUALA LUMPUR advanced strongly, helped by lower interest rates and encouraging economic news. The composite index closed up 8.09 at 602.06, up 2.5 per cent on the week. BANGKOK finished weaker due to losses in major property stocks. The SET index ended down 4.44 at 859.17 in turnover of Bt14.34bn. The market was 2.8 per cent stronger on the week. Bangkok Land, which has Thailand's biggest equity capitalisation, lost Bt8 to Bt138 in turnover of Bt796.9m. MANILA settled slightly higher in quiet trading on bargain-hunting. The composite index gained 3.19 to 1,389.61 in turnover of 340m pesos, down 2.2 per cent on the week. PLDT rose 5 pesos to 970 pesos with some 51m shares traded. TAIWAN lost ground again as the weighted index closed 67.98 lower at 3,472.50, still 1 per cent higher on the week. SEOUL drifted higher in featureless trading on afternoon institutional buying, a 2.22 rise to 525.57 leaving the composite index with a week's loss of 1.8 per cent.</p>

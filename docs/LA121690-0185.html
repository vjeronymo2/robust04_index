			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> COWBOYS HAVE SHOT AT PLAYOFFS  </P> <P> Tom Landry, a man who never wastes words, had a rather terse evaluation of the  Dallas Cowboys a year ago when they were struggling through a 1-15 season.  </P> <P> "It will take some time before they are to where they can compete," Landry  said.  </P> <P> Landry wasn't exactly an unbiased observer. He had been fired by new owner  Jerry Jones after 29 years of being the only coach the Cowboys ever had.  </P> <P> But Landry's sentiments weren't exactly unusual.  </P> <P> A lot of people were scoffing at the Cowboys a year ago.  </P> <P> Jimmy Johnson, who was Jones' college roommate, was being ridiculed for  everything from his hairstyle to his offense.  </P> <P> Despite his 52-9 record at the University of Miami, he was being called a  college coach who didn't understand how to coach in the pros.  </P> <P> Linebacker Lawrence Taylor of the New York Giants said Johnson's offense was so  simple that he thought it was some kind of a trick.  </P> <P> A lot has changed in a year.  </P> <P> As the 6-7 Cowboys prepared to play the Phoenix Cardinals Sunday, they knew  that if they won their last three games, they'd be in the playoffs this year.  </P> <P> Sure, the playoffs are watered down this year -- three wild-card teams from  each conference now make it instead of two.  </P> <P> But it still would qualify as the first time a club has made the playoffs the  year after having the worst record in the National Football League since the  Baltimore Colts went from 2-12 in 1974 to 10-4 in 1975.  </P> <P> The turnaround has been so abrupt that Johnson finds himself answering skeptics  that he's raised expectations too high too quickly and will now be compared  with Landry's legacy of 20 straight winning seasons and five Super Bowl  appearances.  </P> <P> "We'd have high expectations next year regardless," he said. "High expectations  next year are a given, and it's ridiculous to say we won too many too fast.  I'll deal with next year next year."  </P> <P> Johnson is serious about making the playoffs this year even though he's a long  shot even if the Cowboys beat Phoenix. They have to travel to Philadelphia next  week.  </P> <P> "I'd be severely disappointed (if we don't make it)," he said. "I'd not be  happy."  </P> <P> The Cowboys have done a lot of things right lately. They traded up in the first  round to draft running back Emmitt Smith. Combined with quarterback Troy  Aikman, he's a key to the offense of the future. They've also stockpiled draft  picks in the Herschel Walker and Steve Walsh deals and have five first-round  picks the next two years.  </P> <P> Even Jones, who was dubbed "(Bob) Irsay with a twang" last year for the clumsy  way he fired Landry, is acting as if he understands how to run a club.  </P> <P> He now admits he blew it by attending the first news conference when the firing  of Landry was announced and he slammed the table and said Johnson was worth  five No. 1 draft picks and five Heisman Trophy winners.  </P> <P> "(Former President) Tex Schramm should have come in the room and basically said  there has been a deal between Bum Bright and Jerry Jones, but what we're here  about tonight is that Tom Landry will no longer be the coach of the Dallas  Cowboys after 29 years. I shouldn't have even been on the same podium with that  deal," Jones said.  </P> <P> Now that the Cowboys are inching close to respectability, the real question is  whether they can take the next step.  </P></p>

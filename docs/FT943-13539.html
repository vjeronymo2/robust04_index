			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Ready for China to westernise - A look at Zeneca's moves to exploit the changing market Mr David Barnes, chief executive of Zeneca, the agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals group, believes his company is putting the building blocks in place for what will be a long-term and lucrative involvement in China. Speaking in Beijing recently after announcing plans to invest Dollars 100m (Pounds 66m) over the next five years in China, he said Zeneca's approach was to 'treat each market as a domestic market and develop from within'. In seeking to position itself in China, Zeneca has opted for a two-pronged strategy that rests on production locally of agrochemicals such as paraquat, the active ingredient in the Gramoxone wide-application herbicide; and on the establishment of co-operative arrangements in the marketing and eventual manufacture of pharmaceuticals. For a company of Zeneca's size and reach - 1993 turnover was Dollars 6.7bn - its involvement in China is modest. Sales of its agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals totalled just Dollars 44m last year. This represents a negligible share of regional sales, which account for about 15 per cent of Zeneca's global business. The company was floated in London and New York last year following its demerger from ICI. But Mr Barnes is confident that, in spite of its limited presence in China, Zeneca is poised for fairly rapid expansion. Within the next few weeks it will announce an agreement with a Chinese joint venture partner to produce paraquat, probably in the Yangtze delta within reach of its biggest markets. The company is also fairly close to agreement on the establishment of a plant in the Shenzen special economic zone adjacent to Hong Kong to produce specialty chemicals used in high value-added products such as dyes, printing ink and resins. At the same time Zeneca is in the process of forming a joint venture consultancy to be known as the Sino-Pharm Development Consulting Company. Its partner in this venture is Sino-Pharm, the foreign trade corporation of the State Pharmaceutical Administration of China. This strategic link with the state pharmaceutical marketing authority is aimed at opening China to a number of Zeneca's more sophisticated products, including Diprivan, its intravenous anaesthetic, Tenormin, a heart drug, and Nolvades for the treatment of breast cancer. The company hopes the consultancy will lead to manufacturing ventures as demand among affluent Chinese increases for 'expensive' drugs. Indeed, Western-style medicines have been growing at a faster pace than traditional Chinese medicines and account for 65 per cent of the total Chinese pharmaceuticals market, which was worth about Dollars 4bn in 1992. Imports of pharmaceutical products account for about 10 per cent of the total and have been achieving year-on-year growth in excess of 20 per cent for the past decade. Zeneca executives say an important new and helpful development in China is the fact that the Chinese now appear to be taking more seriously international concerns about infringements of intellectual property rights. Dr David Jones, Asia Pacific representative for Zeneca agrochemicals, said that a 'tightening up' on abuses of patents has 'given us the confidence to bring in our best technology. Before we were not sure we could defend our technology'. Dr Jones said that in China these days there was 'tremendous demand' for high quality herbicides. He expected sales of paraquat to 'grow exponentially' as farmers sought more effective ways of reducing their workload. The new Zeneca agrochemicals plant will produce initially 15m litres of paraquat, sufficient for the manufacture of 3,000 tonnes of Gramoxone - more than enough for China. Zeneca pharmaceuticals expects that, in time, it will secure a 'significant franchise' in the anti-cancer field in China. Among factors weighing in the company's calculations is the likelihood of an increase in various cancers, including colon and rectal cancers, as living standards rise. Mr David Nelson, general manager of Zeneca Pharma International, said the aim was to 'build a broad purpose pharmaceutical company'. The Zeneca Sino-Pharm consultancy was merely a first step. Planned initial investment is Dollars 20m.</p>

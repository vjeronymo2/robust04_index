"Political logic, morality, our own culture, and above all  the situation in today's world does not allow us to have such  deadly weapons."    The commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC)  in an interview to be pulished Thursday, also said that  political wisdom demands us not to go for the weapons which  could cause devastation for humanity.    "The eight-year-old Iraqi imposed war is proof of the real  nature of our combatants who never violated the internationally  recognized norms concerning wars," he added.    "That Iran is trying to acquire nuclear weapons ...is just a  baseless rumor," Rezaie said.    Commenting on the Persian Gulf he said, the geographical  situation of the waterway is such that the deep water is on  Iran's side which enables the Islamic forces to keep alien  warships under surveillance.    Without going into details he said that there was a plot  hatched by Britain, Israel and the United States to keep  regional tensions high.    "I tell my friends in the UAE to listen to my advice as Iran  wants to continue friendly relations with all the sheikhdoms,"  he added.    On the post-war role of the IRGC, Rezaie said that the IRGC  was busy with extensive construction projects in the country.</p>

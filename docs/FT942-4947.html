			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / International Company News: Portugal plans break-up of electricity utility Electricidade de Portugal, the state-owned power utility, is to be split into 10 separate enterprises as part of a restructuring. Electricity production and distribution will also be partially privatised, Mr Joaquim Silva Correia, EDP chairman, said yesterday. EDP is to be unbundled in July. Separate companies will manage power production and the high-tension transmission network, and there will be four regional distribution companies and five service companies. A holding company will co-ordinate operations and strategy. The new production company, Companhia Portuguesa de Producao de Electricidade, will privatise about 20 per cent of its capital on the Lisbon stock exchange by mid-1995, said Mr Silva Correia. Further tranches would be privatised, but the state would retain a majority holding. The regional distributors would also privatise a minority of their capital over the medium term. All the other companies would remain wholly state-owned. CPPE will take over all of EDP's power plants, estimated to represent about half the company's net assets of Es2,247bn (Dollars 13bn). Generating capacity of 7,200MW is to be expanded to 8,800MW by the year 2000. EDP is Portugal's second-largest company by turnover and number of employees.</p>

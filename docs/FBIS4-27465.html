			<p>BFN     [Text] This morning, a Lao delegation headed by Souban  Salitthilat, deputy foreign affairs minister, left Vientiane for  Cairo, Egypt, to attend the 17th nonaligned ministerial  conference from 30 May to 3 June.    Over the past more than 30 years, the Nonaligned Movement  has  firmly adhered to its principle aimed at safeguarding world  peace, contributing to the struggle for national liberation and  disarmament, and speaking against racial discrimination and for  improved living conditions of people in developing countries,  thus making it an influential political force in the  international arena.    At the Cairo ministerial conference, the Movement will  discuss various issues, including its future and program of  action, particularly in contributing towards making the United  Nations more democratic so it will heed the interests of all  countries -- be they big or small, developed or underdeveloped.  In addition, the Movement will also discuss the forthcoming  eleventh summit, cooperation between the Nonaligned Movement and  other international organizations, economic cooperation, human  rights issues, the environment, and so forth.</p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Berlusconi relents on bank chief The Berlusconi government is due to give its long-delayed approval today for the appointment of Mr Vincenzo Desario as director-general of the Bank of Italy. On October 18 the central bank's governing council named Mr Desario, junior of the two deputy directors, to replace Mr Lamberto Dini, who became treasury minister in May. But approval has been held up to register the government's protest over the bank's refusal to let the right-wing coalition chose an outside candidate. Mr Berlusconi yesterday met Mr Desario along with Mr Dini, who opposed the choice of an internal candidate. The meeting was intended to clear the air over the five-month row.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu and  Willy Claes, deputy prime minister and foreign minister of  Belgium, held official talks in Bucharest today on political  relations between the two countries, economic relations, and  possibilities of making use of judicial and parliamentary levers  to stimulate commercial exchanges between the two countries.    According to our correspondent's report, the Belgian  minister  expressed the determination of his country to support Romania  both in the PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland and  Hungary] program as well as in the Group of 24. The two  ministers also examined the possibility of facilitating trips of  certain Romanian citizens to Belgium.    In a statement made at the end of talks, Claes said that the  most important message that he brings to Romania is that the  Group of 12 has no intention of promoting a discriminatory  policy between Central European countries and that Romania is  not a second-class Central European country.    As far as Romania's association with the European Union [EU]  is concerned, Willy Claes said that the treaty of association  should be regarded as a last step before the association,  however, before 1996 no negotiations can begin on this issue  because neither Romania nor the other Central and Eastern  European countries are prepared for this stage.</p>

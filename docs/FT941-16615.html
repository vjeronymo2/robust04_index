			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Travel: Food drink, culture - and exercise - Patti Waldmeir puts both feet forward on a ramble through southern Tuscany There are many things to hate about long-distance rambling, especially abroad. The foreign footpath is inevitably - nay maliciously - badly waymarked, and the foreign farmer too often raises a sadistic chuckle with electric fencing and bulls. Then there are more mundane concerns: whatever your choice of picnic, it is always hot or sodden by lunchtime; the rucksack is crushingly heavy, no matter what you leave behind; worst, there is no way out once you've started. Only masochists need apply. But even if your flaws do not run to masochism, there is still hope. Alternative Travel Group, an Oxford-based tour company, conducts foreign rambling holidays for those who see walking as the best form of sightseeing. I think it was at lunch on the first day of the ATG tour of southern Tuscany  -or maybe at dinner the first evening - that I realised what I was in for: 10 days of the best in food, drink, scenery, culture and exercise, every one of them dedicated to pleasure. Towards that end, ATG ramblers are relieved of the need to carry a rucksack: luggage is transported by van, and awaits the tired walker in their room at day's end. That is not unique. Other tour companies offer luggage service. But ATG also solves the picnic problem - something other tour companies seem to ignore. I never saw a cheese sandwich or cold sausage roll. Instead, we had stylish, colourful salads (one of my favourites: endive, yellow pepper and peach), the pungent Pecorino cheese (without the unpleasant sweat generated by hours in a rucksack), homemade sausage or cured ham, several kinds of local bread, fresh fruit and wine. On the one day we had heavy rain, we straggled in at lunchtime to find Kit - our versatile tour manager - sheltering in a sort of barn, with succour for the wet and miserable: a big pot of soup and lots of red wine. The dinners were worth a trip on their own. As we limped to table each evening, expectancy soon overcame exhaustion: each was a special meal arranged with local restaurants by Kit, eager to show off the Tuscan specialities which she so clearly adored. And the size of the meals provided ample incentive for a vigorous long walk the next day. Although I scarcely turned down a mouthful of food, and indulged my taste for local red wines, I walked off every ounce of added weight during the day. Unlike most of the guests, who had more sense, I walked every inch of the way from the walled village of Montepulciano to stunning medieval Siena, some 90-odd miles. But I am sure I enjoyed it more because I knew I could opt out, if so inclined, for ATG provides the ultimate antidote to masochism: a chance to be picked up by the van, half way . . . or a third of the way . . . or before the last hill . . . and without adverse moral judgments from our enthusiastic, Italophile tour leader, Frances. To her goes the credit for infallible path-finding and cultured commentary on the medieval hill towns which bejewelled our path, and for stunning itineraries which took in - on one special day - a Romanesque church with naif sculptures above the church door; a dip in the thermal baths of Bagna Vignoni; lunch at Ripa d'Orcia, a privately-owned castle on a dramatic bluff above the Orcia river - and a chance to take a van ride home before the last steep hill. However unreasonable the request, Frances and Kit were eager to meet it. ATG tours are not cheap. My 10-day tour of southern Tuscany, without airfare, cost Pounds 1,270, and that was only after I protested at being charged the US dollar price quoted for overseas bookings: Dollars 2,500. But for the hedonist who likes a fair bit of exercise on the side, the price is worth it. Luxury rambling: for the traveller who has everything.

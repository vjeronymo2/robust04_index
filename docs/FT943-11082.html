			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Russian inflation on the rise again Russian inflation, which was squeezed to under 5 per cent a month in June, hit 6 per cent in July and is set to rise this month and next to reach 10 per cent in September, according to Mr Alexander Livshits, the economic adviser to President Boris Yeltsin, writes John Lloyd in Moscow. Mr Livshits said the central bank had issued or would have to issue at least Rbs6,000bn in credits shortly to cover the expenses of the harvest and to provision the northern cities in the Arctic Circle for the winter. However, he expected the inflation rate to fall again at the end of the year. He said it should now be possible to bring the rate down to around 2 per cent a month in 1995, with a peak in the autumn of 6 per cent. The relatively low inflation rate allowed the central bank to again lower its three-month refinancing rate yesterday from 155 per cent annually to 150 per cent - the sixth reduction since April. The refinancing rate has gone down with inflation from a peak of 210 per cent, though it has yet to stimulate much lending. Most Russian banks prefer to make money by acting as a depositor, by arbitrage and by offering other financial services, than by risking their capital in industry.</p>

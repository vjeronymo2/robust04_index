			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Spring Ram finance director likely to come under pressure SPRING RAM, the kitchens and bathrooms group which surprised the market with profits a third below expectations, is holding a crucial meeting on Monday to review the board and the position of the auditors, Arthur Andersen. Pressure is strongest on Mr Stuart Greenwood, who came to the group two years ago as its first finance director. Spring Ram has delivered two nasty surprises to shareholders in the past five months. False accounting was discovered at the Balterley Bathrooms subsidiary last year and disclosed belatedly and 1992 profits were Pounds 26.2m when Pounds 39m was expected. A profit warning came only four days before the results were due, after much haggling with the auditors. Accounting methods were at the heart of the shortfall. Some observers, however, see Mr Greenwood as a scapegoat and point to the ultimate responsibility of Mr Bill Rooney, chairman and in effect chief executive. Some shareholders have suggested that the roles should be split and are urging the company to step up efforts to appoint two non-executive directors. Shareholder criticism of Mr Rooney is, however, tempered by a desire 'not to throw the baby out with the bathwater'. He oversaw the growth of pre-tax profits from Pounds 1m in 1982 to Pounds 36.2m in 1991. Mr Rooney's explanation of the results disappointment included: 'We have been trying to beat recession for four long years and perhaps we have been stretching too far.' He said it was strange for the company to be 'so prudent and so conservative'. He told investors on Monday that the more rigorous accounting represented a clearing of the decks, Apart from the loyalty he commands in the company, there is a fear that, as one shareholder put it, 'a new face at the top would lead to the inevitable kitchen sinking next year'.</p>

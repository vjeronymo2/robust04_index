			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / UK Company News: QMH seeks investors' approval to raise borrowing powers Queens Moat Houses, the hotel group whose shares have been suspended since last April, yesterday called a special meeting to confirm an increase in its borrowing powers to Pounds 2bn. The board has also reappointed Mr Andrew Coppel, chief executive, as a director. Without the confirmation of the borrowing powers, the circular warns investors, the directors doubt whether QMH would be able to continue to trade. Resolutions to lift the debt ceiling and the re-election of Mr Coppel were passed at the annual meeting last summer, but proved invalid when the company found that one class of preference shareholders had not been given the chance to vote. The meeting will be held on March 8. QMH said that some other resolutions passed since 1989, including one to increase the authorised share capital, had also been found to be invalid. These would be dealt with at the same time as proposals for the Pounds 1.3bn refinancing were submitted to shareholders. Approval for Mr Coppel's appointment will be sought at the next annual meeting. QMH has succeeded in re-acquiring 11 Holiday Inns in Germany, which were disposed of under a sale and leaseback deal struck at midnight on December 31 1992, the last day of that financial year. The company said it had no comment to make about putting 14 provincial hotels, including its original hotel in Brentwood, Essex, up for sale. It has also put seven of its Dutch hotels on the market. Mr Coppel said the group was under no pressure from its banks to sell hotels, and that it would not be in the best interests of shareholders or creditors if a lot of hotels were sold in the short term.</p>

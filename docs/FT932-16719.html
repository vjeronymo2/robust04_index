			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Bosnian Serbs spurn accord BOSNIAN SERBS yesterday defied pressures to accept the peace settlement proposed by international mediators, heightening the risk of further conflict in the former Yugoslav republic. The self-styled Bosnian Serb parliament, called to a special session at Bileca, spurned a resolution that would have allowed conditional acceptance of the peace plan for Bosnia-Hercegovina. The resolution, proposed by Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, was branded by deputies as 'too moderate'. It was cast aside without a vote. Mr Karadzic had poured scorn on the map proposed by the mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, dividing Bosnia into 10 semi-autonomous provinces. But he argued that the boundaries proposed were 70-80 per cent acceptable. He called for direct talks between the three warring parties in Bosnia to reduce the disputed territory to 10 per cent. It was not worth 'killing each other' over such a small area, he said. 'By this resolution we do not accept the maps,' Mr Karadzic argued. 'What we are saying is: peace yes, talks yes, but the maps not yet.' But unconvinced, the deputies formed a commission to reword the resolution in stiffer terms for today's session. The Serb forces occupy 70 per cent of Bosnian territory, hundreds of thousands of Moslems having fled or been expelled from their homes. Mr Karadzic warned of the probable consequences of a negative vote by the Bosnian Serb parliament on the Vance-Owen plan. It was likely to lead to sharper sanctions, arming the outgunned Moslem forces, and even to foreign military intervention, he said. In a move to put pressure on the Serbs to sign the peace plan, the UN Security Council on Wednesday had approved a resolution to allow Nato warplanes to shoot down aircraft flouting a five-month-old ban on flights in Bosnian airspace. Nato permanent representatives agreed in Brussels yesterday to send US, British, French and Dutch fighters to enforce the no-fly zone. Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, said the plans to send the warplanes would be ready less than two weeks from now. Sarajevo Radio reported 'bitter fighting' yesterday around Srebrenica, the besieged Moslem town in eastern Bosnia. It claimed that Serb forces launched artillery, tank and mortar barrages against the town. The radio said government forces repelled a Serb infantry attack. Elsewhere in Bosnia, a five-day-old ceasefire held with only minor violations, though snipers were reported to have killed one person and wounded four in Sarajevo. Meanwhile, Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, Norwegian foreign minister, announced in Oslo he had agreed to take over from Mr Vance as the UN peace mediator on the former Yugoslavia, joining Lord Owen, the European Community representative. The minister will probably take up the job at the end of this month, after the peace negotiations have moved back to Geneva from New York.</p>

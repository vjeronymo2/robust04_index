			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Efim Schwarzmann] </F>   [Text] Simferopol April 2 TASS -- The Ukrainian president's  decree on setting up his office in the Crimea was received with  discontent in the Crimea. Sources among the presidential staff  members told ITAR-TASS today that Leonid Kravchuk's decision was  at variance with the Ukrainian law on the division of powers  between the bodies of state authorities of Ukraine and the  Crimean republic, which contains no provision for the setting up  of a Ukrainian presidential office in the Crimea.    According to the same sources, the decree violates a clause  of Article 14 of the same law, under which Ukraine acts as a  guarantor of the legal status of the Crimean republic.    The decree setting up a Ukrainian presidential office in the  Crimea met with a negative reaction also in the Council of  Ministers of the Crimea and in the Presidium of the republic's  Supreme Soviet (parliament), according to the presidential  staffer, Vladimir Demin.    Demin also said that the Chairman of the Crimean Supreme  Soviet, Nikolay Bagrov sent a proposal to the Ukrainian  president for suspending his decree. The Crimean president's  staff members said the enforcement of the decree would lead to  destabilisation of the political situation in the Crimea because  it contradicts the agreement on mutual respectful relations  between Simferopol and Kiev.    Reliable sources told ITAR-TASS that the Crimean leadership  is planning to make their viewpoint on the Ukrainian president's  intention to set up an office in the Crimea in a message  addressed to the presidents of the Russian Federation and the  United States of America, as guarantors of stability in the  Crimea, and to the participants in the trilateral Moscow accords  signed in January during President Bill Clinton's visit to  Moscow.</p>

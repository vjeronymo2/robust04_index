			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / People: IBM's Robinson moves to DTI Executives of IBM's UK subsidiary are well known for keeping in close contact with senior civil servants in Whitehall. The latest example of the link is Geoffrey Robinson's appointment as the chief adviser on science and technology in the Department of Trade and Industry for a period of five years from June. He will succeed Ron Coleman who retired at the end of March. Geoff Robinson, 46, is director of IBM's Hursley laboratory in Hampshire, the group's main UK research and development centre. He is responsible for 2,000 people working mainly on computer software projects. Robinson is the lab's second director to become a senior government scientist. A predecessor, Sir John Fairclough, was chief scientific adviser to the Cabinet Office from 1986 to 1990. Another link between the two men is the Centre for the Exploitation of Science and Technology (CEST), a London-based organisation dedicated to improving the exploitation of research by UK industry. Fairclough is now chairman of CEST and Robinson is a member of its policy-making council. IBM has named Phyllis Byrne, whose entire career so far has been spent with the company's US operations, to succeed Robinson as head of the Hursley lab. As an American citizen, she will not be able to follow him into the British civil service.</p>

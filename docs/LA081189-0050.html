			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MEDICAL BUILDING HIT BY BOMB BLAST  </P> <P> A medical building housing the office of a white supremacist organization in  Glendale was hit early Thursday by a bomb explosion that shattered windows and  caused about $5,000 damage, fire officials said.  </P> <P> There were no reported injuries.  </P> <P> The two-story structure in the 1200 block of South Glendale Avenue was shaken  by the blast of a medium-strength bomb at 3:30 a.m., according to Capt. John  Orr of the Glendale Fire Department's arson-explosive unit.  </P> <P> Orr said that George King, a member of the League of Pace Amendment Advocates,  favoring deportation of all people who are not white Christians, told  authorities that he believes the bomb was directed at his organization.  </P> <P> The case has been turned over to the FBI because it may have been politically  motivated, Orr said.  </P></p>

			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Chrysalis buys 50% stake in comedy vehicle Chrysalis, the music and media group, has acquired a 50 per cent stake in GDTV, a newly formed independent production company set up as a vehicle to exploit the works of Mr Geoffrey Dean, one of Britain's most successful young comedy writers. His recent credits include Birds of a Feather, May to December, and Chef. Put and call options, exercisable after August 31 1998, have been created on the remaining 50 per cent. If exercised, Chrysalis will pay an amount linked by a formula to GDTV's profits but subject to a cap of Pounds 2.5m plus 10 per cent of any excess of the product of the formula over this amount.</p>

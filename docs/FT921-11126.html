			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Hopes rise for deal on German tax reforms HOPES rose at the weekend for a deal between the German government and opposition over a deadlocked package of tax reforms, including a one percentage point rise in value added tax, and a variety of enterprise taxation cuts, blocked since last December. One possible compromise put forward by the ruling coalition is for the VAT rise to be put almost entirely towards financing the German Unity Fund, thus relieving the financial burden on the federal states in former West Germany. Another deal proposed by Social Democrats from the state of Lower Saxony is for the pain of the VAT increase from 14 to 15 per cent to be offset by a doubling in child allowances to DM100 (Pounds 34.80) a month. The two houses of the German parliament - the directly-elected Bundestag, in which the government has the majority, and the upper house, or Bundesrat, where states ruled by the Social Democrats (SPD) have the upper hand - are scheduled to resume negotiations on Wednesday. Without a deal the whole tax reform package for 1992 will fail, including both increased family allowances and the enterprise tax reforms. The VAT increase is only proposed for January 1 1993. Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, told Die Welt am Sonntag, the Sunday newspaper, that the ruling coalition was offering a 'fair and financially bearable new compromise'. Details which emerged last week include devoting almost all the extra revenue from the VAT increase - about DM11bn - to the unity fund, thus allowing the federal states to keep their own structural funds, for infrastructure spending, intact from 1993. At the same time, the states would get a slightly higher proportion of VAT - 36.5 instead of the current 36 per cent - paid directly to their own budgets. That should increase the temptation for some SPD-ruled states, like Lower Saxony and Brandenburg, to break ranks with their national leadership and agree on a deal. Mr Oskar Lafontaine, the SPD deputy leader and chief negotiator, remains adamant that any VAT increase is out of the question, providing an unacceptable boost to inflation and stoking the wage demands of trade unions. He also rejects cuts in company taxation, at a time when the exchequer is running a record deficit. On the other hand, Mr Lafontaine admits that a legally-binding deal in Brussels for all EC states to have a minimum VAT rate of 15 per cent from 1993 - which seems inevitable in the coming weeks - would cut the ground from under the SPD. Thus the compromise proposal from Mr Gerhard Schroder, SPD premier of Lower Saxony, could provide a face-saving way out: the SPD could claim the credit for the doubling in child allowances to DM100 a month, in exchange for an inevitable backing down over VAT. MR Hans Tietmeyer, vice-president of the German Bundesbank, said at the weekend he could not indicate when a reduction in German interest rates would be possible, Ian Rodger writes from Zurich. 'We will continue to hold monetary expansion within the targets we have set,' Mr Tietmeyer said at a press conference at the World Economic Forum in Davos. He said the decision to raise the Lombard and discount rates on December 19 was not made purely on the basis of the current wage negotiations in Germany. He noted that the moves had already resulted in a reduction in long-term interest rates, and claimed this was a consequence of markets believing that the German authorities were taking inflationary tendencies seriously. 'We have created credibility,' he said. Mr Tietmeyer recognised concern abroad about the interest rate increases, but said Germany was in a special situation. 'German economic development is not the same as in other countries. Co-ordination does not mean that we must have the same policies.'</p>

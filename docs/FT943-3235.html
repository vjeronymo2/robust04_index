			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Jobless fall spread through all regions Last month's fall of 34,200 in seasonally adjusted unemployment was spread throughout all regions although the fall in the south-east, where the number of jobless claiming benefit fell 12,600, was faster than elsewhere. Department of Employment figures for August 11 showed that the adjusted unemployment rate fell to a provisional 9.2 per cent of the workforce from 9.3 per cent the month before. The unemployment rates of all regions fell 0.1 percentage points except in the south-east, where the fall was 0.2 points to a below-average 8.9 per cent. Greater London continued to be an unemployment blackspot in the south-east, with the local jobless rate slipping just 0.1 point to 10.6 per cent. UK unemployment is now well below the latest European Union average of 10.8 per cent but higher than average unemployment of 6.8 per cent in the Group of Seven leading industrial nations. It is also higher than the 7.8 per cent average of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the 25-nation group of industrialised countries. The latest figures continue to show a wide disparity between male and female unemployment. Male unemployment, which fell 26,700 to 1,979,000 between July and August, affected 12.4 per cent of the workforce. Female unemployment, which fell 7,500 to 616,900, was just 5 per cent. But the overall jobless figures showed a marked improvement. Last month's fall in unemployment was higher than the most recent three- and six-month average falls of 21,700 and 26,200 respectively. The seasonally adjusted unemployment total of 2,595,900 in August was 376,000 lower than its December 1992 peak and at its lowest level since January 1992. The employment department reported a fall of 6,300 to 319,500 in the number of claimants joining the unemployment count last month. The August inflow of claimants was the lowest since October 1990 and 51,200 fewer than a year ago. The outflow of claimants increased by 2,100 to 356,400 in August compared with July, but was 16,100 lower than in August last year. The stock of unfilled vacancies at Jobcentres increased a seasonally adjusted 6,600 to 163,900 last month and was 35,200 higher than in August last year. It was the 11th consecutive monthly rise, bringing the stock of vacancies to its highest since April 1990. Jobcentres reported their highest inflow of vacancies - 225,900 - since October 1989. The employment service placed 171,800 people last month, 14,100 more than in July and the most since such statistics started in 1980. But yesterday's official figures suggest that improvements in the labour market have had little inflationary impact on average earnings and no adverse effect on labour relations. The underlying annual growth of average earnings was a provisional 3 3/4 per cent in July, unchanged from June. Underlying annual earnings growth in the production industries was 4 per cent, down from 4 1/4 per cent in June and the lowest rate since these statistics started in 1980. Average earnings growth in manufacturing fell to 4 per cent from 4 1/4 per cent in June, while service industry earnings inflation was unchanged at 3 1/2 per cent. Productivity rose strongly in manufacturing. Output per head was up 5 per cent in July compared with July last year and 4.8 per cent year-on-year in the three months to July. Manufacturing wages and salaries per unit of output fell 0.9 per cent in July compared with July last year and were 0.5 per cent lower in the three months to the end of July compared with a year earlier. Only 27,000 working days were lost to strike action in July in spite of the high-profile signal workers' dispute.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UNEMPLOYMENT LOWEST SINCE JANUARY 1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- August, seasonally adjusted  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Northern Ireland                         13.0% North                                    11.2% North-west                                9.5% Wales                                     9.5% West Midlands                             9.4% Yorks &amp; Humber                            9.4% Scotland                                  9.2% South-east                                8.9% Greater London                           10.6% East Midlands                             8.7% South-west                                8.2% East Anglia                               7.1% UK                                        9.7%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Department of Employment  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

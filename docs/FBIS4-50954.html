			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 20 (XINHUA) -- China's courts and  administrative authorities at various levels have pledged  continued efforts to enforce the law to the letter and bring to  justice violators of the intellectual property rights.    The achievements in the protection of legitimate rights and  interests of the intellectual property right owners in China has  attracted worldwide attention.    Statistics showed that from 1986 to the end of 1993, China's  courts have handled a total of 3,505 preliminary intellectual  property cases. Among them, 1,783 relate to patent matters,  1,168 cases were filed for copyright infringements and 554 cases  were lodged for trademark infringement.    Liu Jiyang, chief secretary of the China Intellectual  Property Society, said that as China's legal authorities stick  to "fair and just" principles, China has moved closer to the  international standards in the enforcement of intellectual  property legislation.    Before July 1993 there was no special division in courts for  handling intellectual property cases. Cases concerning  intellectual property were tried by the economic division and  the civil division respectively.    Since Beijing was the city in which the number of  intellectual property disputes was the highest in the country,  the Beijing Higher People's Court and the Intermediate People's  Court set up their intellectual property divisions at the same  time in July 1993, which was the first such division set up in  Chinese courts.    Since the beginning of this year, the higher people's court  and some of the intermediate people's courts in Shanghai  Municipality, Guangdong Province, Fujian Province and Hainan  Province have all set up intellectual property divisions.    Su Chi, presiding judge of the intellectual property  division  of the Beijing Intermediate People's Court, said that the cases  accepted by the division covered all kinds of intellectual  property cases. They include cases involving disputes over  patents, trade marks, copyright (including the copyright in  computer software), non-patented technology and various cases  concerning the violation of the principle that honesty and  credibility shall be observed and infringement of others' trade  reputation and trade secrets.    Since the establishment of the division, it has accepted 217  intellectual property cases, among which 21 were relating to  foreign countries and Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. The total  sum claimed in all these cases amounted to 156 million renminbi  yuan.    Su Chi said that the intellectual property cases were all  tried by collegiate panels in the division.    In cases of a complicated technical nature, such as cases  involving patents and computer software disputes, expert  assessors are invited to join the panel, Su said.    "However, in most cases, the panel consists of judges only,"  Su added.    When technical problems are involved in a case, explanation  or evaluation made by at least two experts should be heard in  court.    As Su Chi put it, all the intellectual property cases were  heard in public.    He said that the division not only announces the time of  court sessions in accordance with the procedures provided by the  law, but also distribute ahead of schedule the time list of the  court sessions to the public every month.    According to statistics, more than 3,000 people sat in court  within more than half a year.    Su Chi pointed out that among the various intellectual  property cases accepted by the division, infringement cases made  up 80 percent of the total.    He said that the principle in dealing with infringement  disputes was that once the infringing act is proved by evidence,  the court should order the infringer to stop the infringing act  and to compensate for all the damage that the rights-holder  suffered because of the infringement according to the claim of  the rights-holder and the provisions of the law.    The amount of the damages should be such as to properly  compensate for the losses of the rights-holder and to stop any  further infringement.    Su gave the example of the case in which the Beijing Vie de  France Food Co. sued the Beijing Sunshine City Department Store.    He pointed out that it was the first case in China's  intellectual property trials that the reasonable expenses for  the investigation of the infringing act and of the litigation is  deemed to be part of the economic loss and is borne by the  infringer, as ordered in the judgment.    Su explained that the reason was that the "full  compensation"  principle of the Chinese civil law should be fully implemented  so that the damage sustained by the infringed party can be fully  compensated for and they can have less worries about the  economic expense when they launch a legal struggle against the  infringer.    Besides, Su added, the judgment also took into consideration  the principles provided by the Uruguay Round Intellectual  Property Agreement.    In the past 14 years, China has established a complete legal  system for the protection of intellectual property rights.    The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress  enacted the laws governing trademark, patent, copyright and  anti-unfair competition subsequently.    In 1992 and 1993, the Standing Committee of the National  People's Congress adopted the revised Patent Law and Trademark  Law, extending the protection of the Patent Law to such objects  as chemical substances, pharmaceuticals, food, beverages and  flavorings.    The patent rights became applicable to importation while  process patents now became applicable to products. Furthermore,  trademark protection has been extended to service marks and  harsher penalties for trademark infringement acts have been  imposed.    China has also been participating actively in the  international cooperation in this field, fulfilling the  international obligations and joining international  organizations.    Dr. Arpad Bogsch, secretary-general of the World  Intellectual  Property Organization, highly praised China, saying: "In the  history of intellectual property, China has made these  achievements at a speed second to none."</p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Quarto seeks Pounds 9.5m for expansion QUARTO is calling on shareholders for Pounds 9.5m to treble its art print business, as the publisher and publishing services company yesterday announced pre-tax profits up from Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 1.63m for the six months to June 30. The company is to acquire Scafa, a publisher and distributor of art prints in the US, for Dollars 4.4m (Pounds 2.9m) plus between Dollars 1.2m and Dollars 6.5m on a profit formula basis payable by September 1998. The deal pushes Quarto's art business up from 30 per cent to 37 per cent of total turnover, of which art prints will be a third, compared with 10 per cent now. The rights issue is on a 3-for-11 basis at 225p, underwritten by Samuel Montagu. The company plans to allow Scafa Dollars 5m in 'acquisition finance' with the balance going to reduce Quarto's net debt. At the half-way stage Quarto had net debt of Pounds 8.5m (Pounds 6.4m) and gearing of 96 per cent. Pro forma, this will fall to 25 per cent post rights. Net interest payments climbed to Pounds 228,000 (Pounds 177,000) because the company moved Western Signcraft, a silk-screen printer, 20 miles from Bristol to Corsham, costing Pounds 900,000. Turnover rose to Pounds 19.5m (Pounds 16.5m). The sales increase was in volume rather than price. The new administration in the US, where the company sells more than 40 per cent of turnover, had been 'positive' for Quarto. Sales had also benefited from favourable currency translation. Mr Laurence Orbach, chairman, said that following a slightly flatter second quarter trading in the seasonally more significant second half had 'picked up'. The interim dividend is 2p (1.6125p) payable from earnings per share of 6.4p (3.9p).</p>

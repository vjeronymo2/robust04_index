			<p>BFN     [Text] The more than two-year fuel scarcity in Kano State  has disappeared with all the filling stations in the capital  having fuel. The long queues of vehicles witnessed during the  fuel crisis have been eliminated, improving the movement of  vehicles in the state.    Meanwhile, the military administrator, Colonel Mohamed Wase,  has directed the reconstituted task force on the fuel scarcity  to report daily to his office on the supply and movement of fuel  tankers. During an unscheduled visit to the depot, the  administrator directed the task force to discourage touts from  besieging the premises of the depot. Col. Mohamed Wase then  lifted the order prohibiting the sale of more than 100 naira  fuel to motorists.</p>

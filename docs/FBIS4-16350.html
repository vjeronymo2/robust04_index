			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Valentyn Landyk held  a news conference in Kiev dedicated to issues of gas supply to  our state. According to Valentyn Landyk, the general situation  with gas does not evoke concern at present. The problem mainly  lies in the fact that payments for the gas supplied are not made  in time. For example, today our debt to Russia in this sphere  reaches 600 million dollars.    It was reported that a mechanism of settling accounts with  Russia's Gazprom had been worked out during the negotiations  held by our governmental delegation in Moscow on 12 April. It  is envisaged that half of our debt will be paid off at the  expense of the deliveries of Ukrainian-made pipes, pumps, and  electrical equipment. Also, an agreement was reached on storing  10 billion cubic meters of Russian gas in our gas-holders and on  paying relevant compensation to Ukraine for this.    Valentyn Landyk also reported that national joint-stock  company UkrHazProm would be set up in the near future. He  expressed certainty that the problem of energy sources in our  state would be solved by the end of the next year. It is  envisaged that 37 billion cubic meters of gas and seven million  tons of oil will be extracted in Ukraine itself.</p>

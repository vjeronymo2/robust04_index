			<p><P> May 13, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROTECTING TELEPHONE ANONYMITY  </P> <P> I feel that Marx has overlooked the most positive aspects of this welcomed  feature. Realistically, many residences cannot afford or would not be  interested in spending more money to know who is calling them. This decision is  left to the consumer.  </P> <P> Marx failed to point out the advantages of medical and business uses of knowing  the origin of incoming calls. A loved one or any elderly person could have a  life saved in the event of a medical emergency.  </P> <P> Businesses would benefit by being able to route a call to the proper service  person or department instantly.  </P> <P> If Marx contends that calling a spouse from somewhere other than work is a  reason to hinder a potential life-saving capability, he needn't worry about  receiving phone calls anyway.  </P> <P> DAVID A.

			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A transformer caught fire at the Shearon Harris nuclear power plant near  Raleigh, N.C., and was brought under control, officials said. No injuries were  reported. Officials said that the incident posed no apparent danger to  residents and that no evacuations were ordered. The fire apparently was started  by a hydrogen leak in a transformer and did not threaten the plant's nuclear  operations, said a spokeswoman for Carolina Power and Light Co., which owns the  facility. The nuclear generator was shut down automatically when the  transformer fire started. Hydrogen is used to cool the generator.  </P></p>

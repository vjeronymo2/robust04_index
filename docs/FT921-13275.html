			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Row over running of Lloyd's grows THERE ARE signs that the leadership of Lloyd's of London is increasingly isolated in opposing proposed reforms to the way the market is run. With feeling running high among the market's underwriting and broking businesses, Lloyd's Council, the insurance market's governing body, may be forced to backtrack on its initial rejection of a proposal that its responsibilities for business development should be handed over to a new market board controlled by Lloyd's agents. In its 240-page report, published last week, the 14-man task force also recommended that the council's independence as a regulator should be reinforced by the appointment of an independent chairman. On Monday Mr Alan Lord, chief executive, and Mr David Coleridge, chairman, reiterated their opposition to the task force proposals on governance. Mr Lord described them as unworkable. Yesterday Mr Paul Archard, chairman of the Lloyd's Underwriting Agents Association, which represents more than 150 agencies, said he was 'amazed' by the council's instant rejection and by Mr Lord's comments. 'The governance chapter of the task force report is fairly fundamental to other things we want to achieve,' he said. Mr Nigel Rogers, managing director of Octavian Group, one of the most rapidly growing Lloyd's agencies, said: 'I haven't spoken to anyone who thought that the council was right. The groundswell of opinion means that they will have to reconsider.' Mr Chris Burton, joint chief executive of AJ Archer, a listed Lloyd's agency, described the council's decision as 'very disappointing'. He added: 'I endorse the idea of a market board and I believe this view to be widely held.' The Association of Lloyd's Members, which represents more than 9,000 Lloyd's Names, the individuals whose assets provide the market's capital, says it will press the council to reverse its decision. Mr Val Powell, the association's chief executive, said: 'We are in round three and the boxing could get pretty dirty.' Names will be urged to attend meetings next month to register their opposition to the council's stance. The association saw the task force's proposals as analogous to the two-tier boards common in Germany, with the council and the market board playing roles equivalent to those of supervisory and management boards. The market board was necessary because the business had 'not been driven properly', it said. Professor John Kay of the London Business School, a member of the task force, emphasised the importance of a division of the council's regulatory and executive management roles. 'I can't think of any business structure where they are combined,' he said. 'You wouldn't ask the chief executive of BT to be director-general of Oftel.' Editorial comment, Page 14</p>

			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Letter: Team briefing has become part of the workplace vocabulary Sir, Your report of the study, sponsored by the Department of Employment, on employee involvement ('Team briefing has little effect on commitment', July 27), is unjustifiably gloomy about team briefing. Many employers would be pleased that the introduction of a simple monthly drill contributed to nearly 60 per cent of employees knowing more about their organisation. Team briefing has become part of the accepted vocabulary of the workplace - a tribute to the many employers who know that ignorance is incompatible with effectiveness and profitability. Yvonne Bennion, campaign and development director, The Industrial Society, Robert Hyde House, 48 Bryanston Square, London W1H 7LN</p>

			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Money Markets: More rate cuts THE central banks of both Ireland and Italy cut their official short-term interest rates yesterday, as tensions continued to ease inside the European exchange rate mechanism, writes James Blitz. Denmark, Portugal, Sweden, Belgium and the Netherlands have all eased monetary policy this week in the wake of Denmark's approval of the Maastricht treaty. Yesterday, the Italian central bank joined this group, cutting its discount rate to 10.50 per cent from a previous 11.0 per cent. A little while later, Ireland's central bank cut its short-term facility rate to 8.25 per cent from 8.50 per cent. Yesterday's moves raised new questions about whether European central banks might be able to cut interest rates without waiting for the Bundesbank to do so first. Mr Adrian James, an economist at NatWest Markets in London, said that a crucial test of the structure of European rates will come on Monday when the Bank of France operates in the money market. The Bank of France's intervention rate - which effectively acts as its repo rate - is currently at 7.75 per cent, only 15 basis points above Germany's. Mr James says the Bank of France may seize the opportunity to push their short-term rates below Germany's for the first time since their aborted attempt in the winter of 1991. One sign that the markets are at least expecting German and French short-term rates to converge is that the June futures contracts for both currencies' interest rates are getting closer together. The Euromark contract closed at 92.78 yesterday, on very thin trading. The French contract remained at 92.66 on a day when the Matif was closed for the public holiday. In sterling markets, there was a downbeat attitude towards rate cuts after the April unemployment figures registered their third consecutive monthly drop. The September short sterling contract dropped 11 basis points at its low point, but later rebounded amid sterling's strong performance against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges. It closed at 93.99, down 6 basis points on the day. In the cash market, the three-month deposit rate was unchanged at 6 per cent. There was a large shortage of Pounds 1.7bn, and the overnight rate peaked at 9 per cent.</p>

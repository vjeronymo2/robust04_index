			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters questioned the use of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey agency and HCFA discretion to conduct an extended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey at any time for any reason. Some commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disagreed that the Act gives HCFA or the survey agency the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discretion to conduct an extended survey at any time. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters urged HCFA to clarify that the purpose of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extended survey is to identify policies and procedures that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> caused the facility to furnish substandard quality of care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We disagree with commenters who believe that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Act does not give HCFA or the survey agency the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discretion to conduct an extended survey at any time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sections 1819(g)(2)(B)(i) and 1919(g)(2)(B)(i) of the Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically state, ``Any other facility may, at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary's or State's discretion, be subject to such an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extended survey (or a partial extended survey).'' However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we recognize that when facilities are subject to an extended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey or partial extended survey, they are disadvantaged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because they automatically lose approval of their nurse aide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training and competency evaluation programs (NATCEP) for two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years. There may be other instances when a facility would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lose their NATCEP, for example, when a facility has a nurse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> staffing waiver or has had a denial of payment for new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> admissions remedy, or temporary manager remedy imposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, as a matter of policy, we do not expect to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exercise our discretionary authority to conduct an extended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or partial extended survey unless we have found substandard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality of care on a standard survey or abbreviated standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey and we will advise the State survey agencies in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manual instructions to adopt the same policy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  We have built into our survey process the ability of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the survey team to expand a standard survey at any time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The expanded standard survey can be tailored to the unique  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situation in a particular facility and need not include all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the tasks listed at &sect;488.310(b). It allows more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thorough investigation of specific areas in order to confirm  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance when the initial scope of the standard survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not adequate to substantiate a particular deficiency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> But it does not penalize a facility with loss of approval of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a NATCEP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  We are not including proposed &sect;488.160(c)(2) which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would spell out the State survey agency's and Secretary's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discretion to conduct extended surveys, as it is unnecessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> given the explicit language of sections 1819(g)(2)(B)(i) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1919(g)(2)(B)(i) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We received numerous comments urging us to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amend the purpose of an extended survey as stated in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.310(a). One commenter suggested the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revision:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

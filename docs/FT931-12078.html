			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Arts: Virgins in the night - Radio HERE IS the content of late-evening programme on Radio 4, after A Book at Bedtime. First, a song from Harry Lauder, then a switch to the origins of Thomas Cook and Son's tourist schemes, that began in 1841 as a temperance activity. Drink soon featured unofficially,and sex too - what did one go to Paris for? There was a number about Cook's in Lionel Monckton's musical, The Runaway Girl. But this leads us to Edison's invention of sound-recording in 1877, and we are back for a moment with Harry Lauder, before moving on to Caruso, John McCormack and James Joyce with whom he once recorded a duet. This is Hindsight, presented on six Friday mornings by Dr Christopher Andrew and repeated more aptly at bedtime on Wednesdays. I saw no philosophical conclusion to these recollections, except the reminders of more recent things. They are leaves in a loose-leaf album, and a pleasant way to woo sleep. The current Book at Bedtime, is a semi-dramatic reading of a ten-part adaptation of Sarah Cauldwell's Thus Was Adonis Murdered, with five parts left. Kathryn Hunt reads the letters Julia is sending from Venice, where she is on an arts tour. They tell of her weakness for handsome Ned, but the press tells of Ned's death from stabbing. Neville Barber presents the story from the different viewpoints. Madame Bovary, Radio 4's Classic Serial, now at 2.30 on Sunday afternoon, is a different brand of serial story, ably directed by Kay Patrick, who emphasised the primary colours of the familiar story. Emma's home life does not sound as boring as Nicola Pagett makes it seem with her contrasting ambition; her trouble is ideas above her station. Robin Polley's Rouault is decent enough, but you can understand it when Emma asks 'Is that all there is?' Paul Downing's young Leon Dupuis will do for home-style romance. As for Stephen Moore's Bovary, he is a friendly, even ambitious, doctor, tedious as he may appear at the ball. He is to start a new practice tomorrow. Then what? Mr Wroe's Virgins, Radio 3's Sunday play, is adapted from Jane Rogers's novel by Mike Harris. Prophet Wroe is a small crazed hunchback, but a powerful preacher, leader of the Christian Israelites. He persuades the people of Ashton-under-Lyne that the world is to end in 1830 and the New Jerusalem will be built at Ashton. The Lord, he says, insists that he must have seven virgins to help him, and sure enough seven virgins are provided,some more virginal than others. Wroe is played by Alun Armstrong; he has a great speech at Huddersfield, about the world's end, that almost won over faithless virgin Hannah (Barbara Marten). Joanna (Melanie Thaw) is the most faithful virgin, tireless in good work. - Leah (Victoria Finney) is hardly virgin at all, having a 4-month bastard 'orphan'. and Martha (Jane Hazlegrove) is educationally subnormal, though not so much so that she cannot tell when Wroe abuses her in a ditch. She finishes up living on the moors. Wroe is also seen naked with Hannah, a sensible woman more interested in workers' lives than Wroe's mission. The other three virgins are less interesting, but the operative four are beautifully contrasted. Michael Fox directed, and there was missionary music by Paddy Cunneen. There will be a four-part television version of the story next month on BBC2.</p>

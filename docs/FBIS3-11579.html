			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] Managua LA PRENSA in Spanish of 1 March  1994 on page 4 reports that Camoapa farmers exported 15,000  pounds of cheese to El Salvador during the last two weeks of  February. Producer Mario Aragon predicted March exports will  total 60,000 pounds. According to Aragon, producers began  exporting cheese when processing plants reduced purchases of  milk. As a result, dairy farmers have had fewer losses from  surplus milk, production costs have dropped, and profits have  risen. Producers say that El Salvador is the best Central  American market for cheese.    The article also reports that the Hermoso Vijil company has  begun exporting typewriter ribbons to Spain, Germany, Italy, the  United Kingdom, and the United States. Near-term exports are  expected to total $6 million. The company plans to expand  operations to include the manufacture of photocopier material,  laser printers, and diskettes.</p>

			<p>920312 FT  12 MAR 92 / Lloyd's rejects S&amp;P allegations LLOYD'S of London yesterday rejected claims by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit-rating agency, that the insurance market faces a liquidity crisis. S&amp;P, which began analysing Lloyd's syndicates last year, said that it had identified a 'negative balance' of liabilities against assets of Pounds 1.2bn last autumn. The combination of new legal actions and the apparent reluctance of commercial banks to lend to either Names or agents was leading to a possible liquidity crunch, S&amp;P said. More than 700 Names - the individuals whose assets back underwriting at Lloyd's - are seeking to prevent their deposits held by the market being drawn on. S&amp;P said commercial banks were reluctant to extend credit. Its figures, which were based on reports to the Department of Trade and Industry, show that bank guarantees represented 50 per cent of all personal deposits at Lloyd's compared with 11 per cent in 1977. It is concerned over Lloyd's 'near-term capital adequacy and liquidity'. Mr Alan Levin of S&amp;P in New York said: 'We are quite worried.' In a prompt rebuttal, Mr David Coleridge, Lloyd's chairman, deplored the S&amp;P assertions as 'misleading and potentially damaging'. Lloyd's said that on December 31 1990 the market's total declared resources amounted to more than Pounds 18bn. This was more than Pounds 6.5bn in excess of all estimated future liabilities. It added that S&amp;P was only taking into account 'readily realisable' assets held in premium trust funds. These are ongoing funds made up of insurance premiums earned by Lloyd's syndicates. The agency's figures for liabilities included substantial amounts 'which will not fall due for payment until the end of this century and, in many cases, into the next century'. Lloyd's also argued that over the past year the size of its American Trust Fund had increased by Dollars 1bn and that its central fund now stood at Pounds 500m.</p>

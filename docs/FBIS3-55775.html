Officials in  Shushkevich's headquarters told Interfax that the setting up of  a monetary union of the two countries would be a major issue the  two men will discuss.    Observers note that Shushkevich and Belarussian Prime  Minister Vyacheslav Kebich have significant differences over the  economic integration of the two countries.    Valery Tsepkalo, an adviser of the Supreme Soviiet chairman,  told Interfax that Shushkevich largely shared the views of  Stanislav Bogdankevich, Chairman of the National Bank of  Belarus, who opposes the signing an agreement on the merger of  the monetary systems in the form it was drafted by a bilateral  ad hoc team of experts.    Valery Dashkevich, an advisor of the National Bank of  Belarus  (NBB) chairman, told Interfax that his chief "thinks that before  a monetary union is established an agreement should be reached  on common prices of fuels and basic raw commodities. ... If his  view is ignored, the NBB chairman may resign."    According to Dashkevich, the NBB chairman will accompany  Shushkevich to Moscow.    Asked by Interfax whether Shushkevich intended to coordinate  with Yeltsin his position in talks with U.S. President Bill  Clinton, Tsepkalo doubted the need in this because, in his view,  "Belarus does not have differences with the U.S.A. or Russia."</p>

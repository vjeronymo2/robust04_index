			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Orlando Muchanga: "There are still bases"] </F>   [Excerpts] Xinavane--Residents of some districts of Maputo  and Gaza Provinces say that former Renamo [Mozambique National  Resistance] bases still exist.    We realized that the movement of people and goods between  areas controlled by the two sides is still restrained. The  population in towns are afraid of going far away, and those in  the rural areas only come to the small urban areas to visit  families with return travel permits issued by Renamo.    Even demobilized Renamo soldiers return to areas under the  movement's control where they settle themselves. Only in the "3  February" communal village, in Hlalalene, we met with a Renamo  demobilized soldier, Eusebio Ernesto Monisse, who really  returned home, coming from an assembly area in Magude District,  where he was demobilized on 7 April. [passage omitted]    In Manhica town, people still speak of bases such as that of  Mirona and Macandzene and those of Calanga. Our sources said  the main Renamo commanders who fought in these areas, such as  Elias and Agostinho, and "Mabaioneta" himself, have not yet been  confined in assembly areas.    Some of the many hunters, most of whom are without licenses,  who have been hunting in Magude District's Mapulanguene and  other areas, assured us that the roads are already in good  conditions, some Renamo soldiers allow people to hunt there, but  no one is allowed to come near the Ngungwe base on the border  with South Africa.    One of the hunters said, "We don't know what is hidden  there". He added that people hunt with AKM's. We also spoke to  hunters who use traditional weapons, and they gave the same  information. We learned that there is a similar situation in  Macalawane, Xivimbanine, Maqueze, Mumbi and Chaimite areas of  Chibuto District.    The head of the Xipadja administrative region in Chibuto,  who  is still afraid of revealing his name, told us that in his area,  the Chindzavane, Macosse, and even Hlanganine bases -- where the  Renamo assembly area is located -- are still operating. He  said, "There is still no contact between families residing in  Renamo areas and those in administrative authorities".    More than 50,000 people are currently residing in Xipadja.  This year they are faced with famine. [passage omitted]</p>

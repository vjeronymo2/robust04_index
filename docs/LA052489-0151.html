			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BRITAIN HIKES INTEREST TO 14% TO BOLSTER POUND  </P> <P> Britain raised its interest rates today to defend the battered pound in a move  that market analysts said could forestall any reduction in U.S. rates.  </P> <P> The Bank of England, the central bank, sought to protect the pound against a  surging dollar and crack down on one of the highest inflation rates in West  Europe by lifting its money-market lending rate by 1 percentage point to 14%.  </P> <P> Commercial banks quickly fell in line with similar rises in their base lending  rates to 14%.  </P> <P> "The pressures were such that they didn't have much choice," said economist  Peter Fellner of stockbrokers James Capel, after the government's 10th rates  rise in a year.  </P> <P> Bond market traders in the United States said the move, if followed by other  countries, would help reduce pressure on the high-flying dollar and could stop  any reduction in U.S. rates.  </P> <P> Due partly to the unwanted strength of the dollar, some economists have  predicted that the Federal Reserve will loosen its yearlong tight grasp on  rates. A high dollar makes U.S. goods more expensive abroad, making it more  difficult for the United States to reduce its huge trade deficit.  </P> <P> Higher rates abroad would serve the same purpose, without increasing U.S.  inflationary pressures.  </P> <P> British currency and share markets were jittery after the increase, which  followed a bout of pound-selling on the foreign exchanges because of gloom over  Britain's 8% annual inflation rate and the dollar's resiliency against repeated  central bank intervention.  </P> <P> Industrialists warned that output could suffer, while the opposition Labor  Party said the Thatcher government clearly cannot handle the economy and  inflation, now at a seven-year high.  </P> <P> "High interest rates run the risk of recession and they make life harder for  British people and British industry," said Labor spokesman John Smith.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told a meeting of Conservative supporters: "We  need a period of high interest rates to bring inflation down. And while the  effects can be uncomfortable, the effects of continued high inflation can be  much worse."  </P></p>

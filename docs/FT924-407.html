			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Surprise rise in savings may threaten upturn A SHARP rise in personal savings reported yesterday has underlined the depth of consumer resistance to substantial increases in spending, a development that may hold back an overall economic upturn. Britain's economic weakness was also underlined by the decline in wages and salaries in the third quarter of this year compared with the previous three months - the first time that those items have seen two successive quarter-on-quarter drops since government records started in 1955. Total personal disposable income saw a modest rise between the second and third quarters. That was partly because of redundancy and dividend payments. The Central Statistical Office said the savings ratio - personal savings as a percentage of personal income, less income tax, social security contributions and other financial transfers - climbed to 12.3 per cent in the third quarter. The seasonally adjusted figure was the highest since late 1984, and came after savings ratios of 11.4 per cent in both the first and second quarters. It surprised the City, which had expected a third-quarter savings ratio of about 10 per cent. Wages and salaries as measured in current prices, unadjusted for inflation, fell by 0.2 per cent between the second and third quarters to Pounds 74.58bn. That was after a 0.7 per cent drop between the first and second three-month periods. The fall in wages and salaries was partly because of falling employment. It may also have been a reflection of a high Pounds 75.29bn figure for wages and salaries in the first quarter. The drop between the second and third quarters in wages and salaries was offset by an increase in non-wage income and reduced income tax contributions. That led to personal disposal income growing between the second and third quarters by 2.2 per cent to Pounds 110.66bn. After adjusting for inflation, real personal disposable income grew between those periods by 1.4 per cent. Compared with the corresponding period last year, it increased in the third quarter by 2.5 per cent. The CSO said companies' gross trading profits (after deducting stock appreciation) came to Pounds 19.76bn in the third quarter, little changed on the second quarter.</p>

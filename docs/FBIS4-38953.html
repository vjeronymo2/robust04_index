			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev [no date as received] -- A delegation of the  Russian joint stock company Gasprom will hold negotiations in  Kiev on 3-4 June on Ukraine's payment for Russian gas  deliveries. Ukrainian Acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy  is heading the Ukrainian side at the talks.    The talks will focus on the possibility of Ukraine building  houses in Russia and supplying technical resources from its  enterprises to repay the debt. Gasprom's shareholding in  Ukrainian companies will also be discussed. The talks are  likely to raise the issue of setting up joint ventures to use  Ukrainian gas fields and pipelines, which the Russian side wants  as part of debt payment.    Asked by UNIAN about the Russian position on gas deliveries  to Ukraine, Vladimir Podmarkov, an engineer of Gasprom's central  distribution directorate, said it remains unchanged. While  Russia continues to supply gas to Ukraine even in greater  amounts than pledged, Ukraine is continuously failing to repay  the debt. Meanwhile, Russia has repeatedly threatened to suspend  gas deliveries if Ukraine does not pay what it owes, which since  the beginning of the year has reached approximately $1 billion.    Russia has postponed suspension of deliveries until  negotiations have been held. At a recent meeting in Moscow, the  sides decided that Ukraine will collect $150 million from  enterprises of the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of  Machine-Building to relieve tension at the next round of talks.  Ukrgazprom, the Ukrainian company trading with the Russian  partner, told UNIAN, however, that the money has not been found.    Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Vasyl Yevtukhov said in an  interview for UNIAN that Ukraine's Industry Ministry, which has  been asked to pay $100 million, does not actually owe anything  for gas. Meanwhile, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Valentyn  Landyk met with chiefs of the Ministry of Industry and the  Ministry of Machine-Building on 2 June to discuss hard currency  payments for gas.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  on Monday [30 May] hinted at his party's preparedness to form a  coalition with the No. 1 opposition Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP).    "I do not have any vengeance (against the LDP) at all. Such  an option is possible," Hata told the House of Representatives  Budget Committee.    Hata, the leader of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a core  party in the ruling coalition, was responding to an LDP  questioner who urged the prime minister to consider the  possibility of "forming a conservative coalition with the LDP"  by giving up any vengeful feelings he may still hold toward the  party.    However, Hata quickly added his reservations over the  proposal, saying, "if we put priority on forcing political  stability alone, it would not change Japan's politics."    Japan "needs to go through the process of devastating the  vestiges of the (LDP's) long hold on power," he said.    The premier made the comments as his minority government is  facing a possible no-confidence motion by either the LDP or the  Social Democratic Party that could scuttle his minority  government.    The minority coalition accounts for 178 out of the 511-seat  lower chamber. Shinseito has a parliamentary strength of 61.  If combined with the 206 LDP legislators, such a conservative  alliance would hold 267 seats -- well above the majority.    The mass defection of former LDP members who later formed  Shinseito stripped the LDP of its majority in the lower chamber  last June, putting an end to the party's 38-year grip on power.    In a related development, Hata expressed his willingness to  hold separate summit talks with the leaders of the opposition  parties.    "I am always ready. I am so even before or after the  parliamentary passage of the (state) budget," he told a group of  reporters in the Diet building.</p>

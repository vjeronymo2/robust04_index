			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GIVING THE NOD TO THE CALVERTS IN SURROGATE MOTHER CASE  </P> <P> Gary and Jeanne Neumann of Irvine ("Finally . . . It's a Boy!" Oct. 17) deny  that their daughters resent the new baby boy whose sex was determined by the  sperm selection technique.  </P> <P> It makes one wonder, though, when they expressed such obvious relief what their  real motives were. Daughters have been devalued all through history, and their  girls might someday wonder why their parents didn't feel the family was  complete until a son was born.  </P> <P> SUSAN LeTOURNEAU, Garden Grove  </P></p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Walesa vetoes wage control law Poland's centre-left ruling coalition yesterday suffered a setback in a political tug of war with President Lech Walesa when it failed to muster the two-thirds majority needed to overrule the head of state's veto on a wage control law. The coalition's trade union deputies, in an effort to see wage rise limits eased, voted with the opposition Solidarity trade union against the government. President Walesa has argued that the law, designed to replace regulations limiting pay rises in state sector enterprises, would enable the government to extend controls to the private sector. The government will propose a modified wage law to parliament today to replace the state sector regulations. In their absence, some 6,000 state enterprises have the freedom to raise wages, but few are likely to do so since they lack the funds.</p>

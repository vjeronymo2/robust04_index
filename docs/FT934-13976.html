			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: NationsBank and Chase reflect improving trend TWO OF the largest US banks, Chase Manhattan and NationsBank, yesterday underscored the sector's improving earnings trend by announcing sharply higher operating profits. Chase Manhattan, one of the leading New York money-centre banks, reported consolidated net income of Dollars 267m, or Dollars 1.25 a share, up 52 per cent from Dollars 176m, or 94 cents, in the same period of last year. NationsBank, a super-regional bank based in Charlotte, North Carolina, reported net income of Dollars 341m, or Dollars 1.33 a share, compared with Dollars 350m, or Dollars 1.40, in the same period of last year. However, NationsBank said its performance was masked by one-off items and last year's lower effective tax rate, and that pre-tax operating income before securities gains rose 56 per cent to Dollars 507m from Dollars 324m. Chase reported net interest revenue of Dollars 926m, up 3 per cent, with a net interest margin of 3.99 per cent, against 4.08 per cent a year ago. Average interest earning assets were Dollars 92.1bn, up from Dollars 87.5bn, while average loans dropped from Dollars 64.1bn to Dollars 61.7bn. The provision for credit losses was Dollars 215m, down Dollars 105m on a year ago, while the return on average assets rose to 1.01 per cent from 0.71 per cent, and the return on equity was up from 11.9 per cent to 15.1 per cent. The tier one capital ratio rose to 7.48 per cent from 6.48 per cent For the first nine months Chase reported net income of Dollars 653m, or Dollars 3.23 a share, against Dollars 470m, or Dollars 2.59 a share. NationsBank reported net interest income of Dollars 1.17bn, up from Dollars 1.06n a year ago. Average loans and leases rose 15 per cent to Dollars 77.8bn. The net interest yield was 3.83 per cent, down from 4.16 per cent, but the bank said this rose 6 percentage points on last year's figure before the impact of its acquisition of Chicago Research and Trading. The return on equity was 15.6 per cent, down from 18.97 per cent, while the tier one ratio stood at 7.60, up from 7.54. For the first nine months, net income rose to Dollars 1.13bn, or Dollars 4.42 a share, up from Dollars 911m, or Dollars 3.69 a share.</p>

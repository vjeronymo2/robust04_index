			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Radio Caroline back on air with local licence RADIO CAROLINE, the former pirate station, went on the air legally yesterday for the first time in 28 years. The ship, now in Granville Docks, Dover, has been given a 28-day community radio licence to broadcast to the local area. The ship ran aground in gales last November and the six-man crew of the Ross Revenge, the home of Radio Caroline, had to be rescued. Quite apart from the damage caused by the storm, the future of pirate stations such as Caroline is very much in doubt. The 1990 Broadcasting Act opened up the possibility of a vast expansion of commercial radio but at the same time increased the penalties on pirates. Radio Caroline may now have little option but to go seriously legitimate. As a pirate station, Radio Caroline, named after Caroline Kennedy, launched the careers of disc jockeys such as Kenny Everett and Tony Blackburn and influenced the style and content of the BBC's pop-music station, Radio 1.</p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Bhutto set to return as PM MS Benazir Bhutto was last night almost certain to return as Pakistan's prime minister in today's parliamentary vote, with her Pakistan People's party (PPP) expected to build a coalition with smaller parties in the National Assembly, the lower house of parliament. Sunday's victory for Mr Yusuf Raza Gillani of the PPP, for the position of Speaker, had already confirmed Ms Bhutto's lead over Mr Nawaz Sharif, her arch-rival. The PPP is also expected to form governments in at least two of Pakistan's four provinces (Sindh and Baluchistan), while Mr Sharif's Pakistan Moslem League (PML) appears to be leading in the North-West Frontier Province. However, the two sides are still engaged in a tough fight for the province of Punjab, the country's largest and wealthiest province. Members of the provincial legislatures are due to elect their governments tomorrow. Ms Bhutto's latest victory has effectively ended her three-year stint as leader of the opposition, since her government's dismissal in August 1990 on charges of corruption. She feels vindicated because none of the charges laid against her or Mr Asif Ali Zardari, her husband, has been proved. However, her return still needs to be consolidated through the formation of a stable government which can resist opposition pressure. Although Mr Sharif is out of power, that has not curtailed his ability to build up his ranks by winning over members of smaller parties allied to Ms Bhutto. One of Ms Bhutto's most important challenges will be to carry forward the recent negotiations with the International Monetary Fund. Pakistan is seeking up to Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 790m) under the extended structural adjustment facility and extended finance facility over the next three years. Her aides have already said Pakistan's economic direction will remain unchanged, with emphasis on privatisation and deregulation of the public sector. But it is still not clear if sensitive measures such as a wealth tax on powerful feudal landlords, which were introduced by Mr Moeen Qureshi, the interim prime minister, can be retained, with most of the newly-elected members representing the rich farmers' lobby.</p>

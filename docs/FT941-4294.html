			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: Sumitomo Cement plans merger with smaller rival A government-inspired restructuring of Japan's overcrowded cement industry took a step forward yesterday when the fourth and eighth largest producers announced merger plans. Sumitomo Cement and its smaller competitor Osaka Cement are to join forces from October, to form Japan's second largest cement maker, with 18.3 per cent of the market and combined annual sales of Y211.1bn (Dollars 1.9bn). Their marriage is driven by the forces behind last November's merger of Onoda Cement, Japan's largest producer, with Chichubu Cement, the number six, to consolidate Onoda's market leadership, with nearly a quarter of the country's annual cement demand. Both mergers are designed to seek economies of scale in an overcrowded market worsened by the collapse in construction orders during this recession. 'The cement industry in our nation is facing sluggish demand and harsh cost competition. So we have decided to merge in order to better grow in such an international era,' said a joint statement. Before announcing the deal, the pair consulted the Ministry of International Trade and Industry which was informally encouraging alliances among Japan's 22 cement makers, said the ministry The final decision to merge was made by the companies themselves, it emphasised. Sumitomo Cement made the first move. Between 2 per cent and 3 per cent of Japan's 90m tonne cement production capacity was surplus to requirements, the ministry estimated: 'In the long term, cement makers must restructure because the market is receding.' Some private sector forecasters argue the cement industry needs more slimming than suggested by the ministry. Less than 10 producers would suffice to meet domestic demand, believes Nomura Research Institute. Osaka Cement will be dissolved after the merger and its president, Mr Tetsunosuke Hamada, will become chairman of the new group. He forecast large savings on production, distribution, capital investment and research and development. The new group expects a Y5.2bn pre-tax profit in the year to March 1996, its first full trading year, rising to Y7.5bn in the following year, said Mr Shoichi Tatemoto, president of Sumitomo Cement, who will be president of the new company. It will be named Sumitomo Osaka Cement.</p>

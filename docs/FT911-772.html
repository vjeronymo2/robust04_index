			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Gun lobby suffers rare defeat SUPPORTERS of tighter gun control in the US have won a rare victory over the well-financed gun lobby, with the approval by the House of Representatives of legislation imposing a seven-day waiting period for purchases of handguns to allow time for background checks. The margin, 239 votes to 186, was larger than expected after intense lobbying and advertising. But a much closer vote is expected in the Senate, where rural states in which the pro-gun National Rifle Association (NRA) is influential have an equal say with more highly populated, and crime-ridden, urban states. Moreover, President George Bush, a longstanding opponent of gun control and an NRA member, has threatened to veto the measure unless it forms part of a much broader anti-crime package that includes an expanded federal death penalty. The debate over the measure has touched deep-seated American traditions. Even if it is enacted, no one expects the bill to make much practical difference in a country where there may be 100m guns in circulation.</p>

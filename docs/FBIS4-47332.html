Vetlutskiy and T.V. Poplavskaya, </F> Novosibirsk; UDC 532.526]    [Abstract] The problem of calculating a three-dimensional  compressible laminar boundary layer on a contoured delta wing  with supersonic leading edges has been formulated and presented  along with an algorithm for solving it. The algorithm has been  used to perform calculations for the windward and leeward sides  of a wing with a sweep angle (_ch_) of 45 given a Mach  number (M[.sub][/]) of 3 and for the windward side of a  wing with the same sweep angle and Mach numbers of 3 and 6 for  any number of angles of attack (_a_). The effect of Mach  number,  angle of attack, and relative profile thickness on friction  coefficient and its contribution to the wing's total drag have  been investigated. Selected results of the calculations are as  follows. The adjusted values found for a contoured wing exceed  their values for a plane wafer by 30 percent. The difference  between the values found for the friction coefficient on the  nose and those on a plane wafer is much greater when  M[.sub][/] = 6 than when M[.sub][/] = 3.  Calculations of the effect of the angle of attack on the  distribution of the friction coefficient on the leeward side of  a contoured wing indicate that the friction coefficient  decreases by about 15 percent when _a_ is increased by 5  and that, given identical profile thicknesses and Mach numbers,  the curves plotted for the friction coefficient (and also for  the Stanton number) for different angles of attack are  qualitatively similar to one another. A calculation of the  contribution of the total intensity of friction  (CF[.sub]x[/]) to the total drag (CX[.sub]0[/]) for each  wing surface given Re[.sub]L[/] = 10[.sup]5[/] indicates  that as M[.sub][/] increases, the value of CF[.sub]x[/]  decreases somewhat when _a_ = 0 and increases when _a_ =  5;  however, wave drag decreases significantly, which results in an  increase in the contribution of friction forces from 67 to 79  percent when _a_ = 0 and from 21.5 to 43 percent when _a_ =  5. The value of CF[.sub]x[/] is on average 15 percent  greater for a contoured wing than for a delta wafer; however,  wave drag is significantly greater in the case of a contoured  wing, which reduces the contribution of friction forces to total  drag when compared with that in the case of a plane delta wafer.  An analogous phenomenon is observed when the angle of attack is  increased. Although the value of CF[.sub]x[/] increases when  _a_ is increased from 0 to 5, wave drag increases more,  and  as a result, the contribution of friction forces decreases from  67 to 21.5 percent when M[.sub][/] = 3 and from 79 to 43  percent when M[.sub][/].

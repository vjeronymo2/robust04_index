The defense minister told reporters during an inspection of  the Baltic Sea Fleet that all European countries should be equal  on the issue of realizing European security and stability and  that no country's interests should be harmed, the INTERFAX news  agency reported.    He stressed that Russia will not follow some East European  and Baltic states who see participation in the "partnership for  peace" plan proposed by U.S. President Bill Clinton as a  transition to full NATO membership.    Grachev said that there are three reasons for Russia's  position on the issue.    First, a country that intends to join NATO must reconstruct  its defense system to suit NATO's commanding system. This will  undoubtedly mean bankruptcy for a big country like Russia which  has a 2.3-million-strong armed forces.    Second, Russia can not meet the requirement that a country  must be equipped with the same weapons and equipment as a NATO  member before it enters the military bloc.    Third, few NATO countries have strategic rocket troops like  Russia.    Meanwhile, Grachev said that Russia will build a "special  defensive zone" in its western region of Kaliningrad this year  to defend the country's western sea and air borders.</p>

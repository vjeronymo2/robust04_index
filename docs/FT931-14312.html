			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / International Company News: BCE to dispose of SHL shares BCE, Canada's biggest telecommunications group, is selling its 25.6 per cent interest in the fast-growing international systems integrator, SHL Systemhouse for CDollars 83m (USDollars 64.8m) The 9.7m SHL shares are being sold via a secondary offer underwritten by Gordon Capital at CDollars 8.55 each. The offer closes on February 10. SHL was part of the Kinburn hi-tec and packaging group in the mid-1980s. BCE, then still on a diversification course, invested CDollars 400m in SHL and Kinburn equity and loans. But Kinburn failed early in the recession and BCE wrote down its investment by CDollars 224m in 1990. Early in 1991, it planned to raise its 25 per cent stake up to 60 per cent and use a revamped SHL as the data processing centre for Bell Canada, its telephone unit. But the plan ran into opposition and BCE decided to sell. SHL is now expanding fast in the US and Europe under new management and is profitable again. Bell Canada has formed Bell Sygma as a data processing and telecommunications systems management and service unit. Its own DP operations are being transferred to Sygma. BCE is concentrating on competing with Unitel, now 20 per cent owned by AT&amp;T, in the long-distance market and in building its global telecom business.</p>

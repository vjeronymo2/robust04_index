In a statement to mark the 35th anniversary of the Tibetan  uprising in 1959 the Dalai Lama said: "I must now recognise  that my approach has failed to produce any progress either for  substantive negotiations or in contributing to the overall  improvement of the situation in Tibet. Moreover, I am conscious  of the fact that a growing number of Tibetans, both inside as  well as outside Tibet, have been disheartened by my conciliatory  stand not to demand complete independence for Tibet. Because of  my statement, some Tibetans have come to believe there is no  hope at all for the Tibetan people regaining their basic rights  and freedoms. This, and the lack of any concrete results from  my conciliatory approach towards the Chinese Government over the  past 14 years, has caused disillusionment and underminded the  resolve of some Tibetans."    The Dalai Lama said that in his negotiations with China to  try and "restore freedom, peace, and dignity" to Tibet he had  always sought to be guided by "realism, patience, and vision."    "For the past 14 years, I have not only declared my  willingness to enter into negotiations but have also made  maximum concessions in a series of initiatives and proposals  which clearly lie within the framework for negotiations as  stated by Deng Xiaoping in 1979 that `except for independence of  Tibet, all other questions can be negotiated.' The ideas put  forward in my Five Point Peace Plan for Tibet in 1987 and the  Strasbourg Proposal in 1988 envisage a solution which does not  ask for the complete independence of Tibet."    On both occasions the Chinese government refused to enter  into negotiations with the Dalai Lama. "The issue," he said,  "is not my return to Tibet but the survival of Tibet's six  million people, its culture and civilization. I have made it  clear that the negotiations must centre around ways to end  China's population transfer policy, which threatens the very  survival of the Tibetan people, respect for Tibetan's  fundamental human rights and entitlement to democratic freedom,  the de-militarisation and de-nuclearisation of Tibet, the  restoration of the Tibetan people's control over matters  affecting their own affairs, and the protection of Tibet's  natural environment.    "I have always emphasised that any negotiation must comprise  the whole of Tibet, not just the area which China calls the  'Tibet Autonomous Region.'" Many exiled Tibetans have been  critical of the Dalai Lama's moderate stance over the years and  what many have considered his appeasement of China.    Tibet was incorporated into the People's Republic of China  in  1950. Nine years later the Dalai Lama and up to 60,000 of his  followers fled into exile in India after a bloody revolt against  Chinese rule. The Dalai Lama has maintained that since China's  "occupation" of Tibet 1.2 million people have died. Others have  described China's rule over Tibet as tantamount to cultural  genocide.    "I had hoped that my middle-way approach would eventually  create an atmosphere of mutual trust, conducive to fruitful  negotiations, and exert a restraining influence on the  repressive Chinese policies in Tibet," he said. "But the  Chinese Government has rejected my overtures one after another  and has consistently attempted to confuse the real issue.  Meanwhile, the magnitude and gravity of the situation inside  Tibet has dramatically escalated.    "Developments in Tibet have been marked by an  intensification  of the Chinese policy of suppression, the marginalisation of the  Tibetan people in their own country, the gradual extermination  of our unique culture and religion, and the destruction and  exploitation of Tibet's environment," he said.    The Dalai Lama's initiatives for Tibet have been largely  endorsed by the international community. China, however,  maintains that Tibet is an integral part of the PRC. "I have  left no stone unturned in my attempts to reach an understanding  with the Chinese," he said.    The Dalai Lama said he would "remain committed to finding a  peaceful and negotiated resolution to the issue of Tibet." He  called for increased international political and economic  pressure on China to "resolve the problem of Tibet peacefully  and amicably".</p>

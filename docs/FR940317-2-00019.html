			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Goodman filed a ``Petition for Waiver,'' dated November 29, 1993, in accordance with &sect;430.27 of 10 CFR part 430. The Department published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on February 23, 1994, Goodman's petition and solicited comments, data and information respecting the petition. 58 FR 8608. Goodman also filed an ``Application for Interim Waiver'' under section 430.27(g) which DOE granted on February 10, 1994. 58 FR 8608, February 23, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No comments were received concerning either the ``Petition for Waiver'' or the ``Interim Waiver.'' The Department consulted with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) concerning the Goodman Petition. The FTC did not have any objections to the issuance of the waiver to Goodman.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Assertions and Determinations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Goodman's Petition seeks a waiver from the DOE test provisions that require a 1.5-minute time delay between the ignition of the burner and the starting of the circulating air blower. Goodman requests the allowance to test using a 40-second blower time delay when testing its GMN series central furnaces. Goodman states that since the 40-second delay is indicative of how these models actually operate and since such a delay results in an improvement in efficiency of 0.6 to 1.0 percent, the petition should be granted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under specific circumstances, the DOE test procedure contains exceptions which allow testing with blower delay times of less than the prescribed 1.5-minute delay. Goodman indicates that it is unable to take advantage of any of these exceptions for its GMN series central furnaces.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the blower controls incorporated on the Goodman furnaces are designed to impose a 40-second blower delay in every instance of start up, and since the current provisions do not specifically address this type of control, DOE agrees that a waiver should be granted to allow the 40-second blower time delay when testing the Goodman GMN series central furnaces. Accordingly, with regard to testing the GMN series central furnaces, today's Decision and Order exempts Goodman from the existing provisions regarding blower controls and allows testing with the 40-second delay.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is, therefore, ordered that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The ``Petition for Waiver'' filed by Goodman Manufacturing Company (Case No. F&hyph;067) is hereby granted as set forth in paragraph (2) below, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (3), (4), and (5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of Appendix N of 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B, Goodman Manufacturing Company, shall be permitted to test its GMN series central furnaces on the basis of the test procedure specified in 10 CFR Part 430, with modifications set forth below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Section 3.0 of Appendix N is deleted and replaced with the following paragraph:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

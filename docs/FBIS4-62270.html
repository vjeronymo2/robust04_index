			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 12 TASS -- The bill on the Russian land  code undoubtedly became the main issue discussed on Thursday by  the Presidium of the Russian Government. Following numerous  remarks by ministers and heads of departments, the bill was  adopted as a whole.    A decision was made to submit the land code to the Russian  Parliament lower chamber on June 2 after it is finalised.    "The land code which is still a bill, interferes with  reforms", Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin summed up speeches on this  top priority issue for Russia. "The absence of the legislative  basis retards reforms in the agricultural sector and blocks  channels for domestic and foreign investors.    "On the other hand, we must not leave unsettled issues and  legal contradictions," the premier stressed.    Vice-Premiers Sergey Shakhray and Anatoliy Chubays spoke  about the above problems when discussing the land code bill.  They were interested in how members of the Russian Federation  will behave themselves when the land code is adopted.    They also asked why the bill favours the principle of state  regulation of land relations at the expense of the rights of  owner, including foreigners. The vice-premiers suggested that  the document be finalised by the Government without shifting  this task onto legislators.    The Government Presidium also approved the bill on civil  defence as a whole.</p>

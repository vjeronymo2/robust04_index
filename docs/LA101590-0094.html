			<p><P> October 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC NOTES  </P> <P> If it can be stir-fried or microwaved, a food item stands a better chance of  getting attention from importers in prosperous Asian countries, an Agriculture  Department report says. Consumer tastes are changing in Asian nations.  </P> <P> Fast foods, Western-style meals and a growing interest in healthful diets are  making an impact. "Asian consumers are also returning to their culinary roots,  seeking out traditional foods, but with a new twist: convenience," said Violet  Oon, a food editor in Singapore. "The result is a desire for tradition in a  packet that can be defrosted or microwaved." Oon, writing in the November issue  of AgExporter magazine, said the new trends in Asian eating didn't develop  overnight. Basically, she said, the changes in consumer tastes are linked to  rising disposable income, openness to imports, a receptive news media and  growth of the middle class. Singapore is "on the leading edge in consumer  tastes" among the countries of Southeast Asia, Oon said. As countries develop  economically, more and more consumers eat out as women join the work force. And  domestic help is hard to come by.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> South Africa Show to Air: Boston Public Television station WGBH has reversed  its decision to drop the weekly newsmagazine "South Africa Now." A spokeswoman  for the station said the decision not to renew the show for a sixth season was  made before station officials realized how important it was to viewers. "South  Africa Now" made headlines last month when Los Angeles public station KCET  decided to drop the show, claiming it was biased, and then reversed itself  under pressure from community organizations.

On Wednesday, the  police had said that two Ethiopians, a man and a woman, faced  trial in Kenya.    One of the hijackers, a man who was injured when police  captured the pair on Tuesday, had been armed with an imitation  pistol, a police spokesman said. An unarmed woman with him was  seized unhurt. One of the other women was arrested just  afterwards, while security forces detained a third who had  managed to merge with some 140 Ethiopian passengers freed before  police ended the hijack bid, police disclosed Thursday.    The man's alleged accomplices named him only as Fuad and  said  that he was a former Air Force officer who had been expelled  from Saudi Arabia to Ethiopia, but did not want to return,  police said. The women were named by police as Sofia Kadir  Mohamed, Fatma Daya and Muna Abdir Kadir. Press reports have  said that the hijackers were illegal immigrants to Saudi Arabia.  [passage omitted]</p>

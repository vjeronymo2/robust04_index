			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Letter: Cyprus not a 'poorer' applicant for EC entry Sir, Both preceding and in the wake of the recent Lisbon Summit of the EC there have been a number of reports in the Financial Times relating to EC enlargement. In these reports we see the dangerous tendency to lump together existing and potential EC applicants in certain entry baskets. We read that the 'Efta states' are likely to be the next batch of members of the EC and that 'the three poorer southern countries' of Turkey, Cyprus and Malta will have to continue to do time in the EC's waiting room. The former socialist countries of eastern Europe are also bracketed together over the timing of their possible entry into the EC. In Cyprus we consider that it is more appropriate to examine the case of each EC applicant state on its own individual merits. In terms of economic development both Cyprus and Malta cannot be considered poor. An examination of the income statistics in the 1992 World Development Report of the World Bank shows Cyprus with per capita GNP of more than USDollars 8,000 in 1990 compared with USDollars 6,610 for Malta and USDollars 1,630 for Turkey. Furthermore, the per capita income of Cyprus is considerably in excess of that of two existing EC members, namely Greece and Portugal, with per capita GNPs of USDollars 5,990 and USDollars 4,900, respectively, in 1990. We would add that the flourishing and sound economy of Cyprus is based on the twin pillars of a strong market-oriented system and a pluralistic democracy.

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Appointments: Hopkins quits NIIDB Tony Hopkins, chief executive of the Industrial Development Board, Northern Ireland's main jobs promotion agency, is quitting after four years. The announcement came as a surprise to business circles. A brief statement issued by the Department of Economic Development confirmed that Hopkins had been invited to take up a position in the private sector. As a permanent secretary, Hopkins is one of the highest paid civil servants in the province; his post carries a salary of over Pounds 60,000. His resignation comes at a time of changes in direction for the organisation as a result of the government's emphasis on competitiveness. Government sources stressed that his departure was unrelated to recent criticism of the IDB by Noel Stewart, senior partner of Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte. Stewart argued last week that the IDB did not have the calibre of executives required to achieve the government's new competitive strategy. He pointed out that it would take time to develop the skills required for such a sophisticated plan and he criticised the IDB's overseas operations. ***** Lesley Knox, head of institutional business at Kleinwort Benson Investment Management, has become chairman of KLEINWORT BENSON INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT. Colin Bradbury, Juliet Cohn, Simon Fenton, Georgina Perceval Maxwell and Richard Watt have been promoted to directors of KBII.

			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGEL NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> VERSATILE DONNIE HILL HAS A PLACE ON THE ROSTER CLEARLY IN HIS SIGHT  </P> <P> He can hit from either side of the plate, throw with either hand and play  second, shortstop or third. With all the things Donnie Hill can do for the  Angels, it's easy to overlook the two he won't do.  </P> <P> One is play first base.  </P> <P> "I'm a little short for that," said Hill, who is generously listed on the  Angels' roster at 5-feet-11. "Maybe when I grow up."  </P> <P> The other thing he isn't likely to do is discuss the eye ailment that  threatened to curtail his career. An infection that developed in 1987,  apparently caused by his contact lenses, didn't disappear until he was fitted  with disposable lenses, which are discarded before bacteria build up on them  and infect the wearer's eyes.  </P> <P> Free of discomfort and distorted vision, Hill has shown enough eagerness and  versatility in training camp to virtually assure himself of a spot on the  Angels' roster.  </P> <P> "The kid can play three infield positions and switch hit. There's not too many  of those around," Manager Doug Rader said of Hill, who was signed as a free  agent in January and came to camp as a non-roster player. "If he remains  healthy, he remains in our plans. The only thing that could get in the way is  his eye problem."  </P> <P> Eye problem? What eye problem?  </P> <P> "I have no eye problem," said Hill, who was born in Pomona and graduated from  Edison High in Huntington Beach. "It's completely gone now. It affected my  vision, but it's cleared up and my eyes are fine."  </P> <P> Hill, 29, was signed by the Oakland Athletics in 1981 and came up through their  farm system as a shortstop. He was supposed to start the 1985 season in double  A, but was moved to second when Tony Phillips was injured during spring  training. Hill batted .285 that season, with three home runs and 48 runs batted  in, and hit .283 the next season as the regular second baseman.  </P> <P> Hill was traded to the White Sox in December of 1986 and opened 1987 as their  second baseman, but he was put on the disabled list because of his eye ailment  early in the season. He returned to the disabled list in July and August  because of a hamstring injury and platooned at second for most of 1988, when  his average fell to a career-low .217.  </P> <P> He was released by the White Sox last March, but the A's signed him to a  triple-A contract with their Tacoma affiliate. He hit .261 in 58 games, but was  released by Oakland last August.  </P> <P> Hill, who was familiar to Rader because of Rader's stint as a coach and interim  manager in Chicago, is determined to make the most of his ability.  </P> <P> "I came to camp ready to do everything I could to make the club," said Hill,  who played second, shortstop and third during Sunday's intrasquad game. "I was  kind of worried during the lockout, but things have worked out OK so far. I  look at this as getting another chance to prove I can play."  </P> <P> If he can give second baseman Johnny Ray, shortstop Dick Schofield or third  baseman Jack Howell an occasional rest without the Angels losing anything in  the field, he would fit Rader's ideal of stockpiling versatile players. Rader  has already said he will try second baseman Mark McLemore at third and  shortstop, and Kent Anderson played some at second and third last season, in  addition to the 65 games he started at shortstop. Bobby Rose can also play  second or third.  </P> <P> Becoming so versatile wasn't Hill's original plan.  </P> <P> "Oakland moved me to second in '85, but I really didn't think much about  playing other positions until then," he said. "As time has gone on, especially  if you're not starting, it helps to be able to play other positions. I started  at third in Chicago a little bit, so basically I have quite a bit of time in at  all three. Normally, I'd say I prefer second base, but I'm comfortable at all  the rest. Wherever he (Rader) sticks me, I'll just try to do the best I can."  </P> <P> The Angels open a four-game exhibition series against the Padres today in Yuma.  </P> <P> Mark Langston is scheduled to pitch the first three innings for the Angels  today, with Mike Witt set to go the next three. Bryan Harvey, Scott Bailes and  Bob McClure will finish up.  </P> <P> Schofield will be rested today because of a minor hamstring pull that has not  fully healed. Ray didn't start Sunday's intrasquad game as a precaution after  he was hit in the head twice Saturday during a simulated game, but he played  later and pronounced himself fit. Chili Davis was limited to being the  designated hitter Sunday because of minor leg tenderness, but Rader said the  problem is not serious.  </P> <P> Outfielder Dan Grunhard, who played at double-A Midland, Tex., last season, and  Anderson each had three hits Sunday.  </P> <P> "The Grunhard boy did a nice job," Rader said. "It was nice to see all the kids  do well."  </P> <P> Grunhard is among six non-roster players who joined the club for the trip to  Yuma. Also going were Hill, former Philadelphia third baseman Rick Schu and  reliever Mark Eichhorn.  </P> <P> Eichhorn, who pitched for Atlanta last season after several successful years  with Toronto, was signed as a free agent last December. He gave up three runs  in his first inning Sunday but Rader was not discouraged.  </P> <P> "I'm very impressed with the guy," Rader said. "He needs to throw forkballs  consistently. The first few pitches he threw were fastballs. As soon as he  started throwing forkballs and breaking balls, he started getting people out."  </P> <P> The Angels are trying to persuade the Padres to use the designated hitter for  this series. The Angels' pitchers haven't taken batting practice, and they're  not likely to get any. "They'd take it (today) at the plate. It's going to be  'Go hit.' That's it," Rader said.  </P> <P> Pitcher Bert Blyleven was elected the Angels' player representative this  season, replacing Witt. "I've been there before," said Blyleven, who was the  player representative for the Minnesota Twins.  </P> <P> Outfielder Claudell Washington worked out at first base in one of the two  simulated games the Angels played Saturday. He enjoyed it, but not enough to  make a habit of it.  </P> <P> "I played first base for 30 minutes. I know my career is up," Washington said  with a mock grimace. "If they had put me over there when I had reflexes, I  might have had a better chance."  </P></p>

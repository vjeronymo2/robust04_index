When we say the Security Council, we in fact mean the U.S.  Administration that has imposed its full control and hegemony  over the international organization since the Gulf crisis in  1990 and the subsequent host of unjust resolutions adopted, in  record time, against fraternal Iraq. The Iraqi people are still  suffering from the effects of these unjust and unprecedented  resolutions even though their alleged justifications are over.    Within less than two weeks, the Security Council adopted  some  13 resolutions, including a resolution that allowed the  launching of a brutal aggression against Iraq, in addition to  the imposition of an all-out siege. On the other hand, the  council has spent two full weeks on consultations on the most  brutal and unprecedented massacre in contemporary history.  These consultations have been subject to strange U.S.  bargaining. This bargaining has once again shown the hypocrisy,  double-standards, and blatant contradictions in U.S. political  behavior. It has exposed the allegations about eagerness to  implement international legitimacy and UN resolutions.    The final straw in this U.S. bargaining was the humiliating  condition set by Christopher in his telephone contact with  Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat last Thursday. Christopher  emphasized his administration's position, which forms a link  between any proposed international resolution condemning the  massacre and the resumption of the Palestinian-Israeli  negotiations, despite the fact that the U.S. position on the  draft resolution is not far from what Israeli wants. Washington  insists on a diluted resolution that does not contain any  serious measures to deter the Israelis from their repressive  policy in the occupied Arab territories.    We have never had a good opinion of U.S. intentions toward  our just Arab causes. We have never ignored the nature of the  strategic alliance between the United States and Israel, which  has continued for decades, or the unlimited U.S. support for  Zionist aggressiveness against the Arab nation. We are fully  aware that restoring respect and dignity to this nation cannot  be realized through the emotions of the United States, because  politics and interests do not know emotions. There is no  alternative for Arab solidarity, even the minimum of this  solidarity.</p>

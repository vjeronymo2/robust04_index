			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Panic and rumours upset skittish Tories: Leadership fears sweeping the Commons Will he stay or will he go? If he goes, when will he go? And when he goes, how will he go? Mr John Major's leadership was the only issue in Westminster yesterday. Throughout the day, the Westminster hothouse was feverish. An abusive front page in the increasingly disloyal Daily Mail added to anxiety on the Tory back benches that the prime minister's compromise on Europe had crippled his leadership. There was panic in the air. A flurry of pre-lunchtime ministerial meetings led to rumours that several ministers - perhaps the prime minister himself - might be on the verge of quitting. The first rumour was that cabinet ministers were in Number 10 discussing somebody's future. But no, the meeting was on the government's efficiency white paper. Then there was news that Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, had driven to the home of Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury and a fellow rightwinger, for breakfast. A bit of rightwing plotting? 'Come on, Michael is having chats with people the whole time,' said an MP close to the home secretary. By the evening, nerves had calmed. But the mood among backbench Tory MPs was bleak as they prepared for a grim and pensive 10-day Easter break. Much will depend on their mood when they come back. As one said, they are exhausted at the end of a long session of committees and late-night votes. If yesterday's despondency has not lifted after the Easter break, even Mr Major's staunchest supporters say they will look elsewhere for leadership. It was pointed out yesterday that the political complexion of MPs attacking the prime minister has changed. For the past 18 months the right of the party has sniped at him on Europe and on the welfare state. Now, some rightwing Tories are hesitating to go in for the kill, fearing that they have no candidate to pitch against Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, or Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. As one staunch rightwinger put it: 'I'll do anything to stop Heseltine's white-knuckle ride.' It is MPs on the centre-left of the party, the pro-European wing, who are now getting nervous about the prime minister's prospects. 'There are people round here backing Michael Heseltine who would have had nothing good to say for him three months ago,' said one MP. Another said: 'You should have seen the number of MPs wheedling around Heseltine last night.' It is the doubts of these MPs, the sensible, utterly pro-Major tendency, that could rock him. 'He is finished,' said a former minister at the centre of the political spectrum. 'There is a growing inevitability about things.' He predicted that even a ridiculous 'stalking horse' candidate in a leadership race could trigger enough abstentions to damage Mr Major seriously. Another pro-European back-bencher who was happy with the result on qualified majority voting, said: 'What has damaged him so much is his tactics. They have helped no one.' A member of the 1922 executive - one of the 'men in grey suits' - was no more encouraging. 'His performance in question time last Tuesday was the last straw. It was very, very damaging because it raised the spirits of the large group of MPs who had held their noses while supporting the government on Maastricht, only to disappoint them again.' A handful of MPs still expressed support. 'There are simply no other candidates whom the party can back and stay united,' said one. Another said: 'The state of the economy is still the key card he has to play.' But unqualified and unreserved support for the Conservative party leader was nowhere to be heard.</p>

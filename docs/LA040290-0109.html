			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> STOP FIGHTING, MANDELA PLEADS  </P> <P> Nelson R. Mandela said today he will meet President Frederik W. de Klerk on  Thursday to discuss ways to end the factional violence among blacks in Natal  province, and he appealed for an end to the fighting that has kept blacks from  uniting to fight white minority rule.  </P> <P> Mandela, the African National Conference deputy president, decided to meet De  Klerk despite the ANC decision to pull out of talks April 11. The ANC canceled  the meeting because police shot and killed at least nine demonstrators last  week in the black township of Sebokeng near Johannesburg. The organization said  it will reconsider entering talks once the government curbs the police.  </P></p>

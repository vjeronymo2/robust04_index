Cindoruk sent a letter to the president of the European  Parliament following the Parliament's decision on the subject.  In his letter, Cindoruk noted that the decision by the European  Parliament blatantly discriminates against the various regions  in Turkey and ignores the maturity of democratic processes.  Cindoruk remarked that there is no logical reason whatsoever to  rely on observers to secure a just and free election atmosphere  during the upcoming local elections.</p>

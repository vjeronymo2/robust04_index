			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Property: A market for sensible sellers - Prices for prime houses in central London are recovering fast, with more increases on the way The central London market has re-established itself. Since autumn 1992, overseas buyers have snapped up prime properties and agents have sold off almost all the backlog clogging their books at reduced, realistic figures. The result was a price increase last year of around 10 per cent in the best areas, much of that in the second half. Agents expect further increases in 1994 and most see a gentle rise of around 10 per cent - although, in a much-publicised forecast two months ago, Yolande Barnes of Savills Residential Research predicted 25 per cent in prime central London. The key factor is how much property will be available. With housing so affordable but supply short, price rises are inevitable. It is becoming a sellers' market - but they must be sensible. Buyers have not forgotten the recession; and if a house is priced too high (which agents might suggest in order to secure the business), there will not be a sale. Yet, if the figure is seen as reasonable, they will move quickly and even pay over the odds if there is competition. In Chelsea, Lord Bective of Egertons reports four cases when the first person through the door of a new listing bought at the asking price or within 2 per cent of it, although he adds that Barnes' mega-bullish forecast 'has put the dampers on the vendors'. Anthony Lassman, of Lassmans, feels a 20 per cent increase for 'the very, very prime places' would not be any surprise, with 10 per cent on average. But remember that, whether buying or selling, everywhere is different. During last year, the happy news in prime London spread to the fringes of the centre - such as Hampstead, Islington and Fulham - and to the home counties. Eventually, it should reach from John O'Groats to Land's End. In the recession, unsellable new developments and repossessions made things worse, while a new disease called negative equity cursed sellers who had bought at the peak. Now, however, this virus is working its way out of the system as prices rise. Meanwhile, those who bought early in the 1980s or before, many as first-time buyers, are taking advantage of the present situation to climb a rung higher on the housing ladder by moving up to homes with two or three bedrooms. Then again, the devaluation on Black Wednesday in September 1992 led to investment-seeking foreign buyers - mainly from Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore - pouring money into new developments or refurbishments in the best areas. Now, there is a scarcity of these, says James Wilson of buying agent Wilson &amp; Wilson, a situation compounded by the lack of new projects because of the recession. As first-timers bringing in new money, albeit for the most expensive properties, the foreigners gave the market a kick-start which then drew in UK buyers. Add the lack of houses to buy and, suddenly, a rise in central London of 10-15 per cent by mid-1994 - predicted by Barnes in autumn 1992 but pooh-poohed by many - looks to be coming true. Agents in 1993 had their best business for years, clearing old stock at attractive final prices. Mayfair specialist Wetherell sold two mansions (Aberconway House and 4 St James's Square) for around Pounds 6m; both were offered originally for about twice as much. Now, says Simon Edwards of Winkworth's Pimlico office, the margin between selling and asking prices is down from 5 to 2 per cent. In Belgravia's Eaton Square, SW1, the right address adds hundreds of thousands of pounds to the price. The north side, which catches most of the sun, is best. Be as close as possible to the majestic central block where the freeholder of the entire area lives - the Duke of Westminster (who owns the Grosvenor Estate). Here, Lassmans has sold a 7,000 sq ft flat, stretching across three houses, for Pounds 9m for a 20-year lease. Nearby, in humbler Pimlico, Winkworth reports price rises this past autumn. A maisonette in Moreton Road, bought in September for Pounds 217,500, was sold (for family reasons) in November for Pounds 235,000. In Belgrave Road, a one-bedroom flat went from Pounds 90,000 to Pounds 94,000 between July and November. In Mayfair (W1), where the Grosvenor Estate also is the main landowner, Wetherell sees a seller's market in 1994. Last year, houses and flats went for a third off their 1991/92 prices and the agent sold property worth Pounds 35m. Now, in only February, it has Pounds 35m of instructions and is acting in future developments worth Pounds 65m. In Kensington, large family houses on the Phillimore Estate (W8) have passed the Pounds 1m mark again to stand at 1989 levels, if not yet at the all-time high of August 1990. The bottom end is back to peak levels as first-time buyers and family trusts look for Pounds 200-300,000 houses for letting or personal use. At the very bottom a small, one-bedroom flat costs around Pounds 80-90,000 and a one-bedroom house Pounds 150-180,000. A garage adds Pounds 20-30,000. Agents expect the next growth area to be the Pounds 500-600,000 mid-range. Farther out in Fulham (SW6), John D. Wood's Brian Bishop reports there was a desperate shortage of houses a month ago. Three went to best and final offers, selling at 5 per cent over the asking prices. Stock is better now, though. In Hampstead (NW3), prices at the top end stopped rising early in 1988 and then fell steadily for five years, says Marc Goldberg, of Hamptons. In mid-1993, the tide turned and prices have risen about 10 per cent. Goldberg expects a further rise of 10 per cent 'or possibly more' this year if the supply continues thin. Prices could reach mid-1988 levels, but not the early 1988 peak. St John's Wood (NW8) and Primrose Hill (NW1/NW3) are selling well, says Patricia Greenstone, of John D. Wood. 'We have a market now. You can be confident of getting your price. Ridiculous offers Pounds 100,000 below the asking price are over.' The only cloud is Regent's Park, where flats in the terraces have been slow for the past two years because of uncertainty as to what the Crown Estate will do about extending the leases. Meanwhile, for a long-term perspective, consider 2 Wyndham Place, W1, a late-Georgian listed house where Somerset Maugham once lived. It is under offer, at a guide price of Pounds 595,000, through Chestertons Residential. The seller is the Greater London Fund for the Blind - which bought the house in 1952 for Pounds 7,600.</p>

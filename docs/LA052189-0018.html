			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> HIGH WINDS AND RAIN BUFFET SOUTHEAST  </P> <P> Thunderstorms swept across the Southeast, with lightning setting a house afire  and injuring four people in Tennessee. Some flooded rivers began receding in  Texas but thousands of residents remained out of their homes. The National  Weather Service said storms raked Tennessee, Kentucky, Arkansas, Alabama,  Mississippi and Oklahoma. A thunderstorm produced hail the size of golf balls  at Memphis, Tenn., with winds gusting to 56 m.p.h. Tornadoes were reported in  Cross County, Ark., and just west of Corinth, Miss., but there were no injuries  or major damage. In western North Carolina, thunderstorms produced high winds  that uprooted large trees in the town of Texana. Three to five inches of rain  fell in parts of Okmulgee and Muskogee counties in east-central Oklahoma. In  Texas, authorities recovered the body of an 11th storm victim from flooding  that swept through the state during the last week.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 12 Jun (PL) -- Official sources reported  here today that Foreign Secretary Manuel Tello, Commerce  Secretary Jaime Serra Puche, and Fisheries Secretary Guillermo  Jimenez Morales form part of the delegation accompanying Mexican  President Carlos Salinas de Gortari for his visit to Cuba  tomorrow.    Sources close to the two nations indicated that, as a  central  focus of Salinas' visit, he and Cuban President Fidel Castro  will analyze bilateral political and economic relations and  explore new actions to strengthen them.    Another topic that is not excluded from the talks at the  highest level between Cuba and Mexico is that of the Fourth  Ibero-American summit in which the two presidents will  participate in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, on 14 and 15 June.  The Mexican president will arrive at 1115 (1515 GMT), and,  after receiving honors befitting his office at Jose Marti  International Airport in Havana, he will begin private talks  with his Cuban counterpart.    At the same time, the delegations of the two countries will  also meet to examine ongoing bilateral cooperation and ways to  promote economic cooperation projects that are in the  negotiation stage and, if possible, to conclude them for their  signature. Cuba and Mexico have been holding talks to establish  joint enterprises in the telecommunications, energy, glass, and  textile fields, among others.    The delegation which will accompany the Mexican president  also includes Commerce Under Secretary Herminio Blanco and  Santiago Onate, chief of the president's advisers. This was  reported by Mexican Ambassador to Cuba Carlos Tello Macias, who  indicated that he must wait for official confirmation regarding  the rest of the delegation.    Before leaving for Colombia, Salinas de Gortari will meet  with representatives of Mexicans living in Cuba and will hold a  news conference.</p>

			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rubber pact granted stay of execution ONCE AGAIN the world's natural rubber producers and consumers have pulled back from the brink. After a five-day meeting here, both sides failed to find any common ground on key issues dividing them. But they did not, as widely expected, make moves to abandon the International Natural Rubber Agreement. 'We agreed to defer the decision to allow delegates to consult among themselves and with their respective capitals,' said a Malaysian delegate to the talks. 'Hopefully, things will get more definite.' The meeting, held under the auspices of the International Natural Rubber Organisation, discussed two main issues. The main producer countries - Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Nigeria and the Ivory Coast - say the present agreement failed to guarantee adequate prices. Rubber prices have slumped to their lowest level in real terms in more than 30 years. Many thousands of rubber farmers are being forced out of production. The producers want a renegotiation of the pact, which lapses at the end of this year. Further, the producers have warned the consumers, mostly the big tyre companies, that if they fail to renegotiate Inra then producer countries will bring in their own pricing mechanisms. The consumers recognise some of the difficulties the producers face. But they say that before they can begin to discuss a renegotiation of Inra, producers must accept that they breached the terms of the present agreement by failing to agree on a downward revision of the price support band earlier this year. Consumers say that according to various technical terms of the pact there should have been a 5 per cent cut in price. The European Community has been particularly insistent that the price revision question be resolved. The meeting seemingly made no headway on either of these issues. The consumers and producers now return to discuss ways out of the present impasse with their various governments. Time is not on their side. The next Inro council meeting is in November. Before then each side has to investigate if there is any room for compromise: the EC, for instance, will have to enter into discussions with each member government and then consult with other consumer countries. While both sides left here relieved that Inra had been granted a stay of execution, there is little optimism that the two sides have either the time or inclination to find solutions to their present problems. 'At this stage it really looks as though both sides are merely postponing the inevitable,' said one consumer country delegate. 'It still seems unlikely that Inra will survive beyond the end of the year.' World rubber stocks have built up again after a drawdown in recent years, Inro says, reports Reuter from Kuala Lumpur. In its annual report it estimates world stocks at the end of 1992, including its own buffer stock, at 1.66m tonnes, up from 1.45m tonnes at the end of 1990 and overtaking the end-1987 peak of 1.65m tonnes. 'The trend towards lower stockholding and to just-in-time purchasing by manufacturers, and the lower demand particularly during the last two years, resulted in the gradual building-up of natural rubber stocks,' the report explains.</p>

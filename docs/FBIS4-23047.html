Mendeleyev; UDC539.63:666.192.001.5]    [Abstract] Amorphous silicon dioxide grade ChDA (pure for  analysis) was chosen as a research object in the development of  structures intended for compaction by explosion of finely  dispersed substances. The silicon dioxide was subjected to  shock-wave treatment in steel and copper ampules containing an  axially arranged charge of explosive. After the shock-wave  treatment, the silicon dioxide was subjected to X-ray phase  analysis and IR spectroscopy. The results demonstrated the  existence of a new, previously unknown modification of silicon  dioxide having a primitive cubic lattice (a = 7.78 angstroms).  X-ray and IR data are presented.

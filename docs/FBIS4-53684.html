			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- An influential business  leader welcomed a government decision to freeze public service  charges until the year-end and expressed hope Friday [20 May]  that the decision will remain in force for more than two years.    Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan Association of  Corporate  Executives (Keizai Doyukai), said the decision by the government  Wednesday to freeze public fee hikes was a welcome move and that  it should remain in force for at least two years. He said it  would be unnatural to raise government-controlled fees at a time  when private enterprises are going all out to restructure  operations and cut costs.</p>

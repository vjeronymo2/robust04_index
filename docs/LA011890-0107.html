			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAPT. CAMPEAU'S TITANIC VOYAGE  </P> <P> What could possibly bankrupt a department store with such high-energy marketing  that it will sell you French lessons as easily as a new pair of shoes? Well,  ask people at Bloomingdale's, which in the East has for years been just another  way of describing the cutting edge of success. But now, for reasons beyond  their control, the folks at the popular store most everyone calls "Bloomie's"  face an uncertain future.  </P> <P> All it requires, they would tell you, is a takeover artist whose experience is  in real estate, not retailing, whose ego exceeds his bankroll and who goes so  deeply into debt to snap you up along with an extended family of other prestige  stores that he can't meet the mortgage payments. So it was that the federal  bankruptcy court in Cincinnati this week accepted a petition from entrepreneur  Robert Campeau's Canadian holding company to protect the stores from their  creditors under Chapter 11 of U.S. bankruptcy laws.  </P> <P> Campeau paid top dollar, and then some, for Allied Stores Corp. in 1986 and  Federated Department Stores in 1988. Between them, they owned 260 retail  outlets with more than 100,000 employees. Stockholders did very well in the  short run, but only about one in eight ventures into bankruptcy for the purpose  of reorganization ever succeeds. And so their windfall could mean Bloomie's  downfall.  </P> <P> Other, more difficult questions come to mind as courts and creditors start  their damage assessments. Shouldn't there be a law to prevent such needless  economic calamity? Probably. But does anybody know what kind of law? Not  really. The best thinking in Congress homes in on current tax law, which, oddly  enough, provides a tax break for acquisitions financed by debt but not for  those using real cash. This is an area definitely worth looking into.  </P> <P> Economic legislation in free-enterprise societies is designed to curb sharp  practices, not to define or proscribe acceptable levels of risk. Risk in the  expectation of gain is the very engine of the system, and courts and regulators  are seldom prepared to tell entrepreneurs how much risk is too much. Much of  Wall Street saw the Campeau episode as coming close to the finish of the  high-interest junk-bond financing of the 1980s -- the end of a cycle if not of  an era. The next cycle would lift the system and the people who depend on it  for jobs into something better.  </P> <P> This may be valid economic theory, but Congress probably will -- and certainly  should -- take a look at the whole risky business. Campeau's own management has  given Congress a place to start looking. The company distributed a memorandum  Monday saying, among other things, that "Chapter 11 (bankruptcy) no longer  carries the stigma it once did." Congress should determine whether that wave of  the wrist over the wreckage also implies that there is not the risk in high  finance there once was, at least for financiers.  </P> <P> If so, Congress may want to see whether there is some way it can make risk seem  at least as real as the hope for profit. That is, after all, the point on which  the system is supposed to balance.  </P></p>

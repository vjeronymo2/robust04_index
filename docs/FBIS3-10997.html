Has the agreement been signed yet?    [Camilion] This agreement is almost closed. We believe all  negotiations will be finalized in late April. The agreement  includes the refurbishment of 36A 4M Skyhawk aircraft: 18 will  be done in the United States and the rest in Argentina, in the  Cordoba Materiel Area [AMC].    [Nole] Can you tell us about this dual program negotiation,  because there are many versions.    [Camilion] A Defense Ministry and Air Force delegation held  talks with the Westinghouse company -- which will provide the  celebrated radar installations -- with Pratt &amp; Whitney --  which  will supply the avionics -- and with Lockheed. Talks were also  held with the U.S. Navy to renegotiate letters of intent  originally agreed on over the refurbishing of a significant  number of aircraft. Third, Lockheed has begun talks with the  U.S. Smith Industries because we want that company to  participate in this program. And, last, talks were held by the  Defense Ministry with the Vought company to coordinate the Pampa  2000 aircraft project.    [Nole] Who will run the former aircraft factory?    [Camilion] The AMC property will not be transferred to  anybody. It will be run by a group of companies that will be  headed by Lockheed with the Air Forces' participation.    [Nole] There were rumors that the purchase of these aircraft  caused concern in Chile.    [Camilion] I do not think the Chileans have anything to  worry  about. We discussed this subject at length with the former  Chilean defense minister (Patricio Rojas). When he visited  Argentina, he clearly said that Chile is not worried about  Argentina buying Skyhawks and disclosed that Chile was buying  Mirage interceptors.    [Nole] Over the past few days there have been rumors about  an  aborted sale of cannons to Liberia whose final destination was,  in truth, Croatia. Did this triangular weapons deal exist?    [Camilion] No. The deal was exclusively with Liberia and was  vetoed right from the beginning. We cannot sell anything to  Croatia. There was a proposal to sell Pucara aircraft to  Croatia, but it was turned down due to the international weapons  embargo on the region. We were not aware of an embargo on  Liberia, but the Foreign Ministry found the operation was not  feasible because there was also a weapons embargo on that  country. But let me make it clear that this sale was for  Liberia and not for Croatia.    [Nole] Where did the rumor on the interest in sending  weapons  to the former Yugoslavia come from?    [Camilion] Those were mere speculations, although I must  admit that I am personally interested in investigating their  origin.    [Nole] What sort of investigations has your ministry started  regarding the participation of military men with guerrilla  elements that held up an armored vehicle on the [Buenos Aires]  beltway.    [Camilion] We have obviously started an investigation and  have been in contact with the SIDE [Army Intelligence Service].  This problem has worried us, we are investigating it, and what  worries us most is a possible link between members of the Armed  Forces with some intelligence service or criminal group. Our  investigations are to determine if there are other connections.  We cannot conduct more exhaustive investigations because the  Defense Ministry cannot engage in domestic intelligence  activities. That must be handled by the Interior Ministry and  the Federal Police.    [Nole] Naturally, but it is very worrisome that members of  the Army and of the security forces act in an organized manner  with criminal groups.    [Camilion] Undoubtedly, although we believe the beltway case  is an isolated case. We must be on the lookout to see if there  are other connections, but we believe this was an isolated case  and do not attribute to it -- despite the ideological mixture of  the group -- any political implications. This is, essentially,  a common case of delinquency.    [Nole] Does the fact that many servicemen work for private  security enterprises to obtain extra money have any effect on  the three branches of the Armed Forces?    [Camilion] This problem is worrying because the need for  another job somewhat affects the Armed Forces' professional  conduct. However, it is currently unavoidable due to the low  salaries officers on duty earn and, consequently, this ministry  and the Armed Forces have accept that this situation will remain  a military reality for some time, that is, the need for the  officers to have other jobs.    [Nole] Armed Forces salaries have always been a polemic and  much discussed subject between the Defense and Economy  Ministries.    [Camilion] This year's budget is considered reasonable,  which  does not mean the Armed Forces's salaries are satisfactory. We  are not being subjected to any pressure or negotiations for  salary increases for the civilian and military sectors. The  1994 budget remains unchanged.    [Nole] How is your relationship with [Economy Minister  Domingo] Cavallo?    [Camilion] We have always rationally explained the Defense  Ministry's needs to the economy minister and have always  received rational answers. First, we have systematically  organized Defense Ministry expenditures and so far have always  had a positive response. There is no disagreement with the  Economy Ministry.    [Nole] Regarding drug trafficking, the United States seems  to  want to form a multinational force to fight this problem. Are  you working on this?    [Camilion] Argentina has two forces to fight trafficking;  the  Border Police and the Naval Coast Guard. This is why the Armed  Forces have no reason or intention of participating in the  struggle against trafficking as happens in other countries.  Naturally, if circumstances justify it, we may cooperate by  granting logistic support, but we do not want the Armed Forces  involved in the struggle against trafficking, because the three  branches do not want this.    [Nole] Was there unrest within the Armed Forces over the  arrival in Argentina of Italian prosecutors to investigate the  disappearance of Italian citizens in our country?    [Camilion] Yes, there was a lot of unrest. The Armed Forces  were deeply concerned because they believed -- rightly so in my  opinion -- that this could mean reopening a chapter which  Argentina considers closed. It was considered that these  investigations would reopen cases that have already been closed  and would mean interfering with the three branches, with the  legislative branch over the laws it dictates, with the federal  chamber over the rulings it hands down; and the executive branch  over the amnesty that it ordered. This chapter is regarded as  closed and nobody wants it reopened through indirect channels.    [Nole] My last question. Within the Armed Forces, are there  any groups that favor a coup?    [Camilion] None at all. The Armed Forces  institutionalization process in Argentina is comprehensive.  There is no chance of a military coup taking place in Argentina.</p>

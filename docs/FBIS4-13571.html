			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukraine has sought India's assistance in setting up  medium and small-scale industrial complex. Addressing a meeting  organized by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and  Industry, FICCI, in New Delhi today, the visiting Ukrainian  foreign minister, Mr. Anatoliy Zlenko, said his country has many  heavy industries, but it lacks the know-how to run medium and  small-scale industries successfully as India does. He said the  three agreements that have been signed between the two countries  on economic, scientific, technical, and cultural cooperation  will go a long way in boosting the traditional ties between the  two countries. Mr. Zlenko also announced that the Ukrainian  chambers and FICCI would set up a joint business committee to  promote business between the two nations. Later, the visiting  minister called on the president.</p>

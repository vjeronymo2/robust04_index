			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Miklos Duray, chairman of the Coexistence </F> (Egyutteles) Movement, by Ivan Durcik; place and date not given:  "Autonomy Is Parliament's Business"]    [Text] [Durcik] The official program of the Komarno rally  no longer mentions the possibility of establishing autonomy.  If, nonetheless, autonomy got onto the rally's agenda, what  would be the response of your movement, which endorsed the  convening of this undertaking?    [Duray] Should there be discussion about self-administration  in Komarno, we can only endorse this view. Reinforcing the role  of self-administration bodies is in the interest not only of the  people of Zitny Ostrov [Rye Island, Hungarian-populated area in  southern Slovakia] but of all residents of the Slovak Republic.  This is the only realistic option, because the only democratic  way to achieve autonomy is by means of a law. And for such a  law to be passed, it is necessary to gain a majority in  parliament.    [Durcik] Do you want to suggest that the term "autonomy" did  not figure even on the original agenda of the Komarno rally?    [Duray] No. The Hungarian parties that endorsed this rally  (Coexistence and the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement --  SLOVENSKY DENNIK note) have never spoken about territorial  autonomy. What we want is a system of self-administration, in  which communities and regions would have the powers that they  need to deal independently with the problems of the local  population.    [Durcik] The Slovak Government is in a difficult situation.  The coalition is not working and the results in the economic  sector are very weak. Do you not think that, by organizing  activities such as the Komarno rally, the Hungarian minority is  voluntarily getting into the role of a culprit, whom the  government can blame for every failure?    [Duray] It is true that Prime Minister Meciar is intensively  looking for people whom he could blame for his own failures. By  creating the image of an enemy, the present government is trying  to lay all the blame on the Hungarian minority, opposition  politicians, disloyal journalists, and so forth. It is not our  activities that directly help the government, however, but,  rather, the stands of some "opposition" politicians. During the  vote on the budget, our deputies voted in unison against the  government draft, while the chairman of the strongest opposition  party and one Christian Democratic Movement deputy supported the  government draft. To ascribe their voting to the fact that the  Hungarians were organizing a rally in Komarno would be a bit  much.    [Durcik] Recently you mentioned that you could imagine a  broader government coalition with the participation of your  movement, as well as the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia  [HZDS], in the event that there is a change of prime minister.  Do you think that the demands of the Hungarian minority would be  easier to realize without Meciar?    [Duray] I do not see the main problem in one person but,  rather, in people's thinking. It is as though, after obtaining  independence, the Slovaks were surprised to find out that there  are also Hungarians in Slovakia. Through our activities, we  want to draw the attention of our Slovak fellow citizens to the  fact that we live here and that we want to coexist with them as  citizens with equal rights. This aim is also to be served by  our rally in Komarno.</p>

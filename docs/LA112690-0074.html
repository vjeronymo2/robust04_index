			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR FIRST TIME, IVORY COAST VOTERS GET A CHOICE OF PARTIES  </P> <P> Voters cast ballots in the country's first multi-party parliamentary election  Sunday amid opposition charges of intimidation and fraud by the party that has  ruled unchallenged for 30 years.  </P> <P> Early results are expected today.  </P> <P> Reports indicated that turnout was low as President Felix Houphouet-Boigny's  ruling Democratic Party headed for an easy victory.  </P> <P> In the capital of Abidjan, voter turnout was as low as 30%, and reports from  the interior of the cocoa-growing West African country confirmed the scant  enthusiasm for the first popularity test for fledgling opposition parties.  </P> <P> About 4.4 million people registered to choose 175 lawmakers from among the 490  candidates representing 19 parties.  </P> <P> The Democrats are assured of 40 seats that are unchallenged. They are expected  to easily win a majority, reinforcing Houphouet-Boigny's huge victory last  month in the nation's first contested presidential race.  </P> <P> His sole challenger, Popular Front leader Laurent Gbagbo, accused the ruling  party of rigging that election, in which the 85-year-old Houphouet-Boigny  received 81.67% of the votes.  </P> <P> Early Sunday, about 200 armed soldiers surrounded Gbagbo's constituency of  Ouragahio, 170 miles northwest of Abidjan. A spokesman for the opposition  leader said the local government there had announced that people could vote  without producing identity or voter registration cards.  </P> <P> In the central town of Bouake, Popular Front officials said their  representatives were refused entry into polling stations to monitor voting. All  parties fielding candidates are supposed to be able to watch the voting.  </P> <P> The run-up to the elections had been quiet, with the first violence reported  Saturday in Abidjan's suburb of Yopougon.  </P> <P> Several people remained hospitalized after a clash there between supporters of  the conservative Democratic Party and the left-leaning Popular Front.  </P></p>

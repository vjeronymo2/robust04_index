			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / N-waste delays pose threat to safety' Workers handling radioactive waste at sites owned by the Atomic Energy Authority could suffer additional doses of radiation because of delays in constructing a permanent repository for nuclear waste in the UK, a nuclear safety study group said yesterday. The group, set up by the Health and Safety Executive's nuclear safety committee, said the sites were running out of storage space. The group's report, however, concludes that the authority is aware of these problems and is dealing with them. The authority said it accepted the findings, and was addressing the specific problems identified. The report says that at Sellafield in Cumbria there are still serious problems left over from a fire in 1952. At Dounreay in the Highlands, where the prototype of a fast breeder reactor is being decommissioned, waste storage is 'very much of a hand-to-mouth existence'. It also says the delay in the repository programme and in a new agreement on packaging specifications for nuclear waste were preventing the more secure storage of waste. Yesterday's findings do not directly affect plans to privatise the Atomic Energy Authority. The division responsible for managing and decommissioning redundant plant will remain in government hands.</p>

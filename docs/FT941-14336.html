			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (18): The cushion may be wearing thin - Investor confidence has soared after the worst year for business since the war. But, under pressure to reduce their prices, many companies are still struggling to survive / Country Analyses - Germany By common consent, west German business has just emerged from its worst year since the war. Automotive manufacturers and engineering concerns, the country's top export earners, for example, suffered production cuts of 25 per cent and 10 per cent respectively. But the Bayerische Hypo Bank's forecast of just over a year ago, that 'the looming recession will not turn out to be a serious disaster for most German companies' has proved to be right so far. The reason, as the bank implied, was that companies were able to cushion the shocks by drawing on reserves of financial fat laid down in the previous decade of relative prosperity. Nowhere was this cushion more apparent than at Daimler-Benz, the country's industrial flagship, which drew down some DM2bn from reserves salted away in better times to limit its nine-month losses - according to German accounting standards  - to just DM181m. By US principles, however, the group slumped DM2bn into the red. Since Daimler is the only German company so far listed on the New York Stock Exchange - it made the move in October - there is no accurate way to penetrate the books of other companies to win a clear impression of the impact of the slump on earnings. But there can be no mistaking the effects of recession on German management. Galvanised by its rude awakening, it has set about rationalisation and restructuring with unprecedented vigour. Lean management, lean production and concentration on 'core' operations have become the watchwords. Encrusted management bureaucracies have been broken down. Workforces have been cut ruthlessly. The traditionally cosy relationship between capital and labour has been brought into question and a new order is emerging. Planned investments have been subjected to the most rigorous examination, and, in many cases, scrapped. Long-time problem subsidiaries have been unceremoniously dumped. Daimler, the lumbering automotive, aerospace and electrical engineering group, is a case in point. AEG, its stand-alone electrical and electronics engineering subsidiary, now faces a new future as an integrated provider of equipment and services for the rest of the group. Its domestic appliances division is to go to Electrolux. Other divisions, finally adjudged too small to compete internationally have been folded up into joint ventures with General Electric of the US, for example. Subsidiaries making electricity meters and motors will be sold. Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) is to close at least six sites and its defence business, crippled by government spending cuts, is to be 'minimalised' in the words of Mr Edzard Reuter, Daimler chairman. Just before Christmas, Dasa's MTU aircraft engine business announced a share swap with Pratt &amp; Whitney of the US, tightening an existing relationship. Group-wide workforce reduction plans for this year and last allow for at least 50,000 job losses: mostly in Germany. And change will continue: partnerships are under discussion in other sectors. AEG's DM2bn-a-year railways business, forced out of a planned deal with Siemens last year by the Berlin cartel office, still needs more international muscle. Like many other German companies, Daimler has taken advantage of the recession to drive through changes which in better times would have run into severe opposition from the workforce. The result, as for many other listed companies, has been an extraordinary resurgence of investor confidence. The Frankfurt stock exchange's DAX index, which rose around 40 per cent last year, headed ever more sharply upwards from mid-summer as confidence grew that Daimler, the lame duck Volkswagen, the battered chemicals giants and others were coming to grips with their structural problems and could fairly be nominated as 'recovery stocks' with plenty of profit potential. The liveliness of German share prices has admittedly been enhanced by other factors. For example, confidence has been increased by inferences drawn from recent gross national product figures that the west German economy is unlikely to fall any further in the current cycle. The Bundesbank's cautious erosion of interest rates has mobilised funds, and signs that inflation is coming under control give grounds for more optimism. Further impetus has come from large volumes of foreign liquidity, especially from US investors looking to correct their under-weighting in Germany. In sum, the investment community has nominated Germany Incorporated as a holding with 'recovery' written all over it. Many of the blue chip industrial companies expect to be up and running by 1995. But it is as well to remember another portion of the Bayerische Hypo Bank's late-1992 forecast, in which it warned of 'a sword of Damocles' hanging over large swathes of German industry and the banks which finance it. The cost-cutting and rationalisation efforts of the larger groups have created a disruptive backwash through the ranks of small and medium-sized Mittelstand companies which supply the big names with parts and services. Under intense pressure to reduce their prices, many have already gone under and many more are struggling to survive. A measure of the scale of the danger was provided in early December by Mr Hilmar Kopper, chairman of Deutsche Bank, who estimated that 1993 provisions for loan risks would be a record DM3bn. Some 90 per cent of that was required to cover risks within Germany, he said.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- German companies by market capitalisation  -----------------------------------------------------------------------        Company                       Dollars m   FT500 rank    Sector  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  1     Allianz Holding                 30867.4            4       151  2     Siemens                         22650.0           10       541  3     Deutsche Bank                   22586.3           12       112  4     Daimler-Benz                    21344.0           14       401  5     Muenchener Ruckversicherungs    13975.6           27       151  6     Veba                            12381.5           33       171  7     Bayer                           12333.6           34       622  8     Dresdner Bank                   10565.8           50       112  9     Hoechst                          9971.0           55       622 10     RWE                              9133.2           61       221  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 11     BASF                             9064.6           63       622 12     Volkswagen                       6115.2           88       401 13     Mannesmann                       6092.9           89       566 14     Bayerische Vereinsbank           6041.7           94       112 15     Allianz Lebensversicherungs      5894.8           96       151 16     Bayerische Hypo. &amp;

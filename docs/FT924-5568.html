			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / GPT loses market share to Ericsson GPT, Britain's largest tele-communications manufacturer, has lost market share in the latest Pounds 926m batch of orders from British Telecommunications for modernising its network. GPT is still BT's largest supplier, but Sweden's Ericsson has increased its market share. GPT has won Pounds 579m in orders for computerised exchanges and software over the next three years, while Ericsson has won Pounds 346m (figures do not add because of rounding). The bulk of the order placed with Ericsson was made in September. It was increased yesterday from Pounds 250m to Pounds 346m to include software development and support. The orders also represent a decline in BT's investment in exchanges as the company's modernisation programme nears its end, Mr Albert Mandall, GPT's manager for customer communications, said. BT has increased its investment in software.</p>

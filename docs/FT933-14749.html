			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Second time around In the US, failure is often regarded as a learning experience. In the UK even success is no guarantee a businessman can raise finance. In contrast with the US, British venture capitalists make very little use of 'second time entrepreneurs,' businessmen and women who have sold one successful venture and want to move on to a second, according to a study* by the Centre for Management Buy-Out Research. Nearly three-quarters of venture capitalists polled said they would prefer to finance an entrepreneur or a manager who had played a leading role in a previous venture. But only 23 per cent had used a team leader from one of their own investments again. And while 53 per cent used a team leader previously backed by another venture firm these two figures overlapped and total use, as a share of deals completed, was low. The main reason given by venture capitalists was that they could not find suitable candidates. The entrepreneur's experience might be in a different sector or in a much smaller or larger company. Venture capitalists were suspicious that someone who had made one fortune would be insufficiently motivated to do it again. It also emerged that venture capitalists did not actively pursue entrepreneurs who had sold out. Only 17 per cent of venture firms polled evaluated their successful entrepreneurs. But the venture capitalists were not to blame alone. Many entrepreneurs were reluctant to go a second round with the same venture capitalist who had backed them the first time. Also, having made one fortune, the entrepreneur might have less need of venture funds to get started a second time. *Venture Capitalists and Second Time Entrepreneurs. M. Wright and K. Robbie.

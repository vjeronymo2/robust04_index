			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Boris Krivoshey] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 23 Jun -- Russia's unilateral demarcation of  its border with Estonia is a forced measure. This was stated by  Grigoriy Karasin, the director of the information and press  department of the Russian Foreign Ministry, at a briefing today  in connection with President Boris Yeltsin's edict to carry out  measures to mark Russia's state border on its Estonian section  before the Russian-Estonian treaty on the border is concluded.    The edict by the Russian president, he noted, is aimed at  creating conditions for applying the law on the border and  defending Russia's political and economic interests. The lack  of a physical marking of Russia's state border impedes the  application of Russian legislative acts that deal with halting  and punishing violations of the border and with the unsanctioned  movement of various raw materials, including smuggling, across  it, the Foreign Ministry representative said.    The marking by the Russian side of the border, which already  exists, does not contradict either the Helsinki Final Act, or  the treaty on the fundamentals of inter-state relations between  Russia and Estonia of 1991, Karasin stressed. He also expressed  the hope that at the talks between the state delegations on  border issues the Estonian side will occupy a more constructive  position, which would open the way to concluding a treaty on the  Russian-Estonian border.</p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' Transactions TINSLEY Robor, the printing and packaging company, has had a difficult period over the past couple of years, with its share price falling from around 20p to barely 5p. But four members of the board, including a non-executive director, have bought stock at 6p. Shares at Lloyd Thompson, the insurance broker, have recovered steadily since the middle of 1992. Following the announcement of interim results, chairman Peter Lloyd and Richard Corfield, an executive director, sold 500,000 and 300,000 respectively at 280p. Lloyd still retains 3m shares while Corfield has reduced his holding by a quarter. Bemrose Corporation has announced it will complete the acquisition of Bemrose Yattendon, a US joint venture, through a 1-for-2 rights issue at 265p. Robert Iliffe, the principal shareholder in Yattendon and a non-executive director of Bemrose, sold his entire holding in Bemrose at 301p in anticipation of the deal and prior to his intended resignation from the board at an EGM on April 15. Crestacare, in the health and household sector, is involved with providing sheltered accommodation for the elderly. Andrew Taee was appointed recently as chief executive, and he and a non-executive director bought more than 1.78m shares at prices around 32p.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          No of Company              Sector       Shares     Value   directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Admiral                Elns        4,000        14          1 Amersham Intl          Hlth       10,000        72          1* Bemrose Corp           Pack    1,903,551     5,730          1 BPP Holdings           BuSe        4,000        11          1 BTR warrants           OthI        7,754        13          1 Deb Tews &amp; Chinn       Prop       20,540        17          3 Devenish (JA)          Brew        4,750        13          1 Ellis &amp; Everard        Chem        7,864        15          1 Fairey Group           EngG        2,000        13          1 Frogmore Estates       Prop       60,000       230          1* Gent (SR)              Text       25,000        16          1 Inv'gordn Distiller    Brew       11,000        30          1 Lloyd Thompson         InsB      800,000     2,240          2 London Merc Def&amp;Ord    Prop       17,777        14          1 M &amp; W                  FdRe       25,000        28          1 Macallan-Glenlivet     Brew      300,000       540          2 Macro 4                Elns        2,000        13          1 P &amp; O                  Tran       23,938       141          1* Rights &amp; Issues Cap    InTr        6,500        19          1 Schroders              Merc       30,000       435          2* Scottish Natl Zero     InTr        6,250        13          1 Town Centre Sec        Prop       29,000        28          2 Victaulic              EngG        8,500        28          2 Vistec                 Elns    1,400,000       378          1 Wickes                 BdMa      505,000       510          2 Wolstenholme Rink      Chem        4,961        22          1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- APV                    EngG       10,000        10          1 Aukett Associates      Prop      235,000        28          2 CrestaCare             Hlth    1,787,302       566          2 CRP Leisure             C&amp;C    4,666,666        28          2 Culver Holdings        Motr      300,000        23          2 EMAP                    Med        8,500        29          1 Hall Engineering       EngG        8,500        16          1 London &amp; Clydeside      C&amp;C      100,000        55          1 Lucas                  Motr       10,000        13          1 Pilkington             BdMa       10,000        12          1 Reed International      Med        5,000        33          1 Tinsley Robor          Pack      755,000        46          4 United Industries      Metl      106,000        16          2 Wholesale Fittings     Elcs       41,435        96          1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service is not proposing to designate marine areas as critical habitat for the marbled murrelet at this time, but will continue to collect information on threats, the need for marine critical habitat, and the potential benefits of designating marine critical habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Criteria for Identifying Critical Habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several qualitative criteria were considered in the selection of specific areas as critical habitat. These criteria are generally similar to criteria used in the development of several recent Federal management proposals, such as the report prepared by the Scientific Panel (Johnson  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1991) and Alternative 9 (USDA  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1993a). The following is a description of the criteria considered:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Known Occupied Sites: Proposed critical habitat units include the majority of the known sites occupied by marbled murrelets on Federal lands. However, known occupied sites may represent only a small portion of the population due to the limited coverage of past survey efforts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Suitable Nesting Habitat: Proposed critical habitat units include areas with current suitable nesting habitat and other primary constituent elements. Approximately 48 percent of the suitable nesting habitat on Federal lands within the range of the species in Washington, Oregon, and California is included in proposed critical habitat. Forests that are not currently suitable, but which are of similar average height and canopy closure, are also important in improving habitat conditions through reduced fragmentation and creation of large contiguous forest stands that reduce the potential for predation. The total amount of land containing the other primary constituent elements is currently unknown.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Distance from Marine Environment: Marbled murrelets forage daily in the marine environment during the nesting season. To allow for foraging opportunities, nesting habitat must be within the flight capabilities and energetic limits of the species. Proposed critical habitat units were selected based on the distance inland of detections in each general area. As stated above, detections range from over 50 miles from the marine environment in Washington to less than 10 miles in some portions of California.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rangewide Distribution: To reduce the impact of catastrophic losses of habitat or birds and maintain the current distribution of the species, proposed critical habitat units were selected throughout the range of the listed population, where Federal lands were available. With well-distributed critical habitat, the probability of substantial population declines resulting from catastrophic wildfires or storm events is reduced. Maintaining nesting habitat, and therefore local concentrations, throughout the range of the species will reduce potential losses from oil spills or other marine events. Given the intense site fidelity of most alcid species, maintaining rangewide distribution may also provide potential source populations for the recolonization of future habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Large, Contiguous Blocks of Habitat: In response to the problems of fragmentation of suitable habitat, potential increases in predation, and reduced reproductive success, the Service concentrated on selecting proposed critical habitat units in terms of large, contiguous blocks of late-successional, mature, and old-growth forest. To provide large blocks of habitat, the Service concentrated on the Late-Successional Reserve system identified in Alternative 9. Marbled murrelet locations and habitat were considered in the development of these reserves. Where large blocks of Federal reserve areas were not available, but where critical habitat was determined to be important for distribution, smaller Federal reserves were included.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Adequacy of Existing Protection and Management: The Service considered the existing legal status of lands in the decision to propose specific areas as critical habitat. Areas with permanent legal protection, such as congressionally-designated wilderness areas, national parks, and national wildlife refuges, are not proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Results of Applying Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Application of the selection criteria resulted in the proposed designation of many of the Late-Successional Reserves, as described in Alternative 9, on Federal lands within the range of the marbled murrelet in Washington, Oregon, and California.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At this time, only Federal lands are proposed for designation. However, the Forest Ecosystem Management Assessment Team recognized the limited ability of Federal agencies to recover this species on Federal lands. ``Although the Forest Ecosystem Management Assessment was designed to address only Federal lands within the range of the northern spotted owl, the marbled murrelet is an example of a species whose life history requirements cannot be accommodated only on Federal lands. The marbled murrelet is a seabird that nests inland and therefore is influenced by both the marine and terrestrial environments. Its nesting range in the three-state area includes land that is south of the range of the northern spotted owl. In addition, several areas that are considered key to the recovery of the marbled murrelet involve private and State lands'' (FEMAT Report at IV&hyph;151 and IV&hyph;152, USDA  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1993a). For example, the southernmost portion of the range of the marbled murrelet in California, southwest Washington, and northwest Oregon contain little or no Federal lands or habitat capable of supporting marbled murrelets. The Service currently lacks sufficient information to fully identify any specific non-Federal lands essential to the conservation of the species in these and other areas. The Service will continue to gather information on non-Federal land contributions to conservation and through this notice is requesting comments on this subject.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Lands Not Proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Not all suitable nesting habitat is included within the proposed critical habitat units. Emphasis has been placed on those areas considered most essential to the species in terms of habitat, distribution, and ownership. That does not mean that lands outside critical habitat are not important to the marbled murrelet. Some Federal lands outside of critical habitat are expected to receive additional protection from the conservation measures proposed in Alternative 9. Some habitat on non-Federal lands receives protection through prohibitions against take of marbled murrelets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

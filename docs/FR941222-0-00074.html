			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In arguing to the contrary, our colleagues rely upon  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Jumbo Produce,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 294 NLRB 998. However, that case is readily distinguishable. In that case, the judge made an oral evidentiary ruling on a single issue. He did not rule on the entire case. Indeed, the Board specifically noted this in distinguishing its earlier ruling in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local Union 195.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> See 294 NLRB at 999 n.4. We have no quarrel with the traditional practice under which judges issue bench rulings on evidentiary issues. But the instant rule goes far beyond that. It gives the judge the power to orally decide the entire case. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We recognize that, in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local Union 195,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the judge did not read any findings and conclusions into the record. However, in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Plastic Film Products,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the judge did precisely that. Notwithstanding this, the Board found that the judge's decision violated Section 10(c) of the Act. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Member Stephens finds the construction of Section 10(c) by the majority in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Plastic Film Products Corp.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> highly questionable, but he agrees that it at least presents an additional issue that parties might raise in the courts when seeking review of cases decided by bench rulings. As we argue below, to the extent that further grounds for appellate litigation are provided, the asserted delay-minimizing objective of the rule is undermined. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In sum, the rules are at odds with Board law. Our colleagues, in apparent recognition of this fact, overrule Board law to the extent necessary to accomplish their purpose. However, they set forth no rationale for this result other than the assertion that the cases are based on a ``misreading'' of Section 10(c). They offer no support for this sweeping assertion. Further, they may not have the power to overrule the extant cases. If the Board was correct in the prior cases, i.e., if Congress did indeed intend to preclude bench decisions in enacting Section 10(c), then the Board is simply without authority to establish a rule to the contrary. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 467 U.S. 837, 842&hyph;43 (1984) (where intent of Congress is clear, agency must give effect to that intent). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the Board has now declared that it has the power to issue the rule, that declaration will not end the matter. The statutory issue will undoubtedly be the subject of extended litigation in the federal courts. Thus, for this reason as well as other reasons described  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> infra,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the rule is at cross-purposes with its stated goal: to expedite the final resolution of unfair labor practice cases. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Policy Considerations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We do not rest entirely, or even principally, on the statutory issue. Quite apart from the statutory issue, we oppose, for policy reasons, the provisions giving ALJs the power to issue bench decisions and the related power to dispense with written briefs. In our view, the rules sacrifice fundamental fairness, procedural due process and high-quality decisionmaking. This sacrifice is said to be in the interest of speed. However, we are not convinced that the rules will result in any overall savings of time. More importantly, to the extent that they might save some time, the price is simply too high. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We first address the rule concerning briefs. Underlying much of our concern about this rule is one critical fact: NLRB proceedings are conducted without pre-trial discovery. Thus, far from involving a rehash of previous deposition testimony and jousting over the significance of documents long ago made available to the opposing side, Board trials typically represent the first occasion on which the parties learn the details of their opponent's case. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  Notwithstanding this fact, the rule would require counsel, promptly upon the close of evidence, to marshal the pertinent facts, spot all the factual and legal issues, cite the relevant authority, and articulate policy concerns_all in a cogent and organized fashion. In our view, even the ablest of counsel cannot be expected to do an effective job under these circumstances. Moreover, as some of the comments on the proposed rules have pointed out, <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  counsel for respondents will be at a distinct disadvantage under this scheme. Armed with the information gathered in the pre-complaint investigation, the General Counsel is in a much better position than respondent's counsel to plot out in advance an oral presentation of the facts and the law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As noted  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> infra,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> the General Counsel will ordinarily have some prior knowledge of the specifics of the respondent's case, with the extent of that knowledge varying with the degree of cooperation extended by the respondent during the pre-complaint investigation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See comments of Thomas A. Lenz (Atkinson, Andelson, Loya, Ruud &amp; Romo) at 2; William K. Harvey (Jackson, Shields, Yeiser &amp; Cantrell) at 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The rule is otherwise flawed. Although it provides for a ``reasonable period'' for oral argument, it does not provide such a period for the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> preparation  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> of the argument. Further, even if a judge granted such a period, that would not cure the fundamental defect in this provision. A recess period is simply no substitute for the time-honored practice of reading the transcript, researching the issues by use of a library and computer technology, reflecting upon the law and the facts, and writing a cogent, organized and persuasive brief. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Requiring counsel to throw together a presentation at the close of the trial also creates a real danger that relevant points will be overlooked. The consequences of any such omission or oversight can be severe. If a party fails to raise a point before the ALJ, it may well have waived its right to raise that issue before the Board. See, e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local 520, IUOE (Mautz &amp; Oren, Inc.) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 298 NLRB 1098, 1098 n.3 (1990);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hydro Logistics, Inc.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 287 NLRB 602, n.1 (1987). Issues not raised before the Board, of course, cannot ordinarily be raised on appeal. See NLRB Section 10(e). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For all of the reasons discussed above, we believe that dispensing with briefs is fundamentally unfair to the participants in Board proceedings. We further believe that this practice will erode the quality of decision-making by ALJs. As any decision-maker can attest, the decisional process is greatly facilitated by access to thorough and competent written arguments on both sides of the issue. Substituting hasty and perhaps ill-considered oral presentations for written briefs cannot help but make the job of the ALJ more difficult, as well as that of the Board members and federal judges who must review the ALJ's decision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

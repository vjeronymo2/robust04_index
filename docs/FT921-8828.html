			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Spending on training 'to be cut by Pounds 170m' SPENDING PLANS for the Department of Employment for the next three financial years, published yesterday, confirm that cuts in spending on training in real terms will be about Pounds 170m next year. Overall spending for the department next year will rise nearly Pounds 0.5bn to Pounds 3.8bn for England and Wales. The department will spend Pounds 2.7bn on training and vocational education and nearly Pounds 1bn on the Employment Service next year. Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, said that in real terms Youth Training (YT) would be cut by Pounds 50m next year and Employment Training, for the adult unemployed, would be cut by Pounds 60m. The department did not question those figures but said the reduction in YT budgets reflected reduced demand as a result of a slight increase to 61 per cent in the school stay-on rate for 16-year-olds next year. The reduction in ET is the result of studies by the department which show that not all unemployed people require training. The department and Labour also clashed over the interpretation of figures relating to the Employment Action programme, the emergency make-work scheme for the un-employed, which should provide 60,000 places in 1992-93 at a cost of Pounds 170m. Mr Blair said the scheme was a dismal failure and had attracted only 8,200 people. The department said the figure at the end of January was 8,500, which represented a large rise on the figure of 5,130 at the end of December. The department confirmed yesterday that some jobs are likely to be cut as a result of the Styles review of the Employment Service, which employs nearly 50,000 people at Jobcentres and benefit offices. However, it described union fears of 1,000 job cuts as 'speculation'.</p>

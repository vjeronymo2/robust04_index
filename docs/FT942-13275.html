			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / People: Sir Brian Pearse adds Lucas to his bow Few bright stars seemed to be around last year to attract Lucas Industries in its quest for a successor to longstanding chairman and chief executive Sir Anthony Gill. 'So who'd have thought we would wind up with the chairman of Rover and the chief executive of Midland Bank?' one senior manager said last night. He was commenting on yesterday's announcement that Sir Brian Pearse, Midlands' chief executive until he retired at the end of March, is to become the motor components to aerospace group's chairman next month. Unlike Sir Anthony, who has combined both the chairman's and chief executive's roles in grappling with Lucas' efforts to adapt to the globalisation of its main industry customers, Sir Brian's post will be strictly non-executive. Very much a city figure, he is likely to be seen as a near-ideal complement to George Simpson, the former Rover vehicles group chairman. Simpson, a dyed-in-the-wool motor industry figure given most of the credit for Rover's renaissance, has been quietly getting his feet under the new chief executive's desk at Lucas' Birmingham headquarters since earlier this month. That is a lot later than Sir Anthony himself had earlier hoped - but made unavoidable by Simpson's having to deal with Rover's sale to BMW. It is now expected that Sir Anthony will undertake a staged hand-over to Simpson and Sir Brian, thus paving the way for his final departure from Lucas around the time of the annual general meeting in November. Lucas will be far from the only string to Sir Brian's bow. Among a number of directorships and honorary posts, he was recently appointed chairman of the Housing Corporation and of British Invisibles. He is also president of the Chartered Institute of Bankers and treasurer of King's College, London University.</p>

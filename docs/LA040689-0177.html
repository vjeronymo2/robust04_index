			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SIMMONS CUTS HIS LOCKHEED STAKE TO 4.2%  </P> <P> Harold C. Simmons, the corporate raider who disclosed only Monday that he held  a 5.3% stake in Lockheed, sold off 200,000 shares Tuesday, cutting his  ownership to 4.2%.  </P> <P> Simmons had reacted negatively to a restructuring announced by the big  aerospace firm Tuesday, in which the firm created an employee stock ownership  plan and accelerated plans to sell certain assets.  </P> <P> In an interview Tuesday after the New York Stock Exchange closed, Simmons said:  "I am considering selling some or all of my stock."  </P> <P> Indeed. At the time of the interview, Simmons had apparently already sold two  blocks of 100,000 shares each, one for $48.75 a share and the other for $48.87  a share for a total of $9.8 million, according to a filing with the Securities  and Exchange Commission.  </P> <P> When Simmons disclosed his 5.3% holding in Lockheed, some analysts expected  that it might prompt a restructuring.  </P> <P> Lockheed Chairman Daniel M. Tellep said Tuesday that the company already had  that idea and had been planning the overhaul since last fall. According to  Lockheed, it was a coincidence that Simmons' disclosure was made the day before  Lockheed planned to announce its restructuring, which will result in employees  obtaining a 17% share of the company.  </P> <P> "If they're giving stock to the employees, that's obviously not good for the  public shareholders," Simmons said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Since his holdings have fallen below the 5% mark, Simmons is no longer required  to disclose his actions with regard to Lockheed, headquartered in Calabasas.  </P> <P> Simmons' disclosure of his Lockheed holdings on Monday sent the share price up  $3, but the stock dropped back $2 on Monday. It closed Wednesday at $46.675,  down another $1.125.  </P></p>

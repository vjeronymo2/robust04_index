			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- The Transport Ministry said  Wednesday it has granted Chrysler Corp.'s four-wheel drive  "Cherokee" model a type certificate that allows the U.S. car  maker to sell more than 2,000 cars of the model a year in Japan.    Ministry officials said there have been three models of  American cars granted the certificate, with a condition that  sales agents remodel the cars after importing to ensure they  meet Japan's industrial standards.    This time, however, no such condition was given on the  Cherokees, they said.    Currently, Chrysler plans to sell some 7,000 Cherokee model  cars on the Japanese market at about 3 million to 3.73 million  yen per unit.    In line with its domestic industrial and safety standards,  Japan sets standards for goods to be imported to Japan.    It has been charged by other countries, including the United  States, that the system is a nontariff trade barrier.    The ministry sent officials to the U.S. to deliver the  certificate to Chrysler and to visit other manufacturers such as  General Motors Corp. to explain the nature of the system and  requirements for obtaining the certificate, officials said.</p>

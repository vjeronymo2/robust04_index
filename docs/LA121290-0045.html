			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MALE PROSTITUTE, 29, ACQUITTED IN SLAYING  </P> <P> An admitted male prostitute accused of killing a man who picked him up in  Hollywood last year was acquitted on a murder charge Tuesday by jurors who said  they thought he acted in self-defense.  </P> <P> Jonathan Nichols, 29, was on trial for the December, 1989, death of Edward  Parsley, 52, who was fatally stabbed in his Sylmar residence.  </P> <P> Nichols said he stabbed Parsley after the man threatened to beat him and turn  his dogs on him because he refused to allow Parsley to sodomize him.  </P> <P> Parsley was stabbed several times in the back and shoulder with a kitchen knife  early Dec. 9.  </P> <P> Nichols wept and laid his head against Deputy Public Defender David Coleman's  shoulder as the court clerk read the jury's verdict.  </P> <P> Jurors said outside the courtroom they believed Coleman's argument that Nichols  was justified in killing Parsley because he feared for his life. They also said  they were swayed by Nichols' testimony in the case.  </P> <P> "He did have a reason to fear that he was in danger," juror Wanda Demetrion of  Sylmar said.  </P></p>

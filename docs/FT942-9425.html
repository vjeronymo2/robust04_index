			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Credit cards Despite the stirrings of competition, credit cards are still a lucrative business for Barclays and National Westminster who together control around half the market. Both still charge annualised percentage rates around 22 per cent even though base rates are only 5.25 per cent. Newcomers have failed so far to make significant inroads. Save &amp; Prosper, whose APR is only 13.9 per cent, has less than 1 per cent of the market, though it has been selective in targeting customers. But the GM Card has attracted 350,000 customers in the space of a few months. The big issuers would be rash to assume their profits are secure. High margins and low barriers to entry mean credit card companies must be vulnerable to competitive attack. Part of the trouble has been inertia on the part of consumers, who tend simply to look to their existing bank to provide a card. Gradually that is starting to change as brands proliferate. GM's role is important in this regard as is that of niche operators like Bank of Scotland who promote affinity cards. It is behind the card issued by The Sunday Times, for example. It may take only a spot of aggressive marketing for the stranglehold of the big two to be broken and pricing to crumble. It would make sense for Mr Peter Wood of Direct Line, the Royal Bank of Scotland's insurance subsidiary, to take a serious look. Direct Line has the necessary expertise in marketing, cheap processing and risk analysis. It is already spreading its wings into household insurance, consumer loans and mortgages. If he went into credit cards too, Mr Wood could easily do to that industry what he has done to motor insurance.</p>

In an inspection tour of Shanxi Province from January 29  until today, Jiang, also general secretary of the Central  Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, said that the party's  fundamental aim and basic line is to be concerned for the  people, to rely on the people and serve the people.    He urged leading officials at various levels and the party  members to remember that people are the real heroes of history  and work sincerely for their interest so as to promote  development of socialist cause with Chinese characteristics.    Jiang Zemin, who is also chairman of the Central Military  Commission, visited villages in mountain areas, some old  revolutionary bases, schools, factories and military troops.    In Xingxian county, he said that New China was founded by  the  older revolutionary generation. The party and government should  bear them in mind and uphold the revolutionary martyrs' spirit  so as to revitalize the region of the old revolutionary bases.    He specially urged village leaders to take good care of the  poor.    He said that as long as officials keep the poverty-stricken  areas in mind and share the comforts and hardships of the  masses, adhere to Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics and to the party's basic line, the  backward conditions in the poverty-stricken areas will be  removed.    He said that China should make efforts to uproot poverty by  the end of this century. Solution of the question of rights of  subsistance of the Chinese people which account for one quarter  of the world population is an important event not only in  history of the Chinese nation but also in history of the whole  human race.    He noted that the development of stability of the vast rural  areas plays a vital role in the development and stability in the  whole country and the whole of society.    He said that it is always an unswerving task to strengthen  China's agricultural basis. He called for setting great store  by grain, cotton and edible-oil production.    At Qiaoli village in Linfen city, Jiang talked with Wang  Yunkang, secretary of a party branch of the village, and he  spoke highly of his work in leading people to common wealth.    He said that the key question in the work of grass-root  units  in rural areas is to set up a competent party branch.    He said that the party committees and governments at all  levels should enhance construction of leaderships and improve  working style.    Accompanied by Hu Fuguo, secretary of Shanxi Provincial  party  committee, and Sun Wensheng, acting governor of Shanxi Province,  Jiang inspected some capital projects for water and soil  conservation, highways for transporting coal and an irrigation  project on the Yellow River.    He said that in construction of some projects, volunteer  labor programs should be advocated among officials and workers  of all trades.    He said: "That is the concrete display of stressing  socialist politics and the party's fine tradition."    On the question of state-owned enterprises, Jiang said that  in the development of the socialist market economy, the strength  of state-owned enterprises should be enhanced.    He called on the enterprises carefully to control the assets  and properties of the state, and further to transform management  systems, to regulate industrial set-ups and establish a modern  enterprise system.    In his tour, Jiang Zemin paid special attention to rural  education, especially the schooling conditions in mountain  areas. Whenever he arrived at a village, he went to see  kindergartens, primary schools and middle schools, and he  affirmed Shanxi's progress in carrying out the hope project to  help the drop-outs return to school in poverty-stricken areas.    He reiterated that in the final analysis, economic and  social  development in China depend on the quality of Chinese people and  the development level of science and culture.    He said that to ignore education is short-sighted and  dangerous.    He urged the rural areas to develop education services so as  to cultivate more talents at primary and secondary level for  economic development in rural areas.    Jiang Zemin also invited some celebrated national model  workers to attend a forum to listen to people's opinions and he  went to visit some units of the People's Liberation Army.</p>

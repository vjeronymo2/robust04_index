			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Personal View: Party politics of growth UK politicians have recently begun debating the economic theory of 'endogenous growth'. For a visiting economist from the US, it is hard to know which side in the discussion to prefer. The Labour party's shadow chancellor, Gordon Brown, seems serious in his attempts to understand and apply the idea. However, he uses it in a confused way to rationalise government intervention in the economy. On the government side, chancellor Kenneth Clarke dwells on the funny sound of endogenous growth and depicts it as some sort of econo-babble that he need not try to understand. I suppose if it really were 'indigenous growth', as he recently joked, he would be correct. With some temerity, I venture to explain the origins of endogenous growth and its relation to the older neoclassical theory of economic growth. The neoclassical model, developed in the 1950s and 1960s, assumed that technological change was needed if growth of income per head were to be sustained in the long run. Without it, growth would slow as the returns on capital such as machines, buildings or skills diminished. The rate of technological progress, however, could not be explained by the theory, so it was treated as an exogenous influence. This was not as a matter of principle but because the necessary theoretical advances had not been made. As a consequence, the economy's long-run growth rate was exogenous: the theory could not explain what drove it. There was a role in the neo-classical model for investment and government policy in stimulating economic growth. Growth can be increased for a long time by more investment and better policies such as lower marginal tax rates, more productive infrastructure, better enforcement of laws and contracts, price stability. But in the very long run, the neoclassical theory cannot explain what drives growth. In the late 1980s, Paul Romer, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, came up with a theory that appeared to explain the factors behind technological advance. He postulated that it was commercial research and development which led to the discovery and adoption of new technologies, products and ideas. By explaining the rate of technological progress in economic terms, the factors behind a country's long-run growth rate were endogenous, contained within the model. A crucial element in technological progress in this theory was the reward given to innovators. In the absence of some prize, would-be entrepreneurs have no incentive to carry out costly and often unsuccessful research projects. Typically, the reward is a temporary period of monopoly power, during which a new product or the fruits of an improved technology can be priced above the competitive level. This process is clear for pharmaceuticals, where discoveries are protected for a period by patenting - a fact that appears to escape US health reformers such as Hillary Clinton. She wants to force competition on pharmaceuticals companies that produce successful drugs without worrying about whether any new drugs would ever be developed. In Romer's model, the growth rate may be lower than is desirable and there may be a role for government in promoting growth. Many observers have taken this conclusion as a licence to advocate government intervention, such as trade restrictions, support for favoured industries and regulation of the labour market. In fact, the main policy implications from the endogenous growth model are that the government should support basic research (especially that by economists at American universities]) and take a more favourable view of monopoly in high-growth sectors. Some analysis by endogenous growth theorists suggests that many kinds of government intervention - such as industrial policies aimed at picking and subsidising technological winners, distortions of international trade, and restrictions of labour markets - are especially damaging because they reduce long-term growth rates. Endogenous growth theory cannot be used to justify minimum wage rates, strong labour unions, housing subsidies or large welfare payments. From an empirical standpoint, the most successful framework for understanding growth has proved to be a combination of the new, endogenous growth theory with the older, neoclassical model. The new theory explains the growth performance of technological leaders; in particular, why these countries - and therefore the world as a whole - can grow for very long periods without tending to slow down. The older model shows how lagging countries can catch up by accumulating capital and copying the new technologies developed elsewhere. Statistical analysis of data from about 100 countries from 1960 to 1990 reveals a number of variables that influence the growth rate of real GDP per head. The growth rate tends to be higher if the government protects property rights, maintains free markets and spends little on non-productive consumption. Also helpful are high levels of human capital in the forms of education and health, and low fertility rates. More public investment in infrastructure such as transport and communications may be useful. But the present evidence indicates that returns are typically no higher than those from private investment. If two countries pursue similar policies, the country that starts with a lower level of real GDP per head is likely to grow faster. In other words, if a poor country can maintain good policies and accumulate a reasonable level of human capital, then it tends to catch up with the richer countries (as has happened with east Asian tigers such as South Korea and Taiwan). However, countries are likely to remain poor if their governments distort markets and fail to maintain property rights. Overall, the new theory and empirical work on economic growth supports the general thrust of the economic policies such as privatisation and deregulation undertaken by the Tories during their long tenure in office. Thus, it is all the more surprising that chancellor Clarke chooses to ridicule this recent research with anti-intellectual jokes. Even worse are the remarks of UK trade and industry secretary Michael Heseltine, who apparently referred to endogenous growth as Balls, in a reference to Edward Balls, Gordon Brown's economic adviser. I suppose that I will never understand British humour. The author is professor of economics at Harvard University, currently on leave as Houblon-Norman Research Fellow at the Bank of England</p>

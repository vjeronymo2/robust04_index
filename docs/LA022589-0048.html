			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TELEVISION REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> 'REVENGE OF CAPONE' RIDDLED WITH CLICHES  </P> <P> "The Revenge of Al Capone" (Sunday at 9 p.m. on Channels 4, 36 and 39), a new  made-for-TV movie, takes up where the hit theatrical film "The Untouchables"  left off -- with the heinous title gangster on his way to a stiff prison  sentence on a tax evasion rap.  </P> <P> It seems, however, that not even prison will stop Capone's reign of terror in  the Chicago underworld, as old Scarface himself continues to rule the mob with  an iron fist from his rather unsupervised prison digs. Who will step into the  fray and stop the madness? Good old Eliot Ness, we presume?  </P> <P> Wrong, Uzi-breath. This is a TV ratings "sweeps" period, after all, and Ness'  sacrosanct popular legend is just a tad too squeaky-clean to allow him to play  protagonist when teaser commercials full of steamy sex are what's called for.  Thus, in this version of the tale, Ness (played by Scott Paulin) is only a  supporting character -- and seen as an uptight, by-the-rules sycophant of J.  Edgar Hoover whose "prima donna" rigidity stands in the way of true justice.  </P> <P> The "real" hero: Fellow Treasury Dept. special agent Michael Rourke (Keith  Carradine), who is no less righteous in his abhorrence of corruption but who  isn't above jumping into the sack with a seemingly sweet gun moll (Debrah  Farentino) for a little prime-time adultery. Rourke will pay for his  indiscretion, of course, but not before the ratings points are in.  </P> <P> "Revenge" intends to be taken as ironic romantic tragedy as well as bloody  gangland saga, and comes up short all over. In Tracy Keenan Wynn's perfunctory  script (directed by Michael Pressman), Rourke's deteriorating marriage and  family life is sketched in much the same way as his blossoming affair with a  speakeasy hostess: briefly, and entirely in cliches.  </P> <P> What's most needed, of course, is a galvanizing Capone capable of inspiring  obsession on either side of the law -- a la the bat-wielding Robert De Niro of  "The Untouchables." What's offered is appropriately rabid but never believable  scenery-chewing from Ray Sharkey. This Capone -- especially in his last,  disease-ravaged days, which frame the film's flashbacks -- resembles nothing so  much as John Belushi's or Chris Elliott's late-night comedy takes on Brando.  </P> <P> "Revenge" is an offer that can be refused.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["True Picture of 'Upright Politics'" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 4 (KCNA) -- MINJU CHOSON today  comments on the fact that the traitor Kim Yong-sam raked up a  fabulous amount of political fund around the "presidential  elections" at the end of 1992.    The news analyst says:    At the time of the "presidential elections" Kim Hyon-chol,  the second son of Kim Yong-sam, received 120 million won from  traditional medicine manufacturers through lawyer Yi Chun-pom  and wrote a memorandum promising them to resolve their "civil  petition."    The opposition parties contend that Kim Hyon-chol's name was  inscribed on the bills that Yi Chun-pom received and they were  offered as fund for "presidential elections", not as lawyer's  fees.    This shows what base means the traitor Kim Yong-sam employed  in collecting political funds, mobilizing even his son behind  the scene, while publicly promising that he would not receive  political funds and would pursue "no costly politics" at the  time of the "presidential elections."    An opposition party of South Korea is demanding  "parliamentary investigation into state policies" and an  explanation by the "president" for the clarification of the  truth, saying that eight billion won of the 22,700 million won  of secret fund created by the Chongu Construction Company which  undertook the transfer of the Sangmudae Training Center found  its way into the "Democratic Liberal Party" of Kim Yong-sam on  the threshold of the "presidential elections."    The scandal of Kim Hyon-chol and the political fund scandal  involving the Sangmudae prove once again that the traitor Kim  Yong-sam bought the "presidential" seat with political fund.    It is shameless of Kim Yong-sam to advertise "upright  politics."    A true upright politics can be realised only when the  money-lover Kim Yong-sam is ousted and an independent democratic  government is established.</p>

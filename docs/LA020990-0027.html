			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CATALINA GOATS  </P> <P> The Catalina Conservancy should be commended for its recent efforts to reduce  the feral goat population on Santa Catalina Island. Despite the fact that this  program is long overdue, it is no less welcome.  </P> <P> After decades of overpopulation, feral mammals, including pigs, bison, deer,  and the goats, have turned most of Santa Catalina into a lunar landscape. It is  obvious to anyone flying over the Channel Islands that Santa Catalina is easily  the most ecologically degraded of the entire group. The inevitable result of  passive management of such mammal populations in the absence of natural  predators is the extinction of the native species of plants and animals and,  ultimately, the agonizing starvation of the feral mammals themselves.  </P> <P> I am hopeful that the Conservancy's recent goat removal program is the  precursor of organized efforts to eliminate all exotic mammals from Santa  Catalina. Perhaps it finally signals recognition by the Conservancy of its  moral obligation to restore the ecological integrity of this special island.  </P> <P> LLOYD KIFF  </P> <P> Director, Western Foundation  </P> <P> of Vertebrate Zoology  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 23 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  was reported in Tokyo and Beijing Wednesday as having said that  he hopes to hold in-depth discussions on the North Korean  nuclear problem with the leaders of Japan and China during his  official visits to the two countries.    Kim also said South Korea would support any decision reached  by the United Nations Security Council on North Korea.    Kim made the remarks at a press conference Tuesday for  Japanese and Chinese correspondents stationed in Seoul as he  prepared for the visits beginning Thursday.    The president noted that the North Korean nuclear issue is  important to Japan, and that China supported denuclearization of  the Korean peninsula.    Kim stressed that the opinions of the three countries are  basically identical, both Japanese and Chinese press reported  Wednesday.    China's XINHUA news agency quoted Kim as saying he hoped  that  his visits to the two countries would serve as a turning point  in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue and in realizing  peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and unification of  Korea.    Turning to threats by the chief North Korean delegate to the  inter-Korean contact last Saturday that Seoul will turn into a  sea of fire if war breaks out, Kim said any North Korean  provocation would be headed off as South Korea is strong and the  Seoul-Washington security system is flawless.    The president pointed out that North Korea first proposed an  exchange of special envoys. However, it may not happen any time  soon as Pyongyang has set various conditions, Kim said.    When the North Koreans walked out of the inter-Korean  working-level contact last Saturday, the rupture was intentional  since their chief delegate read a statement from a prepared  text, Kim told interviewers.    Aside from the nuclear issue, Kim said economic cooperation  and development of trade ties between Seoul and Tokyo and Seoul  and Beijing will top the agenda during his visits.    In particular, Kim said he hoped economic relations with  China will develop further as a result of his Beijing visit,  noting that the two countries are already conducting exchanges  in every field.    The president said he is convinced that Seoul-Beijing  cooperation will contribute greatly to the peace and stability  of the Northeast Asian region.    With regard to Japanese Emperor Akihito coming to Seoul, Kim  said this would occur when mutual understanding deepened and the  Korean and Japanese people accepted it. Kim thus hinted that  Akihito could visit Seoul during his term in office.</p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Observer: Pohl in person Karl Otto Pohl, the former Bundesbank president who quit in 1991 after a row with Chancellor Helmut Kohl and who these days runs pukka private bank Sal Oppenheim, likes to keep his head below the parapet. Today and tomorrow, however, he has been persuaded to air a 'personal view' of international monetary policy in two Lionel Robbins memorial lectures at the London School of Economics. Diplomacy will probably prevent Pohl dwelling on two of the more prescient warnings of his Buba presidency. In his dispute with Kohl over the costs of German reunification, Pohl's forebodings have proved all too correct - something which still rankles with Kohl. Again, when Britain joined the ERM, Pohl personally told John Major (then chancellor of the exchequer) that the chosen exchange rate for sterling against the D-Mark was too high - a forecast in which he has also been vindicated. But the former central banker hardly needs to blow his own trumpet anyway, for he is already viewed with a degree of awe in London, not least at the Bank of England. Andrew Crockett, the Bank's international director, due to be officially confirmed today as the new general manager of the Bank for International Settlements, once even thought aloud that Pohl could take a seat on the future board of an independent UK central bank. A pipe dream, perhaps, but two years after he stepped down from the Bundesbank hot seat, the City has probably not seen the last of Karl Otto.</p>

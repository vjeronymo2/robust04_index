			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by al-Shaykh 'Ali al-'Ujayli: "Our Enemies and the </F> Historic Mistake"]    [Text] In his speech to commanders on Army Day, leader  President Saddam Husayn emphasized several sensitive points. He  said: Having given up on the possibility of achieving a  military victory; having used their air force and guided  missiles for months without being able to shake up our domestic  front despite the enormous destruction they caused to our  lifelines; having discovered that a ground war, if attempted,  would result in a great disaster for them; and having watched  the Iraqis occupy al-Khafji without air cover, the enemies  resorted to treachery and treason. They turned to the Iranian  regime of ayatollahs that has raised the slogan of war against  the arch satan in order to mislead the simpletons and to pretend  that it is not in league with the arch satan and, in fact, with  all the satans in the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf. The  Iranian rulers have carried out this disgraceful act, despite  all its meanness, deception, and betrayal of a Muslim neighbor,  in order to support the unjust infidel and to seek revenge from  Iraq for defeating them and foiling their plans in the second  al-Qadisiyah [Iraq-Iran war] -- hence their inferiority complex.    The leader president commented on that by saying: Withdrawal  from Kuwait was not within our plans, if it had not for that  treachery. We wanted to deprive the enemies of any opportunity  to undermine the domestic front, which was our main concern. As  for the question of fighting the enemies, that was something  else. If circumstances did not let us fight the enemies outside  the border, we were ready to fight them inside Iraq. We planned  to draw them into the cities, and thus foil their plans against  our domestic front.    So the enemies know the secret of Iraqi steadfastness. It is  the solid domestic front, which our wise leadership has  considered the main base. It is, in fact, the object and means  of the revolution and its ambitious programs. When the enemies  realized their treachery had little effect by any military  standards -- it certainly failed in its strategic aim to  overthrow the regime and to establish a foothold on our land --  they declared a unilateral cease-fire, thereby acknowledging  their military and political defeat despite all the  international mobilization and the propaganda campaign which  carried on for 400 [as published] hours daily.    Since the enemies can justify their premeditated action in  using Iran to carry out their treachery -- in view of their  well-known baseness since the days of Khalid Bin-al-Walid and  Salah al-Din's encounter with the Crusaders, Iran will not be  able to justify its action. The enemies are infidels who claim  no religion or mission. But what do the ayatollahs, who are  entrenched in the vestibules of trickery, have to say when they  claim to be faithful and good Muslims, who uphold the values and  ethics of the chaste imams?!!    Due to their strong disappointment, the treacherous used  their lackeys, those rotten head traitors, to establish a new  situation in northern Iraq that was bound to disappear, and to  divide Iraq into small sectarian or ethnic states, so it would  be easy for them to control its resources and to end the blessed  revolution march of the Ba'th Party and its masses.    If we go back to enemy plans and designs we will discover  that they had indeed planned for such a situation. They knew  that a military victory over Iraq was an impossibility. So they  pinned their hopes on their agents here and there to carry out  the plan of splitting Iraq and turning it into another Lebanon.    There are several points in common between the al-Sa'ud  family and the Tehran regime, whether they conduct their  relations openly or secretly -- "the claimants of religion" in  Riyadh are of a Jewish descent dating back to 'Abdallah  Ibn-Saba, who extended a secret hand to the Persian Mazdaist Abu  Lu'lu'ah Fayruz [name as published] in order to stab the Caliph  Faruq for a cause that was more than personal.    Historical documents prove the al-Sa'ud are nothing more  than  a guided tool in the hand of the foreigner, and that Iran had  never been ruled by a ruler who was sincere to Islam or friendly  to the Arabs. The al-Sa'ud cannot also be dissociated from  Zionist Jewish policy. One can trace that by considering their  common attitude, as well as their independent stands, toward the  Ottoman position on the Palestine question.    Put simply, the al-Sa'ud are in full harmony with all or  most  of the Zionist Protocols. A book published by Ahmad Baha'  al-Din in 1967 under the title: "Israiliyat" contains all the  details of this harmonious relationship.    All historical documents show the al-Sa'ud were never a  party  to any sincere Arab plan that was hostile to Jews, imperialism,  and Zionism. Whenever they were forced, they simply promised,  but they never fulfilled their promise.    In fact, the al-Sa'ud's history shows their hatred to Arab  nationalism. We have all read about their armed raids and  attacks on Arab tribes in the Arabian Peninsula, Iraq, Syria,  and Yemen. Even the Gulf sheikhdoms and the al-Sabah of Kuwait  know that, and hold memories of stands which may not be clear to  the reader now.    The al-Sa'ud attacked Yemen in 1934. Their position on  Jamal 'Abd al-Nasir's intervention in Yemen and their secret  involvement in the June 1967 setback are well known. Their  relationship with Egypt only deepened after 'Abd al-Nasir's  departure.    Here is Henry Kissinger explaining to us the roles played by  the agents in the region. In an article in THE WASHINGTON POST  published in August 1992, Kissinger says: The climate in the  Middle East became good and suitable for a settlement  satisfactory to Israel after the following:    -- The collapse of the USSR.    -- The destruction of Iraqi power. Kissinger points out that  Iraqi power did not represent one country but a whole nation. He  also referred to the Iraqi role in 1967 and 1973. He declared  that the agents in Saudi Arabia were a great support for what  had happened. They asked the United States in 1967 to direct a  blow to 'Abd al-Nasir. The also instigated the aggression  against Iraq and allocated "$700 billion" [as published] as a  minimum sum for the costs of the aggression.    It has been proven that the Saudi Government told criminal  Bush that it would revamp its military establishment after the  Gulf War by spending sums to the tune of $12 billion, and that  criminal Bush convinced the Congress to sell 72 F-15, 18 F-15E,  and 24 F-15H aircraft to Saudi Arabia to make it the central  Arab power in the post-war period to help achieve the short-term  and strategic aims of the imperialist-Zionist plan. As for the  liberation of Palestine, it is an empty slogan which the  al-Sa'ud have made meaningless.    The roles of the Iranian Persian side and the al-Sa'ud  side, which is of Jewish lineage and spirit, may appear  contradictory on the outside, but they are harmonious in  substance, aim, and purpose. The Khomeynite phenomenon raised  the slogan of "exporting the revolution" to eliminate the Arab  national identity, and the al-Sa'ud Wahhabist Movement sought to  divide the nation for the sake of its common interests with the  covetous foreign infidel.    When the leader president referred to the historic mistake  --  telling Iraqi commanders on Army Day this year that Iraq did not  commit a historic mistake during the Gulf War -- he wanted to  draw a clear line between our principles that are reinforced by  noble values, and enemy stands that are full of falsehood,  deception, and evil cunning. The stands were historic mistakes  in part and parcel, and in intention, action, thought, and  reality. Throughout the years, the enemies have been committing  mistakes history has recorded against them. It is as if they  are born with a stigma on their foreheads, a lineage stigma of  meanness and villainy carried from generation to generation.    Perhaps, time and some form of self re-examination will  enable those who forgot or pretended to forget to learn the  lesson of history.</p>

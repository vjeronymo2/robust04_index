			<p>BFN     [Text] Dear listeners of Radio Rwanda, we have just  broadcast the recorded swearing-in ceremonies of the new  government headed by Prime Minister Jean Kambanda.    The government is composed of nine ministers of the  Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development  Party. They are the same as in the preceding government. They  are in their previous posts. All the Republican Democratic  Movement ministers are new. They include: the minister for  foreign affairs and cooperation, Jerome Bicamumpaka; the  minister of primary and secondary education, Dr. Andre  Rwamakuba, and the minister of information, Eliezer Nitegeka.  For the Social Democratic Party, there are also three new  ministers: the minister of agriculture and livestock, Straton  Nsambumukunzi, and the minister of public works and energy,  Yacinthe Nsengiyumva. For the Christian Democratic Party, there  is one minister who has kept his post. He is Gaspard  Ruhumuliza. For the Liberal Party [PL], there are two ministers  who have kept their portfolio: Justin Mugenzi, who remains at  the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and Agnes Ntamabyaliro,  who keeps her Ministry of Justice. A new minister of the PL is  Jean de Dieu Habineza, who has been appointed as minister of  works and social affairs.    It seems that ministers whose whereabouts were unknown were  replaced. Others are those who were replaced for political  reasons. The government was set up by the five political parties  which make up the government. The president of the Republic, as  you know, is Dr. Theodore Sindikubgabo, former president of the  National Development Council [parliament]. Three ministers were  not sworn in. These are the minister of interior and communal  development, Justin Munyazesa, who is on a mission. The same  applies to the minister of defense, Augustin Bizimana, who is  also on a mission. Minister Straton Nsambumukunzi, minister of  agriculture and livestock, was also not sworn in. He was in  Butare at the time of the swearing in.    The government has a six-week term. That is, it should carry  out necessary negotiations for setting up the broad based  transitional government in cooperation with the Rwandan  Patriotic Front [RPF] in six weeks, as requested by the UN  Security Council. The government therefore has a precise role:  to manage the crisis situation, to continue negotiations with  the RPF and to assist the people who are threatened by hunger  and famine, in some prefectures such as Gikongoro and Butare or  in the camps of displaced people.</p>

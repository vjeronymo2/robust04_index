			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> AZERBAIJANIS PACK CAPITAL IN PROTEST MARCH  </P> <P> Hundreds of thousands of people, some holding banners proclaiming "Down with  Russian dictatorship!" on Saturday packed the central square of Baku, capital  of the Azerbaijan republic, protest organizers said.  </P> <P> The gathering was called by the unofficial Azerbaijani Popular Front to back  its demands for greater local autonomy and continued control of the disputed  region of Nagorno-Karabakh.  </P> <P> Popular Front spokesman Nazim Ragimov told Reuters by telephone from Baku that  at least 600,000 people took part in the protest. No independent crowd estimate  was available.  </P> <P> Ragimov said the gathering was much larger than a similar protest in Baku's  Lenin Square last Monday at the end of a one-day strike. An estimated 150,000  people took part in that demonstration.  </P> <P> Ragimov said talks between the Popular Front and the Azerbaijani leadership had  achieved nothing. "They are not prepared to agree to any one of our demands."  </P> <P> The Popular Front has threatened to call a general strike across the republic  unless the authorities support their calls for greater political and economic  autonomy and the recall of parliamentary deputies they say are  unrepresentative.  </P> <P> They are also demanding an end to Moscow's direct control over  Nagorno-Karabakh, imposed last year after clashes between Azerbaijanis and  Armenians, and the end to a curfew and military presence in Baku and other  Azerbaijani towns.  </P> <P> The Azerbaijani authorities, while agreeing to talk to the group's leaders,  have refused to formally recognize the movement.  </P></p>

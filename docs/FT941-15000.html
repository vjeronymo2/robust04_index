			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Cheaper Times and Sun hold circulation gains The Sun and The Times, the two News International national newspapers which last year cut their cover prices, continue to hold on to significant circulation gains. The Audit Bureau of Circulation said sales of the 20p Sun averaged 3,737,188 in December, up 8.19 per cent compared with the same month last year. Average sales for the second half of last year were 3,761,733, an increase of just over 6 per cent. In December sales of the 30p weekday Times averaged 439,327, a 17 per cent rise on December 1992. The six-month average - with only four months at 30p  -was 412,853, a rise of 8.88 per cent. The increases The Times has achieved could be enough to pay for its price cut if advertising yields have increased. The paper gets 65 per cent of its revenue from advertising. The Sun, which raises about 70 per cent of its revenue from sales, is unlikely to be close to covering the cost of the cut. News International is still hoping that ways can be found to push sales of The Sun back up to 4m. Meanwhile the Audit Bureau of Circulation figures confirmed the continued slide of both The Independent and the Independent on Sunday as talks continued about their future ownership. The Independent averaged 301,987 in December, down 13.9 per cent on December 1992. The comparable figure for the Independent on Sunday is 335,475, a drop of 14.76 per cent.</p>

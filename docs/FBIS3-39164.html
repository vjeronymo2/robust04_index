Local sources told the TURKISH DAILY NEWS that two people  were killed and 35 shops were destroyed in the clash, which  began on Monday and continued until Tuesday morning. Sources  said the fighting erupted with a PKK bomb attack on an armoured  vehicle parked in the street. Witnesses noted that security  forces had helped locals back to their houses before the clash  began, telling them not to come out, for their own safety.    Anti-aircraft guns, RPG rocket launchers, light anti-tank  weapons and machine guns were used in the clash, during which a  branch office of the Ziraat bank and several PTT buildings were  hit. The Cizre office of the pro-Kurdish OZGUR GUNDEM was hit  by two rockets. Witnesses said that if the security forces had  not escorted residents back to their homes, there could have  been many casualties.    On Tuesday the OZGUR GUNDEM reported on its front page that  a  total of 16 civilians, two of them children, had been killed in  Cizre over the past month.    Locals suspect that there is a systematic campaign underway  to influence the results of Cizre's polls in the upcoming March  27 local elections. In the past month, dozens of families  living in the Cudi neighborhood of the town have reportedly been  forced out of their homes by paramilitary village guards, who  moved in. Other houses were torched so that they could no  longer be used. On Monday, police raided the office of the  Cizre reporter of SABAH newspaper, Ramazan Imrag. They abducted  him and took him to a nearby government building, where he was  beaten for hours. Imrag said he suspected that he was being  punished for reporting on developments in Cizre to Sabah's  private television channel, ATV. He was told that this was a  "warning" and if he continued to do "what he had been doing," he  would be killed. Recently, state forces in the region started a  campaign along with influential tribe leaders to repopulate  crucial settlements which are known to sympathize with the PKK.    In Diyarbakir, there was a "march to condemn terrorism" this  weekend, during which a total of about 250 people marched  through the streets, shouting slogans against the PKK and in  favor of the Army and police. They were protected by hundreds  of policemen.    About 10 days ago, another group marched through Cizre,  shouting anti-PKK slogans. Both in Diyarbakir and Cizre, those  appearing in the streets were Kurdish village guards, who are  paid fixed salaries by the state to combat the PKK. Sources in  Cizre told the TDN on Tuesday that village guards had recently  started detaining and interrogating suspects as well, and that  many locals placed under custody were not taken to the police  station but directly to the house of the chief village guard,  Kamil Atak. At least seven of those detained in this way are  now reported missing. Sources say that, because of the state's  new campaign, some 3,000 voters in this town are no longer  eligible to vote, and this will seriously affect the outcome of  the March elections. Democracy Party (DEP) deputy Selim Sadak  on Tuesday confirmed the report stating that many voters were  not registered in the area, whereas village guards were. He  said this was [as published] undermined the credibility of the  elections.</p>

			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Putting the spark under reforms - A look at attempts by the Indian government to attract foreign investment into building a power sector necessary for the country's economic modernisation Free electricity is one of life's few blessings for slum dwellers in Shahdara, east Delhi. It is easily obtained by scrambling up an electricity pole and attaching a wire to the overhead mains. Occasionally, someone gets electrocuted in the process, but not often. Electricity board officials turn a blind eye to such pilfering, which happens all over India. The effort of collecting payment from slums is not worth the revenues. Also, decades of socialist thinking have encouraged many Indians to regard the mostly state-owned electricity distribution boards as welfare agencies. Farmers in Karnataka state, south India, pay just 5 per cent of cost for their current. In neighbouring Tamil Nadu they pay nothing. The result is chronic losses for the industry and frequent power cuts for consumers thanks to electricity shortages. However, the government of Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the reform-minded prime minister, is now committed to overhauling the industry, recognising that without improved electricity supplies, the economic modernisation programme launched in 1991 will grind to a halt. After years of relying on state-owned industry, Mr Rao is calling on private companies - including foreign groups - to build and operate 100 per cent privately-owned power plants. But business has so far been slow to respond. Mr P V Rangayya Naidu, minister of state for power, yesterday told parliament that 75 investors, including 35 from overseas had submitted proposals to the government to invest Rs1,041.52bn (Dollars 33.6bn) to build and operate power stations with a total capacity of more than 20,000MW. But only four small-scale plants with a combined capacity of 1,300MW are under construction, all by Indian-owned companies; four large projects totalling 8,000MW and involving foreign capital, have been approved by the government, but none is yet under way. Businessmen have responded cautiously to the proposals, partly because of the huge scale of the investments and partly because of doubts about the government's ability to overhaul the industry's anti-commercial practices. Even though ministers in Delhi are committed to reform, many local politicians, who use cheap electricity to buy farmers' votes, are not. Mr S V Joshi, director of power distribution at the Indian affiliate of Siemens, the German engineering group, says: 'It took the US 10 years to switch from public to private sector power generation. India can't do it in two or three.' The government's 1992-97 economic plan calls for the addition of 31,000MW of public sector generating capacity to the existing total of 78,000MW (which includes 9,000MW from private plants). The public sector does not have the funds to fulfil the plan. With a large power station costing Dollars 1bn or more, the only viable way for private companies to fund such projects is to split the cost between different equity partners and lenders, including multilateral institutions such as the World Bank. Enron, the US energy group, is planning a Dollars 2bn plant for Maharashtra state to supply Bombay - perhaps the furthest advanced of the schemes involving foreign capital. Enron is considering asking lenders for about 80 per cent of the funds, with the remaining 20 per cent equity split between three partners - Enron, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board and General Electric, the US engineering group which would supply much of the equipment. Mr Tom White, chairman of Enron Power, Enron's power generation subsidiary, says raising the money is 'quite a challenge'. The World Bank, the multilateral lending agency which has funded much of India's existing power capacity, has said it will support schemes involving private companies. Officials believe public sector boards are generally poor managers - Indian power plants run at an average of 60 per cent of full capacity and 23 per cent of output is lost during transmission. The Indian government has proposed contracts which would allow generating companies to pass on increases in fuel costs (the main variable cost) and earn a minimum net annual profit of 16 per cent. But most foreign companies say this is not enough. They are asking for central government guarantees that they will be paid by the state-level electricity boards, which are the main distributors. The companies are worried because the electricity boards are controlled by local state governments, which use electricity supply as a political tool. The boards make huge losses because they are unable to charge market rates since politicians manipulate rate increases to protect their constituents, especially farmers. The central government had ruled out guarantees, saying the answer lay in water-tight legally enforceable contracts, but last month, a visiting US delegation headed by Ms Hazel O'Leary, US secretary of energy, convinced the government that few foreign investors would be willing to enter the Indian power sector without counter-guarantees. The government agreed to reconsider its earlier decision, and announced on Friday that the Enron project would be the first to receive a guarantee agreement, valid for the 12 years that the company is servicing its loan obligations. Enron had sought a 25-year guarantee period. The government's decision has, nonetheless, paved the way for guarantee facilities for six other power projects with foreign investment, in Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The cabinet also approved guidelines to enable more of the state electricity boards to qualify for government guarantees. The boards and the states in which the power plants are being built will need to prove that they are financially healthy, and the project's financial plans will be closely monitored by the government's Power Finance Corporation. The ministry is considering further incentives to tempt foreign companies. Officials also point to the success of the four Indian private companies in the industry - the Bombay Suburban Electric Supply Company, the Calcutta Electric Supply Company, Ahmedabad Electricity and Tata Electric Companies. All are profitable and most are expanding capacity. As Mr Joshi of Siemens says: 'This proves India can do it.'</p>

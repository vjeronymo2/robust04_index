			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Pak Ui-chun on the research report, </F> "Analysis of Negotiation Style and Activity in the Era Moving  Away from the Cold War," by the Foreign Ministry-affiliated  Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security; first three  paragraphs are introduction]    [Text] Since North Korea withdraw from the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) in March last year, North Korea  has held talks and behind-the-scenes negotiations with the  United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  over the nuclear issue, thus playing a steady tug-of-war with  them.    Through several rounds of North-South dialogue, including  the  North-South high-level talks, North Korea's negotiation style  toward the South was revealed. However, North Korea's  negotiation style over the nuclear issue, which is compared to a  "long-distance race," has not been nearly revealed.    In this connection, in a recent research report, "The  Analysis of the Negotiation Style and Activity in the Era Moving  Away From the Cold War," the Institute of Foreign Affairs and  National Security analyzed that "North Korea's external  negotiation capacity on the nuclear issue is compared both to  `the style of Zhuge Kongming' and to `an acrobat dancing on the  rope for the first time.'" According to the analysis, North  Korea's diplomatic style concerning the nuclear issue is as  follows:    Regarding the international trends as a "struggle between  socialist and imperialist power," North Korea has recognized  external negotiations as a means for realizing socialist  ideology and smashing the imperialist forces.    Regarding its purpose as an absolute line, North Korea does  not hesitate to employ any means and method to attain its  purpose of external negotiations.    North Korea's basic consciousness about external  negotiations  is mainly affected by a way of thinking which seeks a socialist  equality, the characteristics of the closed Kim Il-song system  based on the chuche idea, independence, and the patriarchal  Confucian culture obedient to the supreme authority. As a  result, North Korea's diplomatic negotiation style has an aspect  different from the Western style of diplomatic negotiations.    In particular, because North Korea has the historical  experiences of being plagued by neighboring powerful countries  for a long time, it distrusts external forces. On the other  hand, it has the consciousness to take advantage of foreign  forces.    As to the nuclear issue, which has a complex and technical  aspect compared with other general negotiations which were  handled during the North-South high-level talks, the  characteristics of North Korea's diplomatic negotiation style  and activity are as follows:  <H5>  The Consciousness as a Means for Resisting Foreign Forces </H5>   North Korea adheres to attaining the target of its  negotiations. North Korea has steadily demanded that U.S.  nuclear weapons be withdrawn from South Korea, that U.S. nuclear  threat against North Korea be removed, that the Team Spirit  exercise be discontinued, that the U.S. nuclear umbrella for  South Korea be removed, and that U.S.-North Korean direct  negotiations be held.    North Korea has repeatedly put forward such conditions.  Prior to adopting the denuclearization declaration, through the  government's official statements, mass communications, and  various conferences, North Korea has repeatedly declared that  without the withdrawal of U.S. nuclear weapons and the removal  of nuclear threat against North Korea, it could not conclude the  nuclear safeguards accord with the IAEA. North Korea has  created the atmosphere that if the preconditions are not met, it  cannot respond to nuclear negotiations and nuclear inspections.    In the long run, North Korea responded to North-South  nuclear negotiations correctly after former U.S. President Bush  took steps to remove tactical nuclear weapons and former ROK  President No Tae-u announced the nonexistence of nuclear weapons  in South Korea.    North Korea does not seem to prepare in advance to  specifically implement details agreed upon by the North and  South. In early December 1991, North Korea agreed to start  nuclear negotiations during the North-South high-level talks  and, just within 20 days after this agreement, it agreed on the  principles put forward by the South. These principles included  "denuclearization on the Korean peninsula" and "the start of the  inspections in June after formulating regulations in May." In  the stage of nearly carrying out this agreement, North Korea  refused to discuss the regulations of the nuclear inspections,  but instead maintained that the root of the nuclear issue is due  to South Korea's introduction of U.S. nuclear weapons. Under  this pretext, it has deadlocked a meeting of the Joint Nuclear  Control Committee for a long time. This is a good example  showing that North Korea does not prepare in advance to  implement agreements between the North and South.    North Korea makes efforts to obtain its target for  negotiations by presenting additional proposals to South Korea.  When we accepted all conditions made by North Korea in December  1991 regarding the IAEA's request for inspection, North Korea  put forward the simultaneous inspection of North and South Korea  as a new condition for accepting IAEA inspections. When we  accepted the simultaneous inspection of the North and South,  North Korea called again for the "adoption of an agreement for  the implementation of inspection" featuring the logic of  converting the Korean peninsula into a nuclear-free zone after  the North and South forge a denuclearization declaration. Also,  it has delayed discussing the inspection regulations.    North Korea regards propaganda as important in negotiations.  Before entering negotiations, North Korea has created  international opinion by conducting a political propaganda that  the fundamental root is caused by U.S. nuclear weapons deployed  in South Korea and it is being threatened by U.S. nuclear  weapons, and by holding the "international conferences for peace  and denuclearization on the Korean peninsula."  <H5>  A Threat With an Extreme Diplomacy </H5>   North Korea invites famous foreign figures who can speak for  its position in the process of negotiations. By using them, it  tries to dispel the suspicion of its nuclear development and  obtains information from them regarding the other party. Also,  it uses them as a way to grasp the limit that the other party  can compromise and, at the same time, to strengthen its demands.    High-ranking North Korean military officials show, however,  that they are still reluctant to meet foreign figures. As a  result, officials of the State Administration and the party can  mainly deal with them. Foreign figures who are believed to be  highly useful for propaganda works are be selected as to meet  with Kim Il-song.    In addition, in the course of nuclear negotiations with the  United States, North Korea has shown its strategies, such as "a  threat of extreme diplomacy, the change of agenda items in  negotiations by presenting either new conditions or proposals,  and the presentation of uncompromising demands."    Through an extreme step of the so-called declaration to  withdraw from the NPT, North Korea has escaped from the pressure  to accept special inspection [tukpyol sachal] from the IAEA for  the time being and led the United States to regard the issue of  making North Korea remain in the NPT as a more important agenda  than the IAEA inspection issue in the negotiations. As a  result, North Korea has come to hold its long-wished-for direct  negotiations with the United States.    In North Korean-U.S. negotiations, particularly, North Korea  has strongly called for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from South  Korea and for the establishment of diplomatic relations with the  United States, while the United States has demanded that North  Korea remain in the NPT. It is the current situation that the  United States, by presenting irresistible demands, checks North  Korea's will concerning nuclear inspections.</p>

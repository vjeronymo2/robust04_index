			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / International Company News: Shareholders challenge Dollars 6bn Medco takeover TWO CLASS actions have been launched in an attempt to block the proposed Dollars 6bn takeover of Medco Containment Services, the US's biggest drugs distributor, by Merck, the pharmaceuticals company. The actions, launched in Delaware on behalf of Medco shareholders, allege 'various violations of fiduciary duty, including failure to make adequate disclosures, failure to explore adequately other forms of business alliance, improper fees payable to certain executive officers and unfairness in the structure of the merger,' Medco said. Mr Martin Wygod, Medco's chairman, will personally receive a fee on the consummation of the deal equal to 1 per cent of the value, or Dollars 60m, an arrangement which was approved by Medco's board. Medco also said it and several other pharmaceutical companies and drug wholesalers faced legal action in California alleging price discrimination. It said it intended to defend all the suits vigorously, and that it did not believe any of them would have a material adverse impact on its business.</p>

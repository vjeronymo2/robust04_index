			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Jorge Valentim, UNITA information </F> secretary, by BBC reporter Carlos Alberto Araujo on the "London  Last Minute" program on 1 February--place not given]    [Text] National reconciliation is now the big issue being  discussed by the Angolan Government and the National Union for  the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] at the Lusaka peace  talks. Yesterday, the two sides took an important step forward  when they reached an agreement on the formation of the future  national police force. That accord provides for UNITA's  participation in that force with 5,500 police agents, out of a  total of 25,700 men. The agreement saw that delicate hurdle  overcome and, also yesterday the two teams moved to discuss  national reconciliation, the second point on the agenda of the  proceedings and one of the fundamental issues concerns the  distribution of ministerial portfolios. BBC reporter Carlos  Alberto Araujo interviewed UNITA Information Secretary Jorge  Alicerces Valentim this afternoon. Araujo began by asking what  UNITA's demands concerning this issue were.    [Begin Valentim recording] I can tell you that we will be  presenting political points rather than demands. For instance,  taking into account the great national catastrophe that has  morally and otherwise ravaged the country, we are for a single  entity, but a single entity with an acceptable standing. In  view of that, we believe that decentralization will be an exit  door, a door that will lead to our salvation and will allow the  Angolan entity to remain united. In this case, unlike what  happened in 1992, we want UNITA to have a more significant  participation in government. I believe these are reasonable  points of view. Another point that is very dear to us is the  status to be enjoyed and the protection guarantees for our  President Dr. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi. In addition, UNITA  militants must be allowed economic participation in the national  economy. We would have liked to have a wider national vision of  the problem at this stage, we would like it made clear that it  is not only the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola's  [MPLA] militants who participate in the economic life of this  nation and enjoy the country's great benefits. The sympathizers  and militants of UNITA and parties must also be able to do so.  [end recording]    UNITA Information Secretary Jorge Valentim admitted that  UNITA now wants to secure more important ministerial portfolios  than the ones it was given in 1992 and he alleges that only such  a move can guarantee the Angolan people that UNITA will  substantively participate in the national life of Angola.    [Begin recording] [Valentim] Yes, I mean, it is so that  people believe in the truth, that we are moving toward national  reconciliation and it is important that the ministerial  portfolios be important, that they make the people believe that  UNITA is responsible for really important public matters. Now,  if we are given something like the Culture Ministry, a few  secretariats, and so forth, that will amount to no more than an  experiment. However, I think that even the government is  rethinking its stand. If the government does indeed rethink its  stand, then that will be a positive point. The year of 1994  will not be equal to 1992. We all evolve and we will reach an  understanding, just as we did concerning the army and the police.    [Araujo] Mr. Jorge Valentim: would you confirm that UNITA  will be asking for the Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Interior  Ministries?    [Valentim] Well, I would only like to say that we will be  asking for ministries that we deem important. However, because  we are at the first stage of discussions, we would only like to  discuss the general aspects, but as the talks progress, perhaps  within the next week, we will give more details about what  ministries we really want.    [Araujo] Mr. Jorge Valentim: you said at the start of this  interview that it is important to build a climate of trust  between the two sides. Do you not think that it is  contradictory that the two sides should have reached an  agreement on the national police issue at a time when there are  reports of intensified fighting in various parts of Angola?    [Valentim] Well, even though we are here, we are concerned  about the intensification of the clashes. We can even say that  both the mediation and the observers have condemned and are not  in agreement with this escalation in the fighting. We have  presented requests to the mediation and the observers for the  fighting to stop. We made such a request only yesterday and the  day before. We should not be discussing national reconciliation  in a climate of war. [end recording]    UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali will today present  to the Security Council his report on the progress of the peace  talks in Lusaka. Diplomatic sources in New York believe the  report will be positive. The agreement on national police  happens a day after that report is presented, and this seems to  suggest that UNITA may have been pressured. However, Jorge  Valentim says that this was a mere coincidence.    [Begin Valentim recording] No, this is a mere coincidence  and  has nothing to do with the UN timetable. It happened that,  after 37 days, we finalized the talks. In reality we have  reached an agreement. Why should we have discussed the police  issue in a hurry, without bases? Let me say that it is not an  MPLA or UNITA police that will emerge, it is a state police in  the service of the nation, a police force which will look at the  security of each citizen, regardless of his political  affiliation, race or ethnic origin.

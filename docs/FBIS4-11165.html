			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Miguel Angel de la Guardia; from the "Evening </F> Information Review" newscast]    [Text] The first report on the achievements of oil  production has already been issued with the end of the first  quarter of 1994, a quarter that marked the beginning of a  special period. The report indicated that oil production  exceeded forecasts by 12 percent; that is, crude oil production  reached more than 300,000 tons. Now, eyes are turning toward  the country's main industry, namely the sugar industry, which  was surrounded by a high-pitched campaign to exceed last year's  output, which is comparable to the output of 1944, when sugar  was sold at two and one-half cents per pound.    Last year, the revolutionary government set out to  significantly increase sugar production, which was already set  at more than 6 million tons annually. Sugar production amounted  to 4.2 million tons in 1993. The country expects to produce at  least 100,000 to 200,000 tons more this year, which is a very  difficult task because of the very adverse condition of the  industry, which has been affected by an acute lack of  fertilizers, transportation, fuels, and herbicides -- usually  sprayed in a short period of time thanks to agricultural  aviation.    The tasks so far accomplished in the industry, due to the  overwhelming support of its workers and reserves, were truly  heroic, especially when we take into consideration that  mechanical sugar harvesters were affected by the aforementioned  situation. The legendary brigades of sugarcane cutters  [macheteros], who filled Cuban fields with routine deeds as  though they were a true fighting army, are currently fused to  the ground, fighting, machete in hand, with the same patriotic  fervor displayed by our founding fathers last century.    The Cuban people and government are relying on these men,  because they inspired admiration in many previous harvest  seasons. We are also relying on the men of the sugar industry,  those who operate and maintain sugar mill equipment and those  who work in the laboratories and offices, who are also doing the  best they can. This harvest battle has the connotation of a  memorable campaign within the great epic that the Cuban people  are staging at the most decisive time of their beautiful  history. In its determination to accomplish production goals  and to surpass them as much as possible, the Cuban Sugar  Industry Ministry announced that the harvest season will last a  little bit longer this year; it will be extended until late May.    In addition, some sugar mills will continue to operate until  June at the latest. After that date, sugarcane production  plummets so much that it is a mistake to sacrifice sugar fields  that can continue to yield crops to ensure that they will yield  more next year. The preparatory tasks for the next sugarcane  harvest started earlier this year. We can guarantee that in  1995 production in this vital Cuban industry will continue to  increase.</p>

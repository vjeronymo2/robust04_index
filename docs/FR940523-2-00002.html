APHIS will be accepting public comments on the environmental assessment. APHIS has previously requested public comments on any plant pest risk issues presented by the ZW&hyph;20 squash. The environmental assessment and preliminary finding indicate no significant impact on the environment from the determination that the ZW&hyph;20 squash does not present a plant pest risk and should no longer be regulated under APHIS' regulations. Based on this preliminary finding of no significant impact, APHIS has determined that an environmental impact statement need not be prepared for the issuance of this determination. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The public meeting will be held in Washington, DC, on Tuesday, June 21, 1994, from 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 1:30 to 4 p.m. local time.

After considering the comments submitted during the 30-day comment period, APHIS determined that it was in the public interest to reopen the comment period to examine scientific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues raised by the commenters. A notice was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  on March 22, 1993 (58 FR 15323, Docket No. 92&hyph;127&hyph;2), requesting additional information on eight issues raised by respondents to Docket No.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 92&hyph;127&hyph;1. On March 31, 1993 (58 FR 17044&hyph;17059, Docket No. 92&hyph;156&hyph;2), APHIS amended its regulations in 7 CFR part 340 by establishing a petition process. The petition process allows for a determination that certain plants are no longer regulated articles, and formalizes the interpretive ruling procedure which was in place when the original petition for the ZW&hyph;20 squash was submitted. To provide for a thorough review of comments and information submitted to APHIS on the ZW&hyph;20 squash, APHIS is convening a public meeting to provide a forum for an open discussion of the issues analyzed in the environmental assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Procedures for the Public Meeting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any interested person may appear and may be heard in person, by attorney, or by other representative. The meeting will be held in the Jefferson Auditorium, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), South Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC, on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> June 21, 1994, from 9 a.m. until 12:30 p.m. and from 1:30 p.m. until 4 p.m., local time. However, the meeting may conclude earlier if all persons who have requested an opportunity to speak have been heard.

The presiding officer may limit the time for each presentation in order to allow everyone wishing to speak the opportunity to be heard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Economist Yuriy Abramov review under "New Books" rubric: </F> "From the Agrarians' Viewpoint"]    [Text] Two basic problems are examined in the work "The  Agrarian Party of Russia. Fundamentals of Its Economic Program"  [Agrarnaya Partiya Rossii. Osnovy Ekonomicheskoy Programmy"],  (authors M.I. Lapshin, L.P. Orlenko, and I.P. Rybkin, published  in 1993 by the N.E. Bauman Moscow State Technical School): Who  is to blame for Russia's present-day troubles; and what must be  done to get out of the state of crisis.    The answer to the first, traditional Russian question is not  one-dimensional. Those primarily to blame are those who broke  up the USSR. The political struggle between the different  branches of power which ended in the bloody October events made  a considerable contribution to the present-day crisis. Yet the  main agents of the crisis are those whose actions generated the  "shock therapy" program, which is based on the "Houston Report."  This document, compiled by order of the leaders of seven  Western countries, is a program (around 1,200 pages long) for  integrating the USSR (Russia and the other CIS countries) into  the world economy in two to three years. Through a transition  to world prices, privatization, liberalization of prices and  foreign trade, financial stabilization....    Essentially it is the "Houston Report" that has determined  the Russian Government's activity in the last two years. This  program's implementation is leading to the destruction of  Russia's scientific and technical potential, the bankrupting of  the processing industry, the collapse of agriculture, and the  utter decline of education, medicine, and culture. The Western  program is creating conditions for mass unemployment, a  reduction in the population of Russia and the CIS countries, and  a drop in the people's living standards. "Shock therapy" is  advantageous to the domestic comprador bourgeoisie and the  developed countries, which are expanding a raw-material base for  themselves, obtaining a market for selling unsold goods, and  eliminating a future economic competitor. What is being created  in Russia instead of a market and democracy is a criminal mafia  society intent on plundering Russia's national wealth in the  interests of Western civilization.    The work in question sets out a concept for extricating  Russia from the crisis. It is based on the implementation in  1994 of a range of measures to halt the decline in production  and prevent the population's further impoverishment. These are  primarily to stop the illegal export of currency abroad (around  $20 billion a year), the unbalanced exchange with CIS countries  (losses of $17 billion a year), and the robbery of the  overwhelming mass of the population by a small section (around 4  percent) of it; to resume weapons exports (losses of over $15  billion a year); to stimulate (by taxes, credits, subsidies,  etc) the production of goods and services; to utilize the  banking system to invest in production; to temporarily introduce  tight control over the export of raw and other materials,  energy, and consumer goods; to end the import of colonial goods  into Russia; and to restrain inflation by regulating the entire  mechanism of economic instruments (prices, taxes, subsidies,  credits, etc).    Creating the conditions for economic growth and for building  a civilized market requires a corresponding structural  reorganization of production, privatization, and the  destatization of public property. In order to preserve  scientific and technical potential and use it practically it is  necessary to form several hundred major corporations like Sony,  Boeing, General Motors, and suchlike. A structural  reorganization, that is a substantial expansion of the  production of goods and services for the population, requires  the utilization of the currency which is now "escaping" to  foreign countries far and near and into the pockets of swindlers  and speculators. These objectives require the corporatization  of production and the leasing of enterprises (corporations) to  labor collectives or the transfer of enterprises to their  economic control, with payment being made for capital and with  the possibility of enterprises' being bought out for shared  collective ownership. This will enable millions of workers to  be made the owners of the fruits of their labor and  simultaneously the co-owners of an enterprise. This trend is  now gathering momentum in developed countries.    Given our criminalized economy, only labor collectives will  be able to cope with economic banditry and create the conditions  for a civilized, socially oriented market. The law-enforcement  organs cannot resolve this task on their own.    Supporting agriculture requires a balanced exchange with  other sectors, aid to the economic units providing goods for the  population, and the termination of aid to foreign private  farmers (in the form of imported agricultural products). The  buying and selling of agricultural and urban land is not  permissible. Otherwise land will be bought up through front men  by foreigners and the nouveau riche, who have become wealthy  through the impoverishment of pensioners, children, doctors,  engineers, military personnel, workers, and peasants. A land  free-for-all will lead to the collapse of the agricultural  economy and to famine in the cities. Public land must be leased  long-term to producers in the countryside (collective and state  farms and private farmers). The buying and selling of land must  not go beyond the framework of dacha and garden plots and land  attached to individual homes.    A system of draft laws on privatization, the agricultural  economy, social policy, prices and price formation, taxes,  finances, and banks, and other topics needs to be drawn up for  the State Duma on the basis of the concept of economic reform in  question. The adoption of these documents will create the  legislative basis for a program of reforms providing an  alternative to "shock therapy."</p>

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Wolstenholme Rink shows 20% advance WOLSTENHOLME RINK, Lancashire-based printing industry supplier, announced pre-tax profits 20 per cent ahead from Pounds 1.68m to Pounds 2.02m for the first half of 1993, on turnover of Pounds 26.6m, against Pounds 24.7m. The result, which followed a 49 per cent jump in profit to Pounds 3.46m for 1992, reflected a recovery at Charles Openshaw following a reorganisation, and a cut in interest costs from Pounds 401,000 to Pounds 215,000. Following the period end the company acquired the resins and varnish business of Leon Frenkel. It will make a contribution in the last five months of the present year. Earnings per share were 16.8p (14p) and the interim dividend is raised from 6.5p to 6.8p.</p>

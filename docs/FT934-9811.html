			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Foothold on cliff of opportunity: Foreign investors are using Hong Kong's stock market as a way into China, say Simon Holberton and Patrick Harverson As Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, prepares for tomorrow's UK cabinet meeting to discuss the latest twists and turns in the battle with China over the colony's political future, the local stock market is showing no signs of shell-shock. While the past seven months have stretched to breaking point the patience of Mr Patten, as he campaigns for political reform ahead of the 1997 transfer of sovereignty to China, Hong Kong's money men have done more than break even - the colony's Hang Seng index has risen 20 per cent in the past five weeks. This remarkable rise in share prices has happened since a visit to China by a group of US fund managers - who collectively manage Dollars 400bn in assets - organised by Morgan Stanley, the US securities firm, in September. At the end of that month, Mr Barton Biggs, the company's chief equities strategist, set the tone when he said: 'After eight days in China I'm tuned in, overfed and maximum bullish.' Less colourfully, Mr Biggs argued that investing in China would be 'the world's most profitable investment opportunity for the next 10 years'. With much of the country's stock market off-limits to foreign investors, he said: 'The best way into the China restructuring story is through Hong Kong.' This judgment will prove either one of the most prescient of the decade  - or the most misguided. Hong Kong is undoubtedly the best gateway to China, but its stock market is vulnerable to internal Chinese politics and to China's worsening relations with the western world, notably the US and Britain. Whatever the long-term outcome for equities, Mr Biggs's remarks have had a startling impact in Hong Kong. A wave of US money has hit the colony this autumn as investors have switched away from unexciting US and European markets towards Asia. Morgan Stanley, for instance, has increased the weighting of the Hong Kong stock market in its global equity model, a theoretical portfolio watched by investors, by tenfold, to 3 per cent from 0.3 per cent; Mr Biggs increased Hong Kong's weighting in his Dollars 1bn 'emerging markets' fund by 45 per cent to 16 per cent of total assets. Warburg Securities in Hong Kong expects a 95 per cent rise - to Dollars 5.5bn from Dollars 2.8bn in 1992 - in US investors' net purchases of Hong Kong equities this year. The love affair with Asian equities as a whole may not be limited to US funds. Nomura Securities, the leading Japanese stockbroker, recently raised Dollars 1bn for investment in Asian equities. According to Mr Robert Rowntree, head of Nomura's regional research team in Hong Kong, most recent Japanese investment in the colony has come from private clients acting through investment trusts. But he, and others, believe that the large investment institutions in Japan may, for the first time, be on the verge of committing large sums to Asian, especially to Hong Kong, equities. 'The conditions are good for Japanese investment in Asian equities,' Mr Rowntree says. 'The yen has peaked, and Japanese securities houses are in a position to service clients. Nomura has 60 salesmen now who know the Hong Kong and Singapore markets. By the end of 1994 we will have 200.' The Hang Seng's 20 per cent rise since the end of September has helped to make Hong Kong the best-performing mature market in Asia this year. The overall increase takes into account the market's poorer performance last week - when it fell by 3.6 per cent, in common with many markets around the world - and its 181-point rally yesterday. The colony has a large, liquid market, which appeals to the large US investment institutions with millions at their disposal. It also attracts foreign investors, because it has more listed companies than any other stock market in the world involved in China, the region's fastest-growing economy. It is the one, in short, most highly geared to the rapid economic growth being experienced on the mainland. In the latest buying wave, investors have been targeting Hong Kong companies with a strong exposure to the Chinese economy. This is especially so for the heavily capitalised companies such as China Light &amp; Power, which sells electricity to China, Hongkong Telecom, the telephone monopoly in the colony with growing business opportunities on the mainland, Hongkong Electric, the power generator on Hong Kong island which is expected to become involved in power station construction in China, and HSBC Holdings, Hong Kong's biggest bank. These stocks have performed especially well. Since September, China Light has risen 10 per cent to close at HKDollars 49.50 yesterday, HSBC 6.7 per cent to HKDollars 87, Hongkong Telecom 27.6 per cent to HKDollars 16.20, and Hong Kong Electric 15 per cent to HKDollars 24.40. As Mr John Hickling, the Boston-based manager of the Fidelity Overseas Fund, put it: 'US institutions just piled in.' However, the speed with which share prices have risen has unsettled some investors and observers. They think the Hong Kong market is overvalued and vulnerable to a political or economic setback which, if it comes, could be severe. Mr Doug Johnson, senior international investment strategist at Merrill Lynch, the US securities house, says some US investors may have mistaken Morgan Stanley's forecast of a positive economic outlook in China for a forecast of a pos-itive short-term outlook for the Hong Kong market. 'There is a good deal of indiscriminate buying taking place based on the long-term Chinese economic story,' he says. 'That story is very robust now, but there is a distinction between what is a good economic story and what is a good market story. They are not always consistent with each other, and it is a differentiation that a lot of investors are not making.' Mr Hickling of Fidelity is also cautious about the short-term prospects for Hong Kong stocks. In 1992, as much as 15 per cent of his Dollars 1.5bn fund was invested in the market, but since then he has cut his holdings to just 1 per cent. 'To me, it seems closer to the end of an opportunity, rather than the beginning. I'm very cautious and don't have a lot of money there.' Many European investors share this view. According to Mr Archie Hart, head of research at Crosby Securities, a Hong Kong stockbroker, the Europeans, having been bitten more than once, are now more than twice shy. 'They have seen the property crash of 1982-83, the stock market crash of 1987 when the market closed for a week, and they are a bit too hard-bitten to swallow it. A lot of the latest investors are new to the market. At the moment there are two views: either they are in for the long term and are buying the China concept; or they are the last people in and are due for a shock.' Underlining such concerns are several indications that, enticing though China may appear, the Hong Kong market is showing some signs of greed outstripping its natural ally, fear. The market rise has happened as analysts have downgraded their earnings forecasts for the colony's corporate sector. At the beginning of the year a 20 per cent rise in 1994 earnings was forecast; a disappointing first half and economic tightening in China suggest 15 per cent growth might be closer to the mark. Some deals hint that investors may have their heads in the clouds. For example, Henderson, a large property developer, raised Dollars 460m from foreign investors last month in the form of a loan convertible into equity in a company which does not yet exist. Henderson planned to list the company, Henderson China, on the stock exchange, but withdrew, after the exchange's listing division expressed doubts about the way Henderson's advisers had valued development property in China. Observers lured by the deal say that, even if Henderson China is not set up, bond holders - primarily US fixed income funds - will receive a handsome yield of 6.6 per cent from Henderson over three years. To others, however, the deal is symbolic of investors buying a 'concept' and not worrying about fundamentals. Another concern is politics. Since 1984, when Britain agreed to transfer Hong Kong to China, the local market has suffered what is known as a 'political discount'. This is shown up in the difference between Hong Kong's 'rating' relative to other Asian markets. Investors are currently prepared to pay prices equal to 19 and 24 times future corporate earnings in Asian markets such as Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. In spite of the recent rise in prices in Hong Kong they are prepared to pay only about 14 times future earnings. This level is above the historical trend, suggesting that either the market is in the process of being re-rated upwards to south-east Asian levels, or that a savage correction downwards could be in the offing. By the end of the year Hong Kong could be coming to terms with a rupture in Anglo-Chinese relations brought about by the inability of London and Beijing to agree a way forward for Hong Kong's political system. But even though Mr Patten is discussing scenarios for the endgame of the talks in London this week, the optimism generated by the rising market has led many to maintain that the governor and his political reforms are irrelevant. In the words of Mr Peter Churchouse, Morgan Stanley's chief strategist in Hong Kong: 'Even if the talks break down, so what? Is that going to cause any blow-up in the China story? I don't think so.' Others are not so sure. Says Mr Hart of Crosby: 'Ultimately, a breakdown in talks must have some effect. A lame-duck government for three and a half years cannot be interpreted as good news.' More seriously, US-China relations are strained. The US wants to see an improvement in China's human rights record - which it has linked to further renewal of China's most favoured nation (MFN) trading status. It also wants it to honour agreements to open the Chinese market to US goods and services. As one broker observed: 'The big political event this month is not Patten in London but Clinton and Jiang (Zemin, China's president) in Seattle', where it is hoped that more workable relations can be established. The loss of MFN for China would hit Hong Kong in several important ways. As the main processor of China's external trade, Hong Kong's domestic economy would suffer a loss of income by virtue of reduced trade between China and the US. Additionally, it would lose from the knock-on effects of slower growth in China feeding through to lower incomes for Hong Kong's companies on the mainland. However, in spite of this uncertainty, the flow of US money into Hong Kong is unlikely to be stemmed immediately by concerns about politics or warnings of corrections. The amount of money flowing into US mutual funds (equivalent to UK unit trusts) - possibly as much as Dollars 200bn this year - is huge; it has to go somewhere, and a chunk of it will be dedicated to buying China through Hong Kong. In a world starved of investment opportunities, Asia holds promising rewards: Hong Kong the most promising. 'Hong Kong might be a bit frothy, but you come back to it by a process of elimination,' says Mr Hart. 'Hong Kong still beats most (other Asian markets) on the basis of valuation.' Says Ms Wai Chin, south-east Asian analyst at the US investment group, Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark: 'Essentially, an investment in Hong Kong today is an investment in the growth potential of China because the economies are so linked . . . If you believe the economic reforms will continue in China, Hong Kong can only benefit.' That is the 'if' with which investors have to grapple. For the time being, at least, it is one which an increasing number of foreign fund managers have responded to in the affirmative. As to who is the 'greater fool' - those now buying or those now selling - the next 12 months should prove decisive.</p>

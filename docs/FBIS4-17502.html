			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yuriy Selivanov report in the "Navy" column: "Where Will </F> the Ukraine Navy Be Based? It Seems That the `Odessa Incident'  Has Turned Out Badly for Ukraine"]    [Text] Presidents are known to reach accord in principle,  relying on corresponding ministers and experts for details. In  this respect the latest Moscow round of talks on the Black Sea  Fleet problem was not an exception. Yet, as it transpired, this  time the framework of the general agreement reached appeared too  broad for the defense ministers of Russia and Ukraine, who met  in Sevastopol, to come to any mutual understanding. True,  despite the general vagueness of the formula coordinated in  Moscow, it has one perfectly unambiguous point: Both presidents  state the impossibility of joint basing of the two countries'  navies. No doubt, this conclusion was precipitated by the  "Odessa incident" which occurred shortly prior to the Moscow  meeting, in the course of which military servicemen of the two  countries all but started shooting one another.    It is hard to tell what, except emotions, moved Leonid  Kravchuk to agree to the principle of separate navy basing; yet  pretty soon it became clear that he has thus driven the Ukraine  Navy into a corner. Two days later Kiev realized this and made  a U-turn: It again started saying that Sevastopol should be an  area for the joint basing of the Ukraine and Russian Navies.  The reason for such a panicky change of position is evident.  It suddenly emerged that the Ukraine Navy, apart from  Sevastopol where it is now located, simply has nowhere else to  go. And although there are plenty of naval bases on the  Ukrainian Black Sea coast, the option of redeploying the Ukraine  Navy somewhere in Donuzlav or moreover Odessa appears quite  fantastic. Hundreds, and in the future thousands, of Ukraine  navy officers will simply refuse to move from their cozy  Sevastopol apartments to a place where nothing is waiting for  them. Therefore Kiev's agreement to withdraw its fleet from  Sevastopol is almost synonymous with losing the fleet itself.  At any rate, the greater part of its officer corps. Aware of  this, Ukraine's Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy during the  talks in Sevastopol sought to contest the sole specific  agreement reached by the presidents -- on separate basing of the  fleets. Yet nothing came of this plan.    The presidents' points of view, coordinated in Moscow, have  touched off an avalanche of irreversible consequences for  Ukraine. Crimean and Sevastopol city authorities came into the  game, confirming unequivocally their extremely negative attitude  to the Ukraine Navy's being based in Sevastopol.    Apparently feeling that things have gone too far, Leonid  Kravchuk, after returning to Kiev, confirmed that Sevastopol  will be a base of the Russian Navy, although -- he added in the  same breath -- it will remain a Ukrainian city. This approach  will hardly arouse particular enthusiasm among the Ukraine  seamen who have been placed in a quandary by their own  president. It is perfectly obvious that Russia, relying on the  presidents' agreements in Moscow, will not back down, especially  given that in Sevastopol the Russian Navy is today assured  100-percent public and political support.    The Ukraine Navy has been left with only two options, one  worse than the other: Either to hold on to Sevastopol no matter  what, which, apart from other things, is fraught with the threat  of perennial conflicts between the two navies; or to look for a  new basing location, therefore running the risk of being left  without the seamen.    It is clear today that the so-called "Odessa incident,"  which  demonstrated graphically the impossibility of the navies'  coexistence, has ill served Kiev, forcing Leonid Kravchuk to  accept the separate basing idea. In light of this, the  excessive excitability demonstrated by the Ukraine military in  the course of the Odessa events, which manifested itself in an  unprovoked armed seizure of the 318th Black Sea Fleet Division,  turned out to be a provocation against Ukraine's own interests,  whose consequences Kiev will be hard put to neutralize. Unless,  of course, one presumes that the provocation organically fits  into a certain confrontation scenario, which is today a subject  of extensive discussion by many analysts in Kiev.</p>

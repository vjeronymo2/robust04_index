President Ramiro de Leon Carpio threatened today to turn  over  the transportation routes to new companies if the strike is not  lifted, but the strikers insist on maintaining it until the  government agrees to approve a new regulation for the sector  that would enable it to increase its profits.    More than 40 percent of gas stations have been left without  fuel in the capital and the interior, according to estimates of  the National Transportation Coordinating Board (CNT), which  organized the strike. This means the country might be at a  standstill before the weekend.    Urban transportation, which is not participating in the  movement, has, nevertheless, had to reduce services to maintain  fuel reserves. Meanwhile, the Chamber of Industries and other  business organizations have urged the parties to resume the  dialogue. The transporters are asking for an increase in rates  and greater profit margins as well as new regulations for their  sector.    The government has not officially replied to the demands,  though Finance Minister Ana Molina has said "five points have  already been accepted." She did not specify the points.    Meanwhile, government workers have begun a staggered strike  to demand higher salaries, increasing the pressure on President  de Leon Carpio.    Local observers believe the government suffered a political  setback on 30 January with the results of a referendum that  approved a series of reforms promoted by the government but that  registered an 85-percent rate of abstention, which has cast  doubt on the legitimacy of the changes.</p>

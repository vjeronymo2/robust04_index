			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Du Pont cuts 860 UK jobs as global rethink on nylon starts DU PONT, the world's biggest nylon supplier, is to shut a factory in Pontypool, South Wales, and cut production at three other sites with the loss of 860 jobs. The job cuts, more than 17 per cent of the company's UK workforce in nylon, are at plants Du Pont bought from Imperial Chemical Industries in July. Further losses could follow early next year after an in-house analysis of Du Pont's world nylon activities. Mr Alan Titus, managing director of Du Pont Nylon Europe, blamed overcapacity in world markets, duplication of production with US and German plants, and a drift from nylon to other synthetic fibres for clothing and carpet textiles. Pontypool will lose 400 jobs when a nylon textile filament plant and associated site services shut at the end of the year. Another plant in Pontypool, which makes the Dacron nylon brand, will stay open. A further 250 jobs will be lost in Brockworth, Gloucestershire, which has a technical centre that is 'too big for the size and quality of the European nylon business', said Mr Titus. Some 150 jobs will be lost at Doncaster, South Yorkshire, as Du Pont ends production of carpet staple fibre - the short sections of nylon filament that are later spun into yarn. The final 60 jobs are to go at Wilton, Cleveland, as part of a general cost-cutting programme. Du Pont said it would be looking for voluntary redundancies and redeployment but that 'involuntary separations will probably be required at some sites'. Mr Titus warned of possible further job cuts. 'This first phase is doing things that appear obvious to us,' said Mr Titus. 'It does not represent a position of sustained financial health.' Last week, Du Pont's global nylon business began 'a fundamental analysis of our entire operations to develop further plans to get us back on the path to sustained profitability.' The UK nylon plants have already borne a series of job reduction programmes. When talks on the deal with ICI began in April 1992, there were 6,100 on the payroll in Europe, the number falling to 5,200 when ICI handed over control. Another 220 job losses in Oestringen, south of Frankfurt, Germany, were also announced yesterday, as well as a further 80 spread throughout European plants. The cuts follow 1,600 job cuts two weeks ago in Du Pont north American nylon production sites. At the time, Du Pont's US management warned that there would be job cuts in Europe.</p>

			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Sale of Railtrack may raise Pounds 3.5bn before next election The government plans to privatise Railtrack, the railway infrastructure company, before the next election, in a public sale which could be worth up to Pounds 3.5bn. The Treasury and the Department of Transport believe Railtrack's move into the private sector could be completed at the end of the 1995-96 financial year. Ministers from both departments are confident it would receive cabinet backing since it would be the final act of railway privatisation and would not need primary legislation. 'Unlike Post Office privatisation, the sale of Railtrack would be relatively free of controversy,' said one minister. The flotation of the company owning rail track and signalling has been given greater impetus by the Department of Trade and Industry's victory in its battle with the Treasury to delay privatisation of the nuclear industry until after the general election. A value of about Pounds 3.5bn is expected to be placed on Railtrack. While some officials believe it could be worth up to Pounds 4bn, ministers believe a lower value is more realistic because of the 'high public policy risk'. Railtrack is reliant for most of its revenue on track access charges, which private rail companies have to pay for the right to run their trains on the national rail network. While the access charges are set by Railtrack, they have to be approved by the rail regulator. A franchising director will be responsible for allocating subsidies to the franchisees run by private rail companies, British Rail management buy-outs or directly by BR. Although any Railtrack prospectus would have to spell out the regulator's intentions on future access charges, potential investors may still be concerned that the regulator could force Railtrack to lower its charges. Until the end of 1996 the regulator must also take account of 'any guidance' from the transport secretary. However, ministers dismiss the possibility of government interference when the company is privatised. Mr Bob Horton, chairman of Railtrack, has said publicly that the government's railway bill has paved the way for his company's privatisation. He believes there is no need for a commercially driven public sector organisation to be subject to what he called 'the full detailed panoply of nationalised industry controls'. Ministers have yet to decide whether all the shares in a private Railtrack should be sold at once or whether the government should continue with a minority stake. Their intention, however, is to sell all the company at the earliest possible opportunity. Lex, Page 20</p>

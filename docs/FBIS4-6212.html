			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, Apr 18 (ANTARA) -- Chairman of the  Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry Aburizal Bakrie  affirmed that employers in Medan are willing to increase the  wages of their employees but only if their demands are  reasonable.    The workers' demand for a pay increase to 7,000 rupiah  (around US$3.33) per day is unreasonable compared to the  regional minimum wage of only 3,100 rupiah per day (around  US$1.5), Bakrie told a press conference after a meeting with  President Suharto at Merdeka Palace [Presidential Palace] Monday.    The conflict began in Medan on Thursday when more than  10,000  workers went on strike to demand higher wages and holiday bonus  payments. The demonstration ended in a riot following the death  of one worker. More than a hundred shops were ransacked and  dozens of cars were set ablaze.    Indonesian police and troops in armoured cars remain on  alert, guarding Medan's industrial areas, particularly on the  city's outskirts where most of the rioting took place.</p>

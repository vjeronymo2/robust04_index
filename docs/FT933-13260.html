			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / International Company News: Awaiting life in an altered state - The removal of uncertainty for Rhone-Poulenc Within the next 10 days, the French government is due to announce the names of the first companies it plans to sell as part of its ambitious privatisation programme. It is a reasonable bet that Rhone-Poulenc, one of the world's 10 largest chemicals group, will be near the top of the list. 'Rhone-Poulenc and Elf (the state-owned oil company) are running neck and neck,' said Mr Gerard Longuet, industry minister, recently. A series of share placings, the most recent in January, has already reduced the state's direct shareholding in Rhone-Poulenc to about 43 per cent, with a further 20 per cent being held by state-controlled institutions. But for investors already holding Rhone-Poulenc shares, and for potential investors in France and elsewhere, the prospect of full privatisation focuses attention on the group's prospects and how they might be affected by the expected sale. For Mr Jean-Pierre Tirouflet, Rhone-Poulenc finance director, the main advantage of privatisation would be a removal of uncertainty. 'Since 1985 we have been constantly told by the government that we will be privatised or we will stay in the public sector. It is very difficult to lead a constant financial policy or a normal relationship with shareholders with such uncertainty and it impedes the ability of the company to finance itself on the market.' The problem takes two forms. On the one hand, shareholders must take account not only of the company's management and strategy in evaluating Rhone-Poulenc's stock, but also of the state's intentions and the possibility that between FFr12bn (Dollars 2.04bn) and FFr15bn of new shares may come on to the market following a sale of the government's stake. At the same time, raising new capital through share issues is complicated by the need to time the issues with the process of obtaining approval from the government. From a financial perspective, therefore, Mr Tirouflet has little doubt; 'the sooner privatisation, the better'. In another important respect, however, privatisation would involve greater uncertainty. The sale of the government's stake would remove a stable investor and raise the question of the future shareholding structure. The solution, according to Mr Tirouflet, is the creation of a noyau dur, a core of long-term shareholders to replace the state. 'We need strong shareholders on board with deep financial interests,' he says. 'We would like them to be from different areas and ideally to include an industrial company.' In terms of the day-to-day running of the business, however, the company believes life after privatisation will remain fairly constant. 'We have not had uneconomical interference and have managed to change substantially while being a state-owned company.' This change has involved a far-reaching restructuring of the company since Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou took over as chairman and chief executive in 1986. The group has moved away from bulk chemicals and increased its presence in higher value added markets such as pharmaceuticals. In 1990, for example, Rhone-Poulenc merged its healthcare business with Rorer of the US, becoming the world's tenth largest pharmaceuticals company. Over the past five years, the group has spent about FFr40bn on acquisitions and disposed of about 80 affiliated companies. Last year alone, the value of disposals totalled more than FFr4bn. The reorganisation is not finished, nor may it ever be. 'I don't think stability is a target,' says Mr Tirouflet. 'You think you have the right balance and then the markets change or you develop a new product and your outlook is different.' The restructuring of the specialty chemicals division is still not complete and further consolidation is expected in the group's fibres activities. The programme of disposals also continues apace. Earlier this month, Rhone-Poulenc sold its 35 per cent stake in Roussel-Uclaf, the specialty chemicals business, which will raise about FFr4.5bn. Last week, the group announced it was cutting a quarter of the jobs at its French fibres business. The restructuring of the group has increased its resilience to difficult market conditions, in particular the effects of European recession, the sharp fall in prices for fibres such as nylon and polyester, the depressed market for base chemicals and pressures on healthcare expenditure in some of its principal markets. Last year, the group raised net profits by 23 per cent to FFr1.52bn, albeit on the basis of modest earnings in 1991. This year, the conditions facing the company remain difficult. 'The chemical industry is in one of its most serious crises in recent history,' according to Mr Tirouflet. The group's agricultural division is suffering from reduced demand resulting from cuts in production arising from Europe's common agricultural policy, while prices for fibre products continue to fall in response to cheap imports from eastern Europe. In the first quarter of this year, the group's sales of fibres in Europe fell by about 25 per cent. Despite the economic environment, however, most analysts expect another increase in profits this year. Mrs Catherine Leveu, chemicals analyst at Cholet Dupont Credit Lyonnais, argues that the strength of the pharmaceuticals business and reduced financial charges resulting from the sharp reduction in French interest rates since the advent of the new government in March, should enable the group to achieve net profits of about FFr1.75bn this year with another increase in 1994. How attractive this appears to investors will become clear after the green light is given by the government. The main concern for the company is that it is appealing enough to form a noyau dur to ease the upheaval of a move to the private sector.  ----------------------------------------------------------- RHONE-POULENC (FFR BN)  -----------------------------------------------------------                          1990      1991      1992  ----------------------------------------------------------- Net sales                78.4      83.8      81.7 Operating income          4.6       6.3       6.8 Net income                1.1       1.2       1.5 Capital expenditure       7.5       7.7       5.8  -----------------------------------------------------------</p>

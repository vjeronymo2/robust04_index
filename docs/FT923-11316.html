			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / International Company News: Chicago insurer to pay Dollars 475m for Frank B. Hall AON Corporation, the acquisitive Chicago-based insurance group, yesterday emerged as the buyer of Frank B. Hall, the troubled insurance broking subsidiary of Mr Saul Steinberg's Reliance Group. Hall, which ranks as seventh biggest broker in the world with revenues of Dollars 462m in 1991, takes in Leslie &amp; Godwin, the leading Lloyd's broker. Aon will pay Dollars 475m for most of Hall's assets, with the consideration comprising Dollars 125m in cash, Dollars 225m in 8 per cent cumulative preferred stock and Dollars 125m in 6.25 per cent cumulative convertible exchangeable preferred stock. The deal makes Aon, which owns the Rollins Burdick Hunter insurance broking operations, the third-largest US brokerage. It is the latest in a series of realignments in the highly-competitive insurance broking industry. Rollins Burdick Hunter has been expanding operations in Europe, where it acquired the Dutch broker, Hudig Langeveldt, last year. Aon's presence in the London insurance market, where the group owns a 40 per cent stake in Nicholson Chamberlain Colls, is increased. Leslie &amp; Godwin, has, like NCC, been a strong player in the aviation insurance market and has a significant retail network in the UK. Hall, which has made losses in the four of the last five years, has had a troubled history. It was embroiled in a series of lawsuits during the 1980s centred mainly on discontinued or formerly-owned direct underwriting subsidiaries, including Union Indemnity which was eventually declared insolvent. Under yesterday's deal, Aon will take on only some of Hall's liabilities. Those related to Union Indemnity, and any 'errors and omissions' claims against Hall will be excluded. The buyer will not assume Hall's Dollars 75m of bank debt nor indebtedness to Reliance. Reliance will provide Dollars 18m a year of reinsurance brokerage commissions to Aon, for 15 years. Reliance, a New York-based financial services group controlled by Mr Steinberg, owns about 70 per cent of Hall. It said that it expected to show a gain of about Dollars 50m after tax when the sale is completed. The remaining shares in Hall are quoted, and once the asset sale is completed, what remains of Hall will be merged into another Reliance subsidiary and Hall shareholders will receive 0.625 shares in Reliance for each Hall share owned.</p>

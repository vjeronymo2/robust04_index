The meeting was joined by Premier Vladimir Meciar after his  return from Brussels, where he signed the Partnership for Peace  plan at NATO's headquarters.    The Slovak parliament was stalemated last week when the  deputies from the government Movement For a Democratic Slovakia  (HZDS) and the Slovak National Party (SNS) walked out of the  parliament at the moment when the coalition's and the  opposition's balance of forces was 75-75.    Ivan Laluha, former chairman of the HZDS Group, told  journalists that "this situation cannot prevail. It is not  possible that a decision on whether or not the government  remains be made at every parliamentary meeting, because this  hampers the process of transformation. Early elections are one  of possible solutions."    Laluha as well as Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik came out  against Meciar's proposal to solve the situation through a  referendum.    In it citizens would decide on whether or not the deputies  who left the parties and movements for which they had been  elected to the parliament should leave the parliament. In this  way, the government camp would gain back the parliamentary  majority.</p>

			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Persil wars go to adverts watchdog The Advertising Standards Authority yesterday became the latest battleground in the soap wars between Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble. Lever Brothers, UK detergents subsidiary of the Anglo-Dutch group Unilever, wrote to the authority complaining about newspaper advertisements taken out by Procter which criticise Unilever's new-generation soap powder. The detergent, which recently went on the market in the UK as Persil Power, contains a manganese-based ingredient, which Unilever calls the 'accelerator'. Procter claims that independent tests show the accelerator can damage some fabrics, causing fading and holes. The advertisements, first seen in Saturday's newspapers, do not name Persil Power but are, said Lever, a clear attack on the product. One version of the advertisement states that 'Only Ariel (Procter's rival product) washes so clean yet so safe' and stresses that Ariel 'does not contain' the accelerator. Another version makes similarly unfavourable comparisons between another Procter product, Fairy, and Persil Power. Procter also alleges in the advertisements that the manganese stays in clothes after washing and so could damage fabrics even if consumers switch to another brand. Lever said yesterday that Procter's advertising campaign was 'unprecedented'. Mr Tim Hammond, Lever's fabrics marketing director, said it was essential to put the record straight not only for the company's benefit, but for the industry as a whole. The complaint to the authority challenges Procter's claims that its products are superior as well as questioning the basis of the tests referred to, and substantiation for the 'carry-over' effect of the manganese. Unilever said its own laboratory tests show that Persil Power is both safe and effective. Mr Hammond said: 'The charges add nothing new. The advertising campaign is part of a continuing attempt to clear the ground prior to their own product launch in September. Time is running out for them because, far from rejecting Persil, consumers across the country are buying and using it in even greater quantities.' Procter is due to launch its own new-generation powder, Ariel Future, in Germany in the autumn. The new detergent will not contain manganese. Results of tests on Persil Power by the independent Consumers' Association are not expected for 10 weeks. Marks and Spencer, which is conducting its own examination of the powder, has yet to decide whether to make the results public. It is likely that an investigation by the advertising watchdog will take some weeks.</p>

			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Observer: As seen on TV Buy that man a drink. Nice to see that Christopher Morgan, Asil Nadir's unpaid PR man, hasn't lost his sense of humour. Amid all the other calls he had to field last week was one from surveyors Stirling Ackroyd, wondering if Morgan's infamous overseas client might be interested in re-investing in the London property market. Although the investment in question was being handled by upmarket rivals Richard Ellis, acting for a bank whose overseas client had gone bust, the man from Stirling Ackroyd felt Morgan's client ought to be alerted to one of the hottest properties currently on the market - 12-16 Elm Street, home of the Serious Fraud Office.</p>

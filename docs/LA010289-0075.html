			<p><P> January 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOWARD ROSENBERG: POTOMAC 'POWER GAME' -- RULE NO. 1 IS . . . TAKE CARE OF NO.  1  </P> <P> What a thrill it is to visit Washington, stroll the Capitol, tour the great  edifices of liberty, glory in the traditions of democracy and see the elected  representatives of the people governing.  </P> <P> Or whatever it is they do.  </P> <P> "Before you save the world, you gotta save your seat," says California  Congressman George Miller.  </P> <P> Ah, yes. Down from the clouds we plummet, crashing into the hard tundra of  political reality. Miller's pragmatic words, spoken on the premiere of a PBS  series titled "The Power Game," epitomize what appears to be the primary  mission of many, if not most members of Congress. Not survival of the universe.  Not survival of the United States.  </P> <P> Survival of self.  </P> <P> Taking care of No. 1. That's the main theme of tonight's instructive hour about  Congress (at 8 p.m. on Channels 28 and 15; 10 p.m. on Channel 24) opening this  week's four-part series adapted from reporter/host Hedrick Smith's book about  the inside workings of Washington. Tuesday's program tackles the Pentagon,  Wednesday's, such unelected power brokers as the media and Thursday's, the  presidency.  </P> <P> The drive to remain in office is primordial in politics. Yet Smith credits the  Congressional Class of '74 -- a group of reformers who changed the rules of the  power game -- with perfecting the techniques of survival to the extent that we  now may have only a three-day Congress.  </P> <P> Many members remain in Washington only Tuesday through Thursday, spending the  other days back home, protecting their incumbencies by informally stumping and  raising the funds they need for their TV-minded reelection campaigns. The  survival obsession may be steadier in the House, which has two-year terms, than  in the Senate, whose members are elected every six years. Yet the obsession is  shared by both bodies.  </P> <P> The average Senate campaign alone costs $3 million, we're told. Handshakings  and mailings help. But the cornerstone of the "constant campaign," as Smith  labels it, is media exposure.  </P> <P> "American politics is money and 30-second spots," laments former Missouri Sen.  Thomas Eagleton. "The modern young candidates -- the Dick Gephardts, the Al  Gores -- can talk in 10 seconds, 20 and 30. You just tell 'em what you want,  and they go click, click, click, click. Old-fashioned politicians like me take  three weeks to answer something."  </P> <P> Or as former House Speaker Tip O'Neill's one-time media adviser Chris Matthews  puts it: "The old guys schmooze, the new guys broadcast."  </P> <P> And broadcast and broadcast.  </P> <P> Smith sees New York Congressman (and Class of '74 member) Stephen J. Solarz as  the prototypical media swifty and "master of all survival games." Regular  viewers of network newscasts will attest to that.  </P> <P> The Solarz mastery includes making an impression on the folks back home by  shrewdly getting his mug on camera for positive reasons again and again. That  includes this program, ironically, for even as his power game is being replayed  and critically analyzed by Smith, the media-smart Solarz uses the camera to  impressively convey action, movement and concern.  </P> <P> The vast majority of Congress with less access to national TV than Solarz is  not left out either. Forget the old-fashioned mimeograph. Republicans and  Democrats maintain their own impressive media operations that enable their  congressional members to make and beam back video press releases to their  constituencies via satellite.  </P> <P> Smith calls this "mass marketing with a home touch." The Democrats used the  technique at their national convention in Atlanta, operating their own studio  inside the convention center from which office holders and other prominent  Democrats taped messages for their constituencies or conducted live satellite  interviews with TV reporters in their home districts. With any luck, they made  the local news.  </P> <P> A favorite stage in Washington is the Capitol lawn, where tonight we see  members of Congress in the role of propagandists for their voting philosophies  and, not incidentally, themselves. One after another, these video hucksters  queue up before a camera and make virtually identical statements tailored for  local newscasts back home: "The trade bill is extremely important to this  country and to my district. . . . "  </P> <P> "And," you wish they'd add, "my own survival is extremely important to me."  </P> <P> So important, perhaps, that for many members of Congress the drive to save  one's seat is so consuming that little time or energy remains for saving the  world.  </P></p>

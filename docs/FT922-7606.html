			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / The Olympia &amp; York Insolvency: US creditors scramble to assess likely impact OLYMPIA &amp; YORK'S US busi-ness associates, bank creditors and bondholders scrambled yesterday to assess the likely impact of the company's US and Canadian bankruptcy petitions, with several saying they thought the company might eventually have to file on behalf of its main US property subsidiaries as well. O&amp;Y claimed its four filings for protection from creditors - under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law - were unlikely to affect the properties owned by O&amp;Y's operating subsidiaries. This was because the US filings did not concern O&amp;Y companies holding substantial portions of the 24m sq ft of office space in New York and 12.7m sq ft elsewhere in the US. But some O&amp;Y watchers, including a senior New York real estate executive who is advising an O&amp;Y creditor bank, said there was a distinct possibility that O&amp;Y would eventually have to seek a bankruptcy filing for its main US property businesses. He said: 'They may be able to save their US properties, but I think they'll have to file for Chapter 11 to do so. There will have to be a master financing at some point, internationally. Right now O&amp;Y needs so much new cash - not just to service debt, but to pay for upkeep and make necessary improvements in New York and elsewhere - that the size of the eventual debtor-in-possession financing will be enormous.' He and others predicted that O&amp;Y would have a difficult time trying to keep its Canadian, UK and US problems separate. He said working through the O&amp;Y problems could take two years. At present O&amp;Y's US property assets remain essentially unprotected - exposed to the potential impatience of creditors. The company said last night that it would continue discussing restructurings with 'the few lenders in the US whose loans are affected'. It said a reasonable solution could be found in the US without resorting to Chapter 11. But US bankers quickly started putting out the word that they were still reviewing the situation. The US banks with the largest O&amp;Y exposure - Citicorp with Dollars 380m, Chemical with about Dollars 225m and JP Morgan with about Dollars 50m - watched their share prices skid in early trading. Prices recovered by the end of trading, with Citicorp down  3/8 at Dollars 19 5/8 , Chemical down 1/2 at Dollars 37 1/2 and Morgan down  5/8 at Dollars 55 Few analysts expect the O&amp;Y crisis to have much further impact on the banking system. This is partly because most of the main bank creditors made substantial bad debt provisions on their O&amp;Y debt in the first quarter of this year. Nor is the O&amp;Y crisis expected to have much of an impact on the already depressed US commercial real estate market. JP Morgan, which has led a group of other creditors in a move to foreclose on a series of O&amp;Y interest rate swaps that were pledged as collateral on a Dollars 160m loan, is expected to go ahead with the auction next Friday. The planned disposal ought not to be affected because the O&amp;Y company in the US used as the swap counterparty is not among those that filed for bankruptcy.</p>

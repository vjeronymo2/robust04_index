A View of the Results of the Parliamentary Elections  From the Angle of Our Immediate Future"]    [Text] Hoping That Fate Itself Has Not Toyed Too  Long...    I cannot shake off the thought that once again -- I am  referring to the parliamentary elections and Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy's unexpected success -- unknown laws of the  historical process are toying with us.    The success of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]  is at the same time an answer to the historically significant  question of whether revenge by communism is possible in the  foreseeable future. The answer is: It is not possible. This  is also a shattering defeat for the bloc of national-patriotic  forces grouped around the newspaper DEN and similar publications  and exemplified by the National Salvation Front [NSF]. Who  remembers the NSF now? Yet only a little while ago its leaders  were terrorizing the Supreme Soviet, calling the political tune  for Ruslan Khasbulatov, and making a puppet of Aleksandr  Rutskoy; it was primarily they who were the source of the threat  of a constitutional coup, they who were the organizers of direct  actions to seize power, as demonstrated 3-4 October.    So far we have twice witnessed the phenomenon of self-defeat  by the forces of the past: communism as a social system in 1991  and the soviets as the organ of state power of that system in  1993. Maybe in Zhirinovskiy and his LDPR we have a new  phenomenon -- the phenomenon of self-exposure. In other words,  the transformation into a dead end of the destructive energy  gradually accumulated over the years and the decades in society  during the years of communist rule and later generated by every  conceivable and inconceivable means by the NSF leaders, other  communopatriotic organizations, and also the mass media. It has  already happened more than once in history that the danger of a  particular social phenomenon has been removed because it has  suddenly acquired grotesque features in society's eyes. That is  not a categorical assertion; rather it is an assumption or  hypothesis.  <H5>  The Same Two Poles All Over Again? </H5>   "What a strange and fateful country is Russia!" Ilya  Erenburg  wrote in his article "The Poles," published in Kiev in 1919.  "It is as though the only colors left for it on the divine  palette were black and white." You cannot help recalling these  words when you think about what may lie in store for us. The  two years until the next parliamentary and presidential  elections in our dramatic life will probably move as swiftly as  a play based on a book by Agatha Christie. And what will  happen? The political center has collapsed as an influential  force, and the polarization among the political elite has  unfortunately also affected society itself, albeit not yet on a  large scale. As yet there is no sign of either a second or a  third echelon to take the place of the current democrats without  detriment to our future civilized development. Yet at present  radical trends are merely gathering strength.    Experience of postsocialist development in Europe shows that  the parties that have undertaken the extremely difficult mission  of transforming the deathly economy and deathly political system  into something viable with mechanisms for self-development  through their reforming activity at the same time call into  being negative processes and phenomena in the socioeconomic and  spiritual and moral spheres which mean that they are usually  defeated in the next elections. Their defeat is usually to the  benefit of left-wing forces that have emerged from communism.  Lithuania, Poland -- the list goes on.    At present we have no such forces, and there is not even  any sign of them. When Viktor Ilyukhin, one of the leaders of  the CPRF [Communist Party of the Russian Federation], was asked  about the party's drift toward social democracy, he answered in  the negative, claiming that this is just tactics. "If we had  approached voters with extreme left-wing slogans, we would  inevitably have lost the elections." That is frank. In the  pure bolshevik style.    But neither do we have any sign of an alternative on the  right of the current ruling democrats. "Yabloko"  [Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc]? The PRUA [Party of Russian  Unity and Accord]? It is doubtful. Maybe, instead of the  possible transformation of the Communists into social democrats,  a bloc will emerge on the left made up partly of  "Gorbachevites," partly of industrialists, partly of agrarians,  and partly of moderate nationalists? In short, at present we  are left with the same old gloomy bipolar picture. Will the  Communists be replaced by nationalists? In general the current  authorities have to forecast what the political spectrum may be  in two years' time. And not only forecast it, but so far as  possible channel the social process in a civilized direction.  <H5>  Zhirinovskiy As a Barometer of Russians' Social Temperature </H5>   Nevertheless, let us return to our topic, so to speak. The  wave of emotion in viewing the election results has abated. The  hysterics from the particularly "neurotic" section of our  intelligentsia have largely ended. Admittedly, a new round of  moaning about other topics has begun. A considerable proportion  of the intelligentsia has never grasped the simple truth that  democracy is an expensive and troublesome business, and the  intelligentsia's characteristic maximalist approach is totally  unacceptable here.    So the time has come for more civilized assessments,  profound  analysis of what has happened, trustworthy conclusions, and  appropriate decisions. The tone of the serious press,  statements by representatives of the establishment, and recent  steps by the president show that the decline in the population's  interest in the elections and referendum, the LDPR's unexpected  success, and the unrealized hopes of "Russia's Choice" have been  seen as a warning. And it has been heeded. The immediate future  will indicate whether it has been properly heeded. However, a  few fundamentally important details of the latest scene in the  Russian political drama remain backstage. Nor can the audience  see the prompters. Not everything is clear about the LDPR's  success. At the same time it is totally obvious that however we  describe Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's ideological and political views  (neofascism, national-chauvinism, and so forth), however we  explain his success, and whatever future we forecast for this  success, today we are living in a different Russia from the  country that existed prior to the elections. Neither better nor  worse -- simply different. Reality is becoming increasingly  complex and increasingly multidimensional, with more and more  factors determining the vector of social development, and this  development itself is becoming less and less unilinear and  predictable.    Essentially Russia is now different from the old familiar  country that existed on the eve of the elections. It is simply  that many of us have failed to notice this. We have failed to  notice that the rules of the political game have changed  fundamentally. The multiparty system and free access by parties  to the mass media, the different capacities of different  participants in the election campaign to pay for and exploit  airtime, in general the different approaches toward the election  campaign itself, the absence of an established political culture  and traditions of parliamentarianism, and the pursuit of  different moral (or immoral) imperatives objectively also  created different conditions of political struggle. It's like  the proverb: Nothing ventured, nothing gained.  <H5>  Dangerous Specter </H5>   But, as the saying goes, every cloud has a silver lining.  Rephrasing our unforgettable classics, let us say that the  elections highlighted a specter that has begun to haunt Russia  -- the specter of authorities that are out of touch with the  people. So when the democratic public, frightened by  Zhirinovskiy's neo-Nazi slogans and appeals, hastens to set up  an antifascist movement in the country, I assert the following.  Yes, such a movement must be created for we have already come  face to face with fascism during the 3-4 October events. But  the antifascist movement, if it is destined to exist, must not  be reduced to the struggle against the LDPR. I emphasize, I  constantly have the feeling that the "Zhirinovskiy phenomenon,"  for all its possible dangers, is merely a timely warning to  society. An even more serious danger -- unless, of course, the  response is appropriate to the challenge -- may emerge from  behind the not overly broad back of Vladimir Volfovich or from  another direction entirely. Furthermore, his success has come as  a surprise to Zhirinovskiy himself, and developments during the  realization of this success may come as a surprise to us.    The prevailing opinion is emerging that Zhirinovskiy  skillfully reaped a harvest that he had certainly not sown. In  other words, the votes for the LDPR were a transmogrified  protest by our citizens against current living conditions.  Correct. But this is not only a social protest, although that  may be the predominant element. Discontent has built up in many  areas. That is on top of the fact that many people have lost  their accustomed status. And on top of the extremely negative  fact of the lumpenization of a considerable section of the  intelligentsia.    First, there is crime and corruption. This is also a social  and, as we know, serious problem, although it is mixed up with a  lot of half-truths and downright lies thanks to the endeavors of  the opponents of reform and the superficiality of our journalism  and simply of stupid people. It will take more than three  months, three years, or even thirty years to put a stop to them.  Crime, corruption included, will exist as long as man lives,  given that he is by no means a holy product of nature. This is  shown by the experience of the most stable, "well fed," and  law-abiding nations. In any case, we by no means lead the world  in terms of the number of crimes.    The problem, in my view, lies in, on the one hand, sharply  reducing the most dangerous and worrying types of crime,  especially organized crime, and, on the other, convincing  society of the seriousness of the authorities' intentions, so  that the crude lie about the "criminal revolution" and "criminal  authorities" does not stick like mud to the reformers,  particularly in the upper echelon of power. However, there is  just one aspect to the problem. The reformers themselves must  be clean, and the president and premier must be uncompromising  in combating this evil. There is more need of glasnost here  than in any other sphere. We must create conditions in which it  is difficult for corruption to spread.    Second, many people are feeling bad about the disintegration  of the USSR, many people still have relatives in nearby foreign  countries. Many people have lost their accustomed links and  contacts and their accustomed way of life. Not to mention those  for whom identity as an empire and superpower is the supreme  value in itself; who would reduce their own mother to poverty  for the sake of reveling in our military might and experiencing  paroxysms of joy at the very thought that we are feared in the  world and regarded as an "evil empire" and that we are capable  of destroying all life on earth several times over; and who  seriously believe in the possibility of restoring the USSR or  the Russian empire and are prepared to countenance a bloodbath  for this. All this must be explained to people. But there is a  need for particular tact here. However, we must also tell the  truth: Attempts to save the USSR by force would have meant a  real tragedy for the peoples.    Third, not only history, but also the communopatriots were  on  Zhirinovskiy's side. Revanchist forces conducted real  psychological warfare against the president, the democrats, and  Russian democracy in general effectively under the protection of  the Supreme Soviet. The nationalists, together with the  communists, managed to create in the eyes of a section of the  Russian people a false image of a humiliated country acting at  the bidding of the West and especially the United States and  selling off its national assets. As though following the  behests of Dr. Goebbels, the communopatriotic press kept on  repeating absurd, deliberately false and simply insulting claims  about Boris Yeltsin's "occupation regime," the "government of  national betrayal and treachery," and "colonial democracy,"  called for a "national liberation struggle," urged the people to  "rise up for a fight to the death," and so forth. In other  words, it created an "enemy image" not only outside but also  inside the country in an attempt to bring about the effect of  wounded national pride characterizing Germany on the eve of the  fascists' arrival in power. Clearly, this succeeded to some  extent. And this happened at a time when Russia, as the legal  successor to the USSR, remains a nuclear superpower and enjoys  great political clout in the world.    Fourth, when you consider that Zhirinovskiy is more of a  good  actor than a stage manager, his stage management is highly  professional. He not only "privatized" virtually all the sore  points of a society that has just embarked on the path of  transition from totalitarianism to democracy but also keeps in  mind the particular features of our national character and  traditions, taking account of our strong and weak points. His  attention focused on the following: the tendency of many of us  at least to rely on simple and speedy solutions, including  strong-arm solutions, the fear of independence, the habit at the  drop of a hat of looking to the all-powerful state, which has to  look after us, the continuing longing for a "master" who would  emerge and "impose order," and the ineradicable belief in  honeyed promises and simple gullibility.  <H5>  Even Cats Like a Kind Word </H5>   What do the many people tired of poverty and hungry for  rapid  change care about Gaydar's macroeconomic schemes when Vladimir  Volfovich promises to change life for the better as soon as they  vote for him! To some people he promises free underwear, to  others vodka, and to others entire countries on a plate.    Psychologists who have made a special study of the  personality of Zhirinovskiy have said how skillfully he exploits  the stereotypes of behavior which were developed in society over  many years of totalitarianism and which have by no means  vanished but have merely entered a state of latency and, given  the opportunity, are ready to immediately proclaim their  existence. Take the problem of the hatred that was constantly  fueled in Soviet society -- only its targets have changed. It  is simple to make political capital out of hatred that can be  easily aroused in conditions of crisis and directed against "yid  masons," or "Caucasian nationals," or those who are "selling the  homeland down the river."    The psychologists emphasized that direct criticism,  especially crude attacks on the LDPR leader, will inevitably  boomerang.    I don't know whether Zhirinovskiy would have been helped by  hypnosis or psychotherapy if the democrats in various blocs and  parties had not confused people; if society had not been in a  state of deep crisis; if many people had not been so disoriented  and troubled; and if the democrats had done what they ought to  have done as democrats right from the first steps in the  emergence of the new Russian statehood and new social system.    What is really bothering people? Poverty? Yes, of course.  But that is not what bothered us. The most oppressive thing is  the apparent lack of any glimmer of light or prospects for the  future. The disintegration of absolutely everything. The  collapse of familiar principles and the values established over  the years of Soviet power. The ones who find themselves in the  most difficult position are elderly people and in part young  people, many of whom are simply drifting with the current. Is  this not why so many young people followed in "Zhirinovskiy's  wake"?  <H5>  Where Are We Heading </H5>   Many people have simply lost their heads in the face of the  flourishing criminal business, raging "wild capitalism," the  insolent behavior of the "nouveaux riches," the rampant crime,  and the irritating behavior of our advertising, which has no  sense of proportion or tact, in the face of a whole series of  antisocial and antispiritual phenomena. They are fed up with  communism, alias real socialism, and they do not want any return  to the past, but they can in no way come to terms with what is  taking its place. It is natural for questions such as "What are  we building?" and "Where are we heading?" to arise in such  conditions.    And instead of attempting to answer these questions, to  remove our fellow citizens' concern, and to explain to them that  all this filth is the price society is forced to pay for the  crimes of communism, which pushed the country out of its natural  channel of development; that at the same time this is the price  that must be paid in order to create eventually normal economic  and social relations as the basis for our prosperity; that we  have to put up with this filth as other peoples have done in  order to avoid coming full circle and finding ourselves back in  long lines facing empty shelves in the stores like our Ukrainian  brothers, for instance; that we are almost on the point of more  or less getting out of this filth -- in the face of all this the  democrats arrogantly say: "We are laying the foundations of a  new society in accordance with common sense and world  experience, as other peoples have done."    The people want to know what our social ideal is, what our  new values are, what our new spirituality is. If their  questions are not answered by the democrats, they will turn --  and in part already are turning -- to other political forces.    In the extremely difficult struggle against the forces of  the  past, against the numerous and diverse forces of reaction, the  democrats have consciously or otherwise surrendered to their  political opponents some extremely important values revered by  the people and capable of rallying them in the fight for the  country's future. These include the ideals of social justice,  patriotism, statehood, and lofty spirituality. These values  must be won back without fail, especially as this process has  already begun. Unless, of course, the democrats want to be  defeated, thereby dooming the young Russian democracy to defeat  as well.    Last. In the years since August 1991 the democrats were  concerned primarily to destroy the material and spiritual  foundation of communism and prevent it from being revived. This  is understandable. The forces of revenge are a real threat to  our progress. But the focus of the struggle must now be  shifted. I am convinced that the only social model that can be  successfully implemented in our country is one which from the  outset attaches exceptionally great importance to the social  aspect of change and is geared, if you like, toward state  paternalism, as in Japan, and toward preventing severe social  contrasts. In the struggle between the two principles of  freedom and social justice that has dragged on over the  centuries, it is the latter that will triumph in our country  unless we succeed in harmonizing them.    And in this connection it is very annoying, no, very  worrying that the democratic authorities seem to have divested  themselves of everyday concern for people, or at any rate have  not created appropriate mechanisms for this. But people who  have grown up in the specific conditions of real socialism are  often not yet ready for the independence characteristic of other  countries. During the transitional period at least something  must take the place of raykoms [party rayon committees]. In  this sense Zhirinovskiy played the role of litmus paper. He  visited many krays and oblasts. He said what people wanted to  hear and flattered them. He praised. Persuaded. Reassured.  Promised. And people took this as a display of attention, as a  show of concern for them. And they responded.  <H5>  What Is To Be Done? </H5>   The first conclusion. The policy of reforms "in all  directions," so to speak, must be adjusted. I do not think it  should be fundamentally changed. A coalition government? I do  not think that would be sensible. Everything must be directed  toward easing the situation of the most underprivileged section  of the population as much as possible.    The task of combating crime and corruption must become just  as much of a priority. It is time to realize that these two  problems have become extremely acute sociopolitical, spiritual,  and moral problems, and the sympathies of the broad people's  masses will be won by the side that can prove that it is capable  of dealing with them.    The second conclusion. The government must react more  sensitively than ever to the mood of the masses, on the one  hand, and explain, persuade, and prove the correctness of its  line and the inevitability of passing through a stage of  difficulties and the accompanying multitude of glaring  antisocial phenomena, on the other hand. It must show more  clearly what will happen if we turn aside from the course of  reform and attempt to introduce a different model of  transformations in present conditions.    The third conclusion. The questions "What are we building?"  and "Where are we heading?" must be answered at the highest  level. The answer must be intelligent and immediate. Society  needs a social, spiritual, and moral ideal. It is simply  impossible to manage without this -- at least in our country.  But all this will be left hanging in the air unless we begin  building democratic parties. And not just a presidential party.  We need a mass democratic party, in the spirit of struggle for  a "society of universal well-being," if you like.    The fourth conclusion. We must finally formulate the  philosophy of national-state development and clarify its  components. I reiterate: It is unforgivable that the democrats  have left the idea of statehood and patriotism to those who,  when it comes down to it, are neither patriots nor state-minded,  if you mean by state-minded someone who fights for a social,  democratic state called upon to serve the people rather than  enslave them and to expend the country's resources in the  interests of improving the people's well-being rather than waste  them, as happened under the communists.    The fifth and final conclusion. Foreign policy, including  policy toward the nearby foreign countries, must also be  adjusted in the light of the changes taking place in the  country. Although I think it already is undergoing major  adjustments.</p>

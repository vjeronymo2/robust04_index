KYODO quoted a diplomatic source in Bangkok as  saying that the North Korean ambassador to Thailand took part in  the workshop as an observer, the first time that Pyongyang has  participated in an ASEAN-related meeting. At the workshop, 19  countries discussed cooperating with one another in the  diplomacy of peace and prevention of disputes.    North Korea has contacted the Thai and other ASEAN member  governments about joining their group, and its participation in  the workshop may be related to the move, according to KYODO.    Thailand was notified last week of North Korea's desire to  participate in the ASEAN-UN workshop, and allowed Pyongyang to  take part as an observer after consulting with other nations,  KYODO said.    The United States, Japan, Vietnam and China also attended  the  meeting in addition to the six ASEAN members, but South Korea  did not take part, KYODO said.    Meanwhile, a South Korean Foreign Ministry official in Seoul  said that the Thai Government had invited South Korea as an  observer. But he said he did not understand why Thailand had  not invited South Korea, an ASEAN dialogue partner, as a formal  attendant.</p>

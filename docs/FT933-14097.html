			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: Court puts off decision on Ciga A MILAN court yesterday postponed for the second time a decision on the future of the controlling stake in the Ciga luxury hotels chain, held by Fimpar, the holding company controlled by the Aga Khan. The postponement means trading in Ciga and Fimpar shares, suspended seven weeks ago, is unlikely to resume soon. The court put off a decision until October 5. The stake has been frozen since a German arm of the IMI financial services group, which led a Dollars 100m credit to Fimpar, sought court approval for a freeze on Fimpar's assets. The credit, which matured earlier this year, has not been repaid, nor has it been renewed. The court's decision to freeze Fimpar's assets pending a decision on the legality of IMI's claim prompted the suspension of trading in Fimpar and Ciga shares. IMI turned to the courts in an indirect attempt to gain representation for Fimpar's foreign bank creditors in the restructuring plan for Ciga being prepared by Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank.</p>

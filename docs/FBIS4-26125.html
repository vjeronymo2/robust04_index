			<p>BFN     [Text] New York, June 16 (CNS) -- The '94 China trade  exhibition held in New York ended yesterday with export trade  contracts signed during the exhibition valued at US$55.5 million  while a number of letters of intent were also signed for trade  and joint ventured items.    The trade function was held shortly after an announcement by  the U.S. President Bill Clinton of extension of the most  favoured nation trade status to China. There were more  businessmen than before from the U.S. trade as well as  industrial and commercial sectors to attend the exhibition.    During the function, negotiations on import and export trade  as well as on joint ventures were held between nearly 10,000  businessmen from across the United States and close to 100  foreign trade companies, industrial and trade companies and  three type foreign-funded enterprises from 17 provinces and  cities across China. U.S. businessmen were very interested in  high technology items on display involving aero-space  technology, shipping, petro-chemical products and postal and  telecommunications equipment.    Initial statistics showed that a total of US$55.5 million  worth of export trade contracts were signed. Trade contracts of  intent were valued at US$96.47 million while contracts of intent  for import from U.S. were put at US$21 million. Agreements of  intent were initially reached on 14 joint ventured production  items including engines, optical fibre, sedan, circuit plate for  computer, satellite communication network and steel. Trade  contacts clinched during the exhibition covered such items as  grain and oil, machinery, hardware, construction material,  products of native livestock, light industry, silk, postal and  telecommunications equipment and handicraft articles.</p>

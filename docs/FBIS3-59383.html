			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wei Jingsheng (7614 0079 3932): "The Best Lesson </F> Mao Zedong Taught Us"--first paragraph is editor's note]    [Text] Wei Jingsheng specially wrote this short  commentary at the invitation of this magazine, the very first  piece of writing he did after he was released from jail. While a  mere 1,000 characters long, it demonstrates the style of Wei  Jingsheng of the Beijing Spring era, lucid and lively, bursting  with a sense of righteousness. His message to the people of Hong  Kong: Learn from the lessons written in blood on the mainland  and spare yourselves a good deal of pain.    Has a verdict been returned on Mao Zedong as a historical  figure? No. Because he is still playing a role in real life. To  put it bluntly, there are still some people who seek to hatch  all sorts of plots and conspiracies in his name.    What kind of person really was Mao Zedong? Most people  answered that question a long time ago. He dragged practically  the entire China onto the road of brutality, treachery, and  poverty, indirectly causing a hundred million people to starve  to death and forcing another hundred million to leave home and  wander about as beggars. Because of Mao Zedong, as many as a  hundred million people were persecuted politically and tortured  physically and mentally for years on end. Mao Zedong's crimes  were too numerous to mention. He outdid the worst despots in the  world, Chinese and foreign. In this sense, he was indeed a  "giant," "the first since time immemorial," "unique." To be  fair, though, while Mao Zedong must be held primarily  responsible for the profound suffering inflicted upon the  Chinese people for over 40 years and for China's poverty and  backwardness, he was not the only culprit. There were other  accomplices who followed him and helped him concoct all manner  of schemes and plots, bringing calamity to the country and the  people. They too should be held accountable in a big way. Then  there were the masses who tolerated their crimes, who revered  them as gods and encouraged them to commit all kinds of  outrages. Can they absolve themselves of their culpability? In  my youth, I was myself an admirer of Mao Zedong. After I woke up  from my dream, I was filled with remorse and self-blame. Then I  realized that remorse and self-blame would not do any good.  Instead we must see Mao Zedong and the bunch of hooligans under  him in their true colors and stand up to them. That was the only  way to save ourselves and countless other fellow victims.    We could not look to the Savior or some upright magistrate  to  save us. Nor can we depend entirely on friends. Only when we  exert ourselves to save ourselves would others be willing or  able to help us. Nobody wants to or is able to help weaklings  who self-destruct or abandon themselves to vice.    We Chinese must keep this lesson, so personal and so  profound, close to our hearts. Otherwise, people who are adept  at using violence and ready to do so would inevitably ride  roughshod over us. Like Mao Zedong, they would torment us  practically to death, while still demanding that we revere them  as gods. In a certain sense, it is the people's timidity and  bullyability that brings out the brutality in a ruler. When  people have the courage to stand up for their rights, it is  impossible for the ruler not to back down. This lesson, written  in blood, the Chinese people will never ever forget. I hope the  people of Hong Kong learn from it and spare themselves a good  deal of pain. 3 November 1993</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Associate Professor Nguyen Phu Trong, M.A. in </F> History]    [Text] In Vietnam, does the market economy require the  party's leadership?    Today, some people are asking: Now that we have switched to  a  market economy, that is, an economy that operates based on the  laws of value, supply and demand, and competition, why do we  need the leadership of the party? They say that on many  occasions, party leadership has hindered and interfered with the  operation of the economy. In many places, the party  organizations are falling apart but the economy has managed to  hold its own and even expand well.    Those with such ideas look at just one aspect of the  problem,  and more importantly, they do not understand the nature and  contents of building a market economy in our country.    As we all known, the party advocates expanding the market  economy (in place of a state-subsidies economy involving  bureaucratic centralism type control), but this is not an  undisciplined market economy but a state-controlled market  economy with a socialist orientation. That is, it is an economy  whose real purpose is to foster a "wealthy people, strong state,  and fair and civilized society." In the past, there were times  when we did not correctly understand the meaning of a market  economy, and a market economy was thought of as being synonymous  with capitalism and incompatible with socialism. But reality has  helped us to gradually understand that a market economy is not  completely synonymous with capitalism and that switching to a  market economy does not necessarily mean that you are following  the capitalist path. Socialism must develop a commodity economy  and apply market mechanisms. However, for socialism, a market  economy is not everything but just a formula and measure for  expanding the production forces. Expanding the production forces  must go hand in hand with building suitable production  relationships and building good relationships between people and  a prosperous, compassionate, and kind society.    Today, there are various theoretical issues that we must  continue to study in depth. Only based on reviewing the  realities can we gradually improve and clarify things. But  concerning the basic points, it can be said that a  socialist-oriented market economy differs from a capitalist  market economy in the following ways:    The ownership system: Under capitalism, the foundation is  private capitalist ownership. But in our country today, we are  varying the forms of ownership based on a system of public  ownership of the main means of production.    Economic elements: Under capitalism, there are many forms  (including a state economy, joint enterprises, state capitalism,  and so on) that are controlled by the bourgeois state and  directed by private capitalists. In Vietnam today, there are  many forms, too, but they are controlled by the socialist  state--meaning a state that is truly of the people, by the  people, and for the people--and the state and collective  economies are playing a greater and greater pivotal role and  directing things.    The management system: Under capitalism, the markets are  characterized by spontaneous and free competition. Even though  the state regulates things, intervenes, and formulates plans,  this is not the basic tendency. In our country today, while  steps must be taken to stimulate and create the conditions for  exploiting the positive role of the market mechanism, there must  also be strong and positive intervention by the state (through  plans, policies, laws, and economic strength) in order to  regulate and guide things and limit the negative aspects of the  market mechanism.    The distribution system: Under capitalism, distribution is  based primarily on capital and serves the interests of the  capitalists. In our country today, we are using many forms of  distribution, primarily distribution based on labor and economic  results. We are both encouraging the laborers and providing  basic social welfare services.    Social policy: Capitalism came into being by initially  accumulating things through plundering. Because of this, it "has  much blood on its hands." Today, the capitalist countries have  made some changes, but because of its nature, capitalism cannot  resolve the basic conflicts, do away with the cruel exploitation  of laborers, narrow the gap between rich and poor, or end the  cruel injustices. In our country today, while the market economy  is expanding, exploitation must be limited and economic growth  must be tied to social fairness. Also, encouraging people to  become wealthy legally must be tied to eliminating poverty. From  the very beginning when the economy is not highly developed,  attention must be given to social policies and to maintaining  the morals and color of the national culture.    In summary, we advocate expanding the market economy, but it  must not be allowed to operate spontaneously and blindly.  Instead, it must be led, guided, and regulated. The positive  aspects must be exploited, and the negative aspects must be  limited for the interests of the majority of the laboring people  and for a just and civilized society. The entity with the  ability to do this is none other than than the communist party,  a party that struggles for socialist and communist ideals and  that really represents and protects the interests of the working  class and laboring people. The leadership of the party is the  decisive factor in maintaining a socialist orientation for our  market economy and the entire development of our country.    Recently, some people were very happy when Vietnam switched  to expanding a market economy, but they hoped that that would be  a "free, privatized market economy," that is, a capitalist  market economy. People have done everything they can to push us  into the capitalist orbit. They think that by encouraging  Vietnam to have a "market economy," the economy will determine  politics and that changing the economic system will lead to  changes in the political system. On one hand, they praise a  market economy, and on the other hand, they actively criticize  and reject the leadership of the communist party. Enemy forces  are implementing "peaceful changes" and trying to attack the  leadership of the communist party with the aim of doing away  with the socialist orientation of our market economy and  eventually eliminating socialism. In Vietnam and among a number  of Vietnamese living abroad, some people have openly demanded  that the Communist Party of Vietnam abandon its leadership role.  The realities in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe show that  once the communist party collapses, socialism will disappear and  the economy will not have a socialist orientation. The Western  capitalist countries are very pleased by this. They are doing  everything possible to foster this tendency. Unfortunately,  among our ranks, a number of people are vacillating, and they  have been fooled by these tricks.  <H5>  Why is there just one leading party here? </H5>   Some people have argued that a market economy is a  multi-faceted economy. Each element corresponds to a particular  class or stratum and each class or stratum has a corresponding  party or political organization. Thus, in Vietnam, why do we  advocate having just one leading party? Having a multi-faceted  economy but just one leading party is a "contradiction," a  "paradox." They have demanded that we implement political  pluralism and eliminate one-party leadership. According to them,  this is the only way to bring about democracy.    First of all, it must be noted that we have not just said  "oppose party pluralism." Because there are many things about  pluralism, understood in its broadest and fullest sense, that  must be opposed and avoided. We are varying the ownership forms  and forms of distribution and pluralizing foreign relations. We  advocate developing a multi-faceted economy and having  multi-faceted information. Our country has had many parties. If  the parties have the same goal and focus on the same basic  interests (for example, the communist party, the democrat party,  and the socialist party all survived in our country for a long  time) and they accept the leadership of the communist party,  there is nothing to reject. But we cannot accept political  pluralism and opposition parties. That is, we cannot accept  opposition organizations and factional tendencies that would  destroy the unity of the party and the revolution of the people.    We have not used the word "oppose." Because in each country,  the situation at any given time is different, and the level of  democracy and specific conditions are different. There may be  countries that need to use a "pluralistic" and "multi-party"  system. That is the internal affair of each country.    What we have said is that Vietnam does not have the  objective  conditions to accept political pluralism and opposition parties.  This is because the political situation, socioeconomic  standards, people's standard of culture, and laws in our country  do not permit this. The war here ended just recently. Our  country needs political stability, solidarity, and unity in  order to build and expand the economy. The enemy forces are  watching, implementing a policy of encirclement, and trying to  destroy the just cause of our people. Within the country, there  are reactionary elements who were punished by the revolution. If  we accept political pluralism and opposition parties, that would  be tantamount to enabling these reactionary forces to rise up  and legally carry on activities opposing the fatherland, the  people, and the system. That is something that the people  certainly cannot accept.    In recent interviews and speeches in the United States, even  Nguyen Cao Ky, a strong anti-communist who once served as the  premier of the Republic of Vietnam, said that "if a poor and  backward country like Vietnam follows the American model of  democracy in all respects, that will just lead to disorder,  smuggling, and prostitution." He said that 30-40 years ago,  Taiwan, Korea, and Singapore "arose from a single-party system,"  and they "did not tolerate opposition." The main purpose of such  a system was to enable them to create political and social  stability and create the necessary preconditions for developing  a market economy. Those countries have "succeeded brilliantly  and built a strong economy." "They have become democratic and  progressive countries that serve as a model for underdeveloped,  third-world countries." [Footnote 1] [See TIME, 7, 8 November  1992 and VIETNAM, 7 November 1992]    Reality shows that in countries that have implemented  political pluralism and that have allowed opposition parties,  there is often instability or there may be coups. A number of  people who have studied international political systems have  summarized and revealed figures proving that of the 23 countries  that have a one-party system, 19 are stable countries and 4 are  relatively stable. None were unstable. Of the 26 countries that  had a multi-party system, 11 were stable, 2 were relatively  stable, and 13 were unstable. In a number of Eastern European  countries and the former Soviet Union, after they implemented  political pluralism and permitted opposition parties, there was  great turmoil and bloody warfare. These countries experienced a  serious economic crisis and were unable to develop, and the  standard of living of the people declined.    Recently, some people have said that not implementing "party  pluralism" is undemocratic and that the level of democracy of a  country is manifested by the existence of many parties. In my  view, such a view is incorrect. The existence of many parties is  not an index of whether a society is or is not democratic or how  democratic it is. South Vietnamese society during the  American-Diem period had many parties such as the Can Lao, Nhan  Vi, Duy Linh, and Democrat parties, and there were hundreds of  political and social organizations. But it cannot be said that  that society was democratic, and it cannot be said that that  society was more democratic than the present society. In my  view, the democratic character and level of a country and  society are determined primarily by the degree to which the  ownership rights of the majority of the people are manifested  and the degree to which the interests and will of the majority  of people (meaning the laboring people) are implemented in  society. Democracy is a manifestation and implementation of the  ownership rights of the people. The administration is in the  hands of the laboring people, and it defends and serves the  interests of the laboring people and exploits the intelligence,  energy, and creativity of the people. Democracy has nothing to  do with how many parties there are.    We are switching to a multi-faceted economy, but as  mentioned  above, this is a socialist-oriented multi-faceted economy that  is controlled and regulated by the state. Because of this, just  because there are many economic elements, there doesn't have to  be many opposing classes and many political parties.    The "many party" arguments of the anti-communist forces are  actually aimed at reducing or eliminating the leadership of the  communist party, creating turmoil and disorder in the country,  and toppling the regime. That is their only objective. People  have spread rumors and demanded "democracy," "pluralism," "many  parties," and "human rights" as a front for implementing their  insidious plot of creating turmoil and destroying things from  within.    Moreover, do those countries and people who are calling for  "pluralism and many parties" really accept those organizations  and forces that oppose them? Why do they advocate killing  communist leaders, annihilating those who oppose them, and  suppressing movements opposing the regime? Before they seize  power, people praise "democracy," "pluralism," and "many  parties," but after they have seized power and eliminated the  leadership of the communist party, they immediately ban  activities by the communist party, place communism outside the  law, demand that the assets of the party be nationalized, close  the offices of the party, burn down the offices of the party  central committee, and look for ways to take revenge on and  eliminate communist party members. Why is this? After they seize  power, they no longer talk about "pluralism and many parties."    The Communist Party of Vietnam has never imposed its  monopolistic leadership role. To have the people recognize it as  the leader, the party has undergone a long and difficult  struggle filled with challenges and sacrifices. Hundreds of  thousands of outstanding people of the party and nation have  fallen. Establishing the leadership of the party is the fruit of  the revolutionary struggle waged by the working class and the  entire Vietnamese nation. Although there have been times when  the party made mistakes, because it promptly admitted and  corrected its shortcomings, the party still has the trust of  most people. To date, no one can refute the leadership role of  the Communist Party of Vietnam, and there is no other political  force besides the Communist Party of Vietnam with the  capabilities and conditions to lead the Vietnamese revolution.  Only the imperialists and reactionaries are slandering the party  and trying to reduce its prestige and eliminate its leadership  role. Only a dolt would reject the revolutionary achievements  scored by his people and want to create opposition parties,  thinking that that is democratic freedom.  <H3>  The leadership contents and methods of the party in a market  economy: </H3>   As the only party with the power to lead all of society in  market economy conditions, the Communist Party of Vietnam  clearly recognizes its responsibilities to the country and  people and the honor given it. The party is responsible for  correctly determining the direction, targets, and path of the  country, and it is responsible for the prosperity of the nation.  It leads the entire political system and social apparatus, above  all the state and organizations, in hitting the targets and  fulfilling the tasks pointed out, leads the systematization and  promulgation of party resolutions as laws, designs the  apparatus, trains and assigns cadres, controls and trains cadres  to support carrying out the political tasks, controls the  implementation of the party's policies and lines, reviews  practices, and revises and perfects the lines and policies.  Everything is aimed at maintaining a correct political character  and orientation on the country's path forward and on the  nation's path of development.    In the economic sphere, the party points out economic  development lines and strategies, ensures the political  character in the development of the economy, enables the economy  to grow at a rapid pace, have high labor productivity, and have  larger and larger production forces in line with a socialist  orientation, limits injustices and exploitation, and looks after  and protects the interests of the laboring people. This is  manifested not only at the central echelon and in the  macrocosmic leadership and management activities but also in  each party cell. Every party base and every cadre and party  member is responsible for ensuring that the party's political  guidelines are understood thoroughly in all economic and social  activities. These are functions that no one but the party can  carry out.    The leading tasks of the party committee echelons are to  lead  and control things and directly struggle to implement the  policies and lines of the party effectively and to ensure that  all the economic elements follow the socialist guidelines and do  not slip out of the socialist orbit. The party committee  echelons, party chapters, and party members at the state  enterprises, collective economic units, and joint and private  enterprises are responsible for leading the masses and mass  organizations in striving to put the party's resolutions into  life, struggling to implement the stipulations of the party and  the laws of the state, protecting the legitimate rights and  interests of the workers and laborers, opposing barbaric acts of  exploitation, and opposing beating laborers or treating them  harshly.    Naturally, in today's conditions, the party cannot lead and  operate using the old formulas. The party must maintain its  leadership role. It cannot relax or reduce its leadership role.  At the same time, it must exploit the role of the administrative  organizations, economic organizations, and mass organizations. A  distinction must be made between the leadership of the party and  the management of the administrative organizations and between  administrative management and management of commercial  production. The party committee echelons must not become overly  involved in or perform the daily management functions of the  administration or economic organizations. The party provides  concrete and close leadership but it must not become involved in  carrying out things and giving orders. It must lead through the  party members and party organizations. Party members who are  assigned to state organizations and economic organizations must  act in accord with the program and line of the party and  implement the principle of democratic centralism. The party's  organizational system must be solidified and streamlined, and it  must provide clear, quick, and dynamic leadership in accord with  the market mechanism. The party must lead using democratic  methods and persuasion. The cadres and party members must set an  example in implementing the resolutions of the party and the  laws of the state, and they must regularly mobilize and persuade  people outside the party. The party organizations must renovate  their activities and operations to make them more dynamic,  reduce the number of unnecessary meetings, strengthen  on-the-spot control and guidance, and monitor the bases closely.    The basic and decisive conditions for ensuring that the  party  provides good and effective leadership are that the party must  be really pure and strong politically, ideologically, and  organizationally, and it must be very close to the people and  have the trust and support of the people. In the present  situation, the party must have strong political capabilities,  adhere firmly to the targets and ideals, have intelligence and  knowledge, have adequate information, and have the ability to  handle complex problems promptly and correctly.    The party must build a tight organizational system with a  small but strong apparatus, including a system of law-governed  state organizations and mass organizations.    The party must have excellent and loyal staff organizations  to help do the work. These must have the ability to analyze and  integrate things, propose solutions, and control and evaluate  projects.    The party must build a rank of loyal and devoted cadres and  party members who have good moral qualities and leadership and  managerial capabilities, who are knowledgeable about and can  manage the economy, who are knowledgeable about the law and can  manage the state using the laws, and who can adjust to markets  quickly and enthusiastically.    All cadres and party members must give attention to  improving  their political quality, adhere to the guidelines and paths  decided on, improve their intellectual standards and work  capabilities, study regularly, improve their revolutionary  ethics, live a wholesome life, and strive to eliminate  corruption and other degenerate phenomena within the party. Only  by resolutely removing the tumors in its own body (regardless of  how painful this is) can the party develop in a wholesome and  vigorous manner.    Once the party is strong and robust, has internal  solidarity,  unity and tight discipline, and has the trust and support of the  people, there will not be any obstacle that the party can't  overcome or anything that the party can't do.</p>

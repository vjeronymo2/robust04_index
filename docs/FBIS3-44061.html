Addressing hundreds of kwaZulu Police recruits at a graduation  ceremony in Ulundi as the homeland's minister of police, Mr  Buthelezi said "we may as well brace ourselves for the long and  hard road ahead of us".    Referring to trilateral talks in Johannesburg on Wednesday  night, which delegates said were fruitful, Mr Buthelezi said:  "I am not at all optimistic that anything concrete is going to  come out of these negotiations."    He alleged chief government negotiator Roelf Meyer  "virtually  told" television audiences after the talks that the interim  constitution would not be amended, "or if at all, not  substantially to accommodate the concerns of his majesty the  king (Goodwill Zwelithini), and also members of the FA".    "I am afraid I must state that while I was pleased with the  way these talks went, I am very pessimistic about the outcome of  these negotiations. We have suffered a lot of blood and tears  all these years of oppression, and it may well be that we will  not be out of that dark dungeon of suffering even after the  elections," Mr Buthelezi said.</p>

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Dublin in contact with Loyalists The Irish government has confirmed that it has recently been in communication with Loyalist paramilitary groups to provide clarification on the Downing Street declaration. The move follows the British government's clarifications given to Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, last month. Mr Albert Reynolds the Irish prime minister, said that Loyalist paramilitary groups had this week 'sought clarification from me which is a very welcome development'. He was willing to extend such clarification 'as I have extended to others' but emphasised that he would not enter into negotiations on the Downing Street declaration 'or on any issues properly a matter for the talks process'.</p>

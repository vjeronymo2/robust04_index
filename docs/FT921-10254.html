			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Arts: Rare prints to thrill It is tempting to ask which is the more remarkable: print dealer Nicholas Stogdon's latest exhibition or the highly idiosyncratic catalogue that accompanies it. Stogdon lays before us an unusual feast. On offer is a group of some 60 15th- and 16th-century German and Netherlandish woodcuts of striking quality, from unique early devotional images of exceptional freshness to fine impressions of well known woodcuts by Durer, Burgkmair, Wechtlin, Baldung Grien and Goltzius. The show opened at the Salander-O'Reilly Galleries in Berlin in December, and continues at Michael Simpson Ltd, 11 Savile Row, London W1, until February 21. It is probably no exaggeration to say that nothing quite like it has been seen in a commercial gallery before. Stogdon addresses the problems of attribution and dating, as well as technique, in a catalogue in which his enthusiasm continually bubbles to the surface, despite the the scholarship. The prints, however, have a vigour and physical presence that speak for themselves. That presence is felt in both 'high' and 'low' art. Arguably more compelling than the sophisticated cuts that rival illumination are the bold and crudely coloured devotional images probably made for sale at a shrine as souvenirs, humble blockbooks made for the poor clergy, religious and secular broadsides, and odd survivals of printed ephemera. In pride of place is a monumental Pieta believed to come from mid-15th century Swabia and derived from sculptural prototypes. Perhaps 20 northern single-image sheets of the period survive. Among the broadsides is a coloured cut from Nurnburg in near mint condition warning against the usury of the Jews and which predates the expulsion of the Jewish community from the city in 1499 by 15 years. Here, too, is an indulgence, an almanac, and three extraordinarily rare sheets with woodcuts and verses composed by Durer. Durer was the first artist to fully realise the potential of prints. Woodcuts and engravings, cheap in relation to painting, proved ideal media for an artist brimming with invention and who wanted to make a name in the world. He revolutionised the graphic arts by developing a new graphic vocabularly, and a system of hatching very fine lines that could yield large numbers of woodcut impressions. Grien lacked Durer's innate sympathy with the woodcut, and set his blockcutters near impossible tasks. That explains why the highly eccentric Madonna and Child here is one of only five impressions. Technical innovations and anomalies crop up throughout. From the 1470s comes an unique dotted print of a type that only seems to have been produced by goldsmiths for 50 years. The image of the Madonna is at once ugly and moving, made with a metal plate punched and engraved. A more satisfactory development of that technique is illustrated by an early white-line woodcut of a monk reading at his desk in a wattle-fenced meadow. Here the image is produced by cutting finely hatched lines rather than the area between them, allowing the white paper ground to provide the design. From there, argues Stogdon, it was a natural progression to the chiaroscuro woodcut, where a traditional black-line woodblock is used with a white-line woodblock to provide tone. Of great interest too is the trial layout for a page of Der Weisskunig. With another proof in the Fitzwilliam, it reveals the publisher's preoccupation with the look of the page and the type of the text and its layout. Burgkmair's woodcut of around 1515 is set on the page with type below borrowed from something else. If this is a precursor of the modern publisher's dummy, the three outstanding and rare proofs of his chilling 'Lovers Surprised by Death' of 1510 are the ancestors of modern four-colour printing. This is the first dated colour print to be made using separate but interdependent blocks. Each of the proofs is printed by three blocks to different effect: three shades of chocolate brown; black and two shades of red; black, eggshell blue and silvery grey. The white ground is exploited as highlight. This new tonal subtlety significantly enhanced the illusion of three dimensions. Burgkmair's ink and wash drawing of five drummers on horseback and engravings by Durer, Schongauer and Goltzius, are among the highlights of a small show at the Strang Print Room. University College, London's holding of some 4,000 prints and drawings is one of the country's least known university collections. As a means of introducing it to a wider public, this first of a series of displays focuses on its major benefactions. The Print Room, located to the right of Wilkins' dome, is open weekdays 1-2.15pm, Tuesdays and Thursdays, 1-5pm. This show, which ranges from Mantegna to John Singer Sargent, continues until March 27.</p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> ISRAEL PREPARES TO REOPEN SCHOOLS IN WEST BANK  </P> <P> Israel ordered preparations Wednesday for the gradual reopening of schools in  the occupied West Bank, closed for most of the 19-month-old Palestinian  uprising.  </P> <P> The move follows mounting international pressure, notably from the United  States, for Israel to relax its clampdown on the occupied territories.  </P> <P> Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin set no date for returning the 320,000 Arab  pupils to their schools, closed because of chronic unrest.  </P> <P> The order appeared to reverse previous government demands for guarantees from  Palestinian leaders to maintain order in schools and prevent pupils from  joining demonstrations before any reopening.  </P> <P> Rabin issued his order a week before a U.S. government delegation visits  Jerusalem to test the sincerity of Israel's offer to hold Palestinian elections  in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> Washington has repeatedly urged Israel to reopen schools as a  confidence-building measure.  </P> <P> Israel first shut them in February, 1988, two months after the uprising  erupted. The closure affected classes from kindergartens to high schools.  </P> <P> In a related development, President Chaim Herzog warned Wednesday that Israel  faces a threat of anarchy from Jews avenging Palestinian attacks.  </P> <P> Dozens of Israelis have taken to the streets, hurling stones at Arab motorists  to retaliate for the killing of 14 Jewish bus passengers last week in the most  deadly Palestinian attack in more than 10 years.  </P> <P> Speaking at a swearing-in ceremony for new judges, Herzog said: "Anyone who  believes he has a right to take the place of the rule of law endangers the very  essence of our society, because if it is permissible for one, it is permissible  for all, and the result will be anarchy and chaos."  </P> <P> In the occupied West Bank, meanwhile, Palestinians shot and wounded an Arab  woman suspected of aiding Israeli authorities and severely beat her husband, a  hospital official said.  </P> <P> During clashes in the Gaza Strip, Israeli troops shot and wounded five  Palestinians, including a 6-year-old child, hospital officials said.  </P></p>

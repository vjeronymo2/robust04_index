			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Gains reversed after gilts prompt late sell-off - Market report The UK stock market, encouraged at first by a better tone in global bond markets, turned off in late dealings yesterday when gilt-edged securities fell on the announcement that next week's auction of government securities will be a further tranche of Floating Rate Treasury stock. The last day of the UK equity trading account was dominated by expiry operations in derivatives markets in London, Frankfurt and New York. Traders ascribed an initial gain of nearly 20 points on the Footsie Index to the traditional book-squaring operations surrounding the expiry, at about 10.20am, of index options and index futures on the London International Financial Futures (LIFFE) market. The day's peak of 3,049.7 left intact the upper end of the current trading range. Shares drifted lower once the derivatives expiry was out of the way and the Footsie showed a fall of 13.1 at 3,017 as London waited to see if New York would build on its overnight gain. The FT-SE Index closed a net 7.2 down at 3,022.9, with the Dow Average 8 points off as London traders set off for home. British Petroleum stocks continued to do well on the back of more positive views on oil prices, and both Enterprise Oil and Lasmo, its bid target, strengthened as the market awaited developments. The broader market, less closely linked to the derivatives expiries, traded easier and the FT-SE Mid 250 Index fell 7.1 to 3,527.1. Seaq business increased to 736.8m shares from 619.8m on Thursday, with non-Footsie stocks making up around 62 per cent of the total - a further indication of the focus on the derivatives-linked blue chips. The Footsie has fallen by 33 points over a week which has seen investment confidence challenged by domestic and international factors. The Mansion House speeches from the UK chancellor of the exchequer and the governor of the Bank of England failed to unsettle equities in spite of their rejection of early tax cut suggestions and warning that UK base rates will rise later this year. But renewed uncertainty in world bond markets such as oil and commodity prices has arisen, because at one stage this week international doubts unsettled shares and continued to overhang markets last night. Over the two-week account which closed last night, the Footsie has risen by about 0.8 per cent, leaving the 3,000 mark still a testing level for market support. UK equities have found it impossible to move far away from this level over the past month. Government bonds put on more than half a point in early trading yesterday before turning off smartly on the news of a Floating Rate auction, which was seen as an indication that the authorities are as aware as the market of the uncertain mood of the bond market. By the close, long-dated gilts were a net  5/32 lower, with the shorts just a touch off on the day. The gilt-edged team at Yamaichi commented to clients that the bond market is 'caught in the dual grip' of domestic uncertainty on inflation policy and the global inflation concerns reflected across the broader range of bond markets. Yamaichi believes that the UK market has established a wide trading range consistent with these uncertainties. While confident that gilts will break out higher as investors perceive that inflation concerns have been overdone, Yamaichi sees a downside risk in the near term.</p>

			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Canary Wharf: Li may feature in sell-off MR LI KA-SHING, one of Hong Kong's wealthiest men and one of its leading property developers, has no immediate plans to buy into Olympia &amp; York's Canary Wharf development in the UK or any of its other property assets. After the annual meeting on Thursday of Cheung Kong, his flagship property development and investment company, Mr Li admitted to a personal interest in acquiring some of O&amp;Y's assets, if they were suitable. However, sources close to Mr Li said yesterday that he had not yet been offered any of O&amp;Y's properties and had not focused on any particular property asset. 'We can't say absolutely 'no',' one said. 'We might be offered something so cheaply that it would be foolish to turn it down.' Cheung Kong would not comment about reports of Mr Li's interest in Canary Wharf. In the past, Mr Li has taken pains to point out that his joint venture with O&amp;Y in a New York office block was un-affected by O&amp;Y's wider financial difficulties. Analysts in Hong Kong expect Mr Li to figure in any break-up of O&amp;Y. He has the financial capability to acquire assets from O&amp;Y and can afford to wait until the bankers come to him.</p>

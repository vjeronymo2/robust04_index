			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Many of our Sierra Leone listeners are less than  happy with the Army's pursuit of the civil war and its behavior  toward the civilian population. Now, hard on the heels of this  week's big shakeup in the high echelons, including the removal  of the Army chief, the new head of the Army, Colonel Kelly  Conteh, is promising a new look into Army policy. From Freetown  Victor Sylver telexed this report.    In an interview this afternoon, the new Army head, Colonel  Kelly Conteh, just back from a command course in Nigeria,  emphasized the need for all Sierra Leoneans to be involved in  eradicating the rebel menace throughout the country. He said  that the relations between civilians and soldiers should be  cordial and that he would not treat lightly incidents of  soldiers acting as members of an occupation force.    Colonel Conteh was of the view that soldiers are servants of  the people and that they have to protect civilians in whatever  situation. Although he couldn't tell me what new strategy he  intends to adopt in bringing the war to a speedy end, Col.  Conteh hinted that the main cause of the reverses in the war  could well be due to leadership and stressed that the  enforcement of discipline will receive top priority from now on.    He agreed with me that the Sierra Leonean Army, like all  others, has its crop of bad eggs and appealed to the civilian  population to show understanding and patience. Col. Conteh also  made a direct appeal to those who had taken up arms against  their brothers to realize that it is their blood that is being  shed and urged them to lay down their arms and make use of the  amnesty being granted to all those who surrender.</p>

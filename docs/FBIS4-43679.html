			<p>BFN     [Text] Guenter Verheugen, the Social Democratic Party of  Germany's [SPD] federal manager, has called on [SPD Chairman]  Rudolf Scharping to present his shadow cabinet before late  August. This is the only way to "reply to the Kohl model" and to  "show that the SPD has a wealth of assertive politicians."    Verheugen said it is tactically unwise to demand that the  SPD  make a clear coalition statement. At the same time he pointed  out that "the idea of a grand coalition must not even come up."  He indirectly favored a coalition with the Greens. The party  must be self-confident in choosing its partners. For its policy  of renewal it needs a reform alliance, Verheugen said.</p>

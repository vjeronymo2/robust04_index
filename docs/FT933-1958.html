			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Bank governor calls in clearers: Big four are told their support is vital to the survival of recession-hit small businesses MR EDDIE GEORGE, governor of the Bank of England, has privately called in top executives of the big four clearing banks to discuss his worries that the economic upturn could be stifled unless they do more to support small businesses. The governor's initiative follows complaints from businesses that banks had been too quick to withdraw support to companies in trouble during the recession. The talks focused, among other issues, on whether strict head office lending guidelines to bank branches may have choked off access to capital for businesses with potential to emerge from the recession in a fitter state. Better training for lending officers was also discussed. Ideas are likely to be forwarded to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, as he prepares his November 30 Budget. Top officials called to the bank included Mr Derek Wanless, chief executive of National Westminster; Mr Brian Pearse, Midland's chief executive; and Mr Bill Gordon, managing director of Barclays' banking division. A senior manager from Lloyds has also attended. Mr George has also had discussions with small-business lobby groups to broaden the debate about how government can create the most favourable economic conditions for businesses which employ fewer than 200 people. The governor has made a personal commitment to improve the climate for small businesses in the 1990s by helping to nurture the relationship between small businesses and the banks. The exercise has also included meetings with representatives of the 58,000-member Federation of Small Businesses and the 21,000-member Forum of Private Businesses. The bank has told people involved in the talks not to discuss them with outsiders on the grounds that publicity might damage the success of the initiative. One person close to the discussions said: 'Eddie has decided to get on top of the mass of complex issues which relate to whether small businesses get enough support from both the government and the banks. He believes the area could be crucial to affecting the shape of the recovery.' The big four banks are crucial to the health of the 2m or so businesses employing fewer than 200 people - which between them account for about three quarters of the workforce - because they act as their main sources of finance through loans and overdrafts. Mr George launched his initiative soon after taking over as governor on July 1, and before a separate Treasury inquiry into small business finances, announced earlier this month but yet to get under way. Subjects covered during the discussions have included: Whether banks have done enough to form close contacts with managers of specific small businesses to assess the industries in which they operate. How the government might change tax policies to make it easier for small companies to gain finance. Calls by small-business lobby groups for better training for bank-lending officers so that they have more broad experience of industry issues. How the fortunes of small businesses are tied in with fluctuations in the UK economy, in particular decisions over the level of the pound and interest rates. Possible extensions to government training schemes to give more support to would-be entrepreneurs. The initiative comes after two inquiries launched by Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, into whether efforts by commercial banks to increase lending margins were preventing small businesses gaining the full benefits of cuts in UK interest rates. Both were conducted relatively openly. Mr George appears to have decided that by conducting his exercise privately he may be able to take a more considered view of the issues involved.</p>

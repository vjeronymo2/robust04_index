Finally, it is proposed to capitalize the first word in each of paragraphs (a)(2), (a)(3) and (a)(4). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;1.685, it is proposed to amend paragraph (d) for clarification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;1.687, it is proposed to amend paragraph (c) to refer to &sect;1.647 concerning translations of documents in a foreign language. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Other Considerations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These proposed rules conform with the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866, and the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Office of Management and Budget has determined that these proposed rules are not significant for the purposes of Executive Order 12866. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Assistant Counsel for Legislation and Regulation of the Department of Commerce has certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration, that the proposed rule changes will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities (Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b)), because the changes clarify existing rules setting forth the procedures used in patent appeals and interferences. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Patent and Trademark Office has determined that this notice has no Federalism implications affecting the relationship between the National Government and the States as outlined in Executive Order 12612. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These rule changes will not impose any additional burden under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et.seq.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> since no record keeping or reporting requirements within the coverage of the Act are placed upon the public. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Observer: Boxed in The disgraced former president of Brazil is doing his best to resuscitate his old party - but it's nothing if not a challenge. With the National Renewal party trailing at under 1 per cent in the opinion polls, Fernando Collor de Mello, who has been banned from office until the year 2000, made an appearance on TV to aid the flagging campaign of the party's next choice for president, Walter Queiroz. No doubt mindful of a Brazilian law that forbids anyone but the candidate himself appearing in a party political broadcast, Collor made do with just a photo and a voice-over as he railed against the 'state mandarins' who had contributed to his downfall. That was still too much for the courts, who warned him that any repeat sallies on to the box would cost him a year in jail. But he must nearly have stumbled over Queiroz on the court room steps. The latter has been expelled from the party following allegations that he 'forgot' to declare Dollars 1.7m in income tax returns, but is fighting to be reinstated.</p>

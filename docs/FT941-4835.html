			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Continental declines to DM74m Pre-tax earnings at Continental, the German tyre maker, fell more than half to DM74m (Dollars 43.5m) last year, according to Mr Hubertus von Grunberg, group chairman. He blamed the decline in the automotive industry. He said the company increased volume deliveries, but prices had been depressed by over-capacity in the tyre industry. The results had once again been burdened by losses at General Tire, the US subsidiary, which had not fulfilled its promises to return a break-even result, he said. Unit sales of car and commercial vehicle tyres increased 2 per cent and 3 per cent respectively, while group turnover fell 3.3 per cent to DM9.4bn. Last year's profits fall was less dramatic than expected, while sales and earnings had increased in the first two months of the current year, he said. Continental would respond to the continuing downward pressure on prices by improving quality and reducing fixed costs rather than cutting output. A further 2,000 jobs would be cut this year, following a reduction of 4,900 in 1993. Mr von Grunberg forecast a positive result this year but refused to comment on dividend prospects. Continental last paid a dividend in 1990.</p>

			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN-MADE TUNNELS AT MCMARTIN PRE-SCHOOL  </P> <P> In reply to "Parents Dig Persistently for Evidence," Metro, June 5:  </P> <P> Jackie McGauley is paraphrased in the caption above her picture as stating she  believes the pentagram on a plate found at the McMartin Pre-school site is  among evidence of alleged satanic rituals at the school. Although it is a  bizarre find, Mrs. McGauley has never made this statement, not even to her  closest associates.  </P> <P> Only further research can establish this possibility.  </P> <P> The article states that the parents and I have tried to make the public believe  that a long-rumored network of underground tunnels were discovered in early  June. The reporter states I offered boxes and boxes of artifacts as "further  proof that the preschool operators maintained and then tried to cover up a  tunnel system." I have never accused the McMartins or Buckeys of this.  </P> <P> My statements thus far have been clear and concise, that the results of the  excavation by the archeologists, geologists and their team simply proved that  there were man-made tunnels under the preschool foundation as alleged by the  children.  </P> <P> TED L. GUNDERSON  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

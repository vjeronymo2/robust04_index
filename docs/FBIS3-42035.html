Interviewed by RIA, he noted that  there is no means to pay AES personnel for their work properly  or to buy fuel, equipment, and spares. In this situation highly  qualified specialists are defecting en masse to Russia's nuclear  facilities. All this, (Bronnikov) stressed, puts Ukrainian  nuclear power engineers in extreme conditions, which is  impermissible if atomic power stations are to function normally.</p>

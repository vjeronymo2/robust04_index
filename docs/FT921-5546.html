			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / International Company News: Travelers reviews strategies TRAVELERS Corporation, the large US insurer, has said that it is still looking at ways of improving its capital position. The company has been hit by property-related losses, and has already cut dividends to preserve capital. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Travelers said the strategies might include offerings of securities to one or more investors; divestitures and investments in Travelers or certain of its subsidiaries. Travelers, however, said this process had been going on since 1989 and there was no guarantee that such actions would go ahead. Assets have already been sold - including Dillon Read, the investment banking business, last November. For 1991 Travelers unveiled improved results, with the group posting a Dollars 318m net profit compared with a Dollars 178m loss in 1990.</p>

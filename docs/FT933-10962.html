			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Finance &amp; the Family: Laurentian Financial LAURENTIAN Financial has launched a critical illness policy called the Lifestyle Security plan. The policy uses definitions for the main critical illnesses - heart attack, cancer, stroke, kidney failure, major organ transplant and coronary bypass surgery - drawn up recently by independent financial advisers as a basis for industry standards. It will also include benign brain tumours, paralysis, terminal illness, motor neurone disease and multiple sclerosis. Laurentian's definition of total permanent disability is based on inability to perform 'activities of daily living' such as eating and dressing unaided, rather than the inability to work, which is the basis for most companies' definitions. This could mean that the cover is not as comprehensive in certain circumstances, and makes it more difficult to compare with other policies. The policy can be taken out by anyone between 18 and 70, and premiums start at Pounds 12.50 a month.</p>

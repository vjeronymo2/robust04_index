			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / International Company News: Pharmaceuticals groups put up strong profits show PFIZER, one of the biggest US drugs companies, yesterday posted a 14 per cent improvement in second-quarter net earnings on sales which rose only 4 per cent. Net income for the quarter was Dollars 203.8m, or 61 cents on sales of Dollars 1.69bn, against earnings of Dollars 179.1m, or 53 cents, on sales of Dollars 1.63bn a year earlier. Pfizer, which has divested or closed several businesses in the past two years, said sales from on-going operations rose 13 per cent in the latest quarter while net income from those operations increased 10 per cent. The sale of Pfizer's Coty fragrance and cosmetics business contributed a Dollars 3m after-tax gain in net income and Dollars 56.5m in restructuring credits to operating income. Sales of new pharmaceutical products contributed to a 17 per cent improvement in pharmaceutical sales growth in the quarter. The company said the improvement was almost entirely due to higher volume, since no pharmaceutical prices were increased in the quarter. Second-quarter earnings from Johnson &amp; Johnson, the US healthcare products and pharmaceuticals group, were also strong. Net income rose 14 per cent to Dollars 464m, or 70 cents a share from Dollars 406m, or 61 cents a year ago. Sales increased about 13 per cent to Dollars 3.41bn from Dollars 3.03bn. For the first six months, net income rose about 13 per cent to Dollars 928m, or Dollars 1.40, from Dollars 824m, or Dollars 1.24 last year. Sales were 10 per cent higher at Dollars 3.34bn from Dollars 3.08bn. Sales growth was led by Johnson &amp; Johnson's profession segment, which includes products used in less invasive surgery, where domestic sales rose 17 per cent and overseas sales advanced 15 per cent. Warner Lambert, another large US pharmaceuticals company, posted net earnings of Dollars 178m, or Dollars 1.32 a share, up 15 per cent, on the back of an 11 per cent improvement in sales to Dollars 1.37bn. A year earlier, the company had net income of Dollars 155m, or Dollars 1.15, on sales of Dollars 1.24bn. For the first half of 1992, net income was Dollars 341.5m, or Dollars 2.54, compared with Dollars 188.1m, or Dollars 1.40, a year earlier. The previous year's results were distorted by an after-tax charge of Dollars 106m, or 79 cents a share, related to an accounting change. Sales in the six months were Dollars 2.68bn against Dollars 2.46bn.</p>

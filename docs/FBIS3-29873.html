The news came at a working-level contact held in New York  Wednesday between Ho Chong, deputy chief of North Korea's  mission to the United Nations, and Tom Hubbard, deputy assistant  secretary of state for Asian and Pacific affairs, diplomatic  sources said. Ho told Hubbard that Pyongyang would issue visas  for the IAEA inspectors as soon as possible, the sources said.    In this connection, U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher said Wednesday that he believed North Korea would  allow the IAEA team to inspect seven reported nuclear sites in  Yongbyon soon.    State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said that Pyongyang  had told the IAEA it would welcome the inspection team's visit.    At the meeting in New York, North Korea is understood to  have  relayed a reply from Kang Sok-chu, its representative at the  first two rounds of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks, to a  letter from his U.S. counterpart Robert Gallucci, assistant  secretary of state for political and military affairs.    The sources noted that the two sides have already agreed  that  the U.S. and South Korean Governments would announce the  suspension of the joint military exercise "Team Spirit" and set  the date for the third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level  talks after the IAEA inspection and resumption of inter-Korean  dialogue.    If South and North Korea agree to exchange special envoys,  Washington plans to hold further high-level talks with Pyongyang  in mid-March, the sources said. And with North Korea's  professed willingness to issue visas for the IAEA inspectors,  the team would likely arrive in Pyongyang early next week at the  latest, barring any unexpected developments in the meantime, the  sources added.</p>

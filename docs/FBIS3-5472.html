January: the three gas turbines installed at Ba Ria, with a  total capacity of 100 megawatts of electricity, generate  electricity. April: the 500-kv north-south landline goes into  stage-1 operation. June: one of the two 75-kw Thac Mo turbines  goes on line. Those will be joyous news items this coming spring.    With a capacity of 150 megawatts, Thac Mo has greater  capacity than Thac Ba (120 megawatts) and almost the capacity of  Da Nhim (160 megawatts). But to date, this is the largest  hydroelectric project for which all the geographical and  geological research and for which the technical designs for  almost all the main projects were done by us.    The energy line and water gates, pipelines, plant, outside  distribution stations, and spill heads of the pressure lines  were built by the Interenergo Corporation (Ukrainian Energy  Projects Institute). All of the other technical projects,  including the main dam, the spillways (including intake and  drainage canals and foundation holes), the Duc Hanh dam and  secondary dams, the canal connecting the two reservoirs, and the  plans to organize construction--pressure line, surfaces, and  hydroelectricity--were the responsibility of Research and Design  Corporation II.    Nguyen Van Thinh, the deputy director of this corporation,  said that most of the people who participated in the Thac Mo  project were very young. A few people such as Doan Hai Minh and  Nguyen Xuan Hoa were present at Song Da and Tri An, but at the  time that they were there, there was little work and the  technical requirements were not great.    Work on the project got underway on 20 November 1991. But  the  "intellectual products" of the people at Research and Design  Corporation II, that is, the economic and technical arguments of  Thac Mo, had been approved 8 months prior to that, and by June  1991 all the technical designs had been examined.    But it was not until 27 December 1993, when the Be River was  safely dammed, that the quality of the design was affirmed.    "Brain power is very cheap," joked a number of people. Thac  Mo cost more than 1.5 trillion, but the technical design work of  the men cost only about 3 billion, which is just 0.2 percent of  the total cost.    Thac Mo is no longer a dream. The same is true of other  large  hydroelectric projects such as Ham Thuan-Dami (472 mw). Things  have been turned over to them and they have gotten underway.    Many people refer to the 500-kv north-south landline as the  "rapid landline."    Ten years ago, the 220-kv landline from Bien Hao to Tri An,  a  distance of 23 km, was called the "rapid landline" because it  was built in just 7 months. Another well-known landline was the  230-kv landline from Thu Duc to Can Tho: after more than 6 long  years (1979-1985) and tens of "operations," 180 km were  "basically completed." This was the case even though pillars,  insulators, lines, and so on were on hand in the storehouses  prior to the start of construction.    The 500-kv north-south landline runs for 1,480 km from Hoa  Binh to Phu Lam in Ho Chi Minh City. People have done research,  drawn up designs, carried on construction, and purchased  equipment. There is nothing simple about this ultramodern  landline. The line passes through many very difficult sections:  the Cam Thuy mountains in Thanh Hoa, 25 km; the Hai Van area  from Hue to Danang, 50 km; the the Lo So gorge in Kontum, 120  km; Krong Ana to Daknong in Dak Lak, 100 km, and so on. Who  would have thought that in less than 2 years from when  construction officially got underway, the basic work--laying the  foundation, erecting the pillars, laying the landline--would  have been completed.    Hoang Dinh Hai, Nguyen Van Tan, Ly Van Tho, Le Van Hien,  Tran  Vinh Tai, and Tran Phuoc Nhi, the leaders of the units  subordinate to Power Construction and Installation Corporation  II, the unit responsible for constructing that section of the  line from Buon Ma Thuot to Phu Lam (a distance of 320 km),  confirmed that it had been necessary to overcome many great  "obstacles." Construction had to be carried on in mountainous  terrain filled with mines and bombs left from the war, there  were battles against malaria, and there were difficulties  because of the long distances involved, because the area was  uninhabited, and because of the swamps near the cities. Together  with many other "landline workers," about 5,000 people along the  route and 110,000 other people were mobilized to complete the  landline on time and transmit electricity from the north to the  south by spring.    Bui Van Luu, the director of Power Corporation II, said that  to date, the national power network has reached 93 percent of  the districts and 55 percent of the villages in the south. In  1993, per capita electricity output in the south reached 150  KWh, which is almost double that (80 KWh) in 1975. But in a  number of provinces in the Mekong Delta, output has reached only  40 KWh per person. In An Giang, the province with the highest  rice yield in the country, output has reached only 35 KWh per  person per year. As of October 1993, An Giang was ranked fourth  in the south with respect to the number of galvanometers:  28,152. But in Tri Ton, Tinh Bien, and Phu Tan, some villages  had only six galvanometers. The average is one galvanometer per  10,000 people. Here, the people have to purchase electricity at  a cost of 750-900 dong per KWh.    In many other places besides An Giang, the peasants in the  south are not very happy with "Mr. Electricity." Many localities  have formed hydroelectric corporations, power service  corporations, and so on in order to purchase and sell  electricity.    Peasants in the south are still waiting for the Spring  electrical current to reach every house.  <H5>  Facts About the Thac Mo Hydroelectric Project on the Be River </H5>   Capacity: two 75-mw turbines for a total of 150 mw.    Ensured capacity: 55 mw.    Yearly power output: 610 million KWh.    Normal rise in water level: 218 meters.    Still water level: 198 meters.    Total reservoir capacity: 1,360 million cubic meters.    Reservoir area: 109 square km.    Water current flowing through the 0.5 percent spillway:  3,700 cubic meters per hour.    Water current flowing through the 1 percent spillway:  4.122 cubic meters per hour.    Water current flowing through the plant: 196 cubic meters  per hour.    Largest water pillar: 106 meters    Smallest water pillar: 83.4 meters.    Official start of construction: 20 November 1991.    Date the river channel was blocked: 27 December 1993.    Date turbine No 1 will go into operation: June 1994.    Power development in the southern provinces:    1976: 1,280 million KWh.    1993: 4,600 million KWh.    1995: (predicted) 12,500 million KWh.    Per capita average:    1975: 80 KWh per person.    1993: 150 KWh per person.    In the Mekong Delta, a number of provinces have an output of  only 40 KWh per person.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jamal Khashuqji: "French and U.S. Contacts With </F> Algerian Salvation Front"]    [Text] Paris, Algiers, AL-HAYAH -- Reliable Islamic sources  have confirmed to AL-HAYAH that high-level contacts have been  made between an Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] leader abroad and  both the French Government and the U.S. State Department. The  sources described these contacts as "important," especially in  view of the "deadlock" in the dialogue efforts between Algerian  authorities and the FIS leadership detained in Algeria, which  began on the eve of Major General Liamine Zeroual's assumption  of the presidency.    The sources said that in their contacts with the FIS leader  the French offered a plan to sponsor a dialogue between the FIS  and the Algerian Government. However, the sources declined to  reveal details of the plan. They pointed out that the Americans  just stressed their neutrality and said they would not offer any  aid to the present authorities in Algeria.    The sources said that these contacts came up against the  principle of referring to the leaders in Blida prison, as FIS  leaders do not decide on any radical plan before referring it to  FIS leaders Abassi Madani and Ali Belhadj, who are detained in  Blida military prison with two FIS shura council members.    The FIS has in the past announced its acceptance of the  principle of negotiating -- not holding a dialogue -- with the  ruling authorities. It set conditions for that, most  importantly releasing FIS leaders and the other detainees,  closing the concentration camps [al-muhtashadat] in the desert,  resuming the electoral process, revoking the decision to disband  the FIS, and judging "those who caused the bloodshed and staged  the January 1992 coup," which led to the cancellation of the  elections and disbandment of the FIS, which had won the first  round of elections.    The sources, which asked to remain anonymous, said that the  "judgment" question was at the top of the French and U.S.  interlocutors' priorities. The sources added that the FIS  continues to insist on this point. And that "the best it can  offer is to turn a blind eye to their departure from Algeria  before the FIS assumes power." The sources interpreted the  raising by the French and Americans of the question of "judging  the officials" as an attempt to explore the FIS' position  vis-a-vis the possibility of its agreeing to participate in  power with some of the regime's elements.    But the FIS -- according to the same sources -- cannot "join  hands with some elements whom it holds responsible for what has  happened in Algeria over the past two years. However, it has no  objection to dealing with the Army after removing the extremist  elements from it under a national plan designed to restore  stability and constitutional legitimacy to the country."    In Algiers, AL-HAYAH has learned that President Liamine  Zeroual has presided over a meeting of the supreme command of  the Army's General Staff. It is the first meeting of such  importance held three [as published] days before the 8 May  marches being staged in support of the dialogue.    No information has emerged about the topics discussed at the  meeting. However, well-informed sources do not rule out that  the meeting may have discussed the stage ahead with regard to  the security, political, and economic aspects. They say it is  likely to be "a meeting for assessing national dialogue" and  discussing the changes expected in the coming weeks. Three [as  published] days before the marches staged in support of the  dialogue, incidents of violence and subversion have begun to  emerge once again. More than 25 security and Army elements were  assassinated in one day, the day before yesterday. These  operations took place after a period of noticeable calm, as  security forces had seized the initiative and showed they were  in control of the security situation.    Observers interpret the resumption of the "show actions"  which occurred in the capital and other areas as "a message of  warning to the regime and public opinion to the effect that  those whose issue this is, are still on the field."    Other sources say that these operations "are merely a  reaction to the security forces' recent air bombardment of the  Bouznika [as transliterated] area in Batna (east Algeria) and  the killing of many members of the armed groups in Boumerdas  (east of the capital)."    But corroborated information conveyed to AL-HAYAH says that  the "calm" that has dominated the recent period is nothing but  "an undeclared agreement" on a truce between the regime and the  armed groups to show "good intentions" vis-a-vis the dialogue  and national reconciliation.</p>

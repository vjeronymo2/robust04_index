			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Clinging to 3,000 SG Warburg's decision to lower its year-end forecast for the FT-SE 100 index is a salutary reminder that this looks like one of those rare years in which equities actually fall. The consolation, after another bumpy week, was that the market seems reluctant to hold below the 3,000 level where it yields 4 per cent. That may not be especially generous compared with a 10-year gilt yield of 8.8 per cent. But the relationship is comfortable since the accumulation of corporate liquidity should allow good dividend growth over the next year or so. The market's prospects still seem to depend more on bonds than the outlook for earnings. For equity investors, the art thus lies in picking out developments that would cause bonds to rally. Briefly one such moment appeared to have been reached yesterday afternoon with reports of progress towards a trade agreement between Japan and the US. In theory an agreement which led the yen to weaken might stimulate capital outflows from Japan that would re-liquify financial markets. But any trade agreement would have to be extraordinarily convincing for that effect to last. A more plausible reason for the market's burst of optimism was a large buy programme from a City investment bank. The more depressing truth is that a decisive turn in bond markets is likely be triggered by developments that are negative for equities. Either the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates high enough to slow down the US economy, or gilts will rally as consumer demand weakens in the UK. Institutions inclined to put fresh money into equities at the start of the new quarter should consider the possibility that, when equities stabilise, it will still be bonds that out-perform.</p>

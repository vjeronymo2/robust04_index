			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANTI-SMOG PLAN  </P> <P> How can AQMD officials expect us to believe they are truly serious about air  quality when everywhere I look diesel trucks and buses spewing out clouds of  acid fumes 24 hours a day, 7 days a week?  </P> <P> Why does the AQMD look the other way and never mention the fact, or only in a  token way?  </P> <P> This has been going on for years, and I see no effort on the part of the diesel  industry to do anything about controlling emissions.  </P> <P> Hundreds of dollars worth of controls have been required on cars for years. I  see no matching effort on diesel vehicles.  </P> <P> Is the trucking industry so insensitive as to think it has no responsibility?  After all, truckers have to live here too. Even our tax-supported school buses  and transit city buses are major offenders.  </P> <P> It is time that a serious effort is made to control diesel emissions. If diesel  emissions were controlled, I am sure the dirty brown smudge that hangs over the  Los Angeles and Orange County basins would disappear.  </P> <P> The token ticketing of trucks for emission violations is totally ineffective.  Why is the El Toro Marine Base allowed to burn its waste oil -- releasing huge  clouds of black smoke into the atmosphere? This compounds the problem. This  doesn't make sense to me!  </P> <P> ALBERT E. TWIDWELL  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel  </P></p>

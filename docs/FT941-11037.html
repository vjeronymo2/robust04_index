			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / BP in talks about floating platform British Petroleum has started sounding out bankers about finance for a possible floating production platform for its new discovery west of the Shetlands. The company declined to comment on reports that it was in talks with bankers but a floating production platform would suit the conditions west of the Shetland islands where the water is considerably deeper than in the North Sea, and where transport by pipeline may not be feasible.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] His Excellency Yusuf Bin-'Alawi Bin-'Abdallah,  minister of state for foreign affairs, has stated that during  the tripartite meeting among His Majesty Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id,  His Excellency Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, and his  deputy 'Ali Salim al- Bid in Salalah yesterday, discussions  dealt with the dimensions of the Yemeni political crisis. His  excellency described this meeting as cordial.    In an exclusive statement to the Omani News Agency, his  excellency Bin-'Abdallah said that after the tripartite meeting,  a closed meeting was held between the Yemeni president and his  deputy. He said that from a personal perspective, the meeting  between the two sides was cordial, warm, and friendly. It seems,  he added, that during the closed meeting, the two sides agreed  on some principles that they believe to be necessary to prevent  any military confrontations or a civil war in Yemen. They  entrusted a committee from the two sides with drafting a  statement that expresses this orientation and these principles.  However, for reasons that we do not known, but which could be  related to the stands of the three major parties, in view of the  known differences already declared by all parties to the Yemeni  crisis, members of the two sides could not agree on issuing such  a statement during their meeting this morning.    In his statement, his excellency the minister of state for  foreign affairs added that, in light of the lack of agreement  between the commands of the Yemeni parties, despite the  orientation of the president and his deputy to evade the  disasters of the crisis, it seems that the commands of the  parties have not reached an agreement yet, especially regarding  the military issues.    In this regard, his excellency said: In the Sultanate of  Oman, we hope that contacts between the parties to the Yemeni  crisis will continue through Yemeni initiatives.    The minister of state for foreign affairs said: In light of  this situation, we should hold consultations with our brothers  in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan to end our participation in  the joint military committee under these circumstances in which  the committee cannot assume its role with regard to the  remaining minutes and meetings. His excellency added: This is  caused by the contradiction in the political stands among the  parties to the Yemeni crisis, particularly the three major  parties.    His excellency said: If no political progress is achieved  among the major parties, the military committee will not be able  to work, and consequently, consultations with the Jordanian side  is necessary.    His excellency the minister of state for foreign affairs  noted that the brothers in Yemen should rely on their political  efforts first and must take into consideration the circumstances  in this difficult phase, the level of responsibility, and the  size of tragedies if, God forbids, the crisis develops contrary  to the interests of Yemen.    His excellency stressed that his majesty the sultan was very  concerned during this meeting to help Yemen overcome this  crisis, or at least, achieve a breakthrough. The minister said:  I can say that a breakthrough on the personal level between the  president and the vice president has occurred. However, he  added, the breakthrough on the level of the three party  leaderships needs time and determination to overcome this  obstacle.    His excellency expressed his belief that the endeavor should  be Yemeni-Yemeni first and that the party leaders must be able  to follow the sound path, forget difficulties, and give up their  conflicting demands because it will be difficult to achieve any  progress on any political track.</p>

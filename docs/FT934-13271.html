			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: BT should not be allowed to carry entertainment Sir, I can but applaud the stance taken in your leader, 'Multi-media superhighways' (October 15), prompted by the proposed merger of TCI and Bell Atlantic. I only wish that your newspaper applied the same principles to its analysis of UK telecommunications competition. If you did, I submit you would not have voiced support in the past for BT being able to carry Video-on-Demand (VOD) services. That is the UK equivalent of permitting the US Baby-Bells to link up with cable companies operating in their own area, which you rightly say would not lead to increased competition. We are not in the US position of having two sets of strong local providers, each migrating into the other's business. Allowing BT to provide VOD is the equivalent of a Baby-Bell acquiring the cable systems in its own backyard. You would allow it the chance to use its power to dominate vision distribution as well as voice, and enhance its ability to prevent alternative networks from being built. If one wants to encourage (or at least not discourage) competition in the provision of local loop services in the UK, I suggest that one has to restrict BT from carrying all entertainment services until the second networks provided by cable operators have grown to a sufficient strength and size. It was thought the government had realised this and that the policy in its 1991 white paper was to prevent BT from conveying entertainment services and providing them until at the least 1998 and 2001 respectively. The effect of permitting VOD services to be provided by means of the BT main network, outside the framework in which the delivery of other entertainment services is regulated, cannot be helpful for the eventual goal of creating voice/vision competition in the local loop for the ultimate benefit of business and residential customers in the UK.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Silviu Achim: "Romanians Compensated by the </F> Hungarian State"]    [Text] On Saturday [8 January], while the mayors and  counselors of ethnic Hungarians living in the southern part of  Slovakia were debating the issue of their self-government in  Komarno, the leaders of the UDMR [Democratic Union of Hungarians  in Romania] county branches held an important meeting in the  town of Miercurea Ciuc. All those who thought that this was  more than just coincidence were wrong, because despite the fact  that UDMR did send a message encouraging the Komarno conference,  UDMR still considers, according to its executive chairman, Csaba  Takacs, that it has to follow its own way, that the steps taken  by the Hungarian minorities living in other regions are not  identical to those taken here, and that neither the success nor  the failure of the Komarno conference can influence in any way  the policy adopted by UDMR. Right now UDMR believes that the  most pressing issue to be dealt with is the Hungarian minority  [of Romania] economic situation. As a matter of fact, one of  the angles of that issue was also debated during the Miercurea  Ciuc meeting.    According to Bela Zsolt Gyorgy, deputy chairman of UDMR,  that  angle refers to the implementation of Bill No.32 of 1991 passed  by the parliament in Budapest, that also concerning -- as  strange as some might find this -- a number of 36,000 Romanian  citizens. The aforementioned bill stipulates that the Hungarian  state should pay damages (in the form of compensation notes) to  its former citizens, who during World War II were captured by  the Soviets. The maximum amount to be paid is 11,000 forints  (about $120) for each month spent by each person after 1 August  1945 in Soviet prisoner camps. The lawmakers decided to  distinguish among persons who are currently Hungarian citizens  and those who today are citizens of other states. The latter may  sell their compensation notes on the free market or on the stock  exchange market; they may buy goods in certain shops; they may  invest them or turn them into stocks of various companies.  However, all this may be done solely in Hungary.    The Miercurea Ciuc meeting was intended to inform the  participants in detail about the stipulations of the  aforementioned bill and to minimize the risks that could occur  while using the said compensation notes. Considering that about  20 percent of the persons eligible to receive such damages are  ethnic Romanians (about 8-10,000 persons), UDMR intends to  translate into Romanian the booklet that it will publish  containing information on the bill. Deputy chairman Gyorgy also  told us that the deadline for registering as a former prisoner  of war has already expired, but between 15 February and 15 March  of this year people can still hand in the necessary  documentation to be included among those who are eligible to  receive compensation.    In Transylvania certain people are still speculating about  the possible political, propaganda, or other kind of purposes of  that bill. And it is quite likely that some of their suspicions  might turn out to be true. However, until then there is nothing  we can do except highlight (and he who has ears will hear)  UDMR's sustained efforts to continuously keep its entire  electorate.</p>

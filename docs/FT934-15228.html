			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Eli Lilly shakeout will cost 275 posts ELI LILLY, the US pharmaceuticals group, is to cut 275 UK jobs in its international rationalisation programme. The redundancies, which will be voluntary, cut across all levels and categories. They will be concentrated at Speke near Liverpool where 107 of the 834 staff will leave, and Basingstoke in Hampshire where 112 out of 650 employees will go. Research staff at Windlesham, Surrey, will be reduced by about 30. The UK subsidiary, employing 2,100 staff, had a turnover last year of Pounds 224m with overseas sales worth Pounds 132m. There will also be cuts in the 35 staff at the European headquarters in London, while the Vienna office, which handles east Europe, will be scaled back. The group said it was still committed to Europe. Earlier this week, the Indianapolis-based parent company announced it was cutting 2,000 jobs, equivalent to 10 per cent of its worldwide workforce. Last year the group turned in its first quarterly loss of Dollars 268.5m. The deficit reflected mainly restructuring and other charges of Dollars 519.6m. Northern Ireland Electricity, the former public utility which was privatised in June, is to shed 600 jobs in the next three years. The redundancies, announced yesterday, will affect management and manual workers in all areas of the company except the shops which sell electrical appliances.</p>

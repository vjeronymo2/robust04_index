			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: STAR(R)ING MOMENT COMES IN A PINCH  </P> <P> What kind of man pinch-hits for Ted Williams? How about Bill Starr, a career  minor leaguer who played only 13 games in the big leagues.  </P> <P> According to Starr's book, "Clearing the Bases," it happened in 1937, when both  were playing for San Diego in the Pacific Coast League.  </P> <P> "We were in a tie game with Seattle. We had a man on first with nobody out in  the last of the ninth, Ted Williams at bat, facing a righty pitcher. Our  manager, Frank Shellenback, had Williams swinging, and he hit a foul -- Strike  1. Shellenback then pulled Williams, who was never called upon to bunt, and  sent me up."  </P> <P> Starr bunted foul and then struck out. He went on to a lackluster career as a  player, although he later owned the PCL Padres. Forever after, though, he could  silence critics by saying, "I was good enough to pinch-hit for Ted Williams."  </P> <P> Bet the IRS knows: Manager Pete Rose of the Cincinnati Reds, the subject of a  gambling investigation, professes to be amused by the allegations of his  betting habits, allegations that vary wildly.  </P> <P> "One week, you owe someone $700,000," he said. "The next week, I win money at  the track. Do I owe it or own it?"  </P> <P> You call this a goon? Donnie Poole is a journeyman fighter whose claim to fame,  so far, is that the Washington Capitals once hired him to "instruct" their  hockey players during training camp.  </P> <P> Poole told Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post that player response was  varied.  </P> <P> Michael Pivonka, for instance, fresh from Czechoslovakia, where fighting on the  ice is forbidden, couldn't even make a fist. On the other hand, Dwight  Schofield was so willing a student that he immediately challenged Poole to a  fight.  </P> <P> Schofield, one of the few Capitals who did not figure to need instruction, at  6-foot-3 and 195 pounds, compared with Poole, 5-5 and 150. Schofield was the  resident goon.  </P> <P> "I agreed to fight him," Poole said. "He was all prepared for it. He had  headgear, boots and a cup. I had nothing. I said, 'I'll box you, but just don't  hit me in the mouth, because I don't have a mouthpiece.' "  </P> <P> Schofield's first punch was at Poole's mouth. Poole ducked, came up with a left  hook and knocked Schofield cold. Schofield was traded a week later.  </P> <P> It's only a dream: Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda has lost 22 pounds since he began  his diet. But at some cost, of course. He told Scott Newman of the Pasadena  Star-News, "I see giant clams in my sleep."  </P> <P> Now he knows how those clams used to feel.  </P> <P> What no-hitter? Not just anybody breaks up Nolan Ryan's no-hitters in the ninth  inning. So far the panel includes Dick Allen, Reggie Jackson and Mike Schmidt.  Oh, also Nelson Liriano, whose career batting average is .256. He's the only  other guy, besides Ted Williams, Bill Starr could hit for.  </P> <P> Liriano would have stood in: Was Ryan always an intimidating pitcher? We'd have  to say yes. As a high school senior he once began a game by splitting the  batting helmet of the first hitter and breaking an arm of the second.  </P> <P> "The third guy," Ryan remembered, "begged not to hit."  </P> <P> Quotebook: Cleveland Indian reliever Doug Jones, asked if he goes into another  state of mind when he's in a save situation: "I don't know anyone who goes into  another mental state, except that Oil Can Boyd."  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: EATERIES' ELUSIVE RECIPE FOR SUCCESS  </P> <P> A few months ago, Andrew Rakos was a trend-setter at Max Factor &amp; Co.,  marketing new cosmetics for men.  </P> <P> Today, he's setting new trends in breakfast and lunch at his 2-month-old West  Los Angeles cafe called Who's on Third.  </P> <P> "I was working 80 hours a week, making a lot of money, but something was  missing," said Rakos, who learned to cook from his Hungarian grandmother.  </P> <P> Determined to combine his marketing skills with his love of good food, Rakos  invested his savings in a ramshackle delicatessen. He sold or threw out  everything in the place, redecorated in bright, upbeat colors and joined the  thousands of entrepreneurs across the country who jump into the risky  restaurant business each year.  </P> <P> Many new restaurants barely survive a year because their inexperienced owners  don't realize that loving good food and wanting to please people are not  enough. A restaurant owner is not only a purchasing agent and personnel  manager, but he or she has to cook when the chef doesn't show up and play  electrician with a balky freezer.  </P> <P> "Those who believe that this is a simple or easy business are doomed to  failure," said Gerald Breitbart, a veteran restaurant owner who counsels scores  of would-be restaurateurs for the California Restaurant Assn.  </P> <P> To be successful, he said, potential restaurant owners must be able to think  clearly under pressure and possess a powerful desire to please the public.  </P> <P> "Regardless of size, you must always believe the customer is a guest in your  house," said Breitbart, who recommends working in a restaurant before thinking  about opening one of your own.  </P> <P> Breitbart said there are five keys to determining the best location for a new  restaurant: population density, accessibility, site dimensions, local zoning  and liquor license availability.  </P> <P> Once you choose a site, prepare a detailed financial plan, projecting whether  your cash flow will service your debt and provide any return on your  investment. Because most bankers consider restaurants extremely risky, plan on  borrowing money from friends and relatives.  </P> <P> Even established restaurant owners have trouble finding working capital. Maxine  Weinman, owner of Maxine's Seafood Cafe in Hollywood, said she would love to  buy a $2,500 lobster tank and a $4,000 double refrigerator.  </P> <P> But she can't find a banker willing to finance her improvements. So far,  bankers have rejected her loan applications because they object to her  less-than-desirable location and the fact that about half of her business  depends on delivering food to customers who work at the surrounding movie and  recording studios. She said bankers are wary because she extends credit to her  biggest customers, who don't have the best financial reputations.  </P> <P> "Owning a restaurant is a never-ending crisis," said Weinman. "You can depend  on walk-in traffic going down when the temperature goes up, the air  conditioning breaking down or the roof springing a leak when it rains."  </P> <P> Despite the challenges, entrepreneurs continue to open new restaurants across  the country every week.  </P> <P> "Everyone seems to have a fantasy of writing a book or opening a restaurant,"  said Danny Liberatoscioli, president of the Restaurant School in Philadelphia.  "But owning a restaurant is hard work. It means 12- to 14-hour days, low pay  and a high rate of business fatality."  </P> <P> His one-year program, which focuses on training people for second careers in  the restaurant business, has drawn students ranging from a former nun to the  co-founder of a major credit card company.  </P> <P> If you want to make a lot of money, stay out of the restaurant business, most  consultants say. About 62% of all eating and drinking establishments had annual  sales below $250,000, according to the 1987 Census of Retail Trade. Eighteen  percent had sales between $250,000 and $500,000 and only 8% had sales of more  than $1 million a year.  </P> <P> The failure rate of restaurants is high. For every 100 restaurants that open,  70 to 80 will fail within two years, according to Saul Leonard, national  partner in charge of leisure industries for the accounting firm of Laventhol  &amp; Horwath. He said there are three major reasons that restaurants fail:  undercapitalization, overspending on site and equipment and inconsistent food  and service. Restaurant patrons, he added, are among the most unforgiving of  consumers.  </P> <P> But Rakos is confident Who's On Third will not be among next year's restaurant  fatalities.  </P> <P> Tapping his marketing skills, Rakos sat across the street from the deli for 10  days, counting patrons going in and out. "I realized the owner had no  business," said Rakos. "Since there was no clientele to buy, I had to start  from scratch."  </P> <P> Rakos bought the business for less than $50,000 and soon transformed the dying  deli into a lively 30-seat eatery catering to neighboring business owners and  residents. His is now among the ranks of the nation's 636,000 restaurants,  which employ about 8 million people and generate more than $200 billion a year  in sales.  </P> <P> "You have to stay clear-headed because things happen all the time in this  business," said Rakos, who plans to start serving dinner in the next few weeks.  </P> <P> In the first week, Rakos went through six chefs, called on his mother to work  as a waitress on opening day and realized he had to install a new air  conditioning system -- fast.  </P> <P> Because you are creating a new product every day, Rakos said the business has  its terrifying moments.  </P> <P> "The worst thing is waking up in the morning and wondering if anyone will come  into my restaurant that day."  </P> <P> "So You Want to Open a Restaurant," an informative, 10-page business planning  guide, is available free from the California Restaurant Assn. Write to the  association at 3425 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 2606, Los Angeles, 90010.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BECOMING A RESTAURATEUR  </P> <P> * Find a good location with plenty of parking and street access.  </P> <P> * Set up a reliable system of ordering food and supplies.  </P> <P> * Plan your menus creatively and completely.  </P> <P> * Hire experienced help whenever possible.  </P> <P> * Make sure you have proper insurance coverage.  </P> <P> * Be sure your operation is sanitary and complies with local health  regulations.  </P> <P> * Order enough supplies, dinnerware, utensils and so on.  </P> <P> * Train your employees well before you open.  </P> <P> * Set up a detailed bookkeeping system.  </P> <P> * To work out all the glitches, begin with limited hours of operation.  </P></p>

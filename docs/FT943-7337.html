			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Ministers warned of legal muddle on VE-day events The government was yesterday faced with the possibility of a another embarrassment over an important second world war anniversary. Mr Don Foster, the Liberal Democrat MP for Bath, accused ministers of creating 'considerable confusion' over next May's VE-day celebrations and urged them to sort out a 'muddle' arising from legislation implemented earlier this year. He called on the government to make 'special dispensations' to allow street parties commemorating the 50th anniversary of VE - victory in Europe - day to go ahead 'without excessive expense and red tape' on May 8. In a letter to Mr Steven Norris, transport minister, Mr Foster said the Road Traffic Regulation (Special Events) Act had caused 'a considerable amount of confusion' because of differences of opinion over the type of event it was meant to cover. Mr Foster said legal experts were divided about the new act, which covers the administration of temporary street closures. District councils said it was meant to apply to all temporary closures, while Department of Transport officials indicated it was intended to cover only large events and not such small events as street parties. Mr Foster asked Mr Norris to clarify the 'anomalies which appear to exist' and urged a 'special allowance' for the re-enactment of street parties. Earlier this year the government bowed to the demands of veterans for a bigger say in the events to mark the Normandy landings in June 1944, after ministers admitted the government's approach had become a public-relations fiasco.</p>

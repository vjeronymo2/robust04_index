No enemy can freely  infringe on the sovereignty of the Korean nation.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is an ever-victorious  iron-willed brilliant commander with an unexcelled clairvoyance,  tested leadership ability and matchless grit and outstanding  intelligence, and a great military genius with both literary and  military accomplishments.    Our republic has become a powerful and dignified country  with  invincible revolutionary armed forces as it has respected  supreme commander General Kim Chong-il as chairman of the  National Defence Commission and enjoys his leadership.    Our supreme commander General Kim Chong-il propounded the  chuche-based idea of army building and is leading the cause of  army building to a brilliant victory with his extraordinary  wisdom and tested commanding art.    Thanks to his tested leadership, our People's Army is  constantly growing in strength to be a matchless, formidable  army in respect of loyalty to the party and the leader,  organisation, discipline and military technique.    Under his wise leadership, the policy of training the whole  army into a cadre army and a modernised army, arming the entire  people and fortifying the whole country has been put into effect  successfully and a powerful domestic self-reliant defence  industry has been built. Never before have the defence  capabilities of the country been so great and have our people  had such a pluck as today.    We are prepared for both war and dialogue.    Our people and army staunchly advancing full of confidence  and optimism with the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as the  supreme commander and the chairman of the National Defence  Commission will smash any counterrevolutionary offensive of the  enemy and firmly defend Korean-style socialism, our life and  soul.

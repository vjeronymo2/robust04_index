			<p>BFN     [Text] Occupied Palestine -- The Israeli bus blast in  Hadera, north of Tel Aviv, this morning has left six Israelis  dead and injured about 30 others, some seriously. Israeli  Police Chief Rafi Peled declared that a suicide operation was  behind the bus blast. The 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions--the  military wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas--claimed  the operation. It stressed that these operations are to avenge  the martyrs of the Hebron massacre. The operation also came one  week after the 'Afula martyrdom operation that left seven  Israelis dead.</p>

			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Reservations over outlook for hotels: Repossessions in the industry are at a record THE TROUBLED British hotels industry has reached a point where a 51-bedroom hotel has been sold with its goodwill valued at just Pounds 1. Four years ago, the Yarborough in Grimsby was bought for Pounds 2m. Now, after the recession that has swept throughout the industry, it has been repossessed and sold at auction by Christie's for a total of only Pounds 350,000. Repossessions of hotels are at a record. Even many of the 'character hotels', which were much in vogue in the 1980s, have not escaped bankruptcy. The upper end of the market is not immune from the recession. Even the Savoy in London's Strand says that one in 10 of its guests try to haggle - unsuccessfully - over their room rates. A manager at the Savoy commented: 'It is a sign of the times. They think that just because business is bad that they can negotiate their own rates.' Hotel occupancy rates are lower overall this year than in 1991 - when business suffered badly because of the effects of the Gulf war - and many in the industry believe conditions has never been quite so bad. Christie's says that sale prices for hotels declined by 16 per cent last year after an average fall of 12 per cent in 1990. All the indicators point to a continuing fall this year. Rank, the entertainment and leisure group, revalued its hotel business last October at 15 per cent lower than the previous year. Queens Moat Houses, a rising star of the trade in the 1980s, had its average room value independently assessed at Pounds 91,000 in December, against Pounds 99,000 a year earlier. Many of the repossessions are of groups and individuals that bought into a buoyant market in the late 1980s only to see their asset values crumble as the recession has bitten. At the same time their customer bases dwindled and income declined. As the squeeze has tightened, branding has become the main issue, particularly for the larger hotel groups. Companies such as Forte, Queens Moat Houses, Vaux and Whitbread have embarked on costly marketing operations in order to corner niche areas of the market and so temper the blow of the recession. Labels such as Garden Court and Travelodge have been created to attract the weekend break customer and the business traveller. At the same time, those hotels which do not fit into the rebranding exercise have been put up for sale. However, there are few buyers at the asking price as sellers attempt to recoup some of the outlay from the inflated prices paid in the late 1980s. Nearly all the big hotel companies have between them several thousand rooms for sale, although few choose to advertise the fact with so little buyer interest. Rank, which has just put its entire UK hotel business up for sale, has been one of the few to admit difficulties and even then said that the sale might take years to complete. The lack of potential buyers, together with rebranding and repossessions, has meant that the market is awash with stock - with a consequent effect on prices. Another indication of the swollen supply side is that Christie's London office has 40 hotels on its books compared with two at the same time three years ago. The banks and institutions that have been badly stung by the present downturn are reluctant to become involved again. 'There is a lack of liquidity in the market,' admits Mr Donald Maine, finance director at Forte, 'although there are signs that demand is slowly creeping back into the market. The situation remains serious, however.' He says that Forte has had several acceptable offers from companies for its secondary-location hotels, but that the banks and other institutions have refused to finance the deals. Although flickers of recovery have been detected, with some companies reporting an improvement in occupancy rates since the general election, industry watchers are not optimistic. 'The market is haemorrhaging,' says Mr Simon Johnstone, a hotels analyst at Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank. 'Many of the independent hotels are going to the wall. It could take up to four years for the industry to return to the levels of profitability seen in 1989.'</p>

			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Appointments: Bowthorpe's third man Do ex-financial journalists make good company chairmen? Anthony Vice, who spent 18 years as a city scribbler before moving into merchant banking, is about to find out. He has been appointed non-executive chairman of BOWTHORPE Holdings, the 55-year-old electronics group. The 60-year-old Vice, who has written a number of books,including Bid for Power and Financier at Sea, has taken over from Raymond Parsons who retired as executive chairman at the end of the year. The 81-year-old Parsons, who was only the second chairman - after founder Jack Bowthorpe himself - in the company's history, has been made life president and remains a non-executive director. John Westhead, Bowthorpe's group managing director since 1980, has been promoted to chief executive. After Oxford, Vice joined the Financial Times in 1953, moved to the Daily Telegraph in 1958 and the Sunday Times six years later. He helped found the Times Business News in 1967, and in 1971 joined N M Rothschild. Vice says that his switch into merchant banking at a relatively elderly 39 followed a celebrated lunch where Jacob Rothschild asked him if he would like to play the game rather than just write about it. He stepped down as a director of N M Rothschild, Bowthorpe's financial advisers, at the end of 1991. ***** Sir Derek Alun-Jones, the former chairman of Ferranti International who resigned in the wake of extensive fraud at its US subsidiary, has been named chairman of STRAKER, a small contract stationery company based in Mitcham, Surrey. The chairmanship of Straker, a company with a turnover of less than Pounds 10m, had previously revolved between directors at successive board meetings. Jonathan Straker, one of the directors, says he has known Sir Derek since their army days, and approached an old friend 'knowing he had time on his hands'. Sir Derek is unlikely to have accepted the post for its financial rewards - the size of his Ferranti pay-off caused many raised eyebrows at the time. Perhaps he harbours some nostalgia for stationery: back in the 1960s he was finance director of Henry C Stephens, a big name in the ink business in those days. ***** Frank Tomes is appointed product chief executive of T&amp;N's industrial products and materials, part of its bearings and industrial division. Tomes is also md of BIP Chemicals which has been reorganised into two divisions: the moulding materials division, for which the md is Greville Hampshire, and the resins division, for which the md is John Heaton. ***** In a separate move, T&amp;N has appointed David Mcllalieu md of Ferodo, Brian Lindsay md of Ferodo Caernarfon, and Richard Newson md of Brake Linings. ***** Roderick Sears-Black is appointed production director of TAVENERS. ***** On the retirement of Gordon Dunlop, Simon Miller is appointed chairman of FERRUM Holdings; he is replaced as chief executive by Garry Frier.</p>

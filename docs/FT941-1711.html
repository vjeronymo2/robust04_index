			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / City banker jailed for six years Mr Wallace Duncan Smith, the former City merchant banker convicted of a sophisticated Pounds 100m fraud on banks and other financial institutions, was jailed for six years at the Old Bailey yesterday. The former chairman and joint managing director of Wallace Smith Trust Company, a small merchant bank, was convicted last month on one charge of fraudulent trading and two of obtaining property by deception after a three-month trial. Sentencing him, Mr Justice Tuckey said: 'The size of the loss must make it one of, if not the most, serious case of fraudulent trading to come before the courts.' The judge accepted that small investors had not been among the losers from Mr Smith's fraud. However, he said it was no mitigation to say that the losers had only been banks and other financial institutions. 'They lost because they trusted you,' said Mr Justice Tuckey. 'Trust is still a valuable, and in some cases an essential, part of commercial life. You abused it and must inevitably have damaged the reputation of the City of London in doing so.' Wallace Smith Trust Company began to run into severe financial problems in 1990. To cover the losses, Mr Smith committed a series of frauds to give the impression that his bank was trading profitably. At the heart of his fraud was the practice of 'double-dipping' - the use and re-use of certificates of deposit to obtain a series of loans from banks. To avoid detection, Mr Smith laundered the money out of the UK into two shell companies in Canada before routing it back to his bank by charging them bogus management fees. To keep the true nature of these Canadian companies secret, he deliberately appointed accountants seeking short-term work to act as their directors. In April 1991 he committed his largest fraud when he cheated the Discount Bank and Trust Company of Pounds 25m using fictitious Canadian bonds. Mr Smith was jailed for six years concurrently on each of the three counts. He was disqualified from being a company director for 12 years and told that if he did not meet a confiscation order within six months, another year would be added to his sentence. The court heard that under the limited confiscation order Mr Smith has to repay cash reflecting the value of shotguns and rifles he had given to his son after his arrest and just before a Mareva injunction - which freezes his assets worldwide - was issued.</p>

			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / CBI urges single pensions regulator THE CONFEDERATION of British Industry is calling for a single regulator to supervise occupational pension schemes in its response to the government's Pension Law Review Committee chaired by Professor Roy Goode. In a report to be published today the CBI says the key to the future security of occupational pension schemes lies in effective regulation and supervision. It shares the view of Prudential, the UK's largest life assurance company, that that requires a single body responsible for supervision. The Goode committee was set up in the wake of the frauds at pension schemes associated with the late Robert Maxwell. The CBI says: 'The Maxwell revelations must be set against the good record of around 460,000 occupational pension schemes. Additional costs must be carefully balanced against the need to promote and encourage good pension provision.' On the question of compensation schemes for pension shortfalls Sir Bryan Corby, deputy president of the CBI, says: 'If such a scheme is introduced, it should be in respect of fraud only and should not cover poor investment or overfunding.'

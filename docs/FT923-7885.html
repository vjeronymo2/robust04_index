			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Prospects for S Africa talks suffer setback HOPES of an early resumption of South Africa's constitutional talks received a serious setback last night as the African National Congress (ANC) announced that its preliminary contact with the government, including discussions for a blanket amnesty, had proved 'fruitless'. The ANC said that there had been 'no visible movement' from the government in terms of meeting the core demands - for an ending of violence, the installation of an interim government and constituent assembly elections. The ANC says these demands must be met before negotiations can recommence. As a result the ANC said it would 'refuse any further requests for meetings with the government.' Earlier in the day, Mr Kobie Coetsee, minister of justice, told a news conference in Pretoria that substantial agreement had been reached with the (ANC) on details of a blanket amnesty for those who had committed political crimes which would 'wipe the slate clean and bury the past' where serious political crimes have been committed. The ANC in a statement denied that any such agreement had been reached, saying it had never lent its support to a general amnesty and denyingany link between the question of political prisoners and amnesty. Talks, which ended in stalemate, at the last formal negotiating round in May, were suspended by the ANC in June following the massacre of 42 residents of Boipatong. However, the ANC's comments come at the end of a week when the two main parties had seemed to be moving together again, following last week's general strike and mass action protests. Mr Coetsee said the government had approved an amnesty plan drawn up in recent bilateral discussions between itself and the ANC. He said the talks were facilitated by Mr Cyrus Vance, the United Nations special envoy, during his visit to the country last month. The ANC believes that the estimated 300-400 political prisoners still in jail, mostly ex-ANC members, should be released under existing amnesty arrangements. The government argues that they are guilty of serious common law crimes such as murder and grievous bodily harm that are not covered by the earlier agreements. It believes a new blanket amnesty, which would also cover members of the security forces and state, would be necessary. The ANC says it has decided to suspend any further talks with the government on the issue of political prisoners because of the government's bad faith. It also disputes the 'moral competence' of the current government to offer amnesty saying this is a matter for an interim government. The ANC argues that security force members involved in the violence should be prosecuted, not granted amnesty. The ANC also disputed the call, made inter alia by Judge Goldstone who is leading a commission investigating political violence, that a general amnesty was necessary to help investigations. The flare-up last night overshadowed the government's announcement earlier in the day that it had accepted the report of UN secretary-general Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali which includes a recommendation for an external investigation into state security and the sending of 30 observers. Mr Pik Botha, the foreign minister, said the government agreed with the tone of the the secretary general's report and with its recommendations 'as a whole'.</p>

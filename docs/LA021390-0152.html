			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RENEWED CAR REBATES HELP DRIVE UP RETAIL SALES 1.6% IN JANUARY  </P> <P> Retail sales driven by renewed automobile sales incentives climbed 1.6% in  January, the steepest increase in more than a year, the government reported  today.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said sales increased to a seasonally adjusted $146.4  billion after declining a revised 0.2% in December during what analysts  described as modest holiday shopping.  </P> <P> The January gain was the sharpest since a 2.1% advance in October, 1988.  </P> <P> "Consumer spending is still alive," said John Silvia, an economist with Kemper  Financial Services in Chicago. Most categories showed advances that "suggest to  me that the consumer is coming back in the first quarter, taking up his normal  pace of spending."  </P> <P> December sales originally had been reported to have gained 0.2%. A drop in  estimated auto sales accounted for the decline. Overall sales in November rose  0.7%.  </P> <P> Retailing usually slows in January because of the previous month's activity.  Half or more of retail profits come from business between Thanksgiving and  Christmas.  </P> <P> Retail sales account for about one-third of the nation's economic activity and  thus are a barometer of economic growth. The economy, particularly the  construction and manufacturing sectors, has been squeezed by high interest  rates as the Federal Reserve kept a tight rein on credit to cap inflation.  </P> <P> The automobile industry, slowed by the high rates and rising prices on 1990  models, reinstituted rebates on many models last month to lure buyers to dealer  showrooms.  </P> <P> Commerce said auto sales gained 5.4% in January after falling 2.6% in December.  It was the largest advance since a 6.6% increase in October, 1988. Autos  represent about 20% of retail sales.  </P> <P> Excluding autos, retail sales for the month would have risen 0.6%.  </P> <P> The overall durable goods category -- including cars and other big-ticket items  expected to last more than three years -- gained 3.9% after declining 2.1% in  December.  </P> <P> Building materials advanced 2.3%, while furniture and other home furnishings  rose 2%.  </P> <P> Sales of non-durable goods such as food and clothing edged up 0.3%.  </P></p>

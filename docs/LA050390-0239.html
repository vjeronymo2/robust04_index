			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH 'CAN'T REJOICE' WHILE 6 OTHERS ARE HELD HOSTAGE  </P> <P> President Bush said today that while he welcomes the recent release of two  Americans hostages in Lebanon, he "can't rejoice . . . as long as six others  are held hostage."  </P> <P> Asked whether the release of Frank Reed and Robert Polhill might foretell the  release of all Americans, Bush said, "I can't say that our actions facilitated  the release of Reed and Polhill.  </P> <P> "I hope that the affirmation and reaffirmation of our policy contributed, but  there were no behind-the-scenes actions that pulled this off."  </P> <P> The President said at a morning news conference that he welcomed the release of  Reed and Polhill, "but I can't rejoice and say my heart is full of hope and  goodwill as long as six others are held hostages."  </P> <P> The six include Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for the  Associated Press, who was kidnaped in March, 1985, and is the longest-held  Western hostage in Lebanon.  </P> <P> Bush said he would be willing to make goodwill gestures to Iran "that wouldn't  be perceived as negotiating for the release of hostages."  </P> <P> Asked what those gestures might be, the President mentioned that Iran is eager  to learn about four Iranian diplomats kidnaped in Lebanon in 1982.  </P> <P> "If we could go back and get any information that would relieve the anxiety of  the loved ones of those people, we ought to do that," Bush said. "I can  understand the Iranians wanting the full accounting. Here they've said, 'Here  is an area where we can get information.' "  </P> <P> He added that the United States does not think the four diplomats are alive.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NEW YORK;  </P> <P> SUBWAY BEGGING BAN OVERTURNED  </P> <P> In an unprecedented ruling, a federal judge overturned a ban on begging in the  New York City subway system, saying panhandling was a form of free speech  protected by the Constitution.  </P> <P> "While often disturbing and sometimes alarmingly graphic, begging is  unmistakenly informative and persuasive speech," U.S. District Judge Leonard  Sand wrote in his 42-page ruling. The ruling was hailed by lawyers for two  homeless men who brought the class-action suit against the Transit Authority,  the agency that operates the city's subways. A spokesman for the Transit  Authority's parent agency said it was "obviously upset with the decision."  </P></p>

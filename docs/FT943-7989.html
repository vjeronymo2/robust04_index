			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / International Company News: Northam posts loss of R129.7m for first year Northam Platinum, the South African platinum mine in the Gold Fields stable, has reported a loss of R129.7m (Dollars 35.2m) for the year to June, its first full year of operations. Production, at 1.15m tonnes milled, was well below expected levels and sales revenue amounted to R238.4m against costs of R364.2m. The company, which launched a R350m rights issue in 1992, has also used up its cash resources as well as most of its R220m loan facility and has had to arrange a further R25m loan to finance its losses. The poor results were attributed to the mining area being far more geologically unstable than expected. The situation had been aggravated by the presence of high yield water fissures and fracturing to the east of the complex. Northam is currently carrying out a technical assessment to determine the operation's future viability.</p>

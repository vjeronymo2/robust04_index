			<p>BFN     [Text] Geza Jeszenszky is worried that the Socialist Party  [MSZP], which is leading in the elections, might want to change  the direction of foreign policy. In a statement to a Ukrainian  paper, the foreign minister mentioned as an example the fact  that the Socialists, contrary to the six-party agreement, are  urging a referendum about joining NATO. Geza Jeszenszky also  criticized the MSZP for thinking that relations more balanced  than the present ones are possible with Romania, Slovakia, and  Serbia. According to the Hungarian Democratic Forum government  member, the political directions and minority policies of these  countries preclude rapprochement.</p>

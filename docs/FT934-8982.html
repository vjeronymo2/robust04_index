			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Overseas activities give boost to Bank of Ireland BANK OF IRELAND yesterday disclosed doubled pre-tax profits for the half year, helped by a sharp improvement in retail banking operations in the US and Britain. The profits rise for the six months to end-September was from IPounds 65.8m to IPounds 130.9m (Pounds 124.5m). Earnings per share of 15.2p compared with 6.6p. Results from businesses outside Ireland were IPounds 40m ahead of the corresponding period last year. The figures were also helped by a 32 per cent fall in loan loss provisions to IPounds 43.1m (IPounds 63.8m). However, provisions within its corporate banking operations in Ireland rose to IPounds 10m (IPounds 3m) as a result of two large losses. Profits for the retail banking business in Ireland rose to IPounds 80.7m (IPounds 66.7m), while British operations returned to a profit of IPounds 1m (IPounds 5.7m deficit) and an IPounds 3.5m loss (IPounds 27.3m loss) for its New Hampshire businesses. The bank reported a return to a profit of Dollars 6.1m (Pounds 4.03m) for New Hampshire in the third quarter, to appear in its second half results. It has disposed of non-performing assets, reducing them to IPounds 28m against IPounds 84m at the end of 1992. Mr Maurice Keane, deputy chief executive, said that retail banking in Ireland had performed well despite 'not very strong loan demand' from retail customers. He said cost-cutting in Britain had produced a 'leaner, fitter' business. Mr Keane said problems with non-performing loans in New Hampshire had largely been solved. The cut in non-performing assets had been accompanied by a growth in provisions cover to the level of 250 per cent of the remaining assets. The bank's tier 1 ratio of core capital to risk-weighted assets strengthened to 7.3 per cent (6.6 per cent at the end of 1992) following the bank's IPounds 100m rights issue earlier this year largely used to repurchase preference stock. The interim dividend was increased to 3.75p (3.13p). COMMENT Bank of Ireland's strong share performance this year is justified by its brisk correction of past problems overseas, and strict control of domestic business. A cut in provisions despite a hiccup in large corporate lending shows the benefits of this discipline. Full year pre-tax profits of IPounds 260m would give earnings per share of 30p, a multiple of about 10. This is not a dangerous price for a well-managed business, but the lack of loan demand afflicting all banks means there are questions over future growth.</p>

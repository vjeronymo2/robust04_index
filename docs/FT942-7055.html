			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / British Gas hits at constraints British Gas yesterday called for the early lifting of regulations that restrict its activities in the commercial market of consumers who use more than 2,500 therms a year. Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive, told an energy conference in London that government efforts designed to promote competition were now 'anti-competitive, because they tilt the playing field in favour of other companies'. British Gas has to reduce its share of the market for users of more than 2,500 therms to 55 per cent by 1995. However Mr Brown said market share constraints had already resulted in competitors capturing 45 per cent of the market. Mr Brown also complained that British Gas was subsidising independent gas marketers that used the gas pipeline system. 'It makes a nonsense of free market forces . . . and is sending false signals to end users of gas.' He rejected competitors' allegations that British Gas had overvalued its transportation system. Ofgas, the industry regulator, will announce early next month the formula which will govern the prices that British Gas will be able to charge for transportation, and the rate of return it can earn on its transportation assets. Mr Brown warned that the phased opening of the domestic market, due to begin in 1996, was a 'massive experiment' affecting 18m households, and that there was 'precious little time to work out potential problems'. Mr Jonathan Stern, a fellow at the Royal Institute of International Affairs, also warned about possible problems of adhering to the government's ambitious timetable. He suggested that it might be best if legislation to open up the domestic sector slipped by a year to give the industry more time to work out potential problems. Ms Clare Spottiswoode, Ofgas director-general, conceded that de-regulation on such a scale had not been attempted elsewhere. She said Ofgas was aware that a number of problems needed to be solved before competition was introduced'. Ms Spottiswoode, who has been caught up in a political controversy over her refusal to pass on to consumers the costs of energy savings schemes, said Ofgas will publish a paper on the subject in July. She hoped it would spark off 'an extensive debate in parliament'. Ms Spottiswoode said British Gas and Ofgas were looking at ways in which they could promote energy efficiency without having to tax consumers.</p>

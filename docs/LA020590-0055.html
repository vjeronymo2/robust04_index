			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> PRENATAL TEST FOR STEROID THERAPY  </P> <P> A USC geneticist has developed a prenatal test that should be able to determine  which babies with respiratory distress syndrome will respond to treatment with  steroids, thereby making it easier for physicians to determine the proper  treatment for them. Respiratory distress syndrome, characterized by immature  development of the lungs, strikes one in five premature infants and can be  life-threatening.  </P> <P> Conventional treatment of the syndrome involves using corticosteroids, which  promote maturation of the lung. But 20% of babies with the syndrome do not  respond to the drug. These infants are exposed to the side effects of  corticosteroids without the benefits, and effective treatment is delayed.  </P> <P> Michael Melnick reported last week in the American Journal of Medical Genetics  that premature mice that do not respond to steroid therapy have a distinctive  genetic pattern that can be recognized by prenatal screening. Because humans  have a similar pattern, the test should work for them as well. Clinical trials  could begin within a year.  </P></p>

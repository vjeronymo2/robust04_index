			<p><P> October 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARINO STREAK ENDS AS BILLS GET 2 SACKS; DOLPHINS LOSE, 31-17  </P> <P> Thurman Thomas rushed for 148 yards in 27 carries and Larry Kinnebrew had 121  in 21 tries and each scored a touchdown as the Buffalo Bills emphasized the run  and the pass rush in a 31-17 victory over the Miami Dolphins Sunday.  </P> <P> The Bills have won three in a row and five of their last six and lead the  American Conference East with a 6-2 record.  </P> <P> The game was played before 80,208 fans -- the largest crowd ever at Rich  Stadium.  </P> <P> Buffalo twice sacked Dan Marino, who had gone 19 games without being sacked,  and gained 280 against the Dolphins. Thomas and Kinnebrew accounted for all but  11 of those yards.  </P> <P> The Bills ran on 51 of their 60 plays.  </P> <P> With Frank Reich at quarterback, Buffalo has won all three games since Jim  Kelly separated a shoulder in a 37-14 loss to the Indianapolis Colts on Oct. 8.  </P> <P> Jeff Wright snapped Marino's streak of 759 pass attempts without a sack in the  second quarter, and Cornelius Bennett had another sack in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Marino also threw three interceptions, with Kirby Jackson returning his second  of the game 40 yards for a touchdown with three minutes to play. Scott Secules  then replaced Marino, who had 20 completions in 36 attempts for 255 yards.  </P> <P> The Dolphins (4-4) managed only 65 yards rushing in losing for the first time  in four games.  </P> <P> A 21-point second quarter by the Bills blew the game open and gave them a 21-3  lead at halftime.  </P> <P> Kinnebrew opened the explosion two seconds into the quarter with a one-yard  touchdown run. All 15 plays on the 76-yard drive were rushes.  </P> <P> A Bennett interception at the Miami 42-yard line set up the score that put  Buffalo ahead, 14-3. Bruce Smith, who stopped Dolphins running back Sammie  Smith several times for losses in the first half, hurried Marino into throwing  the interception.  </P> <P> Thomas finished the four-play drive with a 30-yard scoring run. The play began  as a sweep to the right and Thomas dodged four would-be tacklers before cutting  to the left and into the end zone.  </P> <P> The final touchdown of the quarter came on a 63-yard pass from Reich to rookie  Don Beebe.  </P> <P> Miami's two touchdowns came on two 44-yard passes, one from Marino to Mark  Clayton and the other from Secules to Andre Brown.  </P></p>

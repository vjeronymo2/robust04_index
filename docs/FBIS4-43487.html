			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed LAR/MJN: "Delcroix: Belgium Will Not Send </F> Troops To Rwanda"]    [Text] Brussels, 16 June (BELGA) -- "If France decided to  intervene in Rwanda within a multinational framework, Belgium  would not send any troops," a spokesman for Defense Minister  Delcroix stated on Thursday [16 June]. "It is not excluded that  Belgium may provide logistic support, such as equipment, but the  Belgian Government still has to decide on that on Friday," he  stated.    Minister Delcroix believes that such an operation need not  necessarily be carried out by the Blue Helmets, but it must  nevertheless obtain UN backing.</p>

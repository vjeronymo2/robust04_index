			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] His Highness Shaykh Jabir al-Ahmad al-Sabah, the  amir of the fraternal state of Kuwait, this afternoon received  brother Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, the prime minister, who  briefed him on the developments of the dispute in our country,  the progress of the battles there, and regional and Arab  reactions. During the meeting, Shaykh Jabir al-Ahmad al-Sabah  expressed fraternal Kuwait's firm and consistent stand which  calls for the settling of disputes with the logic of national  interest and fraternal dialogue in isolation of the use of  force. His highness stressed during his meeting with brother  Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas that the use of force and arms would  only exacerbate the differences and problems. Wounds would be  deepened and strength would be lost, while destruction would  prevail. He said Kuwait would support any sincere and useful  effort to stem the bloodshed and restore understanding and amity  between the two parts of Yemen. The amir of Kuwait expressed  fear that the Yemeni conflict would have adverse effects on the  overall Arab situation. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A FAMILY AFFAIR  </P> <P> Whenever people ask me about the situation in Nicaragua, I tell them it's a  civil war. Now Art Seidenbaum has reviewed a book that points out how and why  it is a civil war ("Memoirs of a Counter-Revolutionary" by Arturo Cruz Jr.,  Book Review, Nov. 19).  </P> <P> Families are so interrelated that when I lived in Nicaragua, we used to joke  that one should never make disparaging remarks about anybody, because there was  bound to be a relative of that person sitting next to you.  </P> <P> If the South, more than 100 years after our Civil War, is still hoping to "rise  again," it should be obvious to our government that it is futile to expect the  U.S. to ever resolve the differences in Nicaragua by intervening in their civil  war.  </P> <P> Thanks for an excellent review.  </P> <P> ANGELA MCEWAN  </P> <P> WHITTIER  </P></p>

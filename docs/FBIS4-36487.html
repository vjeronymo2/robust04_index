			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam </F> al-Majali, in Amman, by Ashraf 'Abd-al-'Aziz, in Cairo; date not  given; from the "Dialogue From Afar" program -- recorded]    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] First, let us shed light on the new cabinet  reshuffle in Jordan.    [Al-Majali] When it was first formed, this government, which  I had the honor of leading, began a new experiment, what we call  separation of executive and legislative powers, and no one from  the House of Representatives took part in it. The experiment  was very good. The non-presence of a deputy in that government  or in any government should not be interpreted as preventing  deputies from being ministers. This is totally wrong. There is  a large number of deputies who have the capability of performing  successful ministerial work.    Under the new reshuffle, 10 new deputies from various  parliamentary blocs and various provinces in Jordan joined the  cabinet. Eight new members also entered the cabinet so this is  a cabinet reshuffle, not reformation.    We always believe in a measure like in the military; a group  or platoon is in the trenches and is replaced by another group  and the process is repeated. We have a good rotation process  and most times it bears fruit. Of course, it has some negative  aspects, but it also has good, positive aspects.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] But surely you have a specific view of a new  phase that Jordan will witness in light of this new cabinet  reshuffle.    [Al-Majali] As you know, the entire region is experiencing a  delicate phase covering a regional order and the so-called  Middle Eastern market. Al these issues are delicate and require  very close cooperation between the executive and legislative  authorities and require the whole country to stand together and  envisage a good future for the state.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Moving from the cabinet reshuffle to the  peace talks, there is a Jordanian-Israeli negotiations committee  holding its sessions in Washington to discuss the border and  participation in water resources. Let us learn about Jordan's  view put forth by that committee.    [Al-Majali] As you know, Jordan signed an agenda with Israel  on 14 September last year and the agenda is clear, especially in  the bases on which it relied. Of course, the basic topics of  that agenda include the withdrawal from the Jordanian  territories, our right to water, and the issue of refugees and  the displaced, in addition to various other topics. It was  agreed to list these issues in an agenda to enable us to  negotiate on them and the bilateral talks assumed this task.  Even in the negotiations on the four tracks, the Arab brothers  agreed that each track has its own characteristics and thus its  progress should be different but what is important is that all  tracks should make the final line.    Before the negotiations stopped because of the Hebron  incident, there was an agreement to form a tripartite  U.S.-Jordanian-Israeli committee to discuss a host of issues,  including those listed on the agenda. We received information  that Israel is now ready to form a joint committee to demarcate  the border correctly prior to withdrawal from the Jordanian  territories and committees to discuss legitimate shares of  water. These two basic points have always been on the agenda  but we were unable to initiate their discussion seriously.  Through the tripartite committee we are now able to do that and  hence came the meetings in Washington to emphasize these points  and put the agreement into a mechanism [last word in English].  According to the agenda, the two sides should agree on a  mechanism and phases for the negotiations to proceed on each  topic.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Israeli suggests that a new road linking  'Aqabah and Elat be opened. What is Jordan's stand on this  proposal?    [Al-Majali] There are many points on the agenda that  stipulates that all parties should cooperate in projects in the  region that are beneficial to all sides concerned. These  projects include, for example, a canal between the Red Sea and  the Dead Sea and a road linking Egypt and Jordan via Elat.  These are projects for the future and the discussion now is on  whether they can or cannot be examined. There is an agreement to  study these projects.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Moving on to Arab issues, what preoccupies  the Arab arena is the current situation in Yemen. What is  Jordan's view on what is happening in Yemen?    [Al-Majali] Jordan's stand is firm and has not changed since  the problem began when the president and vice president asked  His Majesty King Husayn to help them resolve the issue between  them. A dialogue committee was formed, the Amman accord was  concluded, and what happened afterward is known.    We believe in unity. We have an absolute faith in unity and  do not believe in separation because a separation that takes  place in Yemen might take place in any other Arab country. We  are against this. We are not against the south at all but  against the idea of separation. We support unity and oppose  infighting no matter what the reason.</p>

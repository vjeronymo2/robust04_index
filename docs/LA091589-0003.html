			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILLIAM MILLER, 80; CONGRESS DOORMAN, 'FISH BAIT' AUTHOR  </P> <P> William (Fish Bait) Miller, the affable doorkeeper of the U.S. House of  Representatives whose stentorian "Mistuh Speakah -- the Prez-dent of the  Yoo-nited States" echoed across the halls of Congress for nearly 25 years, has  died.  </P> <P> Miller, who opened doors for such visiting House dignitaries as the future  queen of England (who he greeted with a "howdy ma'am") and then wrote a book  that opened doors on the antics of congressmen, was 80 when he died Tuesday at  his home in Greensboro, N.C.  </P> <P> Sherrill Bumgarner, director of Hanes-Lineberry Funeral Home in Greensboro, did  not provide a cause of death.  </P> <P> In his long tenure, Miller introduced six presidents at joint sessions of  Congress and countless other visiting statesmen to the House, letting each name  spin forth in an elongated announcement accented by his native Mississippi  drawl.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wrote 'Fish Bait'  </P> <P> The assembled Congress would then applaud and Miller would sit down at the  front of the chamber.  </P> <P> What he saw and learned of the workings of Capitol Hill led to his book, "Fish  Bait," which also included accounts of the drinking and sexual exploits of  several members of Congress.  </P> <P> Miller's job came to involve more than guarding doors. He supervised 357  employees and an annual budget of $3.5 million. From his oppulent office he  oversaw messengers, pages, barbers and janitors.  </P> <P> Fish Bait, who was assigned the sobriquet when he was 15 and still weighed only  75 pounds, was born William Mosely Miller in Pascagoula, Miss., a small town  that was so near the Gulf Coast that "if you go any farther south you are going  to get your feet awfully wet."  </P> <P> And Fish Bait was always two words, he told interviewers. "Capital Fish,  Capital Bait."  </P> <P> Miller first arrived in Washington in 1933 and he took a job as a clerk in the  House post office.  </P> <P> He was first named minority doorkeeper in 1947, when the Democrats lost control  of the House. He had competition for the job in 1949, when the Democrats  regained majority status, but he wrote personal notes to each member while his  opponent sent a mimeographed letter.  </P> <P> Miller said he helped Democratic House members get their choice of offices by  sanding his fingertips so he could identify by touch the metal disks drawn to  determine office assignments.  </P> <P> Probably his most famous moment came in 1952 when Queen Elizabeth II, then the  crown princess of England, and her husband, Prince Philip, visited Washington.  </P> <P> Miller walked up to her, said "howdy ma'am" and then proceeded to escort the  royal duo around the House chamber.  </P> <P> "Wave to the boys and girls in the gallery," Miller told the prince. "I will  not," Philip replied.  </P> <P> Five feet, eight inches and slightly pear shaped, Miller lost his job in 1974  in a power switch that cost Rep. Wilbur Mills most of his influence and all his  appointments. Mills had become publicly involved with a stripper.  </P> <P> By then Miller had become a Capitol Hill legend. He prided himself on knowing  the birthdays of most congressmen, of saying that "everyone's important here,"  of prowling the corridors of Congress in his bare feet, having left his shoes  in the House barber shop where they were being shined.  </P> <P> After the power shift, the man who once told Rep. Bella Abzug to remove her hat  in the House (she encouraged him to perform an anatomically impossible act)  returned to Mississippi, where he co-authored "Fish Bait," in which the lives  and exploits of many congressmen were touched upon. He later moved to  Greensboro to be near his daughter.  </P> <P> Miller said his favorite Democrats were former President Harry S. Truman (who  laughed away Miller's potentially damaging remarks to the royal couple) and  longtime House Speaker Sam Rayburn.  </P> <P> "Sam Rayburn's heart was as big as my head and your head put together," he once  said. "And Truman, I liked him because he said exactly what he meant and you  always knew exactly where he stood."  </P> <P> He also had fond remembrances of Republican Richard M. Nixon, who once sent him  a birthday card that "made me feel like sovereignty, which I ain't."  </P></p>

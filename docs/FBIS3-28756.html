As was already reported, the South Korean ruling bunch  blocked the visit to Seoul by our side's delegation of  condolence to attend the funeral service for Rev. Mun Ik-hwan.  In addition, it frustrated the Panmunjom contact between the  Chondoist delegates of the North and the South to jointly  commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Kabo farmers war, thus  blocking the joint commemoration of the anniversary by the North  and the South.    On 17 January, the South Korean ruling bunch arrested and  imprisoned in the fascist prison Ho Hyun-chong, senior in  Chonbuk University in South Korea, on the charge of violation of  the notorious National Security Law, claiming that he had  dialogue through international telephone line with the delegates  of the North during the first conference of joint chairmen of  the National Alliance of Youth and Students for National  Reunification [Pomchonghangnyon] last year in the capacity of  South side's vice chairman of Pomchonghangnyon.    Some time ago, the puppet district court in Kwangju staged a  court trial for five Chonnam University students who studied and  researched the immortal chuche idea, and sentenced all of them  to prison terms.    The North-South confrontation commotions and cruel  oppression  of democratic reunification forces which have been perpetrated  by the Kim Yong-sam group more viciously with the beginning of  the new year fully revealed its antinational and  antireunification traitorous color.    By blocking our side's delegation of condolence which wanted  to visit Seoul to attend the funeral ceremony of Rev. Mun  Ik-hwan, the Kim Yong-sam group exposed itself as the group of  peerless traitors and separatists who totally discarded  conscience and essential etiquette and morality as a human  being, being engrossed with commotions on division and  confrontation.    Besides, the Kim Yong-sam group blocked the joint  commemoration of the events marking the 100th anniversary of  Kabo farmers war, which was carried out to safeguard the  national spirit under the ideal of rejecting foreign aggressors  and promoting the people's welfare by defending the country.  Thus, the Kim Yong-sam group showed its true color as the group  of antinational ill-bred hooligans who disgraced our forefathers.    Those who cruelly oppressed the innocent youth, students and  people, who called for national reunification, at the point of  guns and bayonets cannot have any intent for reunification.    The puppets are, in actuality, running wild in an attempt to  crush us in collusion with outside forces on a pretext of  suspicion of nuclear arms development by the North. They are  trying to stage large-scale exercise of a northward war of  aggression, including the Team Spirit joint military exercise,  together with outside forces, thus aggravating tension of the  nation to an extreme pitch. They are bringing dark clouds of  nuclear war over the heads of fellow countrymen and viciously  maneuvering to realize the international cooperation system and  so-called sanctions against us by clinging to sleeves of outside  forces.    They even opened rice markets in South Korea in an attempt  to  block third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. Moreover, they begged  outside forces to set up an international cooperation system in  an attempt to oppose our package solution plan for the  resolution of the nuclear problem.    The vicious maneuvers of the Kim Yong-sam group to aggravate  North-South relations and to block the road to reunification  evoked indignation of fellow countrymen who want reunification.    It is unanimous intent of the South Korean people that the  Kim Yong-sm separatist regime must be overthrown in order to  achieve national reconciliation, unity and reunification that  all fellow countrymen are aspiring to.    The South Korean people, who cannot live without  reunification, absolutely will not tolerate the Kim Yong-sam  group, the most vicious enemy of reunification who is  frantically running amok to block the national reunification  under the veil of civilian government.</p>

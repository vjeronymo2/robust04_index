			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Property: Further decline in all-property return rate The all-property rate of total return continues to decline, recording 0.5 per cent for September, according to Investment Property Database. Although the published equivalent yield remains at 8.1 per cent for the month, underlying yield trends show further signs of lengthening, with a small outward shift of 0.01 points. This resulted in a fall of 0.1 per cent in capital values, the first time since May 1993 that capital growth has gone negative across the whole IPD Monthly Index, taking the index down to 128.77. Rental values fell by 0.04 per cent in September, to give an index value of 136.4 for September, compared with 136.45 the previous month. For the three-month period of the third quarter, the rates of both total return and capital values growth continue to show marked decline in comparison with the first and second quarters. The rate of all-property total return was 1.8 per cent for the three months to the end of September, compared with 3.9 per cent for the second quarter, 7.8 per cent for the first quarter and 8.3 per cent for the fourth quarter of 1993. Capital value growth for the three months to September was -0.1 per cent against 1.8 per cent for the quarter to June. However, rental value decline has continued to slow in the past three months, to record -0.3 per cent against -0.4 per cent for the second quarter.</p>

			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Nigeria's choices FOUR TIMES, President Ibrahim Babangida, Nigeria's military leader, has postponed a handover to civilian rule. Yesterday he continued to vacillate, saying that he had told his army colleagues he was prepared to resign, but giving no indication of actually doing so. Meanwhile his speech failed to provide details of the interim government he promised Nigerians when aborting the presidential poll last June. The sooner the general goes the better, and international and domestic pressure must make him choose one of two options. In theory, the most honourable would be to respect the result of the June election. Unofficial results gave clear victory to Chief Moshood Abiola. Flawed though the process was, it offered one way back to civilian rule. If the general cannot accept that, he has another escape route. His offer of an interim government could win support, if he retired leaving effective power in the hands of a new civilian adminstration. Western governments can play some part in forcing him to choose. They can warn that in addition to existing ban on visas for military officers, an arms embargo will be imposed, arms contracts suspended, and heads of diplomatic missions withdrawn. This is not enough to budge General Babangida from his bunker. First and foremost the solution lies within Nigeria. The trouble is there is a growing danger that the campaign to oust the general will become less a struggle for civilian rule than a battle between the predominantly Moslem north and the mainly Christian south. The divide was starkly illustrated by last week's stayaway called to protest against military rule. It was massively supported in south-west Nigeria, the Yoruba-speaking stronghold of Mr Abiola, but won little backing in the north. Whatever strategy Nigeria's opposition chooses to pursue, it is vital that it transcends this dangerous political fault-line. If this crisis cannot forge a coalition that overcomes ethnic, religious or other rivalries, Nigeria's prospects are bleak.</p>

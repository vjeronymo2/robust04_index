			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Acquisitions help to push Unigate forward Unigate, the food and distribution group, continued its rehabilitation with a 15.9 per cent rise in profits before exceptionals and tax to Pounds 113.5m, and a 7.5 per cent increase in the annual dividend. The shares gained 22p to close at 384p yesterday. Acquisitions, notably of Clifford Foods and Glass Glover, were largely behind the profits rise, with about Pounds 3m of the pre-tax profit coming from a 53rd trading week and another Pounds 1m from sterling's weakness. Turnover was Pounds 1.98bn, against Pounds 1.93bn. Mr Ross Buckland, chief executive, said the year had seen significant progress in reshaping the group. In the three years since he joined, Unigate has made acquisitions totalling Pounds 201m and disposals of Pounds 189m. In the year to March 31, purchases totalled Pounds 121m and sales Pounds 104.2m. Mr Buckland said there were still significant deals to be done, although poor trading would probably prevent the intended flotation of the US restaurant business for another year. Rationalisation following the dairy acquisitions allowed the group to increase milk volumes by a third without extra capacity, lifting operating profits in the division by 40 per cent to Pounds 42.5m. Even so, Mr Buckland said, return on supplying milk to supermarkets was still too low to justify the investment Unigate was making in the business. He predicted a milk price rise following the end of the Milk Marketing Board, scheduled for November 1, but 'not of such an order of magnitude that would cause consumers to switch from buying milk and milk-based products to other products'. Fresh food operating profits rose 34 per cent to Pounds 26.2m and distribution profits were 38 per cent higher at Pounds 22.5m, thanks to a full-year contribution from Glass Glover. Mr John Worby, finance director, said operating profits from continuing operations, up 13.6 per cent to Pounds 97.6m, showed a good performance in difficult trading conditions. Acquisitions contributed another Pounds 9.9m. Associates, mainly the Dutch Nutricia business, made Pounds 14.9m, up from Pounds 14.4m. An exceptional debit of Pounds 11.1m, against a credit of Pounds 3.5m, reflected a loss on disposals partly offset by release of provisions. Interest charges rose Pounds 3.6m to Pounds 13m with year-end debt at Pounds 118.9m, up Pounds 20.7m and giving gearing of 36 per cent. Earnings per share were 31.4p (31.3p) but adjusting for the exceptionals they were up 18.8 per cent to 35.4p. A final dividend of 11.3p gives a total of 17.3p (16.1p). Lex, Page 22</p>

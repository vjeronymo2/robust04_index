			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Spring Ram Cynics who believe shareholder activism involves much sound and fury but little purposeful action should take a look at Spring Ram Corporation. Those shareholders, led by the Prudential, which butted out the tottering buildings material company's previous management must certainly be gratified by its return to respectability. The new management has done a good job in rationalising 3m sq ft of manufacturing space and imposing stricter financial controls. Yesterday's Pounds 42m rights issue will further aid the revival, plugging the holes created by its Pounds 37m annual loss and providing the flexibility for expansion. The promise of bolt-on acquisitions certainly strikes a confident tone so early in the recovery programme. The market's reaction in pushing the shares up 13 per cent highlights the hunger for recovery stocks, particularly in the favoured building materials sector. But it takes an enormous amount on trust. Cautious shareholders would have preferred to read the fine print of the annual accounts before investing fresh funds. Putting the spring back into the company could also prove a trickier task than the market seems to expect. Kitchen sales are doing well but there remain big dents in the baths business. Some nasty surprises could also emerge at Regency Doors, still suffering from its 'appalling inheritance'. At least Spring Ram now has a stronger balance sheet against which to write off the business should the worst occur.</p>

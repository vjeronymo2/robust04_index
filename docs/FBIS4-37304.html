			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Housing Affairs Minister Walid Junblatt by </F> unidentified correspondent on 19 June; place not given --  recorded]    [Excerpt] [Junblatt] I have already explained that the Army  has been present in the mountains. In agreement and  coordination with Army Commander General Emile Lahhud, the Army  has been reinforced. However, the Lebanese media have described  the matter as if the Army has entered a forbidden area. This is  wrong. The Army and the internal security forces have been  there. The refugees began to return last year. They will  continue to return where they can with the help of the ministry  and the Army.    [Correspondent] Do you consider what happened yesterday and  today a reinforcement of the Army's presence?    [Junblatt] This is a new security plan. I have personally  asked for some action to give assurances [to the returnees].  There are steps that have been taken by the Army for reasons  only known to it. We do not deal in the Army's military  affairs. However, the Army has been there. What is the reason  for all this drum beating and trumpeting as if the Army has  entered the Israeli- occupied south?

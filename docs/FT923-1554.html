			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / International Company News: Swedish bank's future on the line: Sara Webb examines the options which Gota Bank is considering MR PER Lundberg has had a baptism of fire. Since taking over as managing director of Gota Bank, Sweden's fourth-largest commercial bank, at the beginning of September, he has had to turn to the government and the central bank for help in sorting out the bank's financial woes. Now a question mark hangs over the form in which Gota Bank will continue to operate - whether it will survive under its own name or be forced to merge with another banking group. Last week, Gota Bank announced that credit losses for 1992 would reach SKr8bn (Dollars 1.4bn) - or double its previous estimate. Non-performing loans (defined as those where no interest has been paid for 60 days or where the interest payment is less than originally agreed with the bank) have escalated to SKr20bn, compared with about SKr10bn at the start of the year, out of a total loan portfolio of SKr70bn. As a result, the bank expects to see an operating loss of between SKr3bn and SKr4bn this year. Sweden's centre-right government has promised to guarantee Gota Bank's commitments to private individuals, companies and all other creditors and counterparties. The Riksbank, Sweden's central bank, also promised to continue normal dealings with the bank, ensuring that Gota Bank has access to the liquidity required. However, the bank's management and owner must prepare to discuss Gota Bank's future with officials from the finance ministry. So far, two possible options have emerged: To place the bad debts in the separate company, leaving the relatively healthy parts of Gota Bank to continue as a normal bank. Mr Lundberg says that Gota Bank has already started to place its non-performing loans - of which about 85 per cent are related to the troubled real estate sector - in a separate division. The bank hopes that the government will step in to reduce the financial burden, possibly with the division containing the non-performing loans being spun off and receiving an injection of funds from the government. The plan is broadly similar to the rescue seen at Nordbanken, another Swedish bank which is in the process of transferring its bad debts to a new company called Securum that will be capitalised with state funds. However, some of the other Swedish commercial banks have complained that it is unfair for the government to take bad debts off Gota Bank's hands when nearly every bank has been hit by heavy credit losses and exposure to the property sector. To find a new owner or shareholder for Gota Bank. Gota Bank is 100 per cent owned by a holding company called Gota, which in turn is owned by Trygg Hansa SPP Holding, an insurance group. Trygg Hansa SPP originally thought its stake in Gota would help to boost its own position in the financial services sector as the insurance group hoped to sell its products through Gota Bank's large branch network. However, as Gota Bank's financial difficulties grew more acute, Trygg Hansa SPP was forced to provide financial support and acquire the whole of the Gota group. If Trygg Hansa SPP is to benefit from selling its insurance-linked products through the bank's network, it will probably have to remain as a shareholder in Gota, although it could reduce its stake if another bank or insurance group were to come in as a shareholder in the Gota group. One solution being considered is for a foreign bank to take a stake in the Gota group as a way of gaining a presence in the Swedish market. However, foreign bankers are likely to be wary: those foreign banks which won government approval to set up subsidiaries in Sweden have found the banking climate tough, and some pulled out because of the losses incurred. In the absence of a foreign suitor, it is possible that Gota will be merged with another Swedish bank - with the state-owned Nordbanken topping the list of likely candidates. Gota Bank's bad debts could then be combined with those of Nordbanken (in the separate company Securum) and Trygg Hansa SPP could then take a stake in the combined banking group, with the state as the other main shareholder. The government has already said it is keen to privatise Nordbanken as soon as the bank returns to profitability - and some bankers point out bringing Trygg Hansa SPP in as a shareholder in a newly-merged Gota/Nordbanken group could provide the first step towards achieving that goal.</p>

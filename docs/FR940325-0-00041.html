			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (4) If a manufacturer has any engine family in a given  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> averaging set which is using NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and/or particulate NCPs, none of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that manufacturer's engine families in that averaging set may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generate credits for banking and trading.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) In the event of a negative credit balance in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trading situation, both the buyer and the seller would be liable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Certification fuel used for credit generation must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be of a type that is both available in use and expected to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used by the engine purchaser. Therefore, upon request by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator, the engine manufacturer must provide information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptable to the Administrator that the designated fuel is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> readily available commercially and would be used in customer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Section 86.092&hyph;23 is added to subpart A to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;86.092&hyph;23  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Required data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The manufacturer shall perform the tests required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the applicable test procedures, and submit to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator the following information:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Provided, however,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> That  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if requested by the manufacturer, the Administrator may waive any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement of this section for testing of vehicle (or engine)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for which emission data are available or will be made available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the provisions of &sect;86.091&hyph;29.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)(1)(i) Exhaust emission durability data on such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> light-duty vehicles tested in accordance with applicable test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures and in such numbers as specified, which will show the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance of the systems installed on or incorporated in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle for extended mileage, as well as a record of all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pertinent maintenance performed on the test vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Exhaust emission deterioration factors for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> light-duty trucks and heavy-duty engines, and all test data that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are derived from the testing described under &sect;86.091&hyph; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 21(b)(4)(iii)(A), as well as a record of all pertinent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance. Such testing shall be designed and conducted in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with good engineering practice to assure that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines covered by a certificate issued under &sect;86.091&hyph;30 will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet the emission standards (or family emission limits, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate) in &sect;86.091&hyph;9, &sect;86.091&hyph;10, or &sect;86.091&hyph;11 as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate, in actual use for the useful life of the engine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) For light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaporative emission deterioration factors for each evaporative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission family-evaporative emission control system combination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and all test data that are derived from testing described under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;86.091&hyph;21(b)(4)(i) designed and conducted in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> good engineering practice to assure that the vehicles covered by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a certificate issued under &sect;86.091&hyph;30 will meet the evaporative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission standards in &sect;86.091&hyph;8 or &sect;86.091&hyph;9, as appropriate,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the useful life of the vehicle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) For heavy-duty vehicles equipped with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline-fueled or methanol-fueled engines, evaporative emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deterioration factors for each evaporative emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> family-evaporative emission control system combination identified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in accordance with &sect;86.091&hyph;21(b)(4)(ii). Furthermore, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement that the test procedure(s) used to derive the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deterioration factors includes, but need not be limited to, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration of the ambient effects of ozone and temperature  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fluctuations, and the service accumulation effects of vibration,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time, and vapor saturation and purge cycling. The deterioration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factor test procedure shall be designed and conducted in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with good engineering practice to assure that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles covered by a certificate issued under &sect;86.091&hyph;30 will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet the evaporative emission standards in &sect;86.091&hyph;10 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;86.091&hyph;11 in actual use for the useful life of the engine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, a statement that a description of the test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure, as well as all data, analyses and evaluations, is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available to the Administrator upon request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) (i) For heavy-duty vehicles with a Gross Vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Weight Rating of up to 26,000 lbs and equipped with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline-fueled or methanol-fueled engines, a written statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the Administrator certifying that the manufacturer's vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet the standards of &sect;86.091&hyph;10 or &sect;86.091&hyph;11 (as applicable)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as determined by the provisions of &sect;86.091&hyph;28.

			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / SEC chief 'troubled' by loss on derivatives Mr Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said yesterday that he was 'troubled' by a growing number of reports of derivatives-related losses at US mutual funds. In letters to the chief executives of large mutual funds and to the Investment Company Institute, Mr Levitt said SEC inspection staff had found reasons 'to raise questions' about the derivatives activities of some mutual funds. 'It is apparent that at some funds derivatives risks may not have been well managed, and that resulting losses may have been unexpected by fund management and fund shareholders,' said Mr Levitt in a letter to Mr Matthew Fink, the ICI president. The SEC chairman's expression of concern comes in the wake of reports of large declines in the value of some mutual funds because of their use of derivatives instruments. Mr Levitt is particularly worried about the derivatives activities of money market and government bond funds because the conservative-minded investors who choose those funds might not be fully informed of their exposure to the instruments. In his letter to the ICI, Mr Levitt said he wanted to know what mutual fund managers had done to address the risks involved in their use of derivatives. He also asked several questions about the industry's derivatives activities, including whether funds were setting and following limits on the use of derivatives and whether all managers were sufficiently expert in derivatives to use the instruments properly.</p>

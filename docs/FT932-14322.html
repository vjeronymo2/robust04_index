			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Danes suffer attack of nerves: The Maastricht referendum countdown IT'S GOING to be a Yes this time - so said the Copenhagen taxi driver. But his assertion came with more conviction than is mustered by the country's political leaders and businessmen, who got it badly wrong last year when voters ignored their advice and refused to approve the Maastricht treaty on European union in a June referendum. A new referendum will take place on May 18, and although the opinion polls so far have shown a comfortable majority in favour of union, there are still many voters who are undecided. A Gallup poll published over the weekend showed 47 per cent in favour, 30 per cent against and 23 per cent undecided or not intending to vote. A poll a week earlier showed 45 per cent for and 29 per cent against. With four weeks to go to the referendum a Yes vote seems a near certainty. But politicians and businessmen are careful not to anticipate a result. Stung after last year's lacklustre campaign for the treaty, the government is leaving less to chance and is mounting an energetic campaign in the final stretch. The vote will be on the Maastricht treaty as modified for Denmark at the Edinburgh summit. This permits the country to opt out of some of the key programmes, defence, the third phase of economic and monetary union, supranational legal co-operation and 'union citizenship'. The anti-Maastricht forces, dominated by the predominantly left-wing June Movement, argue that the electorate will be voting on exactly the same issues as last year and that the Edinburgh agreement makes no difference as the treaty's text has not changed. 'Maastricht is not the solution, it's the problem,' says Mr Jens Peter Bonde, Euro MP and one of the June Movement's leading figures. But seven of the eight parties in the Folketing which endorsed the Edinburgh agreement believe the May vote is 'on a new basis' and is 'for something different'. Their arguments seem to be winning. Gallup asked voters who have switched from a No to a Yes vote why they had changed their minds. Some 30 per cent said it was because of the Edinburgh deal, 23 per cent because they were better informed, and 15 per cent because they thought a Yes vote would be good for the economy. The opinion polls should give considerable comfort to supporters of Maastricht for two other reasons. First, the polls are regularly showing substantial support for Maastricht; last spring they showed the race was neck and neck. However, some polls have indicated an increase in undecided voters at the expense of the Yes vote. Second, the polls show a majority for the treaty among supporters of the country's largest political party, the Social Democrats. In last year's referendum, when the Social Democratic party was in opposition, its supporters voted by 60-40 against the treaty. This spring, perhaps because the Social Democrats returned to government at the head of a four-party coalition in January, polls indicate majority backing for the treaty among the party's supporters; in a poll at the end of March, 47 per cent backed the treaty and 30 per cent opposed it. A notable difference of this year's campaign is that Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen is being more emphatic in warning voters of the dangers of a No vote. Last week he said a second No would be tantamount to telling Europe that Denmark did not want to remain a member of the Community. In the long run a No vote would mean Denmark withdrawing from the EC. However, as Mr Anders Knutsen, chief executive of the television and audio equipment maker Bang &amp; Olufsen and a prominent supporter of the Yes vote, noted, the campaign to date has been muted. This is partly because the voters appear tired of a subject which has dominated the headlines for more than a year. But this does not mean the Social Democrats have remained passive, according to Mr Ove Fich, who is organising the party's Maastricht election campaign. The emphasis is on small, local meetings - dozens of them every week - which appear to be more effective than the roar of expensive advertising. The pro-Maastricht Europe 2000 organisation, a non-party group supported by many prominent Danes, has adopted the same strategy. It is, of course, not too late for the voters to surprise the establishment again. But it seem unlikely - so much so that British bookmakers will no longer accept bets on a favourable outcome.</p>

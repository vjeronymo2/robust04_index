			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Smithfield tenants defeated at polls Tenants of the Smithfield meat market were defeated yesterday in elections for the Corporation of London's general council. In nine wards which held competitive elections, they were out-voted, while a further election was ordered for next year on procedural grounds in the Bassishaw ward, where Smithfield tenants had appeared certain to win at least two seats. At the 'ward mote' last Friday, where candidates announce their intention to stand for election, the Smithfield candidates for the Bassishaw ward were deemed to have made multiple applications for different wards. The corporation said that their withdrawals from other wards had not been properly conducted. The Smithfield tenants had run as part of a campaign against what they say are unfairly high rents being charged by the corporation to pay for the Pounds 60m refurbishment of the market required by new European Union regulations. The Smithfield losses lessen the chances of change to the franchise. This is restricted to the City's few residents, partnerships and sole traders and is hence vulnerable to abuse from single-issue campaigns, particularly in those wards that have less than 100 voters.</p>

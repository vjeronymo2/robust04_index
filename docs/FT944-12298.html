			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Business and the Environment: Planting business skills in Ethiopia The Borena tribe, nomadic pastoralists in southern Ethiopia, measure wealth by the number of animals they own. This can pose problems in the harsh environment of the Borena region, just north of the border with Kenya. Although drought regularly depletes sources of food and water for cattle, camels and sheep, there is resistance to sacrificing some animals to improve the others' chances. Tradition exposes further clashes between economics and environment. The Borena sell animals when prices are high - but wait to buy grain until they need it months later. By then they have less cash and grain prices have risen - often because of drought. Hence an experiment to bring business skills to the Borena. The community is learning to run grain co-operatives, to operate credit schemes and to plan ahead, in a project launched by Care International, the aid agency. Care's immediate aim is to act before a famine strikes. Grain which might in a crisis have been donated free is being sold at a below-market price to the Borena. They can then sell through co-operatives at an agreed profit. About 300 tonnes of grain have been donated by the World Food Programme for the project. By selling the grain to the Borena, Care ensures an affordable local market price for grain, diversifies business skills in the community and even makes some money after costs. This allow it to fund other local projects, such as credit schemes for small businesses and teaching the community to construct sealed storage pits for grain, which allow purchases when prices are low. Ethiopia's problems are largely linked to land use and a fast-growing population. Deforestation for farming, fuel, fencing, tools and housing have left the land vulnerable to soil erosion and desertification. Ethiopia seems synonymous with drought. Yet four decades ago about 60 per cent of the country was forested, compared with less than 3 per cent today. Intensive subsistence agriculture has so depleted soil that Ethiopia can no longer feed its 55m people - even when harvests are good. While the weather is an important determinant of food production, aid and environmental experts alike believe some answers lie in small-scale, self-help projects: such as reforestation, agricultural terracing to contain erosion, irrigation to control flooding and soil and water conservation. 'Famine is not about drought, it is about vulnerability to drought. There is drought in Europe but no famine,' says Fiona Meehan of Rest, the Relief Society of Tigre. Tackling that vulnerability is often an uphill struggle, as evidenced by various reforestation projects. Farmers are not always committed to their success because they fear losing reforested land to the government; saplings are sacrificed for fuel or forage material in times of need; and seedling losses have also been high, having been badly planted or an inappropriate species. The country has 25m goats, whose hides are exported. 'They are worth about Dollars 2m (Pounds 1.25m) a year for gloves, but they eat all the young shoots,' says Girma Woldegiorgis, vice-president of LEM Ethiopia, an environmental group. 'It's not worth it to sacrifice so much for so little.' Ideals of conservation may seem outlandish in a country where thousands have died from hunger this year, but economic diversification is important for the future. The transitional government of Ethiopia - which replaced the Mengistu regime three years ago - has allocated Dollars 37m this fiscal year to the preservation and development of natural resources. It is also considering preservation of 8.5 per cent of the nation's land for forests, parks and wildlife reserves. Ethiopia has more unique species than any other African country and earned Dollars 23m last year from its immature but growing tourism industry.</p>

			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Arts: Abstract virtues - Two London shows celebrate a side of British art which has never been fully appreciated Once invented, abstraction was never going to go away. Rather like the wheel, it was just too useful. It made life so much more simple and straight-forward. Other preoccupations come and go, conceptualism may command our critical attention for a while, post-modernism may shoot across the skies, figuration may be apparently revived; yet always, there will be serious artists making abstract paintings. Speculation about the death of abstraction will always be loose talk. But it is one thing to continue active, quite another to remain important. Is the currency of abstract painting, beyond the mere fact of its survival, worthy of our critical attention? On present evidence the answer is clearly yes. The paradox of abstract painting, is that the apparent simplicity of choice presents the artist with real difficulties. The external references by which the figurative artist persuades us of his merit may be absent - and the abstract painter may not relish them - but the underlying constraints common to all painting remain. Order, structure, colour, form and surface, light and space, are there as ever to tease and confound him, and all the more so by the fact that he has brought them on himself. A single stroke of paint laid upon the bare canvas will conjure up a visual space that extends within and beyond that surface-plane as far as the imagination will take it. Each further mark will qualify and elaborate that space, each colour hold itself in its particular spatial and formal relation to the next and to the painting as a whole. The paint itself must be manipulated and controlled, the painted surface sustained in its entirety: and the eye must be held here and shifted there through the whole complex and subtle course of the work. The show at Flowers East, which fills the galleries on both sides of the road, is of particular interest not just for representing so many of the most important of our abstract painters, but for doing so by recent and substantial examples of their work. It is a generous survey, an effective collaboration between a number of London's principal galleries and burdened by no narrower principal than the quality of the work. Alongside the ebullient and expansive expressionism of Albert Irvin and Patrick Heron, or the heavy calligraphic figures of John Hoyland, or the dense impastos of Gillian Ayres and Alan Gouk, are set the quietist near-minimalism of Edwina Leapman's grey stripes, or Ian Tyson's sparely stated rectangle in blue and white, or Trevor Sutton's exquisitely worked orange square set in a red disc. There are any number of beautiful things - from Noel Forster, Prunella Clough, Sean Scully, Carol Robertson, Alan Green, Clyde Hopkins, Sandra Blow, John McLean, Michael Ginsborg. There are no duds. As for omissions, I think of Barry Cooke, Peter Joseph, John Hubbard - but it is a measure of the show's success that they are few. The new Richard Smith is a treat, for apart from a small show at Feigen in the summer, he has been seldom seen in London in recent years. Overall this is an exhibition of museum standing, which one of our vaunted public institutions might have put on and toured abroad, had it had the nerve or wit. Almost as much may be said of the show, from the collection of Robert Loder, that has come to Atlantis from the Bede Gallery at Jarrow. It has a more historic dimension, going back to the 1960s, and a more personal and miscellaneous character, with one or two artists such as Hoyland, McLean and the late Brian Fielding being well represented. The contemporaneity of the Flowers show gives it a more immediate relevance, but that at Atlantis is none the less worth seeing. Together they celebrate a quality in British art that we have never fully appreciated, let alone celebrated properly ourselves. Were we really so much in awe of American and Continental abstraction all those years ago that we could not see what was under our noses? Technical probity, imaginative authority and a manifest lack of histrionics and self-indulgence: such virtues shine out in a naughty world, yet here they are commonplace. British Abstract Painting: Flowers East, 199 &amp; 282 Richmond Road, Hackney E8, until September 11. Lead and Follow - the Continuity of Abstraction: Atlantis Galleries, 146 Brick Lane, Whitechapel E1, until September 11.</p>

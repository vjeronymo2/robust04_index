			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> 100 RAMPAGING FANS SEIZED BEFORE ENGLISH SOCCER TEAM TIES SWEDEN  </P> <P> Police arrested approximately 100 British soccer fans who rampaged through  downtown Stockholm today before England tied Sweden 0-0 in a World Cup  qualifier.  </P> <P> The hooligans, many drunk, ran through Stockholm's shopping district shouting,  slapping passers-by and ripping clothing off sales racks outside stores. Police  with riot shields gave chase and scuffled with them.  </P> <P> England fans caused riots in Belgium in 1985 and West Germany last year.  Following the 1985 European Cup final, when Liverpool fans rioting resulted in  the deaths of 39 fans of the Italian club Juventus of Turin, England's teams  were banned from playing in European club competitions. The ban did not affect  the national team and it's due to expire in September 1990.  </P> <P> England moved closer to qualifying for the World Cup with the tie. England,  which lead Europe Group Two, is 3-0-2 for eight points with one game left.  Sweden is 2-0-2 for six points followed by Poland, 1-2, and Albania, 0-4.  </P> <P> England has not scored against Sweden in four matches since 1979.  </P></p>

			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: After the deluge, the shocks - Inadequate insurance could cause companies to scale down damage claims AUTUMN HAS once again proved to be the season not of mists but of storms, floods and insurance claims. But a number of the people now mopping up and inspecting the damage ruefully after this week's deluge could get an unpleasant surprise when it comes to having their claim assessed. If the company decides you have been under-insured - that is, you have not been paying enough to cover all your possessions - it can scale back the amount it pays, or pay out only on an indemnity basis rather than new-for-old. Most companies now offer a choice between 'sum insured' and bedroom-rated policies. A sum insured policy means you have to calculate how much your possessions are worth altogether, and insure for that amount. But many people use only a rough estimate, which can be very inaccurate. Unfortunately, working out if you are insured for the right amount is a time-consuming business. You must go through each room, making a list of every item and how much it is worth (whether at replacement or new-for-old levels). With some items, such as jewellery and antiques, it could pay you to obtain a professional valuation, but that sort of service rarely is free. Expect to pay 1 or 2 per cent of the value of the items, and there is usually a minimum of Pounds 20 or Pounds 30. With a bedroom-rated policy, the company fixes a standard maximum sum insured for your type of home and number of bedrooms, based on its experience of typical home contents. An average three-bed semi-detached house would usually have a maximum of about Pounds 30,000. Both types of policy will have a limit for single valuable items such as jewellery or antiques. Bedroom-rated policies have been popular recently. They save people the bother of valuing everything they own, and the standard figure should mean most people are not under-insured. But it is still worth making a rough assessment of your own; you could be surprised by the figure you reach. Insurance is intended to cover the cost of replacing everything in your home if it should be destroyed - from carpets and furniture to bed linen and crockery and not just the obviously valuable stereos and silver which are most likely to be stolen. If you calculate that replacing what you have would cost more than the fixed limit, you should think about getting a sum-insured policy instead or, if you have valuable antiques or artworks, a specialist high-value policy. A bedroom-rated policy could be money wasted if you have few possessions, because you pay the same premiums as someone owning far more. Some insurers now offer minimalist policies with a low sum insured. These cater particularly for people in small, inner-city flats, which can be difficult to insure, or for elderly people in sheltered housing. Insuring too high or too low also can be a problem with buildings cover. Your sum insured for buildings is based on the cost of re-building the property, not its market value. This means that old or unusual buildings may have to be insured for more than those of a standard type, even if their market values are the same. You might not re-build such a property identically, but repairs to old or listed buildings can be more expensive than normal. The Association of British Insurers produces an annual guide to re-building costs for property in England and Wales. While this gives a reasonable estimate for the most common types of house, it does not cover stone, wooden, thatched or prefabricated houses; houses with more than two stories; or flats. You would need to get a surveyor to estimate the re-building costs for such properties. If you think the buildings sum insured for your house is too high or too low, contact your insurer, who should be able to adjust it.</p>

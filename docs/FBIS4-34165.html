			<p>BFN     [Text] Army Commander General Lino Cesar Oviedo warned  yesterday that "the military are the pillar and support for this  incipient democracy." He said he will fight "for social justice  in Congress so that veterans no longer receive a miserable  salary from miserable people."    Oviedo yesterday made a speech at the Cerro Cora of Campo  Grande Club during an homage paid to Chaco war veterans on the  day Paraguayans commemorate the "Chaco Peace." Some 2,000 people  attended the meeting, including a great number of politicians  working for different Colorado Party factions.    The political tone of his speech was noticeable. Oviedo said  in Guarani: "Everyone can speak, but no one can go around doing  just anything he wants to. We will respect and see to it that  others respect our Constitution. We will make laws that are in  accordance with the Constitution."    To stress his position he said: "The military will continue  to exist, despite those who do not like it, as the green uniform  was born with the Paraguayan fatherland. We will not allow our  flag to be used for personal purposes or for the subjugation of  the people for the benefit of the few." Oviedo said: "The  military are the pillar and support for this incipient  democracy."    The military chief came out in defense of veterans,  stressing  that "we will struggle with you for justice in Congress, so that  you no longer receive a miserable salary from miserable people."  This was a direct reference to opposition legislators. He added:  "If we are really human, we must be grateful." He promised to  struggle in Congress "to achieve justice for our just and  honorable veterans within the shortest possible period of time."    "If this Congress really represents the people, here  (referring to Chaco war veterans) are the people's most  deserving and meritorious members." Oviedo also mentioned Juan  Carlos Wasmosy, because he, too, is the son of a veteran.    Oviedo characterized the opposition as "a bunch of cowards,"  adding that they are the ones who probably do not like the  military.    Oviedo regretted the fact that "we are traveling among  people  who sow discord," and questioned the attitude of those who  criticize his work and speak of a civilian and a military  society. "Yes, we are traveling among people who sow discord,  hate, animosity, and slander. We are doing little for our  country in this way," Oviedo said. The military chief once again  reiterated the need for social justice and unity "to overcome  ignorance, health problems, and poverty."</p>

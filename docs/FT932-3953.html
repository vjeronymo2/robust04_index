			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Difficult recipe for a bigger cake: The first round of EC enlargement talks was successful, but the hard bargaining is just beginning In Luxembourg this week, the first round of the negotiations to bring Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway into the European Community was virtually wrapped up at a series of meetings between foreign ministers of the 12 and their Nordic and Alpine counterparts. As a result, the Copenhagen summit of EC heads of government in 10 days will have a modest success to acclaim. But what has been achieved since enlargement talks started in February amounts to little more than moving the first pawns in a multi-dimensional chess game. The tricky moves, as the largely ceremonial Luxembourg talks made clear, start now. Differing expectations among the 12 about how enlargement will change the Community are complicating the negotiations. The talks are already stuck in a morass of intimidating detail, as the two sides work through lists of demands from the applicants. No one doubts that the shape of European integration will be transformed if the candidates - all members of the loose European Free Trade Association (Efta) - enter the Community as planned in 1995. That has been the experience with previous EC enlargements, although this one is bigger. With Danish voters last month changing their minds about ratifying the Maastricht treaty, there is renewed optimism among former Efta members of the Community, including the UK and Denmark itself. They hope that accession by the four will tilt the balance of power decisively away from the federalist core of the EC - the founding six, France, Germany, the Benelux countries and Italy - reinforced by Spain. Relief among the federalists at Maastricht's survival is tempered by fears among some that 'widening' of the EC may come at the expense of 'deepening', that is, a more integrated European union. Among southern member states, this suspicion is heightened by fear that expansion could shift the Community's centre of political gravity northwards. Previous enlargements have led to marked deepening as well as widening. But following the popular backlash across Europe against Maastricht, it is less certain how the proposed new expansion would affect the distribution of power in the EC. Nonetheless, the probability remains that, as in the past, the enlargement will gradually reinforce the power of the Community. When the UK, Denmark and Ireland joined the EC in 1973, federalists blamed the enlargement for what was viewed as the Community's near paralysis in the late 1970s and early 1980s. There is, however, a distinction between paralysis and, as the Emperor Augustus put it, hastening slowly. The Community moved slowly indeed, but clearly towards greater integration. As a result of that 1973 enlargement, the EC agreed a loose foreign policy co-ordination mechanism (European Political Co-operation, or EPC) - a trade-off for France's dropping its veto on UK entry - and its own budgetary resources. These appeared modest initiatives, and indeed the revenue decision led to a long war of attrition over EC budget contributions, dominated by the UK. Yet these budget rows have led to the two Delors finance packages of 1988 and 1992, which in each case included a doubling of regional spending, arguably the EC's most federalist policy. The need to spend on developing the poorer south, in particular, arose from the second enlargement, which brought in Greece in 1981, and Spain and Portugal in 1986. But that expansion also reinforced the case for majority voting and a weakening of national vetoes in EC decision-making, decisive in getting the EC's single market into law. All these seemingly modest increments combined to add greatly to the political density and identity of the EC. Indeed, the common foreign and security policy and extension of majority voting foreseen by Maastricht developed organically from the earlier moves. The EC, in its willy-nilly way, has a habit of creating problems only to look for solutions through greater integration. In the present case, despite federalists' fears, it is already clear that the Scandinavians and Austria favour even more majority voting in a host of areas, which would further dilute the ability of member states, such as the UK, to block or veto measures they dislike. The applicants want more activism on social policy and the environment and a voting mechanism to deliver it. If the social chapter of Maastricht, from which Britain triumphantly wrested exemption, were not in the treaty, politicians across the spectrum in all the applicant countries say they would be less interested in joining. 'We wouldn't dream of not accepting this (the social chapter),' says Ms Kaci Kullmann Five, leader of Norway's conservative party. 'You will find Norway in a group wanting more effectiveness on these kinds of concerns,' says Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, Norway's Labour prime minister. Enthusiasm for more majority voting extends into other sensitive areas, such as industrial policy, which the Community now barely touches, and even into Maastricht's common foreign and security policy (CFSP), where unanimity is now the invariable rule. Norway is a Nato member but its three fellow applicants are neutral states. Nevertheless, sitting on the borders of eastern Europe, with the relative certainties of the cold war now gone, all four have high hopes for the embryonic CFSP. 'Our position would be for majority voting' in foreign policy 'if you want to become an organisation that can act', says Ms Helga Hernes, Norway's minister for Europe. Mr Bjorn Tore Godal, trade minister and chief Norwegian negotiator, specifies that 'majority voting should inform policy on issues like Yugoslavia', on which the EC's record is not widely admired among the applicants. Austrian and Finnish officials say they have no problem with majority voting within the CFSP. Sweden is more cautious, according to Mr Lars Anell, its ambassador to the EC, but would favour 'stepping aside to let others go ahead' where it was outvoted. In contrast with the UK and Denmark, all four are keen (and plausible) applicants for economic and monetary union later in the century. They feel that the mangling of the Finnish mark and Swedish krona in the backwash of last autumn's crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism makes an even stronger case for fixed exchange rates. The entry of the four should also greatly strengthen the free trade wing of the EC, curbing the protectionist tendencies often associated with France. The Scandinavians would, in addition, help open up more EC decision-making to public scrutiny, eroding the secretive habits derived from British, German and French practice. The four, in sum, would not fit into any existing voting alliance on EC policy. But, by the same token, they are not likely to provide decisive reinforcements against federalism - as Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, suggested they would, in a recent interview with the FT. 'If that's the way they (the British government) think it is, they're in for a big shock,' said a senior EC official closely involved in the negotiations. 'We will fight for a more federalist Europe, naturally,' Mr Hans Brunmayr, deputy chief of the Austrian mission in Brussels which is leading Vienna's negotiations, observes more prosaically. But they are not in the Community yet. All four say they are ready to comply with the 12's injunction that they must accept not only existing EC law, but all of Maastricht too, without Danish or British-style opt-outs. Yet they warn that unless the EC accommodates a range of national interests and cultural differences, entry is impossible. The most problematic policy areas are: Agriculture. Some 60 officials in Brussels are already ploughing through 500 pages of Austrian position papers seeking privileged treatment for its Alpine farmers. That should be easy in comparison to the treatment the three Nordic applicants insist on for their Arctic farmers. Farm subsidies per capita in the four are up to twice the already high EC average. If the EC farm regime is complex and wasteful now, even after last year's reform, extending it from the Mediterranean to the Arctic sea is the stuff of nightmares. The Scandinavians say high subsidies to farmers are needed to keep people in their thinly populated northern territories, along with lavish regional grants. 'It is compulsory for us to get a solution,' says Mr Heikki Haavisto, the farmers' leader and Euro-sceptic who Finland last month appointed as foreign minister to stand as guarantor in what it regards as the decisive issue of the negotiations. For Norway, retaining control of its rich fisheries resources is also decisive. 'The question of fish will determine the referendum,' says Mr Jan Henry Olsen, the fisheries minister and another of the previously anti-EC figures which the applicants have thrust into the front line of negotiations. 'We have no fish to give away,' he adds bluntly. Environment. All the applicants fear the EC will erode their generally higher environmental standards, by insisting that these constitute barriers to free trade in the EC's single market. Sweden, for instance, is unlikely to win agreement on all its higher standards on vehicle emissions and safety. A senior Brussels official rates the 'green' issue as much worse than adjusting to Spain and Portugal's economic problems, the crux of the last enlargement negotiations. 'It will be a major challenge to show that they're improving their lot,' he says. 'If we don't, public opinion will see it as vandalising their quality of life.' Energy. Norway reserves half of all exploration rights to its rich oil and gas reserves for its state oil company, Statoil. Draft EC legislation, due to be discussed by the 12 this month, would outlaw such preferences as discriminatory. Oslo wants any decision shelved until Norway enters the EC, and says this measure alone could decide whether that happens. But Germany looks as though it will champion a postponement. Money. This issue will rear its ugly head at the final stage of negotiations. Overall, the four are richer per capita than the 12, and will be substantial net contributors to the EC budget. Spain, as ever, will want more, but the real problem will arise if the Scandinavians seek to offset too much farm spending against their budget contributions, or to phase these in. If all these hurdles are cleared, the Efta four will then step into the political minefields of defence and the reform of EC decision-making. The shape of common European defence arrangements, which Maastricht alludes to, is still a matter of fierce debate in the Community. Yet federalist countries such as Belgium, which will assume the EC presidency in July, want commitments from the four now to an eventual common defence policy. 'Before giving answers, we should know the real questions,' says Mr Pertti Salolainen, trade minister and chief negotiator for Finland, which along with Austria has said it wants to be part of a future European security system. The main concern among the neutrals, as summed up by Mr Jaakko Iloniemi, head of the pro-EC Centre for Finnish Business and Policy Studies, is the vagueness of EC defence plans. 'Are we going to give up a tried policy (of neutrality) for a series of half-baked guarantees?' he asks. Institutional reform, to adapt the EC's creaking decision-making machinery to a possible doubling of Community membership once eastern Europe is embraced early next century, has officially been shelved until the 1996 constitutional review fixed by Maastricht. The EC's formal line is that no more than technical adjustments are needed to fit in the Efta four. Yet already the intra-EC factions are staking out their positions for 1996, and this is unnerving the applicants. The four seem likely to become entangled in the emerging struggle over whether to lower the threshold required for decision-taking under the EC's weighted majority voting, as part of this enlargement. Federalist countries want a lower threshold, making it harder for countries such as the UK to block decisions. The applicants' primary concern is to get enough voting weight in the new arrangement. But they must, above all, be able to demonstrate to their peoples that whatever is agreed will work in the interests of small to medium-sized member states. Fear of being submerged by their bigger partners was one reason Danes voted no to Maastricht a year ago. Already the prospect of enlargement shows signs of leading to a strengthened Franco-German alliance - the main axis of the EC - and possibly even a closer relationship between these two and the UK, completing a 'big three'. The smaller member states are ever vigilant on changes in the EC's delicate balance of power. They see the Commission as a shield for their interests, and last autumn they rallied to defend Brussels when the big countries wanted a big roll-back of its powers, in the name of subsidiarity. The Efta four are acutely sensitive about sovereignty and their vulnerability as small states. Yet they appear prepared to check their national vetoes at the door if they get the right terms to enter the EC. That is why their terms are high, and getting all four in is no foregone conclusion.</p>

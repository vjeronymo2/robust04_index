			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Suharto in plea on farm reform PRESIDENT Suharto, the Indonesian leader and head of the Non-Aligned Movement, yesterday urged the Group of Seven (G7) leading industrialised nations to reach a quick agreement on the liberalisation of farm trade, which would assist developing countries. In a pre-G7 meeting, Mr Suharto told Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, that a settlement of the Uruguay Round of trade talks must be fashioned with the needs of developing countries in mind, as these were particularly vulnerable to shifts in trade policy and protectionism. Mr Suharto, in his role as chairman of the 108-member group, said economic assistance from developed countries should not be linked to human rights issues. He was reflecting the concerns of various developing countries, in particular China, which complains that the US has linked trade and aid policies to progress in human rights issues. Mr Suharto did not get his original wish to address the summit himself.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 9 (XINHUA) -- Experts from the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted here today that  China's National Nuclear Safety Administration (NNSA) has  achieved the standards of usual international practice.    Prior to the conclusion of a fortnight visit to China, an  international regulatory review mission from the IAEA stated  that the NNSA has achieved these standards in the fields of  structure, organization and resources, codes and regulations as  well as in safety review, licensing and commissioning of nuclear  power plants.    In its opinion, the approach taken by the NNSA for its  development "can be used as a good example for other countries  developing a new nuclear power program."    The seven-member group, led by Annick Carnino, head of the  safety standards and co-ordination section, IAEA's division of  nuclear safety, arrived here on April 23 at NNSA's invitation.    During the visit, the group had talks with NNSA officials in  Beijing and visited Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant in Shenzhen.  The visit is IAEA's first review of China's regulatory  practices in a decade, sources here said.    Morris Rosen, assistant director general for nuclear safety  of the IAEA, told XINHUA here today that the invitation for a  visit itself shows that the Chinese Government is open-minded  and willing to have international cooperation in the area of  nuclear safety.    The whole array of China's nuclear safety system is  consistent with international practices, since China has based  its legislation on NUSS [expansion unknown] safety series  documents, Rosen said.    The set of codes and regulations of the nuclear power plants  at Qinshan and Guangdong conform with international standards,  he added.    The group advised its Chinese host to strengthen feedback on  operating experience in nuclear power plants.    At a reception here this evening, Huang Qitao, vice-minister  of the State Science and Technology Commission, expressed his  thanks for the group's hard work and their recommendations and  suggestions.    "These will help us to summarize past experience and make  great contributions to the further enhancement of China's  nuclear safety regulation, ensure safe operation of nuclear  installations in China and the protection of the public and the  environment," he said.    The Chinese Government pays much attention to nuclear  safety,  and "safety first, quality first" is the basic guideline for  developing nuclear energy, said Huang, who is also NNSA director  general.    "We will continue to work with governmental departments and  organizations and continue to do our best to strengthen the  cooperation with international organizations and foreign  regulatory bodies and to improve nuclear safety regulation in  China," he said.</p>

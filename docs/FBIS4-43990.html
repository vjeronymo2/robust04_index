			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Corfu, Greece, June 24 (AFP)--Greek European  Affairs Minister Theodhoros Pangalos snubbed Italian Prime  Minister Silvio Berlusconi on his arrival for the signing of the  Russian partnership agreement on the sidelines of the European  Union summit here Friday [24 June].    Pangalos descended the steps of the Ayios Yeoryios church  here to welcome the leaders of the European Union members,  Russian President Boris Yeltsin and the leaders of the four  applicant members, but stayed steadfastly in place as the  Italian leader arrived.    Berlusconi's inclusion of five neofascist ministers in his  government has caused consternation in many European capitals.  Greece, ruled by the socialists, has expressed particular  concern.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter: "Foreign Privateers Lose Trade </F> Licences"]    [Text] Hundreds of Sino-foreign business licences have  been revoked in a crackdown on joint-venture fraud, according to  local newspapers. Foreign investors have been lying about their  capital investments, falsifying their accounts, over-charging  for out-of-date fixed assets and changing the nature of their  businesses without official permission. Local authorities in  Guangzhou and Shenyang have revoked over 100 licenses, said the  Shanghai-based XINMIN EVENING NEWS. Beijing and Taiyuan,  capital of the northern Shanxi Province, have also cracked down,  according to the GUANGMING DAILY and BEIJING DAILY.    Local systems will be established to improve supervision and  control of joint-venture financing. And the crackdown will help  to protect the legal rights and interest of local Chinese and  foreign investors. Many joint ventures exist in name only,  according to XINMIN EVENING NEWS. Many investors fail to meet  their financial commitments years after being granted business  licences, and some leave China without saying goodbye.    The administrative crackdown officially takes these  companies  off the map, the newspaper added. It is hoped that project  approval and management loopholes will now be closed, the  Shanghai paper said. Licence applications will have to be backed  up by company market research. The lure of the fast buck has  led many ventures into trouble, said GUANGMING DAILY.    The administrative move signals the re-establishment of  governmental macro-economic control over Sino-foreign ventures,  as the country becomes a global investment hot spot, said the  State Administration for Industry and Commerce. There are  174,056 joint ventures and their foreign trade accounted for one  third of the country's total imports and exports last year.</p>

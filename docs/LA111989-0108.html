			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSALS FOR SOLVING COUNTY'S TRAFFIC JAMS  </P> <P> The citizens of the entire state, not just Orange County, need to come to grips  with what faces us in the future. We need to develop well-planned rail systems  that will serve us in the 21st Century. These systems cannot be built with  half-cent tax increases.  </P> <P> We need to raise gasoline taxes to whatever it takes to build these systems of  the future. We have become spoiled on the relatively cheap prices of gas  (adjusted for inflation, it is cheaper today than it was in 1965). This only  encourages us to avoid car-pooling or using rapid-transit systems. Why wait for  OPEC to dictate the price of gas or, worse, until we have exhausted the supply  of fossil fuels?  </P> <P> Raising fuel taxes would force all of us to become fuel-efficient. Car pools  would become very popular, and we would stop thinking in terms of driving  alone. Because there would be less traffic, work would be accomplished more  expeditiously along freeway routes, and with proper funds available, a  centrally designed rail system, interchangeable throughout the state, could be  developed. Ecologically, we cannot continue to spew the waste products of our  automobiles into the environment at our current pace.  </P> <P> There is little doubt that the Orange County traffic problem will become worse.  No one will watch it happen with more glee than I. Because only when we are  faced with a crisis do we respond. When we finally reach a point of complete  gridlock, I have no doubt that emergency legislation will be enacted, or  desperate propositions offered. Then we will build the systems that have been  needed for so many years.  </P> <P> GARY WALSH  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel  </P></p>

Ranariddh told Hosokawa during a 20-minute meeting that  Cambodia is considering a number of major development projects  and would welcome a resumption of the loans from Japan,  officials said.    The two premiers arrived in Tokyo earlier the same day with  a  large government delegation to attend a two-day meeting of the  International Committee on Reconstruction of Cambodia (ICORC),  which begins Thursday.    Diplomatic sources said Japan will not announce a resumption  of loan assistance at the conference, but will pledge some 9  billion yen in grant aid for the coming fiscal year, which  begins in April.    Japan extended Cambodia some 8 billion yen in grant  assistance in fiscal 1993 ending March 31.    The last time Japan, Cambodia's top benefactor, made an  official loan to Cambodia was in fiscal 1968, when it extended  an offer of 1.5 billion yen.    But Cambodia's civil strife and sweeping changes of  government since then precluded the extension of further loans,  while the country's international credit-worthiness depreciated.    Sources said the two countries will have to negotiate  Cambodia's arrears before a resumption of loans can be effected.    Officials said Hosokawa vowed that Japan will continue to  offer Cambodia "as much cooperation as possible" to facilitate  the country's reconstruction.    They said Ranariddh, the son of ailing King Norodom  Sihanouk,  outlined Cambodia's aid expectations of Japan.    In the area of social infrastructure, he said, Cambodia  requires assistance for the building of roads and bridges.    Ranariddh expressed appreciation for Japanese funding for  reconstruction of a key 709-meter-long bridge spanning the Tonle  Sap River which runs through Phnom Penh.    The so-called "Japan Bridge," which was completed last  month,  was first built in 1963 with reparation funds from Japan for  damage inflicted on Cambodia during World War II.    Ranariddh said assistance is also needed to finance various  energy projects, particularly for electricity generation. He  noted that Cambodia has reserves of natural gas that could be  successfully exploited for that purpose.    A Japanese consortium has already started test-drilling an  oil and gas field off southern Cambodia, the first drilling  operation since the civil war halted foreign operations in  Cambodia in 1974.    In addition to social infrastructure aid, Ranariddh said  Cambodia wants Japan's help to improve its agricultural  production.    According to officials, he said Cambodia has great  agricultural potential, noting that land is plentiful in  proportion to the country's small population of some 9 million  people.    The Cambodian leader said his government is making efforts  to  facilitate an influx of foreign investment, such as drafting  investment and banking laws.    Ranariddh expressed expectations for increased numbers of  Japanese tourists visiting Cambodia to see the ancient temple  complex at Angkor Wat.    Officials said he invited Hosokawa to pay an official visit  to Cambodia in the future.    Delegations from 32 countries, the European Union and 12  international organizations will participate in the ICORC  meeting.</p>

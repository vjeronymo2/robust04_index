			<p>BFN     [Text] Damascus, May 15 (XINHUA) -- Syrian President Hafiz  al- Asad today met with visiting U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher who arrived here earlier today on a new tour of the  Middle East.    Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' went to Damascus  airport to greet the U.S. official, whose ongoing tour aims at  securing an essential progress in the Syrian-Israeli peace talks  in Washington.    Israel's proposals on the return of the occupied Golan  Heights is believed to be the main topic in talks between  Christopher and al- Asad.    Israel has offered a phased withdrawal from the Golan  Heights  but did not give details on how much territory it planed to  return to Syria. At the same time, Israel wanted to set up full  diplomatic relations with Syria.    Syria demanded Israel's commitment to a full withdrawal  before outlining its stand on future relations.    On the eve of Christopher's tour to the region, the Arab  world called for Israel's complete withdrawal from the occupied  Golan Heights, stressing that peace will not be achieved unless  it facilitates a comprehensive pullout based on international  legitimacy and in line [with] relevant U.N. Security Council  resolutions.</p>

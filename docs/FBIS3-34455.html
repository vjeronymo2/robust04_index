He considered this act as an attempt to kill the peace  process.    In an exclusive interview with AL-QUDS, al-Rajub said that  the Palestinian leadership regards the Fatah Hawks as part of  the forces that have to protect the national authority.  Consequently, we have to provide security for them.    Regarding the peace process, al-Rajub accused Israeli Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin of responsibility for hampering the peace  process, and said: We realize that Rabin is the key figure in  Israel, but apparently he regrets signing the Oslo accord.  Therefore, he is trying to hinder what was agreed on in Davos.    Al-Rajub said that the PLO is ready to sign the drafts that  were agreed on in Davos. It is also ready to take over power  within 24 hours after the Israeli withdrawal.    'Arafat's occupied territories' affairs adviser said that  the  Palestinian side considers a Palestinian-Israeli summit to be  warranted. He also expressed his apprehension at the  perpetuation of the current situation, which can only lead to  frustration, opposition to the peace process, and an increase in  the phenomena of internal and foreign violence.

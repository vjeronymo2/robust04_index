"Too much impatience won't be good," Fujii  said as he arrived in Honolulu for the finance ministers meeting  of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.    Fujii said open financial markets are important for the  region but policy-makers should take economic realities into  consideration in opening up their markets. "We have to take  into account the matter of soundness. We should proceed in a  balanced manner," Fujii told reporters on arrival in Honolulu.    Fujii said he plans to talk about "the Japanese experience"  during the two-day APEC meeting and underscore the importance of  cooperation in the regional group. The meeting, which opens  with an informal reception Friday evening, is expected to focus  on ways to promote economic growth and foster the flow of  capital in the Asia-Pacific region.    Fujii has a series of separate meetings planned with his  APEC  counterparts Friday afternoon, including a bilateral session  with U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, Japanese officials  said.    Fujii is also scheduled to meet with Chinese Finance  Minister  Liu Zhongli, Australian Finance Minister Ralph Willis and  Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Ibrahim  Anwar.</p>

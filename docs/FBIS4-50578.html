			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["LIAOWANG Forum" by staff commentator: "Strict Control </F> Over the Scale of Investment Is Key to Success in Reform and  Development"]    [Text] At present, China's economy is in a crucial period  in which a new system is replacing the old. The task of taking  various reform measures to maintain sustained, rapid, and  healthy development [chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958  1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455] of the economy is very heavy.  How can the tasks of reform and development be smoothly  fulfilled? Strict control over the scale of investment in fixed  assets is the key.    In the past year, the whole party and all the people of the  country have seriously implemented arrangements made by the  central authorities concerning macroregulation and control,  acted in unison, made concerted efforts, and achieved positive  results in resolving conspicuous contradictions and problems  which have emerged in economic development. Since the beginning  of this year, the macroeconomic environment has remained  pessimistic. The credit and currency situation has not eased.  Transportation capacity, energy supply, and the supply of raw  materials have shown a tendency to become tighter. New  enterprise debts continue to increase. In particular, the rise  in commodity prices is excessive and inflationary pressures  continue to increase. All this shows that if strict control  over the scale of investment in capital construction is not  continuously exercised and if such investment is allowed to  grow, the entire national economy will eventually become  uncoordinated and the fluctuations which will occur will cause  tremendous losses. Moreover, if such a situation occurs, we may  lose the historic opportunity we have at present. Therefore,  the central authorities have paid special attention to  controlling the scale of investment and have decided, beginning  from this year, to establish a restriction and risk mechanism  for investment in fixed assets, to conduct a general inspection  of the scale of investment, and to adopt various measures to  curb growth in investment and to maintain a basic overall  balance in the economy. This is entirely correct and necessary.    To date, leaders of some localities and departments still do  not have a sober understanding of the situation and are still  blindly expanding the scale of capital construction. This is  mainly expressed by: in making arrangements for capital  construction projects, some localities have divorced from  unified planning and have tried to set up a "small but complete"  systems or to duplicate things; some, ignoring actual  possibilities in local financial and material resources, have  hankered after competition with others in doing things on an  excessive scale, resulting in a waste of resources; some have  violated construction procedures, encouraged "making investments  first and using the status quo as pressure to gain approval" and  "acting first and reporting afterward"; and others have broken  up major projects into parts to avoid applying for state  approval and have expanded the scale of construction scale and  standards without authorization after projects have been  approved; and so on. What are the consequences of such  practices? If such projects go beyond the capacity of national  strength to bear and readjustments have to be made, the damage  done will be serious and the opportunity for economic  development will also be forfeited. We have had many lessons in  this respect in the past and we should keep them in mind.    Why is it so difficult to control the scale of investment  despite the fact that the situation is clear, the reason is  clear, and our experiences of an expansion of investment on  several occasions have been bitter? What is the root cause? To  solve this problem, we should have a correct understanding of  how to handle the relationship between macroregulation and  control on the one hand and rapid development on the other, in  addition to overcoming structural drawbacks through deepening  reform.    At present, some people think that since we practice a  market  economy and seek rapid development, we should no longer have  macroregulation and control over investment activities. Such a  way of thinking is not correct. In a modern market economy,  especially when our country is still in the "catching up stage"  of economic development as at present, the extent of market  development is limited, and the gap between the level of  economic development of different localities and of the urban  and rural areas is relatively great, the market itself, because  of its own weaknesses, cannot settle the issues of an overall  balance in the macroeconomy, the rational distribution of  resources, and fair distribution in society. Correct and  effective macroregulation and control carried out by the  government can correct market imbalances and remedy defects of  the market, and only by organically integrating the two will it  be possible to give normal play to the foundation role of the  market in the allocation of resources and to promote the  sustained and healthy development of the national economy.    Another idea holds that in recent years, some localities  have carried out flexible "adaptations" and have "made use of  gray areas" in implementing the central authorities' policy of  macroregulation and control and have rapidly developed the  economy, while those who have honestly and obediently acted  according to the policies of the central authorities have  "suffered losses." Therefore, violations of regulations are  regarded as "successful examples" in speeding up local economic  development for various localities to follow. This is something  totally undesirable. In the course of replacing the old  structure with the new, indeed there are still many loopholes in  the structure for some people to take advantage of because our  policies and laws are not yet sound. However, such practices of  achieving local development at the expense of overall interests  have jeopardized the healthy operation of the entire economy. At  present, investment continues to grow at a high level and the  macro situation is tending to become tense. Has this nothing to  do with the fact that some localities have ignored warnings?  Just imagine, if all localities staked economic development on  studying "countermeasures," what would the situation of economic  development in our country be? That the central authorities  have called for strict control over the scale of investment in  fixed assets and for the comprehensive use of various means to  regulate investment activities is precisely to correct and  restrict unstandardized and even illegal economic activities and  to create a fair environment of competition for honest people  who really act according to the policies of the central  authorities.    Correctly handling the relationship between reform,  development, and stability involves the overall situation in  various kinds of work this year. Strengthening macroregulation  and control over investment in fixed assets and strictly  controlling the scale of capital construction are an extremely  important aspect of subordinating to, and serving, the overall  work situation. Each locality and each department should, in  accordance with overall state planning and a rational layout,  proceed from local reality, seek truth from facts, and do what  they are capable of, and they should never follow the beaten  track of ignoring objective conditions, stubbornly seeking  output value and speed, and blindly expanding the scale of  investment. It is necessary to comprehensively and correctly  understand and implement the guidelines of the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and to really shift  the focus of work to readjusting the structure and increasing  economic results. This is the economic objective we should seek  in reform and development and is also where our hope for the  modernization of our country's economy is placed.</p>

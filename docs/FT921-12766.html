			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Castro crackdown leaves him a castaway at home: The increasing international isolation of Cuba CUBA'S attempts to seek new economic partners, following the demise of the Soviet Union, are being placed in jeopardy by a new purge of opposition leaders in Cuba and the execution on Monday of a Cuban exile. The crackdown has shaken President Fidel Castro's fragile relations with the Latin American and Spanish leaders who count among his last remaining friends abroad, and on whom he is depending for vital foreign investment. Since the execution of Eduardo Diaz Betancourt, the leader of a group of three Cuban-Americans apparently set on sabotage in Cuba, Mr Castro has come under diplomatic attack across the world. The German government expressed 'profound consternation'. The European Community said the execution was a 'great obstacle' to better relations. France, Spain and the Vatican, among others, expressed dismay. The reaction underlines the president's growing dilemma. As Professor Jorge Dominguez of Harvard University says: 'Mr Castro's chances for co-operation with Latin America grow if he does not crack down internally; but his reading of the changes in eastern Europe suggests that he ought to crack down'. Heightened repression is also bound to scare away some of the foreign investment that Mr Castro is hoping will pull Cuba out of its economic troubles. On Wednesday, Germany cancelled a bilateral air transport accord. The extent to which the government is willing to go to deal with dissent was indicated by Mr Raul Castro, defence minister and the president's brother, who said the administration would respond violently to any opposition. He warned opponents that the government would not hesitate to reconvene emergency revolutionary tribunals, scrapped 20 years ago, to determine sentences for violence against the government and the country. The capture of the three Cuban-Americans three weeks ago has provided the Havana government with some justification for its claims that it is under threat and must defend itself, and rationalises a crackdown on opposition elements which appears to have been intensified this week. As the first execution for 'counter-revolutionary activity' in 20 years, it also seemed meant to warn groups which have been making public criticisms of the Castro administration. It has also allowed a temporary diversion, clearly to the government's relief, from the deepening economic problems which have overtaken the country after the end of communism in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe, and stem also from the unbending 30-year US embargo on trade with Cuba. Reports this week of further detentions of opposition figures follow the arrest of some 60 activists since September last year, almost half of whom remain in jail. This comes after a modest political liberalisation in the mid-to-late 1980s and reflects in part an attempt to link the supporters of democracy with alleged US-sponsored attempts to overthrow the regime. More significant: it shows Mr Castro's fear that the discontent (so far mainly silent) caused by the rapid deterioration in the economy will translate into organised opposition. The tough actions have damaged the hopes of some Latin leaders that prospects of Latin American economic integration and foreign investment would encourage Mr Castro to curb political repression. The so-called Group of Three - Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela - invited Mr Castro to Mexico in late October to preach that message. While not offering aid, the three 'agreed to fight for the rapid and total integration of Cuba into the Latin American family', and to promote foreign investment in Cuba. The barely concealed objective was to prod Mr Castro into more reforms, in return for economic help and membership of the emerging Latin American economic bloc. This conciliatory approach contrasts not only with the unbending US position, but also with that of some Latin nations which prefer that help to Cuba be conditional on clear promises for reform. Cuba has rejected such interference in its affairs and has hit back at its Latin American critics. This makes it increasingly difficult for Latin countries to include Cuba in their regional plans.</p>

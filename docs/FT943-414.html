			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Chemical takes hard line on loans: Bank would shed market share rather than relax terms Chemical Banking is prepared to lose its dominance of the US syndicated loans market rather than giving in to the pressure for looser terms, according to Mr Walter Shipley, the bank's chairman and chief executive. Mr Shipley said in an interview with the Financial Times that he had become so worried at the deterioration in loan covenants in the world's biggest syndicated loan market that Chemical might take strong measures. He said this would include refusing to underwrite and lead manage loan syndications where Chemical believed that covenants - the financial ratios to which borrowing companies must adhere - did not provide enough protection. Margins on loans have narrowed sharply this year as banks have competed to lend. Mr Shipley said Chemical was prepared to tolerate lower returns, but that it was not prepared to compromise over covenants. He said that although there had been 'some worrisome migration south' in margins this year, he was primarily concerned at the 'rapid deterioration in terms and conditions' attached to syndicated loans. 'It seems like the banking industry has a very short memory of the recent past, and we are prepared to see our market leadership position go away rather than chase down that path', he said in an interview in London. Mr Shipley said he was primarily concerned to protect Chemical's reputation as a high-quality underwriter. 'It is a question of being firm and disciplined, and if we lose transactions, then that is banking', he said. Although a number of senior bankers have expressed concern at conditions in both the US and European syndicated loan markets, Chemical's strength is such that it could give a decisive lead to other banks. Chemical has established a dominant position in US syndicated loans since the 1991 merger of Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover, and the bank itself describes lending as the 'backbone' of its product range. In the first quarter of 1994, Chemical syndicated Dollars 53.3bn (Pounds 33.8bn) of loans around the world, compared with Dollars 40.7bn of syndications by Citicorp and Dollars 38.6bn by JP Morgan, according to International Financing Review. Mr James Lee, Chemical's senior managing director in charge of syndicated lending, has become a leading figure in the market, with other banks describing Chemical as setting some of the most aggressive terms. Chemical has just set a new European benchmark with an Ecu6bn five-year facility for the kingdom of Spain at 4.5 basis points (hundredths of a percentage point) over the London Interbank offered rate (Libor). The re-entry of smaller Japanese banks to international syndicated loan markets has brought comparisons with conditions in the late 1980s, when loan margins went down sharply as banks competed for business. Banking regulators have started to warn of the dangers of deteriorating loan covenants as banks faced with weak demand for loans have competed for business in order to find a use for growing levels of capital.</p>

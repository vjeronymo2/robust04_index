			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Labour's new social justice A plan for modernising the welfare state, or a plan for modernising the Labour party's vision of the welfare state? The Commission on Social Justice may have thought it could deliver both of these things. But the missions are distinct. The commission's final report has strengths on both counts, but ultimately delivers only on the second. Two years of preparation may have raised expectations unrealistically high, but they have not been in vain. At a minimum, the 400-page document published yesterday is a valuable compendium of suggestions for improving the functioning of the country's out-dated system of tax and benefits. There is little in the report that is fundamentally surprising. It is well-known that social and economic change over the past 50 years has far outpaced reform of the structure of the country's welfare state, with lamentable consequences. Employment, for example, is now less likely to be full time or long term, and more likely to be female than it was in 1945. Yet the current benefit system does not take this sufficiently into account. The commission's report contains a variety of sensible proposals - both short term and long term - for reforms which would improve things. Some could be adopted by the current government without much difficulty, and are even similar in outline to government pilot projects now under way. Many of the detailed training proposals in the report, for example, fall under this head. Starting points Unsurprisingly, many more of the commission's solutions require a political and financial commitment which the current government, at least, would not be likely to contemplate. Yet in suggesting ways of regularising the treatment of the self-employed or the creation of a new part-time unemployment benefit, the report is helpful. It provides sensible starting points towards answering questions which any administration must pose, in light of recent labour market trends. The question which the report resolutely refuses to answer is how much it will all cost. Viewed as a Labour manifesto-in-waiting, it is perhaps inevitable that the report shies away from explicit expenditure commitments which could be used as ammunition in the lead-up to the next election. Welfare state Yet the commission has long claimed a somewhat higher, less partisan, mission: a fundamental re-formulation of both the purpose and structure of the welfare state. Judged in that light, the failure to cost any of its proposals is a serious failing. Vision is one thing, but informing a truly cross-party debate on future reforms must involve putting a price tag on the wish-list. In the past, public debate on the subject has tended to travel along two separate paths: the desire for a better welfare system, on the one hand, and the difficulties of paying for them, on the other. The commission might have distinguished itself by bridging that divide. By and large, it chose not to. The Labour party has been the beneficiary of this caution. By implicitly accepting a narrower, more partisan, role for itself, the commission has provided Mr Tony Blair with something few Labour leaders have had in the past: that is, a well-considered volume of ideas for left-leaning social and economic policies which spells out the interconnections between the two. It remains to be seen whether this will be enough. On the question of pensions, for example, the commission has provided the Labour party with a way to means-test the support given the elderly, in all but name. As with the taxation of child benefits for higher-rate taxpayers, the 'principle' of universal benefits has been retained, in such a way as to mitigate their biggest financial shortcomings. What has been missed is the opportunity for a more radical rethink of the benefits and taxes which a modern Labour party might embrace. These and other examples of political fudge cloud the more visionary elements of the report, such as the proposals for community development trusts and for a Clinton-style 'Citizen's Service' for young people. The Labour party will doubtless embrace both the vision, and the fudge. The country will have to look elsewhere for the cost.</p>

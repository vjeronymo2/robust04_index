			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Steps to boost exports urged CAPITAL investment write-downs, cuts in corporation tax, an exporters' loan guarantee scheme and bankers' export guarantees should be part of Mr Norman Lamont's Budget, Mr Ian Campbell, director- general of the Institute for Export, said yesterday. Mr Campbell urged the government to extend beyond 1994 its transitional arrangements to provide NCM, the UK's leading export credit insurer, with political risk reinsurance. 'The UK will be the only EC country without a permanent facility to reinsure political risks,' Mr Campbell said at the UPS/Export Times Exporter of the Year award ceremony. 'There is not sufficient private-sector reinsurance available, and this will make British exporters less able to compete.' He urged the government to 'work in partnership with industry' to improve export performance, which has remained stagnant over the past three years. He called for a 100 per cent first-year writing down allowance on capital investment in manufacturing industry, and a reduction in corporation tax to 10 per cent. These moves would boost investment in manufacturing capacity, which has grown by just 19 per cent between 1970 and 1990. This compares with 43 per cent growth in Germany, France and Italy, 86 per cent in the US, and 129 per cent in Japan, according to the Centre for Economics and Business Research. Mr Campbell called for an exporters' loan guarantee scheme for small companies at the early stage of exporting. A low-cost bankers' guarantee scheme would reduce the 'prohibitive expense' of financing credits for initial orders out of overdrafts. Editorial comment, Page 21</p>

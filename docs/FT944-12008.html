			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Funds fuel the fashion for metal: A look back on a year of price rebounds This week last year base metal prices were at an all-time low. Now prices have rebounded with aluminium and copper, the two most heavily-traded metals, up by more than 70 per cent. Analysts suggest that prices have run well ahead of what can be justified by fundamental factors such as the balance of supply and demand. Stocks remain high, twice the normal level in the case of aluminium. But an important new element is fuelling price rises: the activity of banks and investment funds. The funds are estimated to have put Dollars 16bn (Pounds 10bn) into metals so far this year. Meanwhile, the banks probably control 75 per cent of the London Metal Exchange stocks - traders say that as much as 85 per cent of the LME's aluminium stock is controlled by four or five banks. Consumers are complaining, particularly the Japanese, the biggest users of metals markets. Mr Kenichi Watanabe, chairman of the Japan Aluminium Federation, said he had little faith in a market, such as the LME, which could be influenced by speculators. Producers, many of whom were almost suicidal a year ago, do not wholeheartedly welcome the new element in the metals markets either. High prices encourage substitution of other materials for metals and volatile prices frighten off potential metals users. Also, producers are likely to use the futures markets to lock in artificially high prices either to fund further development or to bolster flagging operations - moves that might bloat future supply. There is general concern among metal markets users about what happens next. Many share the view of Mr Robin Adams, president of the Resource Strategies consultancy, who says the funds' involvement is 'a fashion craze' and 'financial fashions like real estate investment trusts, loans to Third World dictators and junk bonds, always end in tears'. Nevertheless, there are apparently good reasons for the banks and funds' involvement. Banks, for example, took advantage of cheap money to buy up stocks of physical metal. Mr Chris Harris of Barclays Metals describes how the system worked: typically a bank borrowed one-year money at 5 per cent and used it to buy aluminium at Dollars 1,200 a tonne. The bank negotiated special terms with a warehouse to store the metal for one year at Dollars 52 a tonne. It sold the metal forward at Dollars 1,315 a tonne to gain a Dollars 3 a tonne profit. The volumes involved tended to be at least 250,000 tonnes per bank and two big groups are believed to have tied up 800,000 tonnes each. Investment managers, meanwhile, say interest in metals has boomed because clients wanted to reduce their portfolio risk through asset diversification and hedge against unexpected inflation. Commodities are being touted as a new asset class to compete with bonds, equities and property. But many analysts are sceptical. 'Those three assets offer a running return in addition to the possible capital gain,' says Mr Robert Davies, mining analyst at London stockbrokers, Smith New Court. 'Interest, dividend and rental income from the three traditional asset classes give them a long-term value that is totally lacking in commodities. Base metals are mined to be consumed.' He suggests the main reason for the funds' dive into metals was that 'in an effort to achieve better returns than were possible on bonds and equities, some funds chased esoteric investments, including commodities'. Whatever the reason for their involvement, the funds have certainly had an impact on metals prices. During the last cyclical recovery, between 1984 and 1987, metal stocks fell for two years before prices started rising appreciably. This time prices started moving upwards six months before stocks began to fall. Mr Nick Mason, analyst at the CRU International consultancy, says metals prices are now behaving more like financial instruments and anticipating or leading actual fundamental developments. 'The important question for future metals prices is to what extend will the market anticipate the next major shift in the fundamentals. It would not be surprising if prices begin to reflect this expectation as early as the begining of next year.' The consensus is that the funds will unwind their positions in the metals markets gradually so as to avoid any self-inflicted damage to their profits. The hope is that this will take place coincidentally with a surge in metals demand in line with a global economic recovery. Some suggest the funds' timing so far has been perfect and there are solid reasons underlying recent price rises. Mr Wiktor Bielski, metals analyst at Bain &amp; Co, a Deutsche Bank subsidiary, points out that demand for aluminium, copper and nickel rose 7 per cent in the first half of 1994 against the same period last year, while lead and zinc demand was up by 4 per cent. Meanwhile, supplies have fallen along with exports from the former eastern bloc - apart from those of aluminium. Some producers have had to buy metal on the LME to cover commitments. Ms Rhona O'Connell at T. Hoare &amp; Co, London stockbrokers, admits there is always the possibility that the funds might all sell at once if the herd instinct takes over. However, 'the diversity of fund participation and its raison d'etre is such that the funds will not kill the markets that they have helped to rejuvenate. The downside, though, is that the acceleration of supply caused by artificially high prices may also mean that the troughs will be at lower price levels than would otherwise had been the case. On this basis, one could argue that the funds have not actually helped the metals' cause at all.' Palladium booms, Page 35</p>

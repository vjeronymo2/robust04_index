			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: Bond funds THE TABLE this week shows the 10 largest offshore sterling fixed interest funds, taken from Finstat. These are funds which are recognised by the Securities and Investments Board  - the chief regulator for the financial services industry in the UK - and which have a three-year performance record. UK investors can put money in similar funds onshore, but offshore funds pay income gross. The performance of the offshore funds listed appears to be higher than for onshore bond funds over a similar period (last table published May 15), but is bolstered by the re-investment of gross, rather than net, income and by being quoted on an offer-to-offer basis. Some funds have a single price but add an initial charge so that, if funds were quoted on an offer-to-bid price, the single-priced funds would receive an unfair advantage. Since initial charges are often around 5 per cent, quoting on an offer-to-offer basis makes the performance figures look better than the returns an investor would actually get. The strategy adopted by many of the funds is 'total return,' to give investors both growth and income. As its name suggests, John Govett's UK High Income fund, with a yield of 9.1 per cent, aims to provide a high yield  - although not at the expense of stability in its capital value, says Govett's Simon Osborne. Up to 25 per cent is invested in non-sterling bonds such as Spanish government bonds (10 per cent), Italian government bonds and Mexican short-term Treasury bonds. Around 10 per cent is in longer-term gilts and the rest is in AA credit rated Eurosterling bonds  - those issued in sterling by a government or corporate name (such as British Gas). The fund with the lowest yield in this table  - Gartmore's Capital Strategy fund  - is one of Gartmore's 24 umbrella funds. The aim of the sterling fixed interest fund, according to manager Mark Rimmer, is to invest in 'high quality bonds with minimal credit risk with an emphasis on capital growth.' The emphasis on security is borne out by the fund's requirement that investment in gilts does not fall below 50 per cent. At the moment, 55 per cent is invested in gilts, 22 per cent in sovereign guaranteed bonds (Eurobonds issued by foreign governments) and 20 per cent in corporate names. Rimmer believes offshore sterling bond funds are suited best to investors who want both security and income. 'Sterling bonds still represent reasonable value as inflation remains under control,' he says, 'but the scope for large capital gains from gilts may be limited because the market has rallied over the past few months.' He favours the 5-7 year end of the gilts market where he anticipates total returns of around 10 per cent, while the long-end faces the potential problem of oversupply. Investors should note the charges, as well as yield and performance; there is a wide difference. The initial charge on John Govett's fund is 5 per cent, with a 1 per cent annual fee (minimum investment Pounds 2,000); the initial charge is 3.5 per cent on Lloydstrust gilt fund with a 0.75 per cent annual fee (minimum investment Pounds 5,000); but there is no initial charge at Gartmore. annual fee is 1 per cent and the minimum investment is Dollars 25,000 or its sterling equivalent.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                LARGEST 10 STERLING OFFSHORE BOND FUNDS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Fund                           Size (Pounds m)    Yield (%)     Perf* Lloyds Trust Gilt Fund             491.2            7.60        64.1 Midland Offshore Gilt              377.5            7.87        58.0 Barclays Sterling Bond             188.6            8.90        70.4 TSB Gilt                           144.3            7.84        56.5 Invesco MIM Jersey Gilt            110.2            8.04        58.1 Kleinwort Benson Gilt               40.2            7.25        59.1 Guinness Flight Gilt &amp; Pounds       32.0            8.43        57.1 Hill Samuel Stg Fxd Int             31.3            7.83        64.3 Gartmore Cap Strat                  20.6            6.63        61.6 Govett GSI UK Hi Inc                17.9            9.10        64.4  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Finstat.

			<p>BFN     [Text] La Paz, 9 Jun (EFE) -- Bolivian President Gonzalo  Sanchez de Lozada today announced that Marcelo Cespedes  Gutierrez has been appointed the new labor minister. Gutierrez  replaces Reynaldo Peters, who resigned today.    Peters' sudden resignation can be added to those of Luis  Lema, Bolivian ambassador to Argentina; and Jorge Otasevich, the  congressional and political affairs under secretary, both of  whom resigned today.    Ernesto Machicao, minister of social communications,  explained that the resigning government officials will replace  those senators who have been objected to in the ongoing  impeachment process against the suspended president and senior  justice of the Supreme Court.    The impeachment process against Supreme Court President  Edgar  Oblitas and Senior Justice Ernesto Poppe is in its final stages  after an anguishing process in the Chamber of Deputies and the  Senate. This is the first effort made to establish a precedent  in the battle against corruption undertaken by the Sanchez de  Lozada administration.    The defense objected to several of the senators from the  ruling Nationalist Revolutionary Movement (MNR). In view of  this there was a risk that the two-thirds of the votes necessary  to approve the impeachment would not be achieved.    With the votes of Peters, Lema, and Otasevich, the MNR will  be able to secure the majority of votes necessary to approve the  impeachment process.</p>

			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES  </P> <P> Weird but true: "21 Jump Street" heartthrob Johnny Depp will team with quirky  film maker John Waters ("Pink Flamingos," "Hairspray") -- for the musical love  story "Cry Baby."  </P> <P> A spoof of '50s-era JD (that's juvenile delinquent) flicks, it's for Imagine  Entertainment/Universal. Waters will write and direct with Rachel Talalay  producing.  </P> <P> Depp will play a gang member who gets his "Cry Baby" nickname when he's spotted  shedding a single tear. The pic boasts more than 30 tunes, but Depp may or may  not sing. His spokesman reminded, "Johnny broke in as a singer-musician,"  playing clubs on the Sunset Strip.  </P> <P> Filming is set for Waters' Baltimore stomping ground in mid-April. That's  hiatus time for Depp from his work as a sexy undercover cop on "Jump Street,"  where he's emerged as the hot star at age 25.  </P> <P> But some film offers will have to wait.  </P> <P> "When this season ends," said a Fox TV spokesman, "Johnny Depp's contract  continues for three more years."  </P></p>

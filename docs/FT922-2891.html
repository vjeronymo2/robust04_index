			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Tax risk for Australian inflation AUSTRALIA'S struggle against inflation is likely to be undermined over the next year by tax increases planned by state governments in defiance of federal government calls for restraint. New South Wales and Victoria, the two biggest states, plan significant increases in taxes on beer, tobacco, petrol and financial transactions, together with increases in charges for state transport services. South Australia has also indicated that it is considering raising taxes and charges, and other states are likely to follow suit if slow economic growth continues to worsen their budgetary problems. The increases follow the completion of the annual financial assistance agreement between the states and territories and the federal government, which determines the size of federal grants. This year's agreement provides for an increase in total grants of 5.9 per cent to ADollars 28.4bn (Pounds 11.9bn), together with a 10 per cent increase in the states' aggregate borrowing limit to ADollars 4.2bn. Mr Paul Keating, the Labor prime minister, said the agreement would provide the first real increase in financial assistance since the mid-1980s, when the federal government began cutting transfers to balance its own budget. Mr Keating also extracted an undertaking that the states and territories would avoid increases in taxes and charges to avoid raising inflation from the current low level of 1.5 per cent. However, the agreement failed to resolve a long-running dispute over the mechanism used to determine grants to individual states and territories, which discriminates against the larger states. Mrs Joan Kirner, the Labor premier of Victoria, said she had agreed with Mr Nick Greiner, the Liberal premier of New South Wales, that increases in taxes and charges were inevitable to avoid significant cuts in services. Mr Greiner said the increases in New South Wales alone would add 0.5-0.7 percentage points to inflation, which had been expected to remain below 2 per cent for the rest of the calendar year.</p>

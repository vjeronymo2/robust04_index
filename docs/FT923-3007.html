			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / NVQs criticised as too restrictive MANY of the new National Vocational Qualifications are too narrow and job-specific, an Institute of Manpower Studies report said yesterday. The report - which the institute said was produced under contract with the Department of Employment - draws particularly on experience of NVQs in the construction industry. NVQs, the new national system of assessment based on competence in the workplace, are being introduced across the whole spectrum of employment. Employer-led bodies, called industry lead bodies, advised on the contents of the new qualifications which were drawn up by the National Council for Vocational Qualifications. There are several criticisms of the qualifications in the report, including the view that they suffer from poor general recognition and a lack of information to employers, employees and training providers. 'As yet, most people cannot even conceptualise what owning an NVQ means,' the report says. 'Many NVQs are limited and too mechanistic and restrictive,' it says. 'Often their educational content has been squeezed out along with pedagogic concerns.' The study says the narrowness of employer-defined competence training highlights the conflict between the short-term needs of employers for very specific skills and the long-term interests and training needs of trainees, the industry, and the economy. 'It brings into question whether it is in the interests of individuals to have such narrow and partial training.' The report adds that in their present form NVQs are unlikely to change either the incentive for employers to train people or the take-up of vocational training.

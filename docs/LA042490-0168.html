			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THEATER;  </P> <P> REVIVAL OF 'JOE EGG' TO HATCH AT ART;  </P> <P> AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL BLACK COMEDY ABOUT A HANDICAPPED DAUGHTER IS 'A WARTS-AND-ALL  PRESENTATION.'  </P> <P> When "A Day in the Death of Joe Egg" first appeared in 1967, it came as a  shock. Here was a play in which a mother and father make sick jokes about their  handicapped 10-year-old daughter.  </P> <P> Father, impersonating a German doctor: You vont a vord for her? You can say she  iss a spastic vis a damaged cerebral cortex, multiplegic, epileptic. . . .  </P> <P> Mother: That is a long word.  </P> <P> Father: Which iss vy I prefer wegetable.  </P> <P> One might have expected that sort of black comedy from Lenny Bruce. But from a  British playwright who revealed that "Joe Egg" was autobiographical, that the  title character was based on his own barely sentient daughter?  </P> <P> We are talking about Peter Nichols, the author of nearly a dozen mordantly  funny plays from "The National Health" (about death and disease) to "Privates  on Parade" (about sex and the army) to "Passion Play" (about marriage and  adultery).  </P> <P> Like the schoolteacher father in "Joe Egg," who claims that "every cloud has a  jet-black lining," Nichols is not big on moral uplift. The idea of small  victories over great afflictions does not apply. "If ever there was a case for  euthanasia it was our daughter," he said after her natural death at age 11 in  1971.  </P> <P> The revival of "Joe Egg" that opens Friday at the Alternative Repertory Theatre  in Santa Ana uses a life-size doll rather than an actor in the title role.  "It's been done that way before," said director Joel T. Cotter during a recent  interview at Cal State Fullerton, where he heads the drama department's scene  shop.  </P> <P> An actor in the role, Cotter said, would have distracted an audience in the  small confines of a 61-seat storefront theater, particularly when the script  calls for Joe to have epileptic seizures and spastic convulsions. Further, a  life-size doll fits the format of a sometimes surreal drama filled with  satirical sketches, comic parodies and monologues frequently directed to the  audience.  </P> <P> "I want the real message of the play to come across," Cotter said. "I don't  want the focus drawn away from the other characters. 'Joe Egg' is not really  about Joe. That's what makes it so interesting. But it will be a warts-and-all  presentation. I don't think the audience will leave whistling."  </P> <P> In fact, "Joe Egg" focuses on the strains in the marital relationship between  Joe's father and mother after 10 years of trying to cope with their biological  disaster. They survive on daily fantasies of murder and guilt. The certainty  that Josephine will never be more than a "living parsnip" in a wheelchair, much  less a Christy Brown, keeps the sick jokes flowing. ("A useful anesthetic,"  allows one of the couple's offended friends.)  </P> <P> What drew Cotter to Nichols' play was not only the subject matter but also its  British texture. "I have a real fondness for British things," he said. "I just  love their film and drama. It's very different from what the Americans do. I  find most, though not all, British writers to be more substantial."  </P> <P> At first glance, the 35-year-old director gives an American Gothic impression  himself. In his bushy beard, faded blue overalls and yellow T-shirt, he could  pass for a tall, hefty dirt farmer just finished with chores at the barn. The  impression is dispelled, however, by his soft-spoken theatrical concerns.  </P> <P> "I hope the audience will go into this play with a clean slate," he said. "I  want them to make up their own minds about what happens to the people. I'm not  trying to prod them one way or the other."  </P> <P> In any case, theatergoers will be offered something quite different from the  touching heroics provided by dramatizations of the handicapped in such movies  and plays as "My Left Foot," "The Elephant Man" and "Children of a Lesser God."  </P> <P> "Joe Egg" will be Cotter's third outing as a director at ART. Earlier this  season, he staged a reading of Truman Capote's "A Christmas Memory" and, last  season, a production of Arthur Kopit's comedy "End of the World."  </P> <P> A native of North Attleboro, Mass., Cotter said that for three years before  coming to Cal State Fullerton in 1984 he ran the scene shop at the Actors  Theater of Louisville in Kentucky, one of the nation's leading resident  theaters.  </P> <P>  "A Day in the Death of Joe Egg" opens Friday at the Alternative Repertory  Theatre, 1636 S. Grand Ave., Santa Ana., and continues Thursdays through  Saturdays at 8 p.m. and Sundays at 7 p.m. through June 16. Tickets: $10-$12  ($15 on opening night). Information: (714) 836-7929.  </P> <P> </P></p>

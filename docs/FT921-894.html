			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Continued progress at Micro Focus with 23% rise to Pounds 18m MICRO FOCUS, the Newbury-based software company whose share price, currently Pounds 22.23p, has become the wonder of the UK-owned electronics sector, maintained its seemingly unstoppable progress last year. Profits before tax rose 23 per cent in 1991 to reach Pounds 18.1m (Pounds 14.8m), while revenues were up 20 per cent to Pounds 55.9m (Pounds 46.5m). Fully diluted earnings advanced 26 per cent to 83.1p (65.9p) per share. The rise in cash reserves was 50 per cent to Pounds 30.9m (Pounds 20.4m). There was a gain of Pounds 478,000 from the sale of the company's 54 per cent interest in Softwright Systems. Micro Focus, in keeping with US rather than UK practice, is not paying a dividend. The remarkable growth of the share price - it languished around the 600p-800p mark for much of the 1990s - is the result of US investment through American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). Some 39.4 per cent of the company's stock is now held in this form. US investors are reckoned to understand Micro Focus and its products much better than their UK equivalents, who have frequently found it difficult to value the company adequately. Now Micro Focus is set for a listing on the US Nasdaq exchange. In November last year, it started the process of registering as a 'foreign private issuer' with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, a necessary prerequisite to a Nasdaq listing. Mr Paul O'Grady, chairman, said 1991 had been a tough year and 1992 would be no easier. He expected, however, to maintain growth in both revenues and profits. Tight control on cost expansion is being maintained until there are real signs of an economic upturn. COMMENT Micro Focus' performance would be more than respectable in a healthy economy, but to have grown by more than a fifth in the deepest recession the computing services business has endured with a gross margin of more than 30 per cent is a tribute to the company's tight management and careful housekeeping. It markets its products - software tools to make computer programmers more productive - both to corporate customers and to computer manufacturers like ICL, Siemens Nixdorf and Groupe Bull. It enjoys a close relationship with IBM as a member of the large computer manufacturer's international alliance. There would seem to be little, apart from a further sharp deepening of the recession, that should prevent the company maintaining its growth this year. Laing &amp; Cruickshank estimate pre-tax profits of Pounds 22m for 1992, equivalent to earnings of 104.1p per share. That would give a prospective p/e of 21 which would hardly be considered extreme for a similar company in the US.</p>

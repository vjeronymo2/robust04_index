			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> YOUNG LUNGS: Twice this year, 6-year-old Christopher Lee Parker of Cypress has  sung the national anthem before Angels games in Anaheim, and now 12-year-old  Adrienne Stiefel of Laguna Hills will do the singing before tonight's game at  Dodger Stadium. . . . Adrienne has sung on stage and animated films but says  she was inspired by comedienne Roseanne Barr's controversial spoof of the  anthem before a game in San Diego. "She was horrible, and I thought I could do  better than that." Mark I. Pinsky and Tom Hamilton  </P></p>

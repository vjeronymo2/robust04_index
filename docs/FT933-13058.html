			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: SB's patent cure Drugs prices can go down as well as up. The prices charged by SmithKline Beecham to big buyers of managed healthcare in the US were 5 to 10 per cent lower in the first half of this year than last. Since the company expects such bulk buyers to account for a rising proportion of sales, price deflation has further to run even without government intervention. Drugs prices have fallen this year in Germany and Italy as a result of government reforms. The chances are that similar measures will follow elsewhere in Europe. All credit to SmithKline Beecham, then, for increasing pharmaceutical sales in both the US and Europe. But not all drugs companies have been blessed with a stable of promising new products at such a critical moment. Self-help will be required elsewhere to protect margins and keep earnings on a rising trend. The Dollars 775m restructuring charge taken by Merck yesterday, and cuts announced by Marion Merrill Dow last week, will not be the last. Having been through the pain of merger, SB may have less fat to cut. If a handful of big buyers soon account for the lion's share of its US sales, though, its 2,000-strong US sales force will look extravagant. The expiry next year of the US patent on Tagamet, SB's big-selling ulcer treatment, will be a test. But the impact on earnings should be offset by a timely currency gain. There is also the promise of an over-the-counter version of Tagamet. Judging by the performance of the shares during the great de-rating of the sector, the market now regards SB's consumer marketing expertise as a useful spread of risks.</p>

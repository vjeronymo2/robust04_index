			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Transcription of the text" of an interview with President </F> Juan Carlos Wasmosy by unidentified reporter; place and date not  given; published in the 26 May edition of the Buenos Aires  newspaper AMBITO FINANCIERO]    [Text] [AMBITO FINANCIERO] There is a lot of criticism  against your administration in the newspapers. You seem to be  concerned about what they say.    [Wasmosy] Today a social communicator has much more power  than a minister. So much so that if a bad communicator says  something silly, people tend to believe what he said, even when  you prove it is nonsense and untrue. Today the so-called fourth  power plays an essential role in the process to consolidate  democracy. Of course, it is a process to form a conscience and  mature. We must all learn, including those who own those key  means of communications.    [AMBITO FINANCIERO] It is surprising to see how much the  media has changed since Alfredo Stroessner's times.    [Wasmosy] Just think that in the past we used to read the  newspaper from back to front. Influential journalists, in fact  the only ones around, were those who specialized in soccer or  other sports. Now everything has changed, although in some  aspects everything is being exaggerated. Every front page is  full of reports on scandals, corruption; nothing constructive.  We have the impression that we live in chaos. But you have seen  that is not the case. Nothing happens in the streets. There is  no violence. People work in cities and rural areas. We have  problems, of course, but not to the degree stressed by the press.    [AMBITO FINANCIERO] Do you think there are special reasons  or  interests behind that exaggeration?    [Wasmosy] In general terms, I can say that the campaign has  intensified since the Sao Paulo Forum meeting (international  leftist leaders meeting). Many people will be in trouble if  democracy consolidates, as the country will grow and they will  no longer be able to live as if the country were a ranch. The  same thing will happen with other nations that think it  convenient to keep us as suppliers of raw materials.    [AMBITO FINANCIERO] I see that you maintain a nationalist  spirit, something traditional in Paraguay.    [Wasmosy] Look, this is personal, a very personal opinion.  There are two strong institutions in this country turning  nationalism into something very strong: the Church and the Army.  This is why they are so often attacked. On one hand we have all  these tents and protest movements that are separating the Church  from its evangelical and pastoral mission, and pressuring it to  enter the political arena in the name of a liberation theory.  Many people are involved in this campaign. We must be careful  because it does not affect only us.    But I do not want to speak about other countries, as a  matter  of respect. In other places these forces have also tried to  divide the Army, but they failed despite all their efforts. The  Armed Forces are being reorganized, without losing respect for  the chain of command or discipline. We are giving it the human  dimension required. The Armed Forces not only respect me, they  even like me.    [AMBITO FINANCIERO] They will surely love you if you  maintain  or increase their budget.    [Wasmosy] Look, I will contradict you. The number of  generals  was reduced from 62 to 38, and Congress stripped them of even  their food coupons and reduced everything they had. They have  adapted. I must be honest and say this because no one else  admits it in this country. We face other risks. Those crying out  on behalf of the ecology are people coming from industrialized  countries, people who have destroyed everything. They try to use  our Indians--we have 17 ethnic groups in Paraguay--as a  mechanism to divide us and destroy the country's unity. They do  everything to us. They overwhelm us. They seem to forget that  democracy cannot exist without bread, and that it is very  expensive.    Just look at the issue of drugs. We are being pressured  because it is said that our country is being used for the  transit of drugs. I say: Send helicopters, radars, and even  personnel to control the traffic, but if consumption is not  curtailed production, will never drop. We must be honest and  accept that the principle of supply and demand does not exist  for certain items alone.    [AMBITO FINANCIERO] The economy is becoming global. Do you  not think that violence might also become global? And I cite the  case of Chiapas, in Mexico, as an example.    [Wasmosy] Chiapas, Santiago del Estero [Argentina], San  Pedro  in Paraguay, etc. Everything is part of a single plan. Proof of  that is that part of the labor movement believes in violence and  asks for things they know cannot be granted: a 40 percent salary  increase, withdrawal from Mercosur [Common Market of the South],  an urgent employment policy, etc. It is very easy to ask. I  would like to ask an entrepreneur who tried to become president  and who supported the strike [referring to National Encounter's  Guillermo Caballero Vargas]: If he agrees with the strike's  motives, why does he not grant a 40 percent salary increase to  his own employees? Because you must be consistent and do what  you say should be done. About the demand to withdraw from  Mercosur, I say as president, because I have also been  integration minister, that I will not integrate the country if  integration will not benefit our country. But I am convinced  there is no other path than integration, unless someone shows me  something better.    That does not mean I will jump into an empty swimming pool  and kill my country with me. There are different ways to  integrate. How can you ask for a 40 percent increase if that  means 40 percent inflation? In Mercosur we are calling for  coordination of macroeconomic policies. Then, gentlemen, we must  find a way to understand the problem facing Brazilians without  ruining Argentine industrialists. I do not have the instruments  to implement our government programs, but what can I do? We have  an obsolete Penal Code and Code of Proceedings while banks raise  interest rates. We cannot retool our industries with 36 percent  or 42 percent interest rates. But what is the problem?    The problem is that I cannot tighten the screws because of  the Central Bank Law and the Banks Law approved in 1952. We must  update all those mechanisms. We have a new Constitution, and we  must adapt those laws to the new Constitution and update them.  We are developing an economy that is not directed or controlled  by the state. Do you realize that? This is why I say that  democracy is nice, expensive, and demands a lot of maturity.    [AMBITO FINANCIERO] Your reflections stress items that have  affected many transition governments on their path from a  dictatorial to a democratic system.    [Wasmosy] I would not blame the system that much. It is very  difficult for an obedient society to become an intelligent  society. Our people are used to being directed. They are used to  asking the boss what he thinks, and then just following him.    We must force each individual to think on his own, to have  his own opinion. But that will require time and maturity. Here  is where I think we must be firm in staying on course and  maintaining our objectives.    [AMBITO FINANCIERO] Is everything against you, then?    [Wasmosy] Obviously. Media sources have not trained their  people. Who exactly are most journalists?    [AMBITO FINANCIERO] Perhaps you are confused about that.    [Wasmosy] Very well. It is possible.    [AMBITO FINANCIERO] Do you know what I notice? It seems that  you cannot govern, as was the case with Fujimori at one time.    [Wasmosy] I tell you that I will do everything in my power  to  avoid dissolving Congress; I have confidence in people.... I am  confident that they will mature. What happened to the Senate  Investigative Commission on Illegal Activities? They put their  foot in it so many times that they have lost all credibility.    As for unions, their strikes have failed. Who else will  believe in them? They have to justify the money they receive  from abroad. We.... No other president has done what I did:  sponsor a round table, a Social Development Council where  everyone is heard. But they withdrew. Why? The peasants came and  raised their problems: They were given a solution, which was  welcomed "with applause." And they are satisfied.    Transport workers called for a strike. We told them:  Gentlemen, if you disagree, please bring another proposal to  resolve the problem between transport enterprises and their  employees. But they failed to show up at three consecutive  sessions of the Council. Why? They wanted the strike. We  arranged an agreement between employees and employers through  the justice and labor ministry, but they once again reacted.  Because what they wanted was to promote destabilization.    [AMBITO FINANCIERO] Going back to the subject of foreign  models, you have already said that you would not like your  government to look like "the Fujimori experience."    [Wasmosy] Yet it should be noted that I respect his  experience, because what Fujimori did was to strengthen  democracy.    [AMBITO FINANCIERO] If we consider other less traumatic  models, if you consider the Argentine transition with Raul  Alfonsin, and the Uruguayan transition with Julio Maria  Sanguinetti, which one do you think was better?    [Wasmosy] Sanguinetti, Sanguinetti!    [AMBITO FINANCIERO] Can you explain your reasons?    [Wasmosy] I want to tell you that in the case of Dr.  Alfonsin, for example, there was a reaction against the Army. I  wonder, had the Army failed to do what it did--and I am not  supporting abuses, because I am neither a terrorist nor a  dictator, no, no. I tell you, I have always seen the press  reporting, for example: The Army has committed such and such an  abuse.    And the people who killed the police chief's daughters, who  have blown up cars, who have killed people, are they all  good-natured people? Somebody therefore had to come out the  winner, and with civic courage the Argentine Army brought peace.  Dr. Alfonsin then completed the other institutions. But if the  military had not done what they did, Alfonsin would not have  been able to do what he did, and Menem would not have been able  to consolidate the economy as he did. They could do it because  other people resolved the problems of the other areas of  government.    [AMBITO FINANCIERO] Getting away from politics, the point is  how to incorporate the informal economy into the transition  system.    [Wasmosy] The informal sector will be legalized only when  inflation in Paraguay and in neighboring countries reaches more  or less the same level, or similar levels. And when taxes on  domestic consumption are also put more or less at the same  level. What happens with cigarettes? Brazil produces  cigarettes, imposing a 386 percent tax on them. But if Brazil  exports them, I believe the tax is 0 percent. What is the result  of this? When they export cigarettes to Paraguay, they send only  the documents. Just imagine, in Paraguay we have a tax of only  26 percent.    Cigarette exporters therefore put the Brazilian product in  Ciudad del Este, Capitan Bado, Pedro Juan Caballero, everywhere.  The Brazilians who come to see the Iguazu waterfalls pay 500  guaranies for cigarettes that cost 1,500 guaranies in Brazil. Do  you know how many people enter Ciudad del Este per day? From  Iguazu (Argentina) and Foz do Iguacu (Brazil), 200,000 people.  If each one of them buys 10 packages.... I leave the  calculations up to you.</p>

			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INVESTMENT PROFIT TIDE TURNS, FLOWS OUT OF U.S.  </P> <P> For the first time since the 1950s, foreign investors are earning more from  their assets in the United States than Americans are receiving on their  investments abroad, the government reported Tuesday.  </P> <P> The figures for the second quarter of 1989, published by the Commerce  Department, were taken as another indicator of the continuing erosion of the  United States' international economic position in the face of growing  competition from abroad.  </P> <P> Ben E. Laden, a Washington economist who tracks investment flows, called the  development "a watershed."  </P> <P> He said the report provides "additional evidence that our economic position is  deteriorating. We're now showing a negative."  </P> <P> Until recently, the nation has been able to count on the "services" component  of its trade and balance-of-payments figures to help offset any further  worsening of the trade deficit in manufactured goods and other areas.  </P> <P> The services component primarily measures the difference between what Americans  earn on their investments overseas -- in the form of interest, dividends,  rents, royalties and other payments -- and what foreigners earn here.  </P> <P> But the latest figures -- part of a report on the current account measuring  overall trade and investment flows -- show that the trade deficit continued to  improve while the services component slid into a slight deficit of $176  million, down from a $1.5 billion surplus in the first quarter.  </P> <P> The services deficit underscores another benchmark reached in 1985, when the  United States technically became a "debtor" nation -- meaning that the value of  foreign investment here exceeded that of Americans' purchases of assets abroad.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Resources Could Be Drained  </P> <P> That calculation has been questioned by some analysts because U.S. investments  abroad, which generally are older than foreigners' investments here, are  calculated at their original value instead of at their current value, which has  been increased by inflation.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, it is widely accepted that the trend has been worsening.  </P> <P> Economists say neither figure should cause a panic at this point.  </P> <P> But the situation could become burdensome within a few years, draining  available resources as the nation struggles to pay interest on the money it is  borrowing from abroad.  </P> <P> To rectify the situation, analysts say Americans must begin saving and  investing more and working to improve productivity and increase production  capacity, so the nation can export more.  </P> <P> To many, that means cutting the federal budget deficit to reduce the proportion  of available resources that goes to the federal government.  </P> <P> The current account deficit -- the broadest measure of trade and investment  flows recorded by the government -- dipped to $126.5 billion last year after  peaking at a record $143.7 billion in 1987. This year it is expected to edge  down slightly further.  </P> <P> For the April-June quarter, the merchandise trade deficit fell 2.3% to $27.7  billion. It was the measure's best three-month performance in more than four  years.  </P> <P> Overall, though, the current account deficit for the second quarter was $30.99  billion, a slight widening from the $30.39 billion deficit recorded for the  previous quarter.  </P></p>

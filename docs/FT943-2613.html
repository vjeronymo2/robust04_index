			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Haiti peace hopes hinge on Carter: Cedras said to be demanding Aristide step down as price of junta's leaving Former US president Jimmy Carter yesterday entered a fourth session of talks with Haiti's military rulers, as senior US government officials in Washington insisted that his mission was authorised only to agree the departure of the ruling three-man junta. There were persistent reports from the Haitian side that Lt Gen Raoul Cedras, the army chief, was demanding that Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the Haitian president ousted in the 1991 coup, agree to step down as a condition for the junta's capitulation. Other reports said that General Philippe Niamby, the army chief of staff, was holding out against leaving, but that Lt Cedras and Lt Col Michel Francois, the police chief, were resigned to exile. President Carlos Menem of Argentina yesterday said he was prepared to offer asylum if the junta left before any invasion. As the US delegation, which also includes Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia and retired General Colin Powell, former head of the joint chiefs of staff, was in talks at the Haitian military's headquarters in Port-au-Prince, a US presidential jet stood ready to whisk them back to Washington. Mr Carter briefed President Bill Clinton by telephone on Saturday night, as did Gen Powell early yesterday. This encouraged the White House to say the discussions were 'serious and constructive', with officials emphasising that there was no US desire to humiliate the junta beyond their forced departure. But Mr Leon Panetta, the White House chief of staff, Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, and Mr William Perry, defence secretary, all said in television interviews that the junta must go. 'There is no practical way they can stay after they step down,' Mr Perry said. Officials stressed that the return of Mr Aristide was non-negotiable, especially after his agreement last week not to contest presidential elections scheduled for December 1995. Asked if merely moving across the border to the Dominican Republic was an option, Mr Perry replied: 'We have not yet specified which country they could go to - but that might be under discussion right now' in Port-au-Prince. It emerged at the weekend that Mr Clinton decided to send the Carter mission only after Thursday night's televised address in which he had demanded that the junta leave. Mr Panetta said the final decision was taken jointly by Mr Clinton and Mr Carter but he denied that 'this last-minute effort for peace' had been opposed by some administration members. However, the decision was interpreted in Washington as further evidence that Mr Clinton is still deeply ambivalent about ordering an invasion.

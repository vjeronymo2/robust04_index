			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Nigeria is once again in the grip of acute petrol  shortage. The National Petroleum Corporation [NNPC] has tried  to reassure motorists that things will improve, but all the  refineries are out of action. Those who do manage to fill their  cars are paying a high price as the government says it doesn't  have enough money for imports. From Lagos, Sola Odunfa reports:    [Begin Odunfa recording] From Lagos to Maiduguri in the  extreme northeast, and from the southeastern coastal city of  Calabar to Sokoto in the northwest, the major preoccupation of  motorists in the past 10 days has been search for fuel for their  vehicles. The perennial traffic jam in Lagos has disappeared  because only a fraction of vehicles are now plying the roads.  Most are either parked at the garage or on vigil at filling  stations, expecting fuel.    I left home at five o'clock this morning in the hope that I  would be one of the first to arrive at a station on Lagos Island  which got its supply yesterday evening. I could not even get  near the station in my car. All the approach roads were jammed  with motorists who either slept there overnight or got there as  early as four o'clock. There is chaos everywhere a filling  station is located. Station attendants are making brisk but  illegal business, selling into plastic containers at up to five  times the official price to taxi and bus operators or to private  motorists who cannot afford to ground their vehicles or spend up  to 18 hours on queues.    Lagos is even better off compared to most other towns. In  Abeokuta, there was no drop of petrol at any filling station  yesterday. In Ilorin and Ibadan, only a handful of stations had  anything to sell. This has led to frayed (?nights) among  motorists at the stations and street fights break out now and  then. In Ilorin, northern Nigeria at the weekend, soldiers and  policemen fought openly in the streets following a scuffle  between two servicemen at the a filling station.    Military administrators of the 30 states have been visiting  the NNPC depots and filling stations ostensibly to find out the  cause of the shortage and to ensure that there is not hoarding,  but the effort has so far been fruitless because the four  refineries in the country are hardly producing as a result of  breakdown of machinery.

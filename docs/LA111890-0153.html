			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COUPLE'S 'RICH' CATEGORY RICHLY UNEARNED  </P> <P> Where did we go wrong?  </P> <P> According to our new tax category, Congress has classified us as "rich." Our  combined incomes are $101,000 before deductions.  </P> <P> We drive two American, mid-priced cars that are 5 years old. We live in a  remodeled tract house.  </P> <P> We never go out to eat. It's been four years since we had a vacation.  </P> <P> I cut coupons, everyone's hair, and collect wood to heat the house from the  fireplace.  </P> <P> Our two teen-agers attend the University of California; tuition is $3,600 for  both and housing is $12,000 for both. They work part-time for all other  expenses. They are B-plus students, so neither qualifies for scholarships, and  our combined income removes us from financial aid.  </P> <P> And yet, there is never any money left over. Our only deduction is the mortgage  payment; we have never had enough after doctor, dentist, orthodontist, auto  repair and insurance bills to be able to invest in any tax shelters.  </P> <P> So who is going to get hit with Congress' new tax plans? People like us, whom  they call rich.  </P> <P> MARGARET MUIR  </P> <P> El Toro  </P></p>

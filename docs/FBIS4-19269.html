			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Moderate Coalition Party secretary </F> Gunnar Hokmark by Monica Bjorklund; place and date not given]    [Text] We will remind the voters of what is best for  Sweden. That step by step we are leading Sweden out of the  crisis. And that a "yes" to Europe is a "yes" to the future.    This was how Moderate Coalition Party secretary Gunnar  Hokmark sketched the Moderates' election message. The message  will to a large extent be that Sweden is now on the right road  and what is important is to continue along the path we have  started to take.    "We are used to facing Social Democratic scare propaganda in  election campaigns. But this year their attacks will flounder  on the simple fact that when they were ruling the curves were  all pointing downward and now the curves are pointing upward."    The Moderate election campaign will clearly show the  differences between Moderate and Social Democratic policy. This  applies in particular to tax policy where the Moderates are  pushing their line of tax reductions. While the Social  Democrats, according to the Moderates' calculations, want to  raise taxes by 80 billion kronor.    "On tax policy there is a clear political dividing line.  Here the Social Democrats have already lost credibility once  before. The policy they are now advocating is the same policy  with which they led Sweden into the crisis."    It is from the Social Democrats that the Moderates expect to  attract the largest number of new voters.    "It is there that we have the major opinion poll and voter  gains to make," Gunnar Hokmark said.    "When we have made gains in the past, it is chiefly from the  Social Democrats that we have taken votes."    Gunnar Hokmark does not expect the four government parties  to  publish a joint election manifesto.    "We will run the election campaign as individual parties.  But the government coalition in itself is a very important  manifestation."    He is convinced that European issues will play a major role  in the election campaign.    "The question of whether or not Sweden should become a  member  will hover over the whole election campaign and will be brought  to a head. And it will also be a question of who will lead  Sweden in Europe.    ``We Moderates will push the European issue firmly. We know  that we will win voters with this. And we know that when we  push the European issue others will push it more than they would  have done.''    Gunnar Hokmark believes that the economy and Europe will be  the election campaign's two main issues.    The Social Democrats' party secretary, Mona Sahlin, recently  proposed that farmers and businessmen should pay additional  taxes if Sweden becomes a member of the EU, because these groups  will gain so much from membership.    Gunnar Hokmark calls this a "stupid excuse for raising  taxes."    Center Party leader Olof Johansson in his turn has said that  increased environmental levies could contribute to the financing  of Sweden's contribution to the EU budget. Hokmark says "no" to  this too.    "We will be able to afford to pay our membership  contribution  because membership will lead to increased economic growth. We  should not then limit this growth by increasing taxes."    Gunnar Hokmark thinks that local taxation should be reduced  during the life of the next Riksdag (1994-1998). This will be  achieved primarily with the help of "good local politicians."  But he would also like to see a freeze on increases in local  taxation and he thinks that referendums on tax increases should  be held.    The Moderates' first deputy chairman, Lars Tobisson,  recently  outlined what future social welfare should look like. The  system will guarantee basic protection and protection against  inflation. Citizens will have to protect themselves to a much  greater extent against loss of income through their own savings  and personal insurances.    This caused Social Affairs Minister Bengt Westerberg  (Liberal  Party) to hit the roof. In this area there is a sharp dividing  line between the Moderates and the Liberal Party and here the  Liberals want to keep today's system.    But Gunnar Hokmark would like to tone down the differences.  He thinks that it is wrong to call the Moderate proposals cuts.  They are necessary changes, he said, to create robust insurance  systems which do not undermine social welfare policies.    "The one-day period needed to qualify for sickness benefit  for example was not a cut but an improvement, damn it. It led  to less absenteeism and increased productivity."    He was unwilling to outline any timetable, but said that "it  is important to keep up a pretty rapid pace in the process of  change."    Another issue which divides the nonsocialist parties is  nuclear power. The Center Party and the Christian Democratic  Community Party want legislation establishing 2010 as the final  year for nuclear power stations. The Moderates on the other  hand think that nuclear power should be retained as long as the  safety requirements are met.    "Sweden is now entering a period of economic boom which will  hopefully continue for the whole of the nineties. This makes an  increased demand on electricity. And for environmental reasons  in particular electricity is better than oil.    "It is true that the parties have different views on this  issue. But what has been characteristic of this Riksdag is that  the government parties have been able to incorporate divergent  views. I am convinced that they will be able to do so in the  life of the next Riksdag too."</p>

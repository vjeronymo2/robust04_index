All enterprises and organizations that go into  the international market are obliged to submit information to  the governor's office once each quarter on negotiations and  agreements reached with foreign companies. According to the text  of the directive, the necessity for such control is the result  of "an increase in the extensiveness of export of raw materials  without the creation of a basis for long-term economic activity  of a majority of the participants in foreign economic relations  and its negative influence on the formation of prices in the  international market." In 1993, 380 enterprises and  organizations were engaged in export-import operations on  Sakhalin. The turnover totaled $390 million, given a prolonged  balance of $90 million. Exporter accounts received $222.3  million; however, according to the estimates of authorities, the  incomes could have been one and a half times higher. Poorly  orienting themselves with respect to prices on the world market,  the enterprises that got into it for the first time sometimes  sold fish, biological resources, commercial timber, and saw  timber at prices that were cheaper by a factor of two or more.</p>

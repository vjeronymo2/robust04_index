			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Lady Thatcher speaks out on Gatt talks THE US might withdraw military protection from Europe if the European Community fails to reach a compromise deal on the Uruguay Round of Gatt trade talks, Lady Thatcher said yesterday. Addressing the American Chamber of Commerce in London, she said that a US military withdrawal would be 'very serious indeed for the world as a whole'. She said the US presence in Europe was 'all of a piece with co-operating together on the international economy under the Gatt'. Singling out France for special criticism, she said hopes of a Gatt deal were threatened by a long-standing 'anti-American streak' in the EC.</p>

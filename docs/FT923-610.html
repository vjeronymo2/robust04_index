			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / International Company News: Generali raises premiums GENERALI, Italy's biggest insurance company, raised parent company premiums by 9.2 per cent to L3,927.7bn in the year to July, writes Haig Simonian in Milan. The rate of premium growth was half that in the corresponding period last year, with the fall stemming partly from the decision to weed out unprofitable business, while growth in life premiums remained 'satisfactory'. Group premiums rose by 13.4 per cent to L7,256bn, net of exchange rate changes, while fully consolidated aggregate premiums rose by 15.3 per cent to L11,184bn. The company forecast that underwriting income this year should improve from the difficulties of 1991. However, it warned that earnings, while likely to be affected by the economic problems facing many clients and volatile financial markets, would benefit from extraordinary gains, as in 1991.</p>

			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HIS ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT POINTED TO SUCCESS;  </P> <P> RETAIL: LARRY IMPERIALE, 1986 WINNER OF SAN DIEGO STATE'S BUSINESS PLAN  COMPETITION, SAW A NICHE AMONG THE POINT-OF-SALE GIANTS AND FILLED IT.  </P> <P> Not all winners of the annual San Diego State University business plan  competition go on to start a business, much less become successful.  </P> <P> But Larry Imperiale did and is.  </P> <P> His company, SalePoint, has become a leading producer of point-of-sale systems  used by specialty retailers to track sales and inventory and to improve store  operations. SalePoint expects to do more than $4 million in sales in 1990, only  its third full year in business. SalePoint systems, which basically are cash  registers linked to personal computers, consist of SalePoint-designed software  and International Business Machines hardware.  </P> <P> Imperiale's company has thrived despite heavy competition from corporate giants  such as NCR, Fujitsu and IBM. Among SalePoint's successes are agreements to  supply systems to retailers such as Williams-Sonoma, The Nature Company,  Egghead Software and Universal Studios in California and Florida.  </P> <P> Imperiale, 32, attributes his success in large part to the annual SDSU business  plan competition, which he won in 1986 shortly before receiving his master's  degree in business administration. The young entrepreneur said the competition  forced him to focus and concentrate his ideas in coming up with what became the  blueprint for starting SalePoint in 1987.  </P> <P> Business plans are documents that entrepreneurs use to lay the groundwork for a  new enterprise. The documents, which contain an array of market, technical and  financial information, also serve as marketing tools used to attract capital  from investors or lenders.  </P> <P> Each year, SDSU sponsors a competition to encourage business students to come  to grips with the hard realities of starting up a new business and to foster  the entrepreneurial spirit. The competition is held every December and is  judged by an outside panel, including San Diego business executives, bankers,  venture capitalists and journalists.  </P> <P> For Imperiale, a Redwood City native who attended SDSU's graduate business  school while holding down a full-time job at Triad Systems, his contest entry  became "the vehicle for taking my idea and putting brackets around it."  </P> <P> "The plan was a way of saying, here's how to go about doing it, forcing me to  write it down, plan it out and anticipate all the obstacles I'd run into,"  Imperiale said. "Academically, (the contest) let me tie in everything I learned  through my business school program through one exercise. That's what's lacking  in most business schools. There is so much theoretical stuff that you lose  touch with the pragmatic."  </P> <P> The thesis of Imperiale's plan was that there was an opportunity in the retail  point-of-sale market to develop a system suited to specialty retail stores.  Imperiale knew what he was talking about: he was working in point-of-sale  products for Triad Systems.  </P> <P> At the time he wrote his plan, most of the advanced point-of-sale systems  offered by IBM, NCR and others were targeting very large operations such as  department stores that were likely to have 100 or more cash registers per  location.  </P> <P> Smaller stores and chains were being neglected, Imperiale said, because it was  easier for the manufacturers to sell and service the larger accounts. And not  many small businesses could afford the cost of the IBM and NCR systems, which  made economic sense only if the cost could be spread out among dozens of  "points of sale," or cash registers.  </P> <P> After Triad declined to take up his idea, Imperiale resigned and started out on  his own. He soon took on as his partner Alan Grant, a retired San Jose venture  capitalist living in Coronado and a former national director of the American  Electronics Assn. Grant helped Imperiale navigate the rough financial waters  that all start-up companies encounter.  </P> <P> Imperiale's company set out to develop a product geared to retailers with less  than 10 cash registers per store, and costing half what IBM was charging per  register. SalePoint's system would also use operating software that permitted  store managers to use the computers for a variety of purposes. A drawback of  IBM's proprietary software used in its large-store systems was that it was good  only for the point-of-sale system, Imperiale said.  </P> <P> The product SalePoint introduced in 1988 was good enough that IBM accepted the  company as an "industry remarketer" of its products, a tacit admission that  SalePoint could serve a computer market that Big Blue couldn't, IBM's Beverly  de Luise said Monday.  </P> <P> "IBM depends on its industry remarketers to help us get into niches that IBM  does not have solutions for," said De Luise, a Raleigh, N.C.-based marketing  representative who has responsibility for store systems products. "Theme parks  are a good example. SalePoint has sold IBM hardware into Universal Studios. We  use them as marketing arms and legs for us."  </P> <P> Despite contractual terms that prohibit SalePoint from selling its software  with other brands of point-of-sale hardware, Imperiale said his relationship  with IBM has worked well. The main advantage has been the sales leads that it  receives from IBM salespeople, who receive the same commissions from a  SalePoint deal that they would from selling the systems themselves.  </P> <P> The industry term industry remarketer has come to replace value-added reseller,  or VAR, as a description for a company that buys computer hardware, then adds  its own software, hardware or technical expertise before reselling the package  to the end user, Imperiale said. There are an estimated 8,000 such companies in  the country, according to International Data Corp., a market research firm  based in Framingham, Mass.  </P> <P> SalePoint's five-year, $5-million deal signed last June to supply point-of-sale  systems to Williams-Sonoma, a San Francisco-based retailer of specialty  cookware items, was "a real feather in their cap," said Thomas H. Friedman,  publisher of Retail Systems Alert, a Newton, Mass.-based industry newsletter  that reports on retail automation trends.  </P> <P> "There are companies that are bigger than SalePoint, wealthier than SalePoint,  with more technical resources than SalePoint, but there are few companies with  the tenacity of SalePoint," Friedman said.  </P></p>

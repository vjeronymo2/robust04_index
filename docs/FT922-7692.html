			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Summer Festivals: Jazzing it up in unlikely places / Chasing the blues around the country From the Bude to the Isle of Bute, Summer brings out jazz festivals the length and breadth of the country. Some of the best are held in the most unlikely places. Grimsby, for example, has its South Bank Festival (July 3-5, Tel. 0472 342422) which is held in a 'marquee complex' and this year features Phil Woods among scores of others. Crawley's civic Hawth Centre will be the venue for the often avant-garde Outside-In Festival (September 5-6, Tel. 0293 553636). Featured projects here include The Dedication Orchestra and Mike Westbrook's Orchestra. The major events are in the last throes of programming and are as follows: Glasgow International July 2-11 (041) 552 3552 Carla Bley is composer in residence and the Festival organisers have commissioned a new work from her for an orchestra which features Steve Swallow. Other features of a tremendous programme are a reunited Miles Davis Quintet with Wallace Roney depping for the great man; the Paul Motian Trio; Elvin Jones' Jazz Machine and the McCoy Tyner Big Band. Birmingham International July 3-12 (021) 454 7020 The eighth annual Brum event, headliners include the unpredictable soulfulness of Nina Simone and witty Mose Allison. The rest is a curious but engaging mix ranging from the Ted Heath to the Budapest Ragtime Orchestras. Edinburgh International August 7-15 (031) 557 1642 A big one getting bigger, the Edinburgh International now has a full weekend of blues, special venues for 'world music' and is preceded by the McEwan's 80/- Free Jazz Trail (August 3-7). The main events, which are held in the Usher Hall and Queen's Hall, include Pat Metheny (see also Brecon); Bob Wilber, Kenny Davern and Oliver Jones; Dick Hyman and Jay McShann in concert. A Blue Note showcase is sponsored by Technics. Brecon August 14-16 (0874) 625557 Easily the most convivial of the UK's many jazz happenings, Jazz Aberhonddu is also one of the best programmed. This year's headliners include super guitarist Pat Metheny with drummer Roy Haynes and bassist Dave Holland. Trumpeter Clark Terry leads an all star small group and the hugely talented French pianist Michel Petrucciani puts in an appearance. The town's hotels, bars and fields teem with music all weekend and 'stroller' passes are a good bet. Book early. Bude 29 August - 5 September (0288) 356360/(0684) 566956 Most of the many minor jazz festivals happening in the UK are trad-oriented, but Bude is the main event for lovers of Dixieland, New Orleans and good old fashioned stomping music. Wear a silly hat and bring a pewter tankard. Edinburgh TDK Round Midnight 31 Aug - 4 Sept (031) 557 4446 Between them, Glasgow and Edinburgh host an indecent amount of top class jazz. In the last week of the Edinburgh festival, TDK sponsors the Bob Berg/Mike Stern Band, George Shearing with Carol Kidd, and Nana Vasconcelos JAZZ OVERSEAS JVC Jazz Festival New York 19-27 June 212 787 2020 From Carnegie Hall to Waterloo Village, NJ, George Wein's NY fest is a nostalgic, star-studded affair. For his 75th birthday party (health permitting), Dizzy Gillespie will be joined by Wynton Marsalis, Freddie Hubbard and Jackie McLean; Lionel Hampton celebrates 65 years in jazz and the MJQ, 40 years in the business; Gerry Mulligan leads a tentet. Tributes for those no longer with us include Leonard Feather's concert for Stan Getz, Arturo Sandoval remembering Clifford Brown and Illinois Jacquet saluting trumpeter Buck Clayton. TV star Bill Cosby hosts an evening dedicated to John Coltrane. 13th Festival Django Reinhardt June 26-28 1 64 24 64 82 Samois sur Seine, near Fontainebleu, was home to the great Manouche guitarist in his last years and the festival which commemorates his music was once attended only by gypsies. The gypsy guitarists still bring their caravans to the site, which is on the Ile du Berceau in the Seine, for a programme which is almost entirely French. Montreux Jazz Festival July 3-18 21 963 8282/7474 Less a pure jazz festival these days and more a celebration of musical tastefulness, the lakeside casino hosts C &amp; W (Emmylou Harris), pop (Simply Red), blues (Eric Clapton), soul (Gladys Knight), and rock (Ringo Starr's All-Starr band). There is some jazz, however, and the best nights are July 15 (Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter &amp; Co) and July 16 (The Brecker Brothers with Mike Stern and Dave Weckl plus, on the same night, Jimmy Smith and Jimmy McGriff). North Sea Jazz Festival, The Hague July 10-12 70 354 29 58 'One thousand musicians playing continuously and simultaneously on 13 stages,' is the frightening promise made by the North Sea Jazz organisers. The gargantuan programme includes: female vocalists Roberta Flack, Betty Carter, Dianne Reeves and Celia Cruz; the big bands of Lionel Hampton, Illinois Jacquet, McCoy Tyner and Cab Calloway; Gerry Mulligan's Tentet; An 'organ explosion' which includes Jimmy Smith, Jimmy McGriff and the Lester Bowie Organ Ensemble; An Afro-Cuban, salsa and Brazilian section which includes Tito Puente; a fusion bill with Chick Corea, Grover Washington, Brecker Brothers and Spyro Gyra. La Grande Parade du Jazz, Nice July 11-21 1 46 21 08 37 A rich mix of mainstream and blue sounds is available at the Nice festival this year with Lionel Hampton, Fats Domino, BB King and The Wynton Marsalis Septet topping the bill. An African flavour is added with the appearance of Youssou N'Dour, Mory Kante and Salif Keita (who appears with the Weather Report pianist, Joe Zawinul's Syndicate).</p>

			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Opposition calls Lebanon strike LEBANON'S Christian opposition called yesterday for a three-day strike next week to protest against the Syrian military presence during the first general elections in 20 years, Reuter reports from Beirut. The opposition, which has called for an election boycott, urged Lebanese to observe the strike as of August 21. Voting in north and east Lebanon is set for August 23. The opposition said its strike call was 'a first step on the way to opposing the imposition of the parliamentary elections.' The Syrian-backed government of President Elias Hrawi wants to hold the polls before Syrian troops withdraw from Beirut and surrounding areas.</p>

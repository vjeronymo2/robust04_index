			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Gardening: Plant of the Week Trillium grandiflorum This plant is a native of thin woodland in eastern and central north America where it grows in rather moist, peaty, naturally-acid soil. The white flowers turn purplish with age and are distinctively three-petalled, the petals broad and overlapping, the flowers two to three inches across. They are carried on sturdy 18 to 24 inch stems in April and May. In gardens in Britain they are quite hardy, suitable for any moderately shady place that is not alkaline and does not dry out readily. The tubers should be planted in September or October, three to four inches deep, and left undisturbed for years to establish themselves as colonies by self-regeneration.</p>

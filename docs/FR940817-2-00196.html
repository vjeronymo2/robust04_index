Fisher-Price recently advised the agency that it is now taking the position that it has not determined that its child safety seats failed to comply with the flammability requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 213. Under the agency's regulations, a manufacturer may not seek an exemption from the recall requirements in the absence of such a determination. Therefore, this proceeding is hereby terminated, and the public meeting is hereby cancelled. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Chris Flanigan, Office of Rulemaking, NHTSA (202&hyph;366&hyph;4918). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  On March 11, 1993, a contractor for NHTSA's Office of Vehicle Safety Compliance (OVSC) tested certain child safety seats manufactured by Fisher-Price to ascertain whether those seats complied with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 213, ``Child Restraint Systems.'' The results of those tests indicated that the seats failed the flammability requirements of that standard, which are incorporated by reference from FMVSS No. 302, ``Flammability of Interior Materials,'' in that the shoulder belt webbing of the seats burned at a rate above the limit established by the standard. Upon receipt of the test results, OVSC opened a noncompliance investigation, NCI 3270. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although Fisher-Price initially resisted OVSC's suggestion that the company should make a formal determination that the seats failed to comply, on September 16, 1993, Fisher-Price, submitted a letter, pursuant to 49 CFR Part 573, ``Defect and Noncompliance Reports,'' notifying the agency that it had ``become aware of information suggesting that the molded shoulder belt webbing on its Model AO9191, DO9101, 9103, 9149, 9173, 9179, and 9180 car seats may not comply with the requirements of FMVSS 302.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Concurrently, Fisher-Price filed a petition asking NHTSA for ``an exemption from the notification and remedy requirements *&blank;*&blank;* based on an inconsequential noncompliance with the requirements *&blank;*&blank;* as related to motor vehicle safety.'' This petition was filed pursuant to former section 157 of the Act (now 49 U.S.C. 30118(d) and 30120(h)) and 49 CFR Part 556, ``Exemption for Inconsequential Defect or Noncompliance.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 49 CFR 556.4(a), inconsequentiality petitions may only be filed by a manufacturer following a determination that a vehicle or item of equipment produced by the manufacturer contains a defect or fails to comply with an applicable FMVSS. In its September 16, 1993 letter, Fisher-Price stated that ``[i]n order to comply with the requirements of 49 CFR 556.4(b)(6) [sic] that a report in accordance with 49 CFR Part 573 be submitted with its Petition for exemption,'' it was providing the information required by Part 573. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the circumstances, including the fact that the results of the compliance tests conducted both by OVSC and by Fisher-Price clearly indicated that the seats in question did not satisfy the flammability requirements of the standard, NHTSA interpreted Fisher-Price's statement as a notification of the company's noncompliance determination. Therefore, the agency accepted the inconsequentiality petition for processing. It published a notice that the petition had been filed on November 9, 1993 (58 FR 59511), and denied the petition on March 22, 1994. Notice of the denial was published on May 5, 1994 (59 FR 23253). On May 6, Fisher-Price appealed the denial and asked for a public meeting. Notice of the appeal was published on June 16, 1994 (59 FR 30957), and the public meeting requested by the company was scheduled for August 17, 1994 (59 FR 39015). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Upon reviewing the documents that Fisher-Price submitted with its appeal, NHTSA noted that Fisher-Price seemed to be taking the position that its child safety seats did not fail to comply with FMVSS No. 213. Therefore, the agency requested Fisher-Price to clarify whether it had in fact made a noncompliance determination. On August 10, 1994, Fisher-Price advised NHTSA that it would not concede that its seats failed to comply with the standard and that its September 16, 1993 letter should not be construed as a determination of noncompliance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because 49 CFR 556.4(a) precludes consideration of Fisher-Price's petition for an inconsequentiality exemption in the absence of such a determination, NHTSA is terminating this proceeding (Docket 93-79) and is cancelling the public meeting scheduled for August 17, 1994. The agency plans to take further action with respect to the noncompliance investigation in the near future. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  49 U.S.C. 30118, 30120; delegations of authority at 49 CFR 1.50(a) and 49 CFR 501.8. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued on: August 12, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Barry Felrice, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Associate Administrator for Rulemaking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;20231 Filed 8&hyph;12&hyph;94; 4:59 pm] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;59&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

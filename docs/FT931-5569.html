			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lambeth setback for Labour LABOUR was defeated in a by-election for Lambeth council last night, the first since reports emerged of allegations of corruption in the south London borough. Liberal Democrat Mr Ray Woolford won a seat in Angell Ward, Brixton. The area was the only one in the borough to have consistently returned Labour since council reorganisation in 1964. Labour now has 27 council seats to 19 Tories, seven Liberal Democrats and 10 former Labour members suspended by the party. One seat is vacant.</p>

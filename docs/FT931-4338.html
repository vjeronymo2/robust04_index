			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Sorry example in the far-flung banking empire - Bombay scandal raises questions about control A LITTLE piece of British understatement appeared yesterday in Standard Chartered's review of what has forced it to set aside Pounds 272m against its involvement in the Bombay securities market scandal. It referred to 'the challenging environment' in which it was trying to retrieve its exposure of Pounds 343m. This environment is the atmosphere of hostility among Indian politicians to overseas banks such as Standard Chartered. The bank's earlier belief that its cause would be aided by Indian politicians and bank regulators was severely dented in the second half of 1992. Incidents such as the resignation in November of Mr G Ramaswamy, the attorney general, calls by politicians for the operations of foreign banks to be curtailed, and this week's highly critical report from the Reserve Bank of India, the country's central bank, have all taken their toll. Although the bank's exposure is only calculated to have risen by Pounds 51m because of exchange rate movement, it boosted general provisions by Pounds 160m in the second half. Thus the bank has in effect admitted that its earlier bet that it would receive sympathy and help from authorities is now off. It should arguably have come as little surprise, given the scale of the uproar when the scandal broke nearly a year ago. Alongside the other longest-established foreign bank in the country - the ANZ-owned Grindlays - Standard was a natural target for street demonstrators. Political pressure in India has not abated. The Reserve Bank of India has itself been under attack for inadequate regulation of the securities market. Its own investigations have thrown the responsibility onto foreign banks, and away from the Indian state-owned banks caught in the affair. Standard was not one of the most aggressive foreign banks in the market for bankers' receipts, though its losses are the biggest. The market, driven mainly by Citibank, grew at a feverish pace alongside Bombay's booming stock market during 1991. But Standard's large network and early identification with the scandal have made it a ready target. The bank emphasised yesterday that it had not written the money off, but had just recognised that recovery was uncertain and could take time. 'The fact that we are providing does not mean that we have given up. We are quite tenacious in pursuing money due to us,' said Mr Malcolm Williamson, chief executive. But Bombay raises a wider question about controls at Standard, which Mr Williamson describes as 'pear-shaped' because of the weight of its assets in the Asia Pacific. The incident has proved such a shock that it has been reviewing its central control over other operations since then. The bank has used auditors to check controls in markets in which there has been recent deregulation. Among the operations it has scanned for possible weakness have been Shenzen, the free market trading zone in southern China, and its Treasury operations in countries such as Indonesia. In practice, the only part of its operation it identified as operating laxly was its credit card business in Malaysia where staff had been not been setting accounts limits for well-regarded locals. It has changed this practice, although it calculates its total exposure at only Pounds 5m. 'We have made sure there are no latent Indias,' said Mr Williamson. Yet some doubts remain, given the bank's history. Until the arrival of Mr Rodney Galpin, the chairman who retires in May, operations in different countries had been largely free of central or regional controls. Apart from the review of operational controls, it has also established central limits on lending in particular sectors within which businesses have to operate. Yet it still relies on local management knowledge to assess risks that can vary widely according to the country and region. The biggest risk question hangs over operations in the Asia Pacific and Hong Kong, which produced Pounds 315m in operating profits last year, plus a further Pounds 67m through release of bad debt provisions. The total assets in the region grew to Pounds 14bn from Pounds 11.3bn through exchange movements and expansion. Mr Williamson emphasised that the bank has be re-balancing its portfolio there to reduce risk from long-term lending. The longest-term form of lending is its mortgage book in Hong Kong, which it believes is well-covered because it has lent only up to 60 per cent of current property values. Barring further surprises like Bombay, Standard's profits look set for steady increases as Asia Pacific operations grow and a restoration of UK profits reduces tax charges. But India remains a sorry example of how badly things can go wrong in the far-flung banking empire that Standard remains.</p>

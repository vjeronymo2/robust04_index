			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Bo Andersson report: "Swedish UN Troops Criticize Defense </F> Department"]    [Text] Fifteen officers in the Swedish UN battalion in  Macedonia [The Fomer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]  have written a joint letter to their Defense Ministry (UD)  complaining about its inadequate personnel policy. The Swedish  UN troops say that they have been given no information whatever  about the possibility of the battalion moving to Bosnia.    "After all, it is people who are involved here, not a flock  of sheep that can be moved around here and there without being  informed or consulted," the officers write.    Even Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas was criticized by  the Swedish UN command. She was on a tour of the former  Yugoslavia last week when Sweden was asked by the United Nations  whether the troops in Macedonia could be deployed to reinforce  the troops stationed in Bosnia.    The day after being informed about the inquiry, Mrs. af  Ugglas inspected that very battalion in Macedonia. According to  the officers, she did not utter a single word about the  sensitive political discussions which were going on between  Sweden and the United Nations. "The foreign minister touched on  the matter with the battalion's commanders. She said that it  was not her business to pass any information to the soldiers,"  Staffan Bjork at the UD's press office said. The officers who  wrote the protest letter belong to the battalion of Swedish  riflemen in Macedonia. They were informed by family members in  Sweden that they might be moving to Bosnia.    The defense staff is responsible for providing the Swedish  UN  forces with operational information. The press chief there,  Bertil Tennert, is aware of the officers' criticisms and claims  to understand the climate of uncertainty in which the soldiers  are living: "We had thought of releasing the information, but  news leaked out very quickly in New York. We did not succeed in  getting our act together." Kjell Gothe, Defense Minister Anders  Bjorck's spokesman, gave roughly the same explanation on the  failure to provide information.</p>

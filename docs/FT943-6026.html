			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Splits follow an election defeat: Main Mexican opposition parties troubled Divisions have emerged within Mexico's two main opposition parties, following their heavy defeat in the presidential election of August 21. Both the leftist and centre-right opposition have blamed unfair electoral conditions - the ruling party's massive spending in the campaign and its favourable television coverage - as the key reason for defeat. But both opposition parties are internally divided on the best way to push for fairer future elections, and how far they should co-operate, if at all, with the administration of Mr Ernesto Zedillo of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), due to take office in early-December. The leftist Party of Democratic Revolution (PRD) - which came third with 17.1 per cent of the vote - is increasingly split between a radical faction, which supports challenging the election results through civic protests, and a moderate wing which believes that the party should move to the centre, and focus on presenting evidence of fraud to electoral tribunals. Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the party's presidential candidate, appears caught between the two wings. He has denounced the election as fraudulent - even though most observers believe reported irregularities did not affect the result. Yet he has called on his supporters to avoid the sort of mass mobilisations that have given the party a reputation for extremism. Also, Mr Cardenas, who has so far held the party's two tendencies together, has said he will not run for office again. Hence his ability to unify the party's various factions may diminish. The leaders of the centre-right National Action Party (PAN) have implicitly accepted the victory of Mr Zedillo and the PRI. However, under pressure from many of their supporters, the leaders have stepped up attacks on the fairness of the Mexican political system and questioned the legitimacy, if not the legality, of the result. On Tuesday, the PAN called for new laws to govern the conduct of political parties and to separate the PRI from the government. The PAN's divisions are less profound than those of the PRD, in part because the former won a greater proportion of the vote than ever before. The party won 119 of the 500 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, 48 more than the PRD, and will have 24 seats in the expanded Senate. For many, the results are a vindication of the PAN's strategy of maintaining good relations with the government. Even so, the PAN's failure to win much more than a quarter of the national vote has led to criticisms of close co-operation with the government in recent years, and its acceptance of electoral conditions that favour the PRI. Some even wonder whether Mr Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, the party's presidential candidate last month, had done a deal with the PRI to lose the election. The PAN has been particularly hurt by heavy losses in the three states which it governs - Baja California, Guanajuato and Chihuahua. The PAN had hoped that these local strongholds would act as a springboard for national victory. The PAN's best showing was in states firmly controlled by the PRI - Jalisco, Nuevo Leon and Sonora, indicating that much of its support is based on a protest vote. Mr Vicente Fox, the PAN leader from Guanajuato, last week attacked Mr Fernandez for having accepted the PRI victory and having described the electoral process as clean. Such internal criticisms have led to a notable hardening in statements by Mr Fernandez over recent days. In an outspoken television interview on Sunday night, he sharply criticised the extravagant campaign spending of Mr Zedillo and the favourable coverage the latter had received on television. The PAN leader withheld a full endorsement of Mr Zedillo's victory, describing it as an illegitimate triumph.</p>

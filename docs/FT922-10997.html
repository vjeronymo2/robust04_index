			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Brighton cable TV opens today NYNEX, the New York and New England telephone company, will today open its second cable television franchise in the UK - the south of England franchise of Brighton and Hove. Under its first franchise, the company has made cable available to 26,000 homes in Portsmouth and 5,200 of those are now subscribers. Mr Nicholas Mearing-Smith, executive group director of Nynex Network Services in the UK, said the company expected this year to take cable networks past 30,000 homes and to spend Pounds 60m. The large US telephone company wholly owns nine cable television franchise operations covering 1.2m homes and is building integrated networks offering both cable television and telephone services. 'We're serious and we're here for the long term,' Mr Mearing-Smith said. He believes that offering competitive telephone services to those of BT is rapidly emerging as the most important part of the cable business. The official opening of the Brighton franchise at Hove - the franchise covers 160,000 homes - is a symbol of the progress being made by cable television. Mr Jon Davey, director of cable at the Independent Television Commission, believes that Pounds 450m will be invested in UK cable networks this year to add to the Pounds 1bn already committed to the industry. At the beginning of this year, cable television was potentially available to 1.34m homes and 269,000 actually subscribed. For the first time, the average subscription level passed the 20 per cent mark. Mr Davey expects cable to be available to 2.2m homes by the end of this year as network construction continues. From a small base, there has also been a rapid growth in the number of telephone lines sold by cable companies. At the beginning of last year there were just over 2,000 lines in the UK. Now there are more than 30,000. Although the industry has been dominated by north American interests, Mr Davey believes there is an opportunity for UK investors to get involved.</p>

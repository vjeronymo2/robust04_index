			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Brown calls for interest rate cut BRITAIN SHOULD cut its interest rates in line with the reduction in the cost of borrowing in Germany, Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's Treasury spokesman, said last night. Speaking after the Treasury and Bank of England refused to follow the Bundesbank's decision to cut Germany's discount rate, Mr Brown signalled a fresh attempt by Labour to set the pace at Westminster in debate on the economy. He attacked Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, saying: 'For weeks we have had much talk from the new Chancellor but little in the way of action,' Mr Brown said. He also said that next week's meeting in Japan of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations should address the need for co-ordinated world-wide action to boost growth and employment.</p>

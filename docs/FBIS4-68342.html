			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Letters to and replies from President Yeltsin under the </F> heading "From the President's Mail"]    [Text]    Dear President of Russia:    I am the wife of Captain 1st Rank A.G. Ushakov, commander of  the nuclear submarine cruiser Kasatka.    You visited this nuclear cruiser, dear Mr. President, in  Severodvinsk in April 1992, and presented my husband with the  personal watch of the first president of Russia for achievements  in utilization of new technology; my husband was also presented  with a video film of your visit to the nuclear submarine, in  which my husband accompanies you. This is a tremendous treasure  and souvenir for our entire family: parents, children, future  grandchildren and great-grandchildren. We will remain grateful  to you for the rest of our lives, and I have always been proud  of my husband--for he was the one to be granted the honor of  playing host to the first president of Russia.    Forgive me for taking time, dear Boris Nikolayevich, from  your state affairs, but I am compelled to appeal to you  personally, since for three years already my husband has been  unable to resolve the problem of continuing his military  career--meaning our life as well--through the proper channels.    Here is the substance of the matter. My husband--the  commander of submarine cruiser Kasatka, Captain 1st Rank  Aleksandr Grigoryevich Ushakov, is 42 years old; of these, he  has served 25 years in the Russian Armed Forces. He graduated  with honors from the Imeni Leninskogo Komsomola Higher Navy  School; has been given government awards; has served all his  conscious life on nuclear submarines in the Northern and Pacific  Fleets; is the only submarine commander in Russia who has  received an award personally from the president; has glowing  character references for the next career transfer from Rear  Admiral Salnikov, commander of the Belomorsk Navy Base, and Rear  Admiral Motsak, chief of staff of the Northern Fleet nuclear  submarine group. My husband's submarine also was personally  inspected by the Pacific Fleet commander, Admiral Gurinov, and  this inspection resulted in an article-review in the fleet  newspaper, which I enclose. For 1993, my husband received a  commendation from the Pacific Fleet submarine group commander,  Vice Admiral Komaritsyn.    For three years already my husband has been unable to get a  career transfer to a training center. The training center  commander, Rear Admiral Yamkov, has all the aforementioned  references given to my husband by his immediate superiors, but  nevertheless does not want to resolve the matter in our favor.  As a civilian, I do not understand why. Especially considering  that we are not being given the reasons for the rejection. Who  then is worthy of teaching submariners? I think my husband has  earned this with his 25-year impeccable service to our  Fatherland.    Boris Nikolayevich! I apologize once again and appeal to you  as a godfather of our family. Not everyone in this life happens  to come upon such happiness and trust. Please help us, and I  will pray to God for you, Boris Nikolayevich, for the rest of my  life.    I would like to hope for a positive and quick resolution of  our problem.    With my deep respect for you,    [Signed] Nadezhda Vasilyevna Ushakova    Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy    8 February 1994    Dear Nadezhda Vasilyevna:    Your letter unwittingly reminded me of the time I spent in  the city of Severodvinsk, and the unforgettable meeting with our  Navy personnel, including your husband. They are courageous,  brave people of great fortitude! They have been and will provide  steadfast support of our Fatherland. It is our duty to do  everything possible so that their daily difficult, demanding  service always receives the proper appreciation of the state,  whose borders they protect.    Now about your request. There are certain procedures for  transfers and promotions in the Army and Navy. Since we are  building a law-based state, no one has the right to violate  these procedures. Including the president of Russia. Therefore I  advise your husband to once again petition the appropriate  competent organs on the subject of a transfer to Obninsk to  continue his service there. I hope you will understand me  properly.    [Signed] B. Yeltsin    Boris Nikolayevich, when you come home from work and sit  down  with your family, please read these lines.    On 29 January we, a group of elderly women who survived the  blockade, decided to gather for a home party. We baked pirozhki,  made salads, and quickly had the table filled. We remembered the  war, the blockade, cried a little, sang wartime sings. Life is  not all that bad here--you see, we found enough food and many  kind words, and most importantly, we still have hope and are  waiting for better life.    On 27 January I was at a concert in October Hall. I came  back  very impressed, wrote these lines and read them to my blockade  comrades. They told me to send them to you, with the hope that  you will read them. I was at the concert in October Hall the day  the president visited our city. First he visited Piskarevskoye  cemetery, and in the evening came to October Hall. He sat in the  stalls. During the intermission he left, and everyone who stood  by the aisle tried to tell him something. When he approached  them, I decided to shake his hand and said a few words, too: "We  believe in you, Boris Nikolayevich, so protect our Russian  people, just as we defended and held against the enemy our home  city of Leningrad during the grim days of the blockade." As I  was saying these words I had a vision: There was a fairytale  mighty warrior standing there, I reached out, and he shook my  hand. And in this handshake I felt the mighty force, and the  pure, Russian soul. You carry such a burden, our people's  president! So many dark clouds have gathered over your head! So  rise to your full height, straighten your shoulders, and blow  with your mighty force, disperse these clouds and open the way  to warm, life-giving sunlight for us. Squeeze in your mighty  fist all the darkness--and with such force that when you open  your fist there would be only purity left there, and hope, and  faith in the light and happiness. Maybe not for us, but at least  for our children--open a clear, light road for them.    I am a native Leningrader, I lived through the blockade, and  I have worked for 45 years; I now am raising my granddaughter,  instilling in her all the goodness, honesty, and love for people  and the motherland.    I am sending you my poem:    WAR    It knocked on our doors, Not even knocked but broke in,  Broke  in as an uninvited guest, Bringing all the horrors with it. It  was then when I saw through a child's eyes All the horrors of  war, And hunger, and exploding shells, And I heard the cry Of my  own land, Pleading: Do not let, my people, Do not let the  fascists trample me. And the people rose then And defended you,  our land. So let us honor those Who are now buried in it And  those who lived.    [Signed] Vera Ivanovna Amelina, St. Petersburg    Dear Vera Ivanovna:    I sincerely thank you for the letter filled with your noble  feelings for Russia, its leadership, and the policy it conducts.    Your heartfelt letter is especially touching because it is  written by a woman who survived the blockade and the horrors of  wartime hardship. They are eloquent confirmation of the fact  that the course of socioeconomic reforms being implemented in  the country finds support among broad population strata, despite  the temporary difficulties many Russians are encountering. This  support lets us look to the future with optimism, and prompts us  to double, triple the efforts of rebuilding society in the name  of the well-being of the Fatherland and all its citizens.    I wish you and all your loved one health and success, dear  Vera Ivanovna.    [Signed] B. Yeltsin    To President of the Russian Federation B.N. Yeltsin.    Dear Boris Nikolayevich:    Almost two months have passed since the day of the elections  to the Federal Assembly and adoption of the Constitution of the  Russian Federation--enough time to have conducted a deep  analysis and drawn correct conclusions from this extraordinary  event.    In this letter, addressed personally to you, I want to touch  on just one issue, which in my opinion is of great importance  both for the past and future elections, which are not too far  away; we have to start preparing for them now, today, or maybe  we should have begun yesterday.    What I have in mind is a voters committee, without which no  elections are possible; both the practical experience and your  high praise of the fruitful activities of the Volgograd Voters  Committee last year tell us this.    The Volgograd Voters Committee, whose goal was to assist  citizens in carrying out their constitutional right to  participate in the management of state and public affairs  through an effective democratic electoral mechanism, was  officially registered in November 1992, although its practical  work in our city and oblast began much earlier.    Over this time the voters committee has accomplished a lot  in  forming a high political culture of voters, as called for by the  modern democratic process in our country; it coordinated the  work of its component groups and units and integrated their  activities with the activities of other public organizations and  structures; monitored compliance with the Law on Elections,  observance of electoral procedures and suppression of their  violations; developed recommendations for an improvement of  electoral system on the basis of analysis of public opinion;  conducted information and propaganda events which facilitated  the realization of voters' rights; and increased the numbers and  political activism of voters.    In addition, the Volgograd Voters Committee conducted a  broad  propaganda campaign in labor collectives and at voters' places  of residence aimed at bringing them into socially useful  political activities; in helping labor collectives, public  organizations, and citizens to conduct the entire range of  election campaigning, it actively used in its activities  information and propaganda flyers and posters, methodological  materials, and created its own mass media--and quite effective  at that.    It should also be noted that the Volgograd Voters Committee  supported in every way the voters' initiative aimed at improving  the electoral system; helped ensure voters' direct influence on  the direction and nature of activities of elected bodies, and  promoted glasnost in the work of electoral commissions, making  public the relevant administrative instructions and statutes on  election matters; fought to ensure equal opportunities in the  conduct of the electoral campaign for all candidates to elected  bodies of authority, and observance of legal and ethical norms  of political competition; and ensured public control over  setting the necessary organizational conditions for voters to  recall and re-elect elected representatives.    Over the time of its operation the Volgograd Voters  Committee  became an authoritative organization, to which residents of  Volgograd and the oblast turned with all sorts of questions:  legal, social, economic, political, ecological, pedagogical,  cultural, and so on; it was especially true during the election  campaign, when it was arranged to have someone on duty at all  times, including on weekends.    The reasons people came to us varied: questions,  consultations, complaints, concerns, petitions, requests for  concrete practical assistance, and so on.    There were also different categories of people who turned to  the voters committee. Employed and unemployed, housewives,  pensioners, farmers, Cossacks, and single mothers--especially  those who had been abandoned by their husbands, leaving the  children without alimony.    Unwed mothers at least get some help from the state; women,  however, who have been legally married and then abandoned by  irresponsible husbands do not get any assistance for their  children either from the state or from the former husbands,  since it is practically impossible to extract alimony from them.  There are a great many such women, and they ask you to issue a  special edict on protection of their rights and the rights of  their children.    Unfortunately, too few young people came to the voters  committee. Now it is clear why young people were so unwilling to  participate in the election campaign. We have many political  parties, and all of them first and foremost want power, while no  one works seriously with the youth, or takes their interests  into account. This is a very sad but real fact.    In the past each residential building in the city was  assigned to an agitator from some or other organization; now  this is longer the case, and voters sometimes do not know who to  vote for, where to vote, how to vote, and even when to vote. All  this, and many other things, negatively affect the course, and  especially the results, of elections.    All this and a lot of other work could be done by a  permanently functioning voters committee with a staff of several  people.    There is no money, however, in the city and oblast to  support  such a committee, and nobody wants to try to find any. The  Volgograd Voters Committee is not functioning now for one and  only one reason: There is no money.    Both state and public organizations in the city do not deny  the importance of the voters committee, but nobody will  undertake financial support of it; as a result, the voters  suffer.    In the past, when we had soviets, sometimes people could get  help there from the commissions for protection of citizens'  rights. Now there are no soviets and no commissions either. As  they say, they threw the baby out with the bath water. Some time  in the future analogous commissions will undoubtedly emerge in  the dumas, but so far they have not, and the voters committee  could be of great help to the people during this important and  difficult period.    Based on the above, I ask you to take personal part in  aiding  the Volgograd Voters Committee, and perhaps also voters  committees in other regions in Russia--first and foremost those  that have already shown themselves well during the recent  elections to the central and local bodies of authority.    The issue at hand is maintenance of just several staff  persons; it is not a great expense, and it pays off many times  over; you know this very well, since last year you personally  congratulated the Volgograd Voters Committee on its successful  work in the conduct of the election campaign.    If you now provide the needed help to our voters committee,  it will certainly do everything to make the upcoming elections a  success; the future fate of Russia is predicated on this, the  fate of its long-suffering people, who expect from you more  changes toward a better life.    [Signed] Labor Veteran B. Orlov    Volgograd    Dear B.S. Orlov:    I value very highly the work of the Volgograd Voters  Committee, which you described in your letter. I see the  creation and functioning of such independent public  organizations both as a form of manifestation of true democracy  and as one of the methods of developing it, aimed at assisting  all citizens in the realization of their constitutional rights  and developing high political culture among the voters.    Unfortunately, the state is currently unable to financially  assist voters committees, which, along with Volgograd, exist in  other cities of Russia as well. The national leadership is  counting on their activities being carried out on a volunteer  basis, while the lack of material incentives is more than  compensated for by moral dividends--the knowledge that you are a  direct part of realization of a high goal: the restoration of  Great Russia.    I wish you success in this difficult endeavor.    [Signed] B. Yeltsin    To the President of the Russian Federation Boris  Nikolayevich  Yeltsin    Dear Boris Nikolayevich:    We, veterans of the Great Patriotic War, armed forces  veterans, and wartime labor veterans of St. Petersburg, are  writing to you with a very important request and some proposals.    Boris Nikolayevich, the people who bring this plea to you  have gone through severe trials in combat and battles for the  Motherland, the Fatherland, trials that have befallen  internationalist soldiers, and wartime labor veterans. The  people who bring this plea to you have gone through the harsh  school of serving in the military, former privates and  commanders of companies and battalions, regiments and divisions,  people who commanded corps and armies, military schools,  institutes, and academies, former heads of organizations,  production facilities, factories, and plants, former public  figures, and scientists--from a candidate of science to  academicians of the Russian Academy of Science.    This entire preamble serves the sole purpose, dear Boris  Nikolayevich, of letting you know that we are not unthinking  people; together with our country we have gone through trials  and tribulations--as have you--and we have one and same goal:  Through the modest efforts of those who still work, and by our  advice and proposals, to try to help the common cause of the  well-being of the Fatherland and to the extent possible make  easier the life of the older generation, first and foremost war  veterans. Bear with us; hear our voice--it is a cry from the  heart and soul; hear us out as the president, who is guaranteed  to remain in this position of authority until 1996; as the  supreme commander in chief; and simply as a human being.    Less than a year and a half remains until the historic  date--the 50-year anniversary of the Great Victory of the Soviet  people in the Patriotic War. We ask you, Boris Nikolayevich, to  issue an edict on preparations for this remarkable date no later  than the first half of 1994. And to take into consideration in  this edict our requests and proposals, namely:    1. To set up a committee (commission) for the preparation  and  direction of the celebration of the 50-year anniversary of the  Great Victory under the chairmanship of the minister of defense  or one of his deputies, and with the mandatory participation of  war veterans, armed forces veterans, and wartime labor veterans.  As well as local subcommissions (subcommittees) under the  leadership of military district commanders. All work should be  done on a volunteer basis without additional remuneration.    2. To have under the president and the chairman of the  Russian Federation Government and heads of administrations of  Russian Federation components representatives for war and armed  forces veterans' affairs. These representatives should not be  members of any party or bloc. It would be best to appoint them  from armed forces veterans.    The duties of representatives of war and armed forces  veterans' affairs should include:    --taking care of veterans' everyday problems and needs  locally;    --leading veteran organizations; organizing patriotic  upbringing of the young generation in schools, technical  schools, vocational schools, and institutes.    3. To instruct the minister of defense, military district  commanders, and military commissioners at the local level to  more actively and fruitfully care for war and armed forces  veterans.    4. Keeping in mind that increasingly fewer war veterans will  still be alive by the time of the 50-year Victory anniversary,  to assign the status of category II disability, with all  attendant benefits, to all participants  (precisely--participants, not persons equivalent in status) in  the war, who have been given awards for participation in combat  and battles.    5. To study the possibility of our state materially  rewarding  the remaining participants in the Great Patriotic War on the  occasion of the anniversary. Keeping in mind that there has  never been a war in the history of humanity comparable to this  one in the scale of cruelty on the aggressor side and the mass  heroism and uncompromising stance on our side. It was we who won  in this cruel battle--we Russians, who made a decisive  contribution to the victory in the entire World War II.    6. To canonize in a secular manner the great troop leader,  defender of the Fatherland Georgiy Konstantinovch Zhukov, whose  services to our Fatherland have been no lesser than those of our  great forebears: Aleksandr Nevskiy, Suvorov, Kutuzov, Bogdan  Khmelnitskiy, Ushakov, and Nakhimov, in whose honor the highest  orders have been established. To establish a "Zhukov Order" and  a "Zhukov Medal" and award it to all surviving war veterans in  our Fatherland, the CIS, and particularly distinguished World  War II veterans in the United States, England, and France,  regardless of rank and title.    We have no doubt that such a decision, Boris Nikolayevich,  will be truly appreciated not only by the peoples of Russia and  the CIS but also by the world community.    To erect monuments to G.K. Zhukov at Poklonnaya Mountain in  Moscow and at the sites of decisive battles: in St. Petersburg,  at Kursk Bulge (the site of the historic tank battle), and a  number of other places.    Dear Boris Nikolayevich, you approved this proposal of ours  during your visit to the former front line in the vicinity of  Leningrad, around Maryino village, on 27 January 1994, for which  we are sincerely grateful to you and hope that it will be  implemented in a timely manner.    With respect and hope, on behalf of veterans, we sign this  letter:    [Signed] Chairman of the Committee of the Leningrad  Organization of Brother War and Armed Forces Veterans, Hero of  the Soviet Union, Colonel General V.N. Kubarev    cochairmen of the Club of Aleksandr Nevskiy Order  Recipients, Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences N.A.  Moiseyenko and Artillery Major General, Doctor of Technical  Sciences V.M. Kislov    St. Petersburg    Dear Vasiliy Nikolayevich, Vasiliy Mironovich, and Nikolay  Andreyevich:    I thank you for your letter. Many of the wishes expressed in  it are within the mainstream of the policy conducted by the  national leadership and whose main directions were formulated in  the recent Message to the Federal Assembly of the Russian  Federation. The task now is to combine the efforts of the entire  society towards this in order to energetically overcome the  socioeconomic crisis and its negative consequences. In this work  we also count on the support and help of your heroic  generation--the generation that defended the independence of the  Fatherland.    I wish you health, happiness, and wellness, dear veterans.    [Signed] B. Yeltsin</p>

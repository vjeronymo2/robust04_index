			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSING OPERATOR IN BANKRUPTCY;  </P> <P> GOVERNMENT: SANTA MONICA-BASED FIRM'S FAILURE RAISES ISSUE OF WHO WILL TAKE  OVER ITS GOVERNMENT-SUBSIDIZED PROPERTIES, INCLUDING THREE IN THE L.A. AREA.  </P> <P> One of the nation's largest managers of government-subsidized housing has  declared bankruptcy and abandoned its projects, raising questions about who  will operate the properties, a top federal housing official said in Washington  Thursday.  </P> <P> The chairman of bankrupt Santa Monica-based Housing Resources Management, A.  Bruce Rozet, said he has other corporations willing to take over the projects.  But federal housing authorities must approve any transfer, and that has yet to  take place.  </P> <P> "It's not a positive message," Housing and Urban Development general counsel  Frank Keating said of the bankruptcy. "They in effect have tossed the keys out  the window and walked away."  </P> <P> Executives of Housing Resources Management filed for bankruptcy Oct. 18. On  that day, they also lost a bid to have an order overturned in which HUD, citing  irregularities in the management operation, had barred them from taking over  additional housing projects. The order is to remain in effect pending the  outcome of an investigation of various people associated with the firm.  </P> <P> Keating predicted that as a result of the bankruptcy, filed in Los Angeles,  there will be some "dislocation to tenants." He said other firms will be able  to manage the projects better than Housing Resources Management has. But there  will be "a period of time before that can be fully implemented."  </P> <P> "They have an absolute legal right to (file for bankruptcy)," Keating said.  "But it is disappointing to us that they don't intend to work with us to fix  the problems that they've created."  </P> <P> At the same time, Rozet is trying to sell another major portion of his business  to a New York firm, New Communities of America. In that part of his business,  he acts as general partner in limited partnerships that own low-income housing.  </P> <P> "We are essentially going out of the business of operating HUD properties,"  Rozet said.  </P> <P> He said he plans to continue consulting in the field.  </P> <P> Robert De Monte, regional director of HUD in San Francisco, said the housing  agency, which also has the authority to approve sales of property it  subsidizes, has yet to authorize the sale.  </P> <P> The fall of Housing Resources Management and the apparent sale of Rozet's  syndication business amounts to another dramatic aftershock of the scandals at  HUD.  </P> <P> Neither Rozet nor the firms were named by congressional committees that  investigated the troubled housing agency last year. But HUD Secretary Jack Kemp  singled out a Rozet-controlled project in Washington last year as an example of  how owners have allowed HUD-subsidized projects to deteriorate.  </P> <P> Rozet, a Democratic fund-raiser who has allied himself with such politicians as  Jesse Jackson, says Kemp singled him out in an effort to shift blame from  Republicans who allegedly used undue influence during the tenure of former HUD  Secretary Samuel R. Pierce.  </P> <P> In the late 1970s, Rozet pulled out of the housing business and transferred  many of his assets when he ran afoul of federal regulators. Later, in 1987,  Rozet's main company, Associated Financial Corp., had assets of $121 million,  and he was influential on Capitol Hill, serving as an expert on legislation  affecting low-income housing.  </P> <P> "HUD has made it impossible for us to carry out any kind of reasonable role to  maintain the properties, operate the properties or to assure their well-being,"  Rozet said in an interview Thursday.  </P> <P> As the battle between Kemp and Rozet progressed, some housing officials voiced  concerns that the agency might find itself forced to take over Housing  Resources Management's portfolio of 80 projects nationwide, something it is ill  equipped to do.  </P> <P> Rozet said he hopes to turn over his management operation to a firm based in  South Carolina that manages 55,000 units nationally.  </P> <P> "We have done what they in fact wanted us to do, which is to divest ourselves  of any interest and involvement in these properties," Rozet said.  </P> <P> Rozet said there will be no impact on the tenants -- "unless HUD creates the  disruption." But Keating said the housing agency has no desire to "trade one  nag for another nag."  </P> <P> At its height, Housing Resources Management had 700 employees and operated 100  housing projects with 20,000 individual apartments. The firm now has 14  projects in California, including three in the Los Angeles area. Earlier this  month, HUD seized one of its most troubled projects, the 300-unit Ujima Village  near South-Central Los Angeles.  </P> <P> In the bankruptcy, Housing Resources Management listed assets of $452,838 and  liabilities of $663,552. The company filed under Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy  code, which suggests that the operation is being dissolved.  </P></p>

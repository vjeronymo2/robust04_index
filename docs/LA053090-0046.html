			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DODGERS DIG HOLE DEEPER  </P> <P> Fernando Valenzuela threw three consecutive pitches at Andy Van Slyke's head. A  man charged the mound. Two Dodger relievers were beaten up.  </P> <P> Another brawl between those bosom buddies, the Dodgers and the Pittsburgh  Pirates?  </P> <P> No, it was just the Dodgers beating themselves again in a 9-5 loss to  Pittsburgh Tuesday night before 10,252 at Three Rivers Stadium.  </P> <P> Those hoping for another round of pushing and shoving, as promised by both  teams after Monday's incidents here, were disappointed. The Dodgers obviously  were not looking for a fight.  </P> <P> Valenzuela, hit for six runs in 4 1/3 innings, was throwing at Van Slyke's head  because he just couldn't get it over the plate. He walked six, the most of any  Dodger pitcher in one game this season.  </P> <P> "Van Slyke knows me, he knows I don't do that kind of thing," Valenzuela said  of their fifth-inning encounter, which resulted in a stream of boos from the  fans but just a shrug from Van Slyke. "Today, I have no idea what I was doing."  </P> <P> The man charging the mound was pitching coach Ron Perranoski, who removed  Valenzuela from the game with the Dodgers trailing, 6-0.  </P> <P> The beaten relievers, Mike Maddux and Pat Perry, were bruised only in the box  score. With them on the mound, the Pirates' six runs became nine runs. That was  unfortunate for the Dodgers, because in the meantime they pulled off a five-run  seventh inning that should have put them back in the game.  </P> <P> After Valenzuela and a brief appearance by Jim Gott, Maddux gave up a run on  two hits in the sixth inning to make it 7-0. The Dodgers closed the gap to 7-5.  Then Perry gave up two more runs to seal it for the Pirates, who lead the  National League East by three games. The Dodgers have followed their five-game  win streak with two consecutive losses here, and have fallen 8 1/2 games behind  the first-place Cincinnati Reds.  </P> <P> "In those situations, we have to hold them," Dodger Manger Tom Lasorda said,  referring to his middle relievers. "We still had a couple of at-bats to catch  them."  </P> <P> Perry, who gave up a run in the seventh and eighth innings, was the chief  offender for a second consecutive game. He allowed a run-scoring double by Don  Slaught in the seventh after a wild pitch, and a run-scoring fly ball by Gary  Redus in the eighth after Perry's wild throw on a pickoff play at second base.  </P> <P> In five appearances during his first week on the active roster after last  winter's shoulder surgery, Perry has an 9.00 earned-run average with two wild  pitches in five innings. That's one more wild pitch than Ramon Martinez has  thrown in 58 innings.  </P> <P> Is this another case of a rehabilitating Dodger pitcher who says a heavy  workload has been heaped upon him too quickly? Well, sort of.  </P> <P> "There is a little soreness in my shoulder," Perry said. "I have been tested as  much as anyone in the last week. . . . I've pitched five of eight days right  off the bat. . . . I have been tested a lot, but that's fine, I want to keep  pitching."  </P> <P> Valenzuela, who fell to 4-4 while his ERA rose to 4.09, offered different  reasons for his failings.  </P> <P> "I'm throwing, not pitching," Valenzuela said. "I just go to the mound and  throw the ball, I have no idea what is happening. I have to think out there. I  don't think, I'm in trouble."  </P> <P> While starters Mike Morgan, Tim Belcher and Martinez have been consistently  decent, and starter John Wetteland has been consistently poor, Valenzuela  remains the staff puzzle. He has won consecutive starts only once this season,  alternating tough performances with games like Tuesday's.  </P> <P> The big hits against him were a two-run double by Van Slyke in the second  inning, and a two-run single by former Dodger R.J. Reynolds in the fifth  inning.  </P> <P> But Valenzuela was nearly taken off the hook in the seventh, when Pirate  starter Bob Patterson, with a 5.58 ERA in 59 career games, finally tired. The  Dodgers managed six hits and batted through the order in that inning for the  seventh time this season. The big hits were a two-run pinch double by Mickey  Hatcher, and run-scoring pinch-single by Lenny Harris. It was Harris' first  pinch-hit in nine pinch at-bats this season.  </P> <P> The inning ended when Kal Daniels, one of the best selective hitters in the  league, watched three straight strikes on curveballs from reliever Scott  Ruskin, the final strike being far enough outside the plate to cause Daniels to  momentarily argue with home plate umpire Steve Rippley.  </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> Kirk Gibson increased his playing time in center field to seven innings Tuesday  for triple-A Albuquerque while showing that his legs are in shape enough to  steal third base. In seven innings against Edmonton in his fourth  rehabilitation game, he went one for three with an RBI and his first steal. He  is still adjusting to center field, as he made a three-base error. "He is  giving it a good test, and he is feeling good about it," said Pat Screnar,  Dodger therapist. "He was stiff and sore at first, but that has subsided."  Gibson's return to the Dodgers' active roster could be as soon as a week. . . .  The Dodgers and Pirates were given official warnings before Tuesday's game,  meaning automatic ejections with the first perceived brushback pitch. There  were no such pitches. . . . John Wetteland will be given another chance Friday,  as he has been told he will start against the Cincinnati Reds. . . . Third  baseman Jeff Hamilton said he could be throwing a baseball within a week,  despite continued shoulder pain because of tendinitis. . . . Before Tuesday's  game, the Pirates were still mad at the Dodgers because of Monday's beanball  incidents. Said Pirate Manager Jim Leyland: "I'm tired of the Dodgers being  made out to be the good guys all across the country. The Dodgers created the  problem, let them live with it. And I don't care who over there likes it."  Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda didn't like it. "Why do they keep bringing it up?"  he said. "As far as I'm concerned, it's dead. I've got no more comment."  </P></p>

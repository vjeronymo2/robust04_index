			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Japanese premier secures coalition backing Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, won the crucial support of a key coalition party early today allowing him to unveil official approval of Japan's plan to allow limited rice imports to help clinch a Gatt world trade deal, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Mr Hosokawa, after enduring weeks of hand-wringing and painful debate, announced the decision after a 3am cabinet meeting. The Social Democrats had looked deeply divided yesterday over whether to back Mr Hosokawa on rice or support outraged farmers who account for a big portion of the party's declining support. The party, the largest but most unstable in the alliance, could have brought down Mr Hosokawa's four-month-old government if it had decided to quit the coalition. Such a development would have certainly held up a final agreement on a new world trade pact at the 115-state Uruguay Round of talks, due to wind up in Geneva tomorrow. However, after marathon talks lasting nearly 12 hours, the party's top executive grudgingly agreed to leave the decision to chairman Mr Tomiichi Murayama, who said the Social Democrats must support the rice plan and stay within the coalition. 'We have had to accept that Hosokawa's decision (on rice) is right,' Mr Murayama told a meeting of Social Democrat leaders. 'Our party's responsibility to help stabilise the government is increasing,' he said as angry farmers protested in front of party headquarters in central Tokyo. The issue has traumatised the Social Democrats, who are increasingly dependent on the farm vote as urban voters desert the hardline party in droves. Mr Tsutomu Hata, the foreign minister, who returned to Tokyo early yesterday after a quick trip to Geneva to meet US and European trade officials, defended the decision as unavoidable. 'Everyone agreed that failure to conclude the Uruguay Round will hurt the global economy,' he said. Mr Hosokawa may have cleared one hurdle but more troubles lurk around the corner. The main opposition Liberal Democratic party had threatened to hold a key budget bill hostage if the prime minister gave in on the rice issue.</p>

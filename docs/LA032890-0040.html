			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> SLAP AT SEX IN VIENNA GENERATES LITTLE HEAT  </P> <P> In the course of the 10 scenes of Arthur Schnitzler's "La Ronde," we meet 10  couples from all strata of society. They seduce and submit to each other, and  then move on to other partners in a hollow dance of immediate gratification.  Schnitzler's reported aim was to castigate the Viennese society of his time  (1903) for its degradation of love from a spiritual passion to an animal  appetite.  </P> <P> At Cal State Fullerton, there is plenty of talk about sex and a good deal of  perfunctory disrobing, but no real sexual heat is generated. The characters are  reduced to an interchangeable collection of shallow hedonists.  </P> <P> Christine Mendivil does bring a notable maturity to her role as the Young Wife,  and a genuine sense of character. Her scene with Darrold Strubbe as the Husband  is the high point of the production. And Melinda Suzanne Riemer as the Maid  seemed to yearn for something more from the Soldier (Kevin Bossenmeyer) than a  roll in the grass. That yearning evaporated in the following scene, however,  when she flounced merrily into dalliance with the Young Man (Charles  Gallagher).  </P> <P> The rest of the production plays like a series of blackout skits revolving  around low-rent seduction jokes. The sex acts within each scene, so obscene and  objectionable to Schnitzler's contemporaries, are rendered here as loud,  suggestive noises and one or two comic outbursts in a blackout. A short  blackout. These Viennese are not only shallow, but speedy.  </P> <P> What they are not is dangerous. The evils that Schnitzler wrote to reprove seem  toothless here. In the age of AIDS, only the foolhardy would indulge their sex  drives so recklessly. But woe betide us if we can watch these characters lust  and pose and lie, and envy them the simplicity of their empty lives.  </P> <P> The set, by Todd Muffatti and Rahnee Chung, is handsome, with graceful lines  and serviceable double turntables. The flats are textured with squiggles and  patterns that look like patches of crushed velvet, flocked wallpaper, tassels  and tapestries mired in a gray mud. There's a hint of grandeur hidden and  besmirched. It doesn't help, though, that the scene-change music, featuring an  accordion and guitar arrangement perfect for a gondola ride, is not at all  evocative of turn-of-the-century Vienna.  </P> <P> 'LA RONDE'  </P> <P> A Cal State Fullerton production of the play by Arthur Schnitzler, translated  by Leon Gilbert.

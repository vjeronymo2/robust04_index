			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (25): Edging towards a place in the top 500 - Already the Czech republic has two companies ripe for inclusion among Europe's giants. Meanwhile, mass privatisation should take off in Poland this year / Country Analyses - Eastern Europe A combination of privatisation on an unprecedented scale and the stock market surges which spread from Warsaw to Prague and Budapest in the second half of last year has brought to the fore a growing number of private central European companies ripe for inclusion in the FT500. Already the Czech republic boasts two companies whose market capitalisation at the end of the year exceeded that of the Dollars 921m recorded by the Finnish company at the bottom of the FT500. What is more, the Dollars 2.7bn capitalisation of CEZ, the electrical utility company which heads the Czech list, equals the total year-end market capitalisation of the 22 stocks quoted on the Warsaw stock exchange. Total Polish capitalisation reached Dollars 2.7bn after a hectic year in which Polish-quoted share prices rose on average by 700 per cent. Both Prague and Warsaw outclassed the Budapest stock exchange where the market capitalisation of the 28 quoted shares ended the year at Dollars 820m after a late rally which boosted the Budapest index by 50 per cent over the last few weeks but still left shares languishing in real terms below their values of two years ago. Pre-war Czechoslovakia boasted one of the most developed industrial economies in the world. It lost competitiveness and was diverted into inappropriate energy and raw material consuming heavy industry under Soviet domination. But the innate strengths of the Czech economy and the underlying resources of a skilled labour force are once again coming to the surface under the single-mindedly pro-market and pro-privatisation policies of the government led by Mr Vaclav Klaus. The Czechs pioneered mass privatisation, with more than 1,300 enterprises privatised in the first round of privatisation through vouchers and over 800 enterprises about to be privatised under the second round. More than 70 per cent of the 8m Czech citizens who paid around Dollars 30 for vouchers permitting them to buy shares in the 1,300 companies with a book value vastly in excess of the vouchers, deposited them with the private investment funds which sprang up to manage the deluge of new shares and new shareholders. In effect most voucher holders have become shareholders in the funds who actually manage the shares, buying and selling on and off the stock exchange and building up controlling packets of shares where possible. A glance at the top six shares quoted on the Prague stock exchange is instructive. After CEZ comes Ceska Sporitelna, the Czech savings bank, capitalised at Dollars 1.06bn, which is followed by the biggest commercial bank, Komercni Banka at Dollars 900m. The Czech banks are all in the throes of bad-debt write-offs and capital re-financing to fit them for their future role as financiers of the emerging small and medium private business sector. The two biggest quoted companies after CEZ and the banks are both majority-controlled by foreign investors. Tabak, the former state tobacco monopoly bought by Philip Morris, is capitalised at Dollars 695m while Cokoladovny, controlled by Nestle, pitches in at Dollars 648m. Way behind in sixth place comes the country's largest engineering group, Skoda Pilzen, which is capitalised at Dollars 320m. Skoda Automobilovna, the motor car company which is the largest and probably best known Czech company, is in the throes of becoming controlled 70 per cent by Volkswagen, with the state retaining the remaining shares, so it is not a quoted company. The relatively slow, case by case, privatisation approach decided on by the Hungarian authorities, with the emphasis on trade sales to foreign investors, has paid off to the extent that Hungary has attracted the bulk of the more than Dollars 5.5bn invested in central and eastern Europe over the past three years. But the reluctance to embrace mass privatisation is reflected in the relative smallness of the Budapest stock exchange with only 28 shares quoted, of which the most sought after are those of Fotex, the photographic and luxury goods company. Last year, turnover in shares at 18.26bn forints was only 10 per cent of total stock exchange turnover which was dominated by trading in government bonds and treasury bills. In Poland the biggest company by market capitalisation is Wedel, the chocolatemaker now controlled by Pepsico as part of its ambitious foray, in competition with Coca Cola, into the biggest market of the region. Poland has 39m people compared to just over 10m each in Hungary and the Czech republic, 5m in Slovakia and under 2m in Slovenia whose own fledgling stock exchange is tipped to come alive in 1994 as the well-run economy picks up. Wedel, capitalised at Dollars 304m as of end-September, is followed on the Warsaw stock exchange, housed in the former offices of the Communist party central committee building, by Elektrim, the former state power and telecommunications equipment trading company at Dollars 214m. Fast expanding Elektrim is among several quoted companies planning to tap the market this year by raising fresh equity, in Elektrim's case by partially floating off several of its subsidiary companies. Mass privatisation should take off in Poland this year as the new left of centre government carries on the previous government's plan to privatise up to 500 state-controlled enterprises and create 20-30 so-called 'National Investment Funds' with foreign and Polish managers to perform the vital functions of modernising, slimming down, restructuring and eventually re-financing their companies. This process is expected to greatly expand the stock exchange listings over the rest of this decade. The new government is so keen to raise revenue by successful privatisation that it appears unlikely to impose new taxes on capital gains or tax share transactions as demanded by some of its more orthodox left-wing supporters. The recent successful stock market debut of the first two privatised banks, the Wielkopolski and Slaski banks, has already expanded the number of shareholders in Poland to more than 200,000, and last year's boom has whetted the appetite of many more potential investors in a country where real incomes, and savings, are rising after 4 per cent GDP growth last year.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOP 10 POLISH COMPANIES BY MARKET CAPITALISATION*  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  1.

			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Personal View: Signs that united Germany is working This year's German elections are the first true test of the political aspirations of unified Germany. The euphoria that followed the fall of the Berlin Wall is long gone. So too are the transitional arrangements that allowed the two halves of the new Germany to vote as separate districts in the 1990 elections. In the four years since those elections, I have been to east Germany several times. I have heard the stories of colleagues dismissed from universities, 'wound up', as local usage has it. I have heard of careers ruined, people thrown out of their homes, and apparently flourishing state enterprises sold to west German companies which shut them down. In such soil, conspiracy theories grow. From such people, votes come for the Party of Democratic Socialism, the successor to East Germany's Communist party. What I should to say to my east German friends is that, in spite of everything, unification works. Erfurt in September 1994 looks better than Erfurt in July 1993. People are better dressed. The shops are fuller. Five years after the Berlin Wall came down, polls show that the majority of east Germans consider themselves winners as a result of the change. Unified Germany transfers each year about DM150bn (Pounds 61bn) from west to east. No wonder they feel good. Currency reform has also worked. I talked to one of the economists who advised the Bundesbank on the rate of exchange between the two German currencies on unification. Experts at the time decided that it should be one D-Mark for 2.5 Ostmarks. Chancellor Helmut Kohl ignored them. He heard the footsteps of 40,000 people leaving east Germany each week. When the crowd said, 'if the D-Mark won't come to us, we'll go to the D-Mark', Kohl gave them the D-Mark. I asked the economist: 'Who was right, the Bundesbank or Kohl?' He hesitated and then said: 'Kohl.' There was no time to fiddle with exceptions and regulations, still less to guess the unintended consequences. Among the beneficiaries of currency conversion, along with pensioners, were the organs of the east German state, whose huge, largely concealed cash balances suddenly turned into hard currency. By one of those ironies that make history such fun, Kohl became the benefactor of the PDS, the party which might bring his chancellorship to an end if it succeeds in winning seats in the new Bundestag. I am here with a group of foreign academics, guests of the German Academic Exchange Service. I have had a chance to travel widely. What I see is not change, but continuity. In the five years since the Leipzig demonstrations of October 1989, the old Federal Republic of Germany has absorbed five new federal states relatively painlessly. The constitutional lawyer Hartmut Jackl points out that the German Basic Law, its constitution provisionally adopted in 1949, has scarcely been altered by unification and the federal structure not at all. Since 1949, Germany has had coalition governments at federal level and on most state levels. Coalitions move to the centre and move slowly, if at all. German voters like that. Since 1949, no electoral swing has ever exceeded 5 per cent. If the liberal Free Democratic party fails to get 5 per cent of the vote in next Sunday's election, it will not enter the new Bundestag. Since that would amount to change of much more than 5 per cent, it is not going to happen. It does not matter that the FDP failed to get 5 per cent in the last seven state elections. Enough German voters understand their political system to ignore state results. Yesterday the Allensbach Institute announced that 57 per cent of those intending to give their second vote to the FDP will have cast their first vote for Chancellor Kohl's Christian Democratic Union. These German voters know what they want and how to get it. The German state of 1994 is no longer provisional. The federal republic had 40 years of success before 1989. The last five years have brought more. Lady Thatcher and President Francois Mitterrand were wrong about a united Germany. It is more, not less, stable than the pre-existing states. The symbol of that stability is the massive bulk of Helmut Kohl, 'Bismarck in a baggy sweater'. Bismarck united the old Germany with the sword; Kohl with the vote. That's the real difference between the old and the new Germany. The author is reader in Modern European History at Trinity Hall, Cambridge</p>

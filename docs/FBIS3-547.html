			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Zanele Vutela] </F>   [Text] The notorious CCB [Civil Cooperation  Bureau]--allegedly disbanded two years ago--is very much alive  and has established a criminal empire in Zimbabwe, it was  reported this week. The weekly FINANCIAL GAZETTE, an  independent newspaper in Harare, reports that the Zimbabwean  business community has been extensively infiltrated by about 600  criminals linked to the CCB.    The paper said that a crime syndicate, also linked to the  Blue-Light Gang, was responsible for the exportation from SA  [South Africa] to Zimbabwe of more than 600 stolen vehicles.  The proceeds of the sales of the cars are believed to have been  used to buy drugs which were then sold to finance the SADF's  [South African Defense Force] covert military intelligence  operations.    SA military intelligence was responsible for setting up the  CCB. According to the paper the SA criminal syndicate was  uncovered by the Zimbabwean security in early 1992. In June  1993 Kaarman Noortman, whose aliases include Malcolm Anthony  Cheney and Jack Cheney and who was allegedly wanted at the time  by the SAP [South African Police], was arrested. It quotes SA  records revealing that Noortman was a member of the stolen  vehicle division at John Vorster square until 1985, and that in  1993 he was wanted by the division for car theft and fraud. In  July of the same year Noortman was handed over to SA immigration  officials at Beit Bridge but according to the GAZETTE was  "inexplicably let loose".    Intelligence sources also link Noortman to Frederick Alex  Harding, regarded as the Blue Light Gang's Godfather and the  CCB's operational chief in Zimbabwe until he was arrested and  deported two years ago. It said that Harding, 50, was  interviewed by the ANC [African National Congress] last year  shortly after he had allegedly admitted that he had been  recruited by a SA government agency to carry out dirty tricks in  neighbouring countries.    Harding is also alleged to have admitted that he had headed  a  car and drug-trafficking ring in the 1980s whose task was to  procure funds for military intelligence-linked operations.    SAP Media Liaison officer Colonel B.S.I. Van Rooyen  confirmed  to CITY PRESS that Noortman was an SAP member, and was  re-arrested shortly after being freed at Beit Bridge.    Although Zimbabwean sources suspect Noortman of being in  Harare, Major Van Rooyen told CITY PRESS that Noortman was  currently awaiting trial at the Pretoria Central Prison.</p>

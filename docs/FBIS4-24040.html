			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Kenya Government yesterday dismissed as  "trash" reports by the British press that up to 10,000 people  have been killed in the Turkana region of Kenya by raiding  parties from the Toposa and Pokot tribes.    A report by the DAILY TELEGRAPH says that the future for the  Turkana people is under threat from the raids and that the  Turkana have been forced to flee into the central deserts "where  their cattle die of starvation, leaving the fugitives with no  choice but to turn to the government for relief".    However, when the permanent secretary in charge of internal  security, Mr. Wilfred Kimalat, was contacted for comment, he  said: "Why write such trash? There is nothing like that."    Quoting correspondent George Monbiot, the DAILY TELEGRAPH  said: "in the north, the Sudanese Government has armed the  Toposa tribe with submachine guns and rocket launchers, hoping  they will fight the Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA)."    And, in the south, writes Mr. Monbiot: "The Kenya Government  has supplied automatic rifles to the Pokot people, to cleanse  their lands of tribes opposed to the administration."

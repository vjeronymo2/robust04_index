The document states that the Tiraspol  government does not intend to hinder the participation of the  Dniester inhabitants in the elections, but they will be able to  do that "solely on the territory of the Republic of Moldova."  International observers are invited to make sure that elections  will not be held in the Dniester Republic. Previously, Tiraspol  leaders tried to dam elections in Moldova's eastern regions, by  introducing the emergency state and visa regime for entering the  Dniester Republic.</p>

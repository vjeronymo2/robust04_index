			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Japan likely to cut interest rates from 2.5% low THE JAPANESE central bank is expected to cut its main lending rate by at least half a percentage point today, in the latest attempt to pull the economy out of recession. The cut in the official discount rate, from the already record low of 2.5 per cent which has held for the past eight months, was predicted yesterday by NHK public television, a normally reliable forecaster of official rate changes. Bank of Japan officials refused to comment. But a senior government official said he would not be surprised if the long-expected rate cut happened today, assuming the central bank followed its usual line of timing rate changes for maximum psychological impact. Domestic and international pressure for a cut in interest rates has been rising in line with a stream of gloomy economic indicators. Gross national product fell an annualised 2 per cent in the three months to June and is probably declining in the current quarter, so putting Japan into recession. If the central bank does move as expected, this should relieve some of the disappointment that met a government pump-priming package of deregulation, measures to pass on the benefits of the high yen to consumers and Y6,150bn (Pounds 38bn) of public spending announced last week. It included neither a rate cut nor reductions in income tax, as demanded by Japanese industry. Possible tax cuts, a politically divisive issue, are being studied by a government panel. A senior International Monetary Fund official welcomed the package but said recent economic data were so disappointing that more budgetary and monetary action could well be needed. A 'strong cocktail' of fiscal and monetary stimulus should be considered, he said. The US has also urged Japan to make income tax cuts, say Japanese officials. Yet the Bank of Japan has been cautious about cutting rates partly because it wants to avoid repeating the liquidity-fed rise in asset prices that preceded the downturn and partly because it believes industry needs to cut more capacity. Nevertheless, the bank cut the official discount rate three times in 1991, twice last year and once last February, from 3.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent. A rate cut is like to have a psychological impact and help restrain the yen's rise, but will not bring a marked cut in companies' borrowing costs, said analysts. If the discount rate does come down today, commercial banks are expected to drop their prime rates on October 1, in line with previous practice. However, a decreasing number of banks maintain a tight link between prime and actual lending rates because of the pressure on margins from the need for heavy bad debt provisions. Emiko Terazono adds: Japan's residential and commercial land prices have declined for a second consecutive year, the longest fall on record. According to a land price survey released by the National Land Agency, residential land prices fell by an average 3.6 per cent as of July 1 from a year before, while commercial areas saw a 7.7 per cent decline. The survey, which started in 1975, is likely to prompt an early lifting of the government's 'land price monitoring system', aimed to curb price increases in designated areas. An easing of the monitoring system was included in the coalition government's emergency economic package announced last Thursday. While land prices, especially in cities, remain high relative to income levels for the ordinary Japanese, a further fall could hurt the country's banks, which hold land as collateral for bad loans. Residential land in the Tokyo area declined 12.3 per cent after a 12.7 per cent fall last year. Tokyo's central 23 wards saw drops of 20 per cent, with Chuo ward, the business centre, registering a 37.9 per cent decline. Meanwhile confidence among Japanese consumers declined sharply in August, says Dentsu, the world's largest advertising and marketing agency. According to a survey, the higher yen, cold summer weather, and increasing reports of corporate restructurings have depressed consumers' outlook on the economy. Last month 37.4 per cent of those surveyed thought the economy would worsen, a sharp jump from 21.8 per cent in July and 21.1 per cent in June. Over 54 per cent said they would curb spending against 43.2 per cent in July. See feature, Page 19</p>

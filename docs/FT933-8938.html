			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Yen at new post-war highs THE attention of foreign exchange dealers moved away from Europe to Asia yesterday, as the Japanese yen enjoyed a remarkable rally against the dollar in Wednesday's Asian trading, writes James Blitz. The main trigger for this surge was the news that Japan's trade surplus in July had widened from Dollars 9.23bn a year ago to Dollars 11.82bn. Trade with the US swelled to an unadjusted Dollars 4.68bn surplus from Dollars 3.81bn in the previous month. The news pushed the yen from Y104.50 late on Tuesday to a post-war low of Y103.50 on Wednesday afternoon in Europe. The currency later closed in London at Y103.70. Repeated rounds of intervention from the Bank of Japan and other central banks failed to stem the tide. Dealers said that the main impetus behind yesterday's move was from US investment funds and Japanese exporters. But Mr Marc Hendricks, an economist at Swiss Banking Corporation in London, said that the trade surplus figures were not just a news item, but an underlying cause of the yen's strength. 'Japanese companies are repatriating their profits and refusing to re-invest in Europe because of their long-term balance sheet problems,' he said. 'That is the source of the yen's strength.' Inside the European exchange rate mechanism, the main focus was on France's decision to cut its overnight rate of lending for the second time this week, this time by  1/2 a percentage point to 9.25 per cent. The move at first led to a slight depreciation of the franc, but later the currency recovered strongly against the D-Mark to close at FFr3.511 from a previous FFr3.521. That appreciation was partly due to the Bundesbank's decision to add liquidity to its domestic money markets, keeping the cost of overnight funds low. However, the German move was insufficient to stop heavy selling of the Austrian schilling especially in options and forward markets. The Austrian authorities have kept their currency in a very tight range against the D-Mark of about Sch7.01-Sch7.05. But yesterday, the currency traded as low as Sch7.0473. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, economics adviser at Bank of America in London, said that problems in the ERM were encouraging dealers to test the parities between Europe's traditionally close currencies. The Bundesbank's money market operations helped the dollar to gain a full pfennig against the D-Mark, to close at DM1.7180. Throughout most of yesterday's trading, sterling weakened as dealers suspected that European central banks were selling the currency to help boost reserves. However, the pound recovered at the end of European trading, supported by continuing strength of the UK's equity and gilt markets. The pound closed at DM2.5300, up  1/4 pfennig on the day.</p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / International Company News: Iberia to seek Pta120bn extra state funding IBERIA, the Spanish airline, is likely to make a loss in excess of Pta50bn (Dollars 498m) for 1991 and is seeking Pta120bn of extra funds from the government. The loss estimate compares with an earlier forecast of a Pta43m loss and losses of close to Pta14bn in 1990. The airline has been held in check by the Gulf war, escalating labour costs and a series of acquisitions in Latin America that Iberia views as key components in future realignments among European airlines. The request for state funds will be formally made next week by Iberia's board to the Instituto Nacional de Industria, INI, the public sector holding company which owns the airline. Sir Leon Brittan, the European Commission vice-president responsible for competition policies, is understood to have discussed Iberia's bid for a cash injection during talks in Madrid last week with members of the Spanish government. Iberia discounted press reports that the re-capitalisation plan could come under EC scrutiny and stressed it formed part of a five-year strategic programme to put Iberia on a sounder financial footing. The airline hopes to reduce its losses to Pta17.9bn this year and to return to some sort of profit in 1993. Iberia has begun to make its first staff cuts. It will shed 3,000 employees, 10 per cent of its labour force, this year through early retirements and voluntary redundancies. By 1996 Iberia will have increased its fleet from 132 aircraft in 1991 to 176. A key element in the strategic plan is the beachhead the company has established in Latin America where it controls Aerolineas Argentinas, Viasa, the Venezuelan carrier and Ladeco, a small airline in Chile. Iberia operates hubs in Buenos Aires and in Santo Domingo and it is scheduled to open one in Miami next week. The drive into central and South America will be used by the company as leverage in possible future negotiations to form alliances with other European carriers.</p>

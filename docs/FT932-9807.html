			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Observer: Trailing Birt Want to get to the top in the BBC? Take a compass bearing on Bob Phillis, the new deputy director-general. After little more than a month in the job, Phillis has set off for the Himalayas. It might seem a bit early to take a holiday, even by civil service standards. But that misses the point. He is following in the footsteps of his new master - John Birt - who travelled to Nepal to think great thoughts about the future of the Beeb before he became its DG. Phillis's official reason for his early pilgrimage is that he wants to visit son Ben who is teaching English there before going to university in the autumn. But cynical BBC types are wondering whether there is more to his mission than meets the eye. Could it be that the necessary induction process into the highest peaks of the BBC management is not complete without at least one visit to a Trappist monastery?</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Innocenzo Kabera, Rwandan </F> Patriotic Front spokesman in Italy, by Renato Caprile in  Brindisi; date not given: "Italy, Do Not Side With the French!"  -- first two paragraphs are LA REPUBBLICA introduction]    [Text] Rome -- "The French would do well to stay at home.  They could have stopped the massacre of our people by  exercising pressure on their murderer friends, but they did not  do so. So what do they want now? That we help them ease their  bad consciences? That is a bit too much. If they think they  can hoodwink us with a humanitarian aid charade, they are very  mistaken. If they set foot in Rwanda -- and last time they did  they stayed on for four years -- we will make them regret it  bitterly."    Speaking over the phone from Brindisi, Rwandan Patriotic  Front [RPF] spokesman Innocenzo Kabera did not even attempt to  use diplomatic tones. He went straight to the heart of the  matter. It was enough to whisper the word "French" to see him  blow his top.    [Caprile] Why, then, are you so hostile to France, Mr.  Kabera?    [Kabera] Because we cannot forget the fact that, if all that  is now left in our country is heaps of corpses, if thousands of  children have been wounded in their bodies and their minds, we  owe this precisely to the French. It was they who first  trained, and then armed and supported the government's troops,  the death squads. What are they coming for? To stop the  massacre? Too late, it already took place. In all the towns we  conquered, we found nothing but dead people. So, are they  coming to negotiate so that an agreement can be reached between  the parts? Come off it! What sort of credibility can  accomplices in genocide have in peace talks? Furthermore, whom  are they coming to negotiate with? Not with us, certainly.    [Caprile] So you do not want the French. What about  Italians, who over the past few days have been discussing  whether or not to send a blue helmet contingent to Rwanda?    [Kabera] I have been living in Italy for years. I can say I  know Italians well. I know that, from Lebanon to Somalia and  Mozambique -- wherever they went -- they worked well, but if  they should embark on a joint operation with the French, we will  have no choice: We will fight against what we consider  occupation forces in our country.    [Caprile] Yet Italy has already fully proven its good faith  through Mariapia Fanfani's two missions.    [Kabera] I repeat: We feel genuine friendship and gratitude  toward Italy. We may even trust Italians, but we will not if  they come led by the French.    [Caprile] So, are you not opposed, in principle, to 5,500 UN  blue helmets being sent?    [Kabera] Of course not. We cannot but agree with the UN  initiative, provided that it is strictly neutral. The UN  Security Council has voted a resolution to send troops capable  of ensuring protection for the civilians who are at risk. We  agree with this. But the French should not be part of the  mission. They are not neutral. For them, humanitarian aid is  just a facade. They only want to come to enable the butchers of  our people to save face, they do not want to come to help  suffering people, but only their friends, who are our enemies.    [Caprile] What does "help" mean in your view?    [Kabera] As everybody knows, this war flares up  periodically.  This means that if the government's army is not disarmed, you  can be sure that, within a year or two, it will begin again.  [Kabera ends]    As further proof that the Rwandan Patriotic Front rebels are  absolutely determined to prevent French blue helmets from being  sent to Rwanda, Kabera announced a great protest demonstration  to be held in Rome in the next few days. "We will take to the  streets," he explained, "to let people know about the crimes  committed by [French President] Mitterrand and company during  the genocide of our people."</p>

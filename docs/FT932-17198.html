			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (17): Dream in the balance - David Pilling reviews plans to exploit gas reserves NIGERIA can afford to squander its natural resources less than most countries. And yet, after two decades of dreams, little real progress has been made in the effort to exploit its huge reserves of natural gas through a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project. The Dollars 4.3bn scheme, which seemed finally to be nearing completion at the end of last year, has all but unravelled. Political interference, commercial rivalries and lack of coherent planning again threaten to scupper Nigeria's best hope for export diversification. The country has proven gas reserves of 2,600bn cu m; more than 11 times the combined annual consumption of the UK, Germany, Italy, France, Belgium and Spain . It has an additional 1,800bn cu m of probable reserves. These resources could earn billions of dollars of badly needed foreign currency. Nigeria's aim has always been to export its gas in the form of LNG, which is transported in tankers as a liquid before being 'regassified' in the country of sale. But ambitious plans for a Dollars 14bn, six-train (processing unit) plant to produce LNG came to nothing - after more than a decade of indecision. The project was subsequently revived as a more modest two-train plant. Progress was made in the late 1980s with the formation of Nigeria LNG (NLNG), a joint venture owned by NNPC (60 per cent), Shell Gas (20 per cent), Elf (10 per cent) and Agip (10 per cent). Shell was appointed technical adviser. Initial work was carried out at the proposed site for the liquefaction plant in Finima, Rivers state. Local people were relocated, and NLNG bought four ships to transport liquid gas. Everything seemed to be falling into place when long-term gas purchase agreements were signed with companies from Italy, Spain, France and the US. Lending agencies, including the International Finance Corporation, showed willingness to discuss project funding, and two consortia were asked to bid for the main contract, worth Dollars 2bn. However, last October the project was again thrown into confusion. Shell had assessed the bids, coming down in favour of the Kellogg/Technip (US/France) consortium, but then the Nigerian government stepped in to dissolve the NLNG board. The December 22 deadline for awarding the main contract slipped by with no finance package in place. Dissolution of the board by Mr Chu Okongwu, then the petroleum resources minister, was widely understood to signal government dissatisfaction with Shell's bid selection. Nigerian authorities had made little secret of support for the Bechtel/Chiyoda (US/Japan) consortium, which was seen as offering more prospect of employment for Nigerians and technological transfer. But critics argue the backroom wrangling had more to do with self interest and the pursuit of personal gain. Both consortia, they say, were capable of carrying out the contract. Once the selection had been made, differences should have been put aside and the contract awarded. Whatever the reason for dismissing the board, most analysts agree that the resulting uncertainty has thrown the entire project into doubt. Pessimists believe that blatant government interference in the contract award will be enough to put off international investors already wary of Nigeria's reputation. And it is not clear how long prospective buyers of Nigeria's LNG will be prepared to wait before seeking alternative suppliers. (Algeria, Norway and the former Soviet Union all have the potential to expand production. Venezuela and Quatar are known to be considering LNG projects of their own.) Gloom-mongers also suggest Shell's position as technical advisor and principal multinational backer has been dealt a serious blow. As one commentator says: 'Shell's credibility as technical adviser has been destroyed. If Shell got it wrong, then it should not have been appointed. But if it got it right, there is intolerable political interference.' Mr Ahmed Joda, the chairman of NLNG until the board was dismissed last October, concedes Nigeria was in danger of 'missing out on the LNG opportunity'. In common with many commentators, he believes this may be the last chance for a long-held dream. 'If we fail to do the LNG now, we may never do so in the foreseeable future, because of very prohibitive costs, increasing competition from other countries and the image of unreliability which we have cut with our joint venture partners and potential creditors.' None of the main parties involved in the project is prepared to say publicly where things now stand. One NLNG official described negotiations as 'too delicate to discuss openly at the moment.' Nor will anybody comment on rumours that the NLNG board wants to scrap long-held plans to use gas conversion technology developed by Technip and Italy's Snamprogetti. Privately, however, officials admit that the more common Air Products system is under 'serious consideration'. A decision to change technology at this stage would have serious implications for the bidding process. Aside from the prospect of further delays, adoption of the Air Products system would strongly favour the Bechtel consortium. Air Products would need some convincing before it reveals technical specifications to a consortium which included Technip, developer of a rival gas conversion system. Some people believe the project can still be salvaged. Nigeria, they argue, remains in as good a position as any country to supply the gas needed by Europe. But if Nigeria does not act quickly, its hopes for LNG may slip away.</p>

It also asks the Commission to  submit to it as soon as possible:    --the major outlines of its master plan on nuclear safety in  the East;    --a detailed analysis of the recent joint report by the  World  Bank, IEA [International Energy Agency] and EBRD [European Bank  for Reconstruction and Development] on the different alternative  scenarios concerning nuclear safety in a global energy context;    --an energy strategy for the East, environmentally  sustainable and based on the priority of massive and accelerated  development of energy efficiency in energy production, transport  and consumer sectors. In the framework of this strategic plan,  it asks the Commission that financial assistance in the  framework of the PHARE [Poland-Hungary: Actions for Economic  Reconversion] and TACIS [Technical Assistance to the  Commonwealth of Independent States] programmes places emphasis  on projects involving true partnership, parallel actions between  operators and safety authorities and on twinning between Eastern  and Western European power stations and safety organisations. In  negotiations with the countries concerned, the Commission has to  take account of the following objectives:    (a) commitment by countries to drawing up plans for shutting  down the most dangerous power plants (VVER-230 and RBMK);    (b) introducing a legislative framework for controlling  safety in each of the countries concerned with provisions which  conform to those adopted at Community level;    (c) defining global energy programmes;    (d) setting up independent safety authorities;    (e) adopting energy saving measures;    (f) gradually introducing a real price for energy.    EURATOM [European Atomic Energy Community] loans for nuclear  safety in the East remain blocked Commissioner Chistophersen not  having given Parliament the assurances it regarded as necessary  concerning the conditionality of aid, at the request of its  rapporteur, Parliament sent back to Committee a second report by  Mr. Herve concerning the capacitation of the Commission to  contract EURATOM loans to contribute to funding towards  improving the degree of the efficiency and safety of the nuclear  sector in countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the  Republics of the former USSR. During the debate, Mr.  Christophersen told Parliament that the European Commission  shared their objectives, but that there were differences in the  means of attaining these. In particular, he considered that  Parliament was going a little too far and that it was hardly  possible to require of the Eastern countries that they close  down their plants in order to obtain Community aid. As for the  proposal to create a task force responsible for these questions  within the European Commission, Mr. Christophersen considered  that the implementation of the PHARE and TACIS programmes had,  after some difficulties, found their cruising speed, and that it  was not essential to take further initiatives at organisational  level. The Commission intends acting in four fields:    --on-the-ground-support for modernization;    --analysis of construction safety of those plants which  already exist in the countries concerned;    --setting up independent controls;    --restructuring and storage.    As for the possibility of recourse to EURATOM loans, Mr.  Christophersen regretted that Parliament had on several  occasions postponed the debate on the subject, pointing out  that, to guarantee safety in Central and Eastern Europe and  former USSR comparable to that which exists in the West, it  would require at least ECU [European Currency Unit] 10 billion a  year (notably by mobilising international capital). The  co-president of the Green Group, Paul Lannoye was not satisfied  with Mr. Christophersen's replies on:    (a) the EURATOM Treaty and the recycling of irradiated  fuels:  the Treaty does not mention this at all, otherwise, tell me  which Article, Mr. Lannoye asked Mr. Christophersen, who  affirmed that this was a priority issue in the Treaty;    (b) the import by COCEMA [Comittee of European Manufacturers  of Plant for the Food Industry] of uranium from Russia: the  Commission, Mr. Christophersen recalled, has already approached  France. To Mr. Lannoye who pointed out that the problem was not  a recent one and that it had been going on for twenty years, Mr.  Christophersen replied that the Commission had sent France a  warning. In favour of uniform rules of safety in the Community,  Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union at the same time,  Parliament adopted a resolution on nuclear safety, submitted by  the Socialist Group, by which it considers that the rules to be  respected in the field of nuclear safety have to be harmonized  at Community level, as well as in Eastern Europe and the CIS, on  the basis of more rigorous safety.    It urges the political authorities of the countries of  Central and Eastern Europe and the CIS to commit themselves to  drawing up plans with a view to an immediate decommissioning of  the most dangerous nuclear power plants. It insists on the need  for these countries to look at other forms of energy, taking  account of environmental considerations. It calls on the Council  and Commission to ensure that Community aid does not encourage  the construction or renovation of nuclear sections in these  countries aimed at promoting export strategies of cheap  electricity, but produced to the detriment of safety rules of  countries in the European Union or EFTA [European Free Trade  Association]. It calls on the Commission and the Council to be  extremely vigilant and to ensure, on one hand, that the  Community and all the States concerned by the transport of  radioactive material are beyond such incidents, and, on the  other hand, that the means used for this kind of transport  fulfill the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] safety  standards. It calls on the Commission to find a solution to the  problem of storing radioactive waste, and to study, for each  Member State, the possibilities of long-term storage, and also  to analyse medium and long-term radiological effects on man and  the environment.</p>

If any, a referendum on the status  of the peninsula, in Kyrylov's view, will only be of a  consultative nature and there is no threat to the integrity of  Ukraine whatsoever.    According to that party's decisions and in order to deprive  the Crimean president of the executive functions of the head of  government, changes and amendments to the Law on the president  of the Crimea will be introduced if Yuriy Meshkov scores a  victory.</p>

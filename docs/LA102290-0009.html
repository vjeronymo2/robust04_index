			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> COLUMN LEFT;  </P> <P> IKE WAS ABSOLUTELY ON TARGET;  </P> <P> UNLESS WE REIN IN BLOATED MILITARY SPENDING, WE'LL DROWN IN RED INK.  </P> <P> This month marks the centennial of Dwight D. Eisenhower's birth and at this  moment in history, America sorely misses the courage and common sense of this  remarkable soldier and statesman: the supreme allied commander who led us to  victory in World War II, the U.S. President who called for a "total war upon  the brute forces of poverty" -- a war whose victory would bring the benefits of  better "roads and schools, hospitals and homes, food and health."  </P> <P> Today's softheaded hard-liners urge us to keep throwing money at the Pentagon's  attempts to snow the American people with slogans like "peace through  strength." Ike, the quintessential hard-headed soft-liner, taught us to value  strength through peace: "There is no way in which a country can satisfy the  craving for absolute security -- but it can bankrupt itself, morally and  economically, in attempting to reach that illusory goal through arms alone. The  military Establishment, not productive of itself, necessarily must feed on the  energy, productivity and brain power of the country, and if it takes too much,  our total strength declines."  </P> <P> Americans are at a point in our history that makes these words of wisdom  relevant. We are confronted by a fateful choice: Will our preeminent national  priorities be slanted toward the Pentagon or the people? To be specific, will  billions of dollars continue to be spent on nonsense, such as the so-called  Stealth bomber or the pie-in-the-sky fantasy called Star Wars? Shall we keep on  putting our money where our myths are, simply because of the political power of  the military-industrial complex that Eisenhower warned us about? The Pentagon's  wish list or the people's genuine needs?  </P> <P> As we consider and debate the profound implications of the question, we must  keep in mind this fact: During Ronald Reagan's first four years in office,  military spending doubled, reaching nearly $300 million a year. As David  Stockman, Reagan's director of management and budget, said at the time: "They  were squealing with delight" ("they" being the military-industrial complex).  </P> <P> When we add this scandalous figure to the military-related corruption of recent  years, it becomes evident that in the last nine years American taxpayers have  paid hundreds of billions of dollars more than necessary for any reasonable  definition of national security.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, Adm. William Crowe, recently retired chairman of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff, said, "The threat of a surprise attack on Western Europe is  gone." In a more general sense there is widespread acceptance of the fact that  the Cold War has finally ended. So when do we get a clear-cut national-security  scenario that reflects new realities rather than one that looks at the world  through a rear-view mirror?  </P> <P> In the 1980s, American adults behaved like children beguiled by a Pied Piper  named Reagan, who led us to assume that budget deficits do not matter. But now  we know that they do and that every dollar counts. Consistent with that  awareness, we must demand that our "leaders" justify spending many billions of  dollars on a bomber without a purpose, the B-2 Stealth (whose name implies, as  its only possible target, raids on our national Treasury).  </P> <P> We have been given no reasonable rationale for this astronomically priced  Edsel, no description of a mission that fits the new world around us. Although  beset by severe malfunctions and interminable delays, our government continues  to pour good money after bad. This, despite the added fact that cost overruns  remain concealed, as do the terms of the Air Force's contract with Northrop.  Talk about stealth!  </P> <P> Star Wars and Stealth bombers are but the tip of a gargantuan iceberg. The  totality drains the lifeblood out of our economic body politic.  </P> <P> Like all realistic Americans, I understand the importance of national security  and I support an adequate military component. The point here is to stress the  failure of our government to redefine national security in ways that reflect  new realities rather than old myths -- and to remind our fellow citizens that,  in the words of Dwight Eisenhower's January, 1960, farewell address: "We must  guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or  unsought, by the military-industrial complex."  </P></p>

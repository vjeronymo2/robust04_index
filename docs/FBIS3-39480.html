D'Alema this morning made a spontaneous appearance,  accompanied by his attorney Guido Calvi, before Public  Prosecutor Vittorio Mele, to give his version of the accusations  made by former Socialist Partly leader and ex-Premier Bettino  Craxi on alleged under-the-table contributions to the ex-Italian  Communist Party (PCI), now the PDS.    Craxi recently presented a dossier to the justice department  formally presenting his claims, already voiced on the floor of  parliament, which must now be investigated to ascertain whether  they are true or whether he should be indicted for slander.    The others Craxi claims were aware of the illicit  contributions included PDS secretary Achille Occhetto and PDS  administrative secretary Marcello Stefanini.    According to Craxi, the PCI and PDS received kickbacks for  the so-called "Red Cooperatives" after they were awarded public  contracts.</p>

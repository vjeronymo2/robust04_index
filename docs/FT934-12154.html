			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Charlotte wins Pounds 93m football franchise THE south-eastern states of the US, one of the fastest-growing regions in the country, scored another success on Tuesday night when the city of Charlotte, North Carolina, was awarded a franchise to run a new professional American football team. The owners of the 28 teams that make up the current National Football League unanimously chose Charlotte over four other cities: St Louis, Baltimore, Jacksonville and Memphis. The business group behind the Charlotte bid, led by restaurant owner and former footballer Mr Jerry Richardson, will pay Dollars 140m (Pounds 93m) to the NFL for the rights to own the team. This compares with the Dollars 16m Seattle and Tampa Bay paid when the NFL last expanded in 1976. The owners chose Charlotte because it offered an opportunity for the NFL to expand into new territory. The city is at the heart of the 'New South' - the states of the civil war confederacy now enjoying an economic renaissance. The new team will be called the Carolina Panthers, and will draw upon the support of 10m people who live within 100 miles of Charlotte. The NFL owners were impressed by the group's plans to build a privately financed Dollars 160m sports stadium in the city. More than Dollars 100m of the cost has already been raised through the sale of 50,000 permanent seating licences, which Carolinans bought in the hope of bringing professional football to their region. The cities which lost out in Tuesday's vote have another chance to join the NFL. The owners were due to choose two new franchises on Tuesday, but after their failure to agree on a second city they will try again on November 30. St Louis and Baltimore, which lost NFL franchises in the 1980s when the owners moved their teams to other cities, are favourites.</p>

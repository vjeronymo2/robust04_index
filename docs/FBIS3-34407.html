Giving some examples of the conspiracies hatched by global  arrogance in various dimensions this year, Mr. Fallahian said:  On the security dimension alone, during the current year  [ending 20 March 94] the mercenaries of foreign powers smuggled  about 24 bombs into the country. But thanks to the vigilance of  the hidden imam's unknown soldiers, 20 of these bombs were  discovered and 16 people were arrested. Unfortunately, four of  the said bombs exploded.    He added: During the current year, the country's security  and  intelligence organs have arrested about 40 spies, who have had  links with Iraq.    Referring to the important role played by the president to  advance the objectives of the Islamic revolution, the  intelligence minister said: When the main elements responsible  for the plot to assassinate the president were arrested it  became clear that they are individuals with notorious records,  low belief or no belief at all, low morals, and corrupt. Some  of them have were affiliated with mini-groups [reference to  opposition groups].    He went on: Among those arrested is an individual who has  had  links with some foreign embassies.</p>

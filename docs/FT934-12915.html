			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / China plans wide reforms of banking sector and taxation CHINA PLANS the most radical financial reforms in its post-revolution history with new tax arrangements and an extensive overhaul of the banking sector. Mr Li Lanqing, a vice-premier, said in a Financial Times interview that a Communist party central committee plenary session before the end of the year would approve a blueprint for further economic reforms. His remarks represent the most authoritative outline yet of the next phase of China's reform programme. The reforms would be carried out in six areas: banking, finance, taxation, investment, foreign trade, and enterprise management. These measures would build on the market-oriented reforms of the Chinese system introduced over the past 15 years, which have brought a growing tide of foreign investment into the country. The latest moves would complement those made earlier this year to restrain inflation and cool the economy through, for example, credit restrictions and interest rate increases. They would focus among other things on: Enhancing the regulatory and policy-making role of the People's Bank, China's central bank; Strengthening the archaic tax system, which the World Bank and other international institutions have been urging China to overhaul to increase revenues; Improving management of loss-making state enterprises, which are proving a huge drain on central government finances. The plans coincide with an intense debate within the leadership over the 16-point austerity package introduced in July to curb the overheating economy. Officials are urging a loosening of credit restrictions to cope with a crisis in the cash-starved state sector, where some enterprises have almost run out of money and are unable to pay workers. Mr Li said the authorities would make credit available to 'profitable' state enterprises, and for purchases of agricultural products. But 'strict control' would be maintained over money available for 'overheated areas' such as real estate development. He said that although the 1993 economic growth rate would match last year's 13 per cent, the austerity measures had brought inflation under control, reduced money supply growth and stabilised the exchange rate at a reasonable level. The vice-premier indicated that the centre-piece of new tax reforms would be the introduction of 'federal style' tax-sharing arrangements. The formula would divide tax revenues between the central government and the provinces, with a portion to be shared between the two. Under the present contract system, provinces are able to retain revenues beyond those they have 'contracted' to remit to Beijing. This has meant that wealthy coastal regions, such as Guangdong province in the south, have reaped a revenue windfall while the centre has been starved of funds, weakening its control. Mr Li said that as well as strengthening the regulatory authority of the People's Bank, the reforms would involve removal from the commercial banks of 'policy-lending' responsibilities such as financing big capital works projects. This task would instead be undertaken by new 'policy-lending' institutions. He indicated that the government planned to 'get tough' with loss-making state enterprises by continuing to give preference to profitable market-oriented institutions in the provision of credit. 'Enterprises should run their businesses independently, responsible for profits and losses, expansion and development.' Foreign trade reform would focus on fulfilling requirements for accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, said Mr Li, whose responsibilities include overseeing China's foreign trade.</p>

This announcement is related to all the priority areas of Healthy People 2000 as well as the 1985 Secretary's Task Force Report on Black and Minority Health. (For ordering a copy of ``Healthy People 2000'' or the ``Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Black and Minority Health,'' see the section  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Where to Obtain Additional Information <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Authority <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> This program is authorized under Sections 301 (42 U.S.C. 241) and 317(k)(2) (42 U.S.C. 247b(k)(2)) of the Public Health Service Act, as amended, and the President's Executive Order 12876 of 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Smoke-Free Workplace <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American people. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Eligible Applicants <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Eligible applicants are National Minority Organizations (NMOs) and/or Regional Minority Organizations (RMOs) which principally serve African-American populations. The African-American population is very diverse and more targeted strategies and activities are needed to reduce the growing health gap among this group. Consistent with the 1985 Secretary's Task Force Report on Black and Minority Health, excess mortality, morbidity and disability continues to disproportionately affect African-Americans. A more current update of that report documents continuing excess deaths specifically for African-Americans. Eligible applicants must submit documentation to demonstrate that they comply with the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Are an established tax-exempt organization (a nongovernmental, tax-exempt corporation or association whose net earnings in no part lawfully accrue to the benefit of private shareholders or individuals). The following is acceptable evidence of tax-exempt status: (i) A reference to the applicant's organization in the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) most recent list of tax-exempt organizations described in Section 501(c)(3) of the IRS code; or (ii) a copy of a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Have a governing body or board that is composed of more than 50% racial or ethnic minority group members who are representative of the population to be served. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Have a minimum of 12 months documented experience in operating and centrally administering a coordinated public health or related program serving racial or ethnic minority populations within a major portion or region (multistate or multiterritory) of the United States through its own offices, organizational affiliates, or the participation of other minority organizations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Have a specific charge from the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws or a resolution from its governing body or board to operate nationally or regionally (multistate or multiterritory) within the United States and its Territories. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because the Court did not grant Krupp's request for a 7.76 percent liquidation rate, but rather instructed the Department to conduct an administrative review, the Petitioner asserts that Krupp's actions have simply been an attempt to manipulate the outcome of the administrative review process. The Petitioner concludes that if the Department were to apply the 7.76 percent rate as BIA in these final results, the respondent would in effect be rewarded for its lack of cooperation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Because Krupp failed to respond to our most recent questionnaire and destroyed its business documents, thus precluding conduct of an administrative review and verification of the written information already on the record, we agree with the Petitioner that use of a less adverse rate as BIA in the instant review would be inappropriate. In  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Anhydrous Sodium Metasilicate From France; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 53 FR 4195 (February 12, 1988), we stated that to use the information that the respondent suggests as BIA ``would, in effect, reward the respondent for this failure to provide an adequate response'' in the review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Final Results of Review <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the Department's analysis of the comments received, the final results of our review are unchanged from the preliminary results. We determined that a 27 percent margin exists for Krupp. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department will instruct the U.S. Customs Service to assess antidumping duties on all entries of this merchandise made by Krupp during the period December 17, 1982 through June 23, 1983. The Department will issue appraisement instructions directly to the Customs Service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On August 11, 1986, the Department published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (51 FR 28739) a notice of revocation of the antidumping duty order, effective March 1, 1986. This administrative review covering the period December 17, 1982 through June 23, 1983, does not affect the revocation of the antidumping duty order. Therefore, we will instruct the Customs Service to continue to liquidate all entries of this merchandise exported on or after March 1, 1986, without regard to antidumping duties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 353.22. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: May 21, 1992. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Francis J.

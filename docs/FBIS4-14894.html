			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Regular weekly interview with Georgian State Council </F> Chairman Eduard Shevardnadze by Nato Oniani in Tbilisi on 4  April -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Passage indistinct] [Oniani] Tbilisi subway  engine drivers were on strike and returned to work yesterday.  The railway was also on strike. What do you think this is? Is  this a result of their social conditions, I mean a social mutiny  certain circles have been threatening us with? Or is this an  action planned in accordance with certain political forces'  desire to come to power?    [Shevardnadze] I think both. I am not going to elaborate on  this. I simply want to express my attitude. I am thankful to  the railway personnel, whom I have always relied on, and the  personnel of the subway. They experience great difficulties and  despite this, they have demonstrated a high civic awareness,  acknowledged our difficulties, and taken into consideration the  difficulties of the country and every citizen of the country and  returned to work. I am thankful to the deputies who visited the  strikers. They had thought that something unlawful was taking  place. I cannot say that they appealed to them to return to  work, but they assured themselves that the law had not been  violated there and they did not provoke the continuation of the  strike. [passage omitted]    Now a few words about strikes in general. Strikes make sense  in two cases. First, when the state or a private entrepreneur  has possibilities and resources that are not used for the  benefit of the employees. As a result, the employees suffer  economic losses and feel insecurity in some other spheres.    The state and the citizens are well aware what Georgia  possesses today. They will not be able to gain much from their  strikes. [passage omitted] An increase of salaries in coupons  can eventually have a reverse effect. A better result can be  achieved if it is found possible to bring in goods so that they  are purchased for coupons. This could help, but the state does  not have a lot of big resources or reserves. Of course, we can  issue a large number of additional coupons and distribute them,  but this will not be of any help. So, in this case, a strike is  not a good tool to improve your own economic conditions and the  economic conditions of your enterprise.    Another time is when you consider it necessary that the head  of state quit, the government be replaced, and so on. [passage  omitted] My actions have repeatedly proved that no violent  forces or strikes are required for this. I reiterate that I  have always been ready for this if it is beneficial for our  deeds. But I want to declare that while I am doing my job, I  will do it as my conscience allows me and as my knowledge and  experience, as well as physical possibilities, allow me to.  Keep in mind that there cannot be more than 24 hours in a day.  Hence, the physical possibilities of those who give all their  power and sense of responsibility to their work are limited.  Therefore, at present, there are no grounds for a demand that  the authorities quit. I mean that a strike is not a means to  save the state today. On the contrary, a strike will  practically be directed against families, children, and our own  country.    [Oniniani] Certain positive changes have been observed  lately in talks with the Abkhazia side in Moscow. Will these  promote the deployment of peacekeeping forces in Abkhazia?  Another question. The day before yesterday, you spend most of  the time in the Ministry of Defense. What is being done to  achieve the aim you planned when taking up the leadership of the  ministry, I mean the establishment of a new Georgian army?    [Shevardnadze] If signed this morning, the text of the  agreement will be both a maximum and a minimum. The work on it  still continues in Moscow, and I am not ready to comment on  every paragraph of it because changes were being introduced  during the past two days. It is a maximum of the present  possibilities and a minimum for the UN Security Council to make  a decision on the deployment of international peacekeeping  forces. You remember their precondition that certain progress  should be made during the talks, a cease-fire should be  implemented, fighting should be stopped, and only after this the  United Nations would make a decision to have international  forces deployed. Therefore, when signed, this agreement will  have an essential importance. As for the formula mentioned by  Kozyrev, it will be amplified this morning, and I think it must  be acceptable in principle. There is a little exception there.  An armed person should not enter Abkhazia. Neither should  those who are in the military service, in military units today.  They cannot enter Abkhazia as servicemen. This has nothing to  do with about 98 percent of the population, and only the case of  about 2 percent should be elucidated. I know what will follow  the publication of the agreement. There will be questions about  what the other side is doing and how will the issues of  demilitarization, disarmament of the units present there be  handled. All this comprises the second stage.    At the moment, the principal thing is to create conditions  for the deployment of international peacekeeping forces. And I  want everyone to understand this well.    As for the Ministry of Defense, serious work has started  there. [passage omitted] A lot is yet to be done. We have  discussed all this at the meeting of the collegium and made  certain decisions. We shall speak about the decisions later.    [Oniani] Batono [polite form of address] Eduard, what do you  think can be the reason of a virtually unanimous approval of  your nominees to the Cabinet of Ministers? I am asking this  question because before this process began, there was rather a  strong opposition to them.    [Shevardnadze] Do not hurry. About the unanimity. There  have been difficulties. What can be said about the case with  Mr. Mindia Ugrekhelidze? It is an absolutely incomprehensible  case. This man is a living image of conscience and honor, one  of the best experts on law. I have a deep respect for him as a  lawyer and an individual and I cannot imagine anyone who does  not respect him. An amazingly positive person, and I believe  this was a result of some misunderstanding. But it happened  anyway, and this is a difficulty.    We are facing a crucial day tomorrow. The fate of 10  ministries will be decided. I believe that the parliament will  stick to its good standards.    Now, you are asking me what the motive is and why it has  been  happening like this. I would like to give the following  explanation. A sense of responsibility is dominant in the case.  This happened when the parliament demonstrated its unity as the  police forces intruded into the building. I believe that the  majority of the parliament, I do not mean the official majority  but actually most of the deputies are well aware of the  situation the country can find itself in if a government crisis  continues. In fact, we are witnessing a crisis now because a  person has been sitting in the parliament for weeks waiting for  his turn to be approved. The ministries are at a virtual  standstill at the moment. I reiterate, this is a sense of  responsibility.    [Oniani] And finally. In his TV interview, Security  Minister Igor Giorgadze forecast that the current tensions would  culminate on 9 April [on this day in 1989, 20 people died when  Soviet troops dispersed a rally, and in 1991, the Georgian  parliament adopted an Act on the restoration of Georgia's  independence]. Was this the reason for the postponement of your  visit to Israel?    [Shevardnadze] Generally, before my foreign visits something  always takes place. The same has happened now. I mean strikes,  the incident that happened here [the police raid on parliament],  which has not been completely settled yet, and yet another  expected event Mr. Giorgadze spoke about. So, I summoned the  Israeli ambassador and informed him with anguish that my leaving  the country was not expedient at the moment.    I would say that I am doing this to be on the safe side. So,  I have put off a visit that is so important for our country and  especially for the economic prospects of the country. Some  people think that these visits are simply visits and excursions  and nothing else. You yourself have witnessed what hard work is  done during these visits. Everyone who is involved is extremely  busy. And every visit has a certain effect on Georgia. We have  not become rich, but the fact that we can take a breath and we  exist is a result of these visits.    U.S. President Clinton announced that he was allotting about  $70 million in aid. Later, as a result of our delegation's  activities there, the sum increased to about $80 million. Some  more sums will be added to this from other sources and  foundations, some from previous years, and eventually Georgia  will have $140-$150 million for the current year. There would  have probably been certain assistance even without this visit,  but the visit played its role. Thus, it is not entertainment,  and when a visit is on the agenda, we have to back up one  another because this is so essential for Georgia. Thank you.</p>

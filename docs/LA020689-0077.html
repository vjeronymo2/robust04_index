			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RELIEF FOR CREDIT CARD ADDICTS;  </P> <P> ORGANIZATIONS OFFER ADVICE AS CHRISTMAS BILLS BEGIN TO ROLL IN  </P> <P> When Jerri Kiesler used to get upset, lonely, or bored, she'd pull out her  dozen credit cards and zoom to the shopping malls in search of some little  bauble to raise her spirits.  </P> <P> "I liked to go to specialty stores where they would call me by my name as I  walked through the door," said the 50-year-old Dayton, Ohio, grandmother. "It  gave me a feeling of self worth."  </P> <P> Her mood changed as the bills arrived, followed by late notices, dunning  letters and curt telephone calls from creditors. In two years, Kiesler amassed  $12,000 in credit card debt, nearly half her annual income from an accounting  job. There was no way she could pay all the bills.  </P> <P> She now jokes that at least her trip to bankruptcy court was made in style,  thanks to the dresses and more than 200 pairs of shoes she'd charged from 1984  to 1986.  </P> <P> Kiesler, who filed for personal bankruptcy three years ago and has remained  "clean" since, is one of many American credit card holders facing crippling  financial problems from the enormous power of plastic.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Taking Cash Advances  </P> <P> The National Foundation for Consumer Credit says 2% of the 130 million  Americans who buy on credit are mired in credit card debt, 4% face "some  difficulties" and 10% experience "some discomfort."  </P> <P> Some troubled card holders might take cash advances from one card to pay debt  from another, the foundation says. Others dip into savings or borrow from  friends and neighbors.  </P> <P> Credit problems grow more acute this time of year because the Christmas bills  have rolled in. The American Bankers Assn. says holiday credit card use rose 8%  to 9% in 1988 over the previous year.  </P> <P> Debt counselors and therapists say they've noticed a steady increase in the  number of people with credit problems seeking help, and requests for assistance  have intensified this month.  </P> <P> Many claim that's partly because banks and credit card companies have lowered  their standards by giving people far more credit than they can handle.  </P> <P> Luther Gatling, who runs the nonprofit Budget &amp; Credit Counseling Services  Inc. in New York, said that while calls for help from debt-swamped clients  might be more noticeable after the holidays, "this business doesn't really have  an ebb or flow."  </P> <P> "It used to be that we got real busy at the end of January. But because of the  proliferation of credit you don't see it as acutely," he said. "Christmas does  heap on credit (and) . . . this may push some people over the edge."  </P> <P> To help credit card addicts, the Maryland-based National Foundation for  Consumer Credit, an umbrella group for services such as Gatling's, has nearly  doubled its nationwide offices to about 400 in the last two years, said Donald  L. Badders, foundation president.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Spendthrift Yuppies  </P> <P> He said the number of individuals and families receiving budget counseling from  them soared to 211,000 for the year ended Oct. 1 from 176,700 in 1987 and from  118,000 five years ago.  </P> <P> "As baby boomers came of age in the past 10 years . . . the consuming public  has grown," Badders said. "The complexity of consumer economics has grown."  </P> <P> So has the spendthrift yuppie mentality, to some degree.  </P> <P> "We've gotten to be a much more materialistic society. The cost of looking  successful is going up and up," said Evan Steffans, a therapist at Miami Valley  Hospital in Dayton, Ohio, who co-founded a Shopper Stoppers counseling program  with Kiesler three years ago.  </P> <P> Badders said the percentage of debt-dogged consumers has remained fairly  constant but the size of their debt is "a lot deeper than it was 10 years ago."  </P> <P> For example, the average person counseled at the foundation offices in 1980 had  about $9,000 in accumulated debt, compared to $15,000 in 1987 and $17,000 last  year. Badders said credit card debt is the fastest growing component of overall  consumer debt.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Aggressive Marketing  </P> <P> "This tells us that the percentage of those getting into trouble have taken  advantage of more credit opportunities," he said. "What I've seen happen is  more aggressive marketing on the part of credit card companies."  </P> <P> That marketing, some credit counselors contend, can be irresponsible. The  counselors complain that banks, in particular, don't adequately supervise  different subsidiaries that peddle cards.  </P> <P> Kiesler and many others who have faced even worse credit problems claim that  they sometimes have received card applications from the same banks harassing  them to pay delinquent bills.  </P> <P> "It became a challenge to get credit cards. I still get applications," said  Kiesler, now unemployed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Funds at Risk'  </P> <P> Joseph L. Boutin, an executive vice president for Howard Bank in Burlington,  Vt., and an ABA executive vice president, said those cases are rare. He said  most banks thoroughly check credit backgrounds.  </P> <P> "I'm sure you're going to be able to find some banks that have lowered their  standards for whatever reasons," Boutin said. "Most banks recognize when they  make a loan they have to be paid back because we have deposit funds at risk."  </P> <P> Still, more people who are normally considered a greater credit risk -- young  adults, teens and modest-income earners -- hold a significant portion of the  850 million credit cards in circulation.  </P> <P> Robert Johnson, director of Purdue University's credit research center, said  his most recent data show 21% of families with annual income of less than  $10,000 were card holders in 1986, compared to 12% in 1983. He said 42% of  those under age 25 had credit cards in 1986, compared to 20% in 1983. Many  bankers and merchants agree that solicitations for new credit card customers  have increased, but they attribute it to wider acceptance of credit cards and  growing competition for customers.  </P> <P> This rivalry has pressured issuers to reduce annual fees or lower interest  rates, at a time when interest rates have been rising.  </P> <P> Further squeezing profits are tax-law changes reducing the deductibility of  credit card interest. The ABA says about a third of all card users used to pay  their entire bills at the end of the month, but in the last year that rose to  40%. Many issuers had derived much of their earnings from interest payments on  balances left outstanding.  </P></p>

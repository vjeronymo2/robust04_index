			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPREME COURT RULING AGAINST OPERATION RESCUE BLOCKADES  </P> <P> The full effect of the Supreme Court decision to let stand the New York Federal  District Court ruling interpreting the 1871 Ku Klux Klan Act to include  Operation Rescue's blockading of abortion clinics has yet to be felt. As  pro-abortion forces celebrate their shortsighted victory for "privacy" and the  "American way," you can be sure police departments, district attorneys and  corporate lawyers are figuring out how to use it to stop other forms of civil  protest.  </P> <P> The effect will be felt on the sidewalks and public places within 50 feet of  consulates, embassies, country clubs and corporate offices.  </P> <P> The court's decision to restricting speech as to time, place and manner is  aimed at all forms of protected speech involving acts of nonviolent civil  disobedience, not just Operation Rescue. Had this decision been on the books in  the 1960s, the sit-ins and civil rights movement never would have gotten off  the ground. No lunch counter or college sit-in would have been possible because  of the "chilling effect" criminal penalties and civil fines would have had on  protesters. How will AIDS activists react when they are hit with triple damages  for interfering with the "right to assemble" and "freedom to practice religion"  for their disruption of Roman Catholic Masses? How will the ladies of Mills  College react when they are told that their blockade of administration offices  is a violation of the constitutional right of those who wish to do business at  Mills?  </P> <P> Today pro-abortion activists are savoring a great victory, but tomorrow they  most certainly will feel the sting of the double-edged sword they helped to  forge against Operation Rescue.  </P> <P> SEAN McCARTHY  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

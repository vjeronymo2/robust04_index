			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [First of unknown number of installments: "Special article" </F> by special correspondent in Washington Chu Hsing-fu (2612 1630  4395): "United States Must Not Cancel China's MFN Status --  Written on the Eve of Christopher's Visit to China"]    [Text] Washington, 7 Mar -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher, who currently is on visit in the Asia-Pacific  region, is scheduled to pay a three-day visit to China on 11  March. He is the first U.S. secretary of state to visit China  since the visit to Beijing by former U.S. Secretary of State  James Baker in November 1992, and also the most important of  U.S. official to visit China in recent years.    As reported by the U.S. media, Christopher's visit is aimed  exclusively at China's most-favored nation [MFN] trading status.  Two months from the 3 June deadline by which U.S. President  Clinton is to make a decision on renewing China's MFN trading  status, the U.S. side wants to make a final sprint and do its  best to force China to make more concessions on the human rights  issue. If China does make major concessions, the U.S. secretary  of state may suggest to President Clinton before the end of May  that China's MFN status be renewed. However, if China refuses  to make major concessions, the Clinton administration probably  will stop granting MFN trading status to China.  <H5>  China Has Done a Great Deal on the Human Rights Issue </H5>   According to the U.S. Presidential Executive Order signed by  Clinton last year when renewing China's MFN trading status,  China must attain major and comprehensive headway in improving  its human rights record in a number of fields, otherwise the  United States will not be so easy on China this year. In its  human rights report issued on 1 February, the U.S. State  Department reaffirmed the fact that China has made some headway  on the human rights issue, but the U.S. side still insists that  the concessions China has made are insufficient, and it  continues making constant threats to end China's MFN trading  status.    China and the United States have different cultural  traditions and values, and the economic development levels of  the two countries also are widely different. Therefore, it is  only natural that China and the United States should have  different understandings and perceptions of human rights  standards. Even so, China has done a great deal on the human  rights issue. For example, China used to consider the human  rights issue an internal affair and refuse to discuss the issue  with the United States, but now it is willing to discuss the  human rights issue in detail with the United States, which only  minds other countries' business without giving proper care to  things at home. China also has held talks with the  International Red Cross concerning visits to Chinese prisons,  and it has released a number of "pro-democracy" activists before  the completion of their terms of imprisonment. Knowing that the  United States itself also exports prison products to foreign  countries, China has reiterated its strict implementation of the  Agreement on Banning Exports of Prison Products; moreover, it  also has agreed to allow officials from the U.S. Embassy in  China to conduct shock inspections of Chinese factories under  suspicion.    The Chinese Government's great efforts on the human rights  issue last year are obvious to all. It would have been  impossible for China to achieve all these breakthroughs before  reform and opening up. However, one cannot build up his  constitution on one mouthful. The higher the requirements and  expectations the United States has unduly set on China's human  rights issue with a view to forcing China to accept all its  demands regardless of China's national conditions, the greater  is the disappointment to which United States is doomed. The  U.S. Presidential Executive Order is sacred and solemn on the  territory of the United States, but forcing this Order on China  is inappropriate. It is just as the diplomat of an Asian  country has put it: As a large country, China has national  dignity, as well as its own Constitution and laws. China will  not allow itself to be led by the nose by the U.S. Presidential  Executive Order.  <H5>  China Will Not Kowtow to the United States </H5>   During Christopher's visit to China, both sides will reach a  consensus on a number of international issues, and China may  make some gestures on the human rights issue, perhaps promising  that China will do more, in accordance with its Constitution and  laws, to abide by the World Declaration of Human Rights; or  continuing to release jailed dissidents for their satisfactory  performance in prison; or reiterating its willingness to hold  talks with the exiled Dalai Lama. However, China will not  kowtow to the United States, neither will it promise not to  arrest law-breaking dissidents who attempt to stir up turmoil  inside the country. Moreover, China will not sacrifice its  principles on holding talks with the Dalai Lama, unless the  latter agrees to give up his stance on Tibetan independence.    People tracking the development of Sino-U.S. relations all  share the opinion that no matter how hard China tries on the  human rights issue, dialogue and fights between China and the  United States over the human rights issue are going to be  protracted. This year's pressure will last until the end of the  coming May. Will the United States really abolish China's MFN  trading status this year? The Clinton administration will not  do so if it is sober-minded and has foresight. The undue  stubbornness of the United States on the issue of China's human  rights will lead only to the effect that "haste makes waste,"  which is contrary to its original wish. In China, no one dies  because of insufficient food and clothing, no one loses his leg  or hand for his violations of the law, no one obsequiously begs  for economic aid from the West, and no woman is deprived of her  right to participate in political affairs. The human rights  situation in many other countries is even worse than that in  China, so why does the United States not go and condemn them?    The reason the U.S. Government always adopts a tough  attitude  toward China on the human rights issue is that the government is  faced with pressure imposed by a number of U.S. senators and  human rights organizations. Although many senators have urged  efforts to increase pressure on China on the human rights issue,  and even have called for abolishing China's MFN status, not one  of them really wants, deep in his heart, to stop granting the  MFN trading status to China. Human rights are just a tool used  by the United States to impose pressure on China. If China's  MFN status is canceled this year owing to its poor human rights  record, those U.S. senators will be unable to find any other  excuse in the future for their criticism of China, and their  public exposure will come to an end following the cancellation  of China's MFN status.    A China undergoing reform and opening up is beneficial, not  only to the interests of the Chinese people, but also to the  interests of the United States. If it really wants to improve  Sino-U.S. relations, the United States must not cancel China's  MFN trading status.</p>

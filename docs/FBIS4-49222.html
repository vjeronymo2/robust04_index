			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Yan Fengli (2518 7685 0448) and </F> correspondent Cen Daokun (1478 6670 0981): "Abulaiti Abudurexiti  Stresses Foreign Affairs Work Must Open up Wider and Serve the  Economy"]    [Text] On 31 March, a regional conference of directors of  foreign affairs offices ended. Addressing the closing ceremony,  Abulaiti Abudurexiti, Xinjiang Autonomous Regional People's  Government chairman, called for seizing the opportunity, opening  up wider, and successfully handling foreign affairs work to  promote Xinjiang's rapid and highly efficient economic  development.    He said: Xijiang is located at a hot-point region for  attracting foreign funds. It is necessary for foreign affairs  departments at all levels to clearly understand this trend,  emancipate their minds, boldly blaze new trails, enhance their  consciousness of having foreign affairs work serve economic  construction, and focus attention on the enthusiasm of all  fields of endeavor for contacts with foreign countries. We must  make full use of foreign affairs departments' characteristics of  having extensive, multiple channels for contacts with foreign  countries to vigorously establish links for economic  departments. We must step up propaganda abroad to let the world  understand Xinjiang. We must improve contacts with Chinese  embassies and consulates abroad and strive to win their support  and help for Xinjiang's opening up wider and conducting economic  activities and trade. We must successfully build and manage  ports open to the outside world, strengthen the building of  spiritual civilization at these ports, increase their cargo  handling capabilities, and guarantee smooth transportation to  these ports to provide excellent services for opening up.    Xinjiang has established economic, cultural, and other ties  with more than 60 countries and regions, including the  Commonwealth of Independent States, Japan, the United States,  Western European countries, Hong Kong, and Macao. Abulaiti  Abudurexiti said: It is necessary for all foreign affairs  departments to cement ties with old friends, make more new  friends, and establish a reliable network for contacts with  foreign countries. While consolidating the existing markets,  efforts must be made to expand the share of markets captured in  Japan, the United States, Hong Kong, and Central Asia and to  vigorously open up new markets in South Asia, the ROK, Russia,  Eastern and Western Europe, and West Asia. While attracting  foreign funds, we must continue to improve the orientation for  industries, treat the new high technology industry and technical  transformation of the old enterprises as the focal points for  encouraging investments, and pay attention to the percentage of  foreign funds that have been remitted to their recipients as  well as the quality and efficiency of the utilization of foreign  funds. He also stressed: We must open our doors wider to the  outside world, successfully attract foreign businessmen and  their capital, and strive to make the 1994 Urumqi Trade Fair an  even greater success.</p>

			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Turkish wrangling delays reform Turkey's domestic political wrangling looks set to delay the release of a much needed World Bank structural adjustment credit, raising doubts over whether the government can meet its longer term economic recovery targets. For much of the normally quiet summer months, the conservative-led coalition of Mrs Tansu Ciller has been taken up with a series of crises, with media attacks on the prime minister's property acquisitions in the US, legal setbacks to the privatisation effort, and a controversial cabinet reshuffle which has raised questions over the government's durability. With such a hectic agenda, Mrs Ciller has still not responded to the World Bank's policy recommendations, submitted in mid July, making it increasingly unlikely that the Bank's board will be able to approve release of a structural adjustment credit in October as planned. The Bank's recommendations cover privatisation, public sector enterprise reform, social security, tax and farm subsidy reform as well as an overhaul of the entire incentive system. The Bank credit was expected to be in the range of Dollars 250m-Dollars 500m, released in two roughly equal tranches. One explanation for the government's failure to respond to the World Bank is simply official complacency, following what the Bank acknowledges as the early success in implementing the April 5 stabilisation measures. However economists point out that many of the steps taken - tax charges on the wealthy, fuel tax surcharges - are one-off measures, rather than sustainable sources of revenue for the government. 'Without some movement on the adjustment issues, Turkey may find itself in a sticky situation next year,' warned one western economist yesterday. Adjustment measures are central to the revenue targets announced by Mrs Ciller. Sales of state companies are earmarked to raise Dollars 5.2bn by the end of 1994, half of which is destined to help close the deficit which is targeted to be halved to 9 per cent of GNP. To date, the only significant sell-off is a 21 per cent minority stake in the privately managed Tofas car company, a joint venture with Fiat of Italy and a local producer. Rulings from the constitutional court, Turkey's supreme legal authority, currently block the government's use of decree powers to speed up privatisation. Last week the court passed an injunction to freeze the legislation passed by parliament to sell off the telecommunications monopoly PTT. With GNP growth in 1994 expected to slow down more sharply than anticipated, economists point out that tax collection is also likely to drop, making it doubly vital to take the adjustment measures.</p>

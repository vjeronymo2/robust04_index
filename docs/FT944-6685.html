			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Low-smoke smokescreen? US cigarette manufacturer RJ Reynolds Tobacco yesterday appeared to be playing down prospects for the launch of a new type of low-smoke cigarette called Eclipse, saying it did not know if or when the cigarette would be introduced because it was still being developed. Reynolds, part of RJR Nabisco, the US food and cigarette group, has been testing the cigarette which works by igniting a charcoal element at the end and passing the hot air over tobacco without burning it. A similar non-burning cigarette called Premier, launched by the company in 1988, flopped. Yesterday Reynolds said testing indicated that Eclipse had less tar and nicotine than 95 per cent of cigarettes currently on the market and eliminated 90 per cent of second-hand smoke.</p>

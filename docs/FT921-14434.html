			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / Letter: Lloyd's report offers no solution to 'outsiders' Sir, Once again we get exactly what we should have been expecting from a group headed by a Lloyd's 'insider' - a clever set of suggestions as to how the 'insiders' can go on obtaining enough 'outsiders' to continue to rip them off in the future. We could have hoped for a few more imaginative ideas from a team supported by McKinsey. The only radical ideas are in the suggestions which are presented as possible areas that Lloyd's may like to look at in the long term and are, therefore, never likely to be implemented. I know of no other organisation in the world which asks Names to take such risk and in which the people who are meant to look after their interests not only enjoy so much immunity but also have their own often conflicting interests. David Rowland, who chaired the task-force which prepared the report, offers no radical solution to this problem and he offers no solution to the basic conflicts of interest in the market despite much nonsense talked about the 'primacy of Names' interests'. There are, of course, some good 'nuts and bolts' suggestions - but then every report on Lloyd's in the last 50 years has had some good ideas along with some bad ones - and if the Council of Lloyds continues to represent the insiders then there is little hope in the aftermath of this report, as there was in the aftermath of the last report, that the recommendations which are actually implemented will reflect the outsiders' interests. I am one of those Names who had hoped that the balance of power would finally and irrevocably have shifted in favour of the provider of capital and that a scheme would have been devised to ensure that those who had profited from past market dishonesty would have contributed something to a fund to help present sufferers. I therefore put off my resignation pending the Rowland report. I sent it off today. Claud Gurney, 41 Brompton Square, London SW3</p>

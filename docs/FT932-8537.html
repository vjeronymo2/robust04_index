			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / D-Mark hit by easing of tensions in ERM THE prospect of a Yes vote in the Danish referendum weakened the D-Mark yesterday, as international investors took the view that such a result would significantly ease tensions in Europe's exchange rate mechanism. Several European currencies, including sterling and the Italian lira, enjoyed strong rises against the D-Mark, as Danish opinion polls pointed to a clear ratification of the Maastricht treaty and a period of calm in Europe's fixed exchange rate system. This reversed a trend of recent weeks in which investors, fearful of another Danish No, sought a safe haven against currency turmoil and a renewed threat to European economic and monetary union by buying D-Marks and Swiss francs. German government bond prices also fell to the benefit of Italian and French bonds. Danish opinion polls helped the pound to close a pfennig higher against the D-Mark on the day, at DM2.4875. The Italian lira was also a strong performer, closing at L909.2 against the D-Mark from a previous close of L914.9. The dollar gained significantly from the D-Mark's weakness, rising more than a pfennig to peak at DM1.6272 in Europe, and reaching a 7-week high. It later closed in London at DM1.6240. An additional factor pushing the dollar higher against the German currency was speculation that the Federal Reserve's federal open market committee would lean towards tightening monetary policy at its meeting in New York yesterday. Expectations of a rise in short-term US interest rates have followed last week's US inflation figures, which were higher than anticipated. The results of the meeting, which took place yesterday and continues today, will not be known for some weeks. Currencies, Page 43</p>

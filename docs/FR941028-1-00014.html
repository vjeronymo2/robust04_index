			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Thus, the fact that a centralized market is composed solely of institutional or ``sophisticated'' participants does not obviate the need to ensure market integrity, price dissemination, and adequate protections against fraud, manipulation, and other trading abuses by continued Commission regulation and oversight. In this regard, the term ``institutional'' may encompass customers with a wide range of financial experience, acumen and resources. The Commission believes, moreover, that the Act and Commission regulations serve a vital function, even where such a market includes only sophisticated participants, in that the regulatory requirements substitute for individualized credit determinations and permit increased access to the markets by secondary participants and customers. Further, a premise of the CEA for over 70 years has been that all traders require not only an efficient, but also a fair marketplace in which to trade, which Congress has previously determined to be best effectuated by a regulatory framework in which federal regulation is paramount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, notwithstanding the exchanges' arguments to the contrary, since the enactment of the CEA the exchanges have grown and thrived, not despite, but at least in part, because of the regulatory scheme under which they operate and the resulting public confidence in the fairness of the markets. The Commission agrees with the commenters who stated that regulatory safeguards promote public confidence in the integrity of the markets, confidence likely to be eroded without federal oversight. Accordingly, the Commission is not convinced that a broad exemption of the kind requested by the exchanges is in the public interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nevertheless, the Commission has in the past taken into account in fashioning its regulations, granting exemptions, and establishing policies, whether the general public is excluded from a market or transaction or is permitted to participate. The Commission considers the exclusion of non-sophisticated market participants as the single most important rationale supporting the various forms of relief proposed herein. The proposed relief from certain aspects of exchange regulation should enhance the exchanges' ability to innovate and their competitive posture. Indeed, the Commission is cognizant, as the exchanges and other commenters noted, that its exemptive authority is ``intended to promote responsible economic and financial innovation and fair competition.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In issuing its study on U.S. market competitiveness, the Commission stated that it was committed to keeping its regulatory programs under continuous review to assure that ``consistent with our responsibilities for market integrity and customer protection, they: (1) keep pace with changes in the marketplace; and (2) do not unnecessarily impede domestic exchanges from evolving to remain competitive, especially with regard to the cost of compliance relative to non-U.S. exchanges.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> H.R. Rep. No. 978, 102d Cong., 2d Sess. 78 (1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Commodity Futures Trading Commission,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> A Study of the Global Competitiveness of U.S. Futures Markets  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 (April 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To that end, the Commission recognizes that some regulatory controls, such as certain procedures for Commission review and approval of new instruments, could be streamlined in order to facilitate the introduction of products and the on-exchange offering of more varied contract designs. More flexibility to permit some customizing of exchange-traded products also may attract certain institutional participants for which the efficiency of exchange markets and other protections they afford may be preferable to off-exchange transactions where prices are often opaque and credit risk is a more profound issue. The Commission also believes that exchange transactions traded by professional traders may not require the full panoply of regulatory requirements. In that regard, the Commission believes that a more flexible approach to risk disclosure for products offered to sophisticated market participants may be preferable to existing requirements. In addition, the Commission preliminarily agrees with the commenters who suggested that certain registration requirements could be streamlined for professional traders licensed with other financial regulators to facilitate new entrants to the exchange markets by persons currently selling OTC products to sophisticated customers. Finally, the Commission preliminarily believes that the long-standing traditional requirements of open and competitive trading could be relaxed for sophisticated, eligible participants in order to facilitate the execution of large orders, as long as appropriate post-trade transparency, customer, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other market protections from trading abuses are maintained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For these reasons, after reviewing the exchanges' petitions and the general comments, the Commission is proposing to test some ways of giving the exchanges flexibility and greater latitude in order to enhance their ability to devise innovative responses both to other centralized and to less regulated, non-centralized markets. The Commission believes that the exemptive relief that it is proposing preserves regulatory safeguards but also acknowledges that non-centralized markets have a far lower regulatory burden and that several comparable markets of other jurisdictions provide certain trading mechanism concessions not currently afforded the U.S. futures markets. In that regard, the Commission proposes a new Part 36, which exempts contracts termed ``section 4(c) contract market transactions'' meeting specified criteria from certain specific requirements and regulations under the Act. There are four main proposed limitations on the exemption: (1) The duration, (2) the scope, (3) the persons who are eligible to enter into the transactions, and (4) the transactions which may trade as section 4(c) contract market transactions. The Commission believes that this proposal strikes the appropriate balance between the need to detect and deter abuses and the need for an innovative central market tailored to the needs of sophisticated and institutional market participants. The Commission requests comments concerning the specifics of the proposed criteria for the transactions as well as the proposed provisions from which the transactions will be exempt.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920825 FT  25 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian tea faces crisis after Russian withdrawal THE INDIAN tea industry is facing a crisis following the disappearance of Russian buyers from the country's tea auction centres. The withdrawal has been caused by the Russians exhausting the technical credit of Dollars 32m extended by the Indian federal government earlier this year. 'Without the Russians the bottom will soon be falling out of the Indian tea market,' said Mr HP Barooah, chairman of Indian Tea Association. Under the trade protocol, Russia is supposed to buy 65m kg of Indian tea in the current year but so far it has bought only 16m kg. Russia will need another at least Dollars 100m worth of technical credits to procure the remaining amount and the beleaguered Indian industry has made a representation to the federal government for an immediate release of Dollars 20m so that its buyers can return to the auctions. Mr Hiteswar Saikia, chief minister of the largest tea growing state of Assam, is reported to have urged Mr Manmohan Singh, India's finance minister, to come to the rescue of the tea industry by giving Russia further technical credits, but New Delhi is unrelenting. It has made it clear that further release of technical credit will have to await Russia giving oil and petroleum lubricants to India as part of the barter arrangement. Mr Barooah said the setback to tea exports had already forced gardens in south India, Cachar, Terai and Dooars to sell tea at below the cost of production. The same would soon be happening to the Assam gardens, he added. In view of the severe resource constraint, the Russians, who in the past used to buy medium and superior grades of teas, have this year been purchasing lower value teas, said Mr Vijay Dudeja, spokesman for the brokers. The tea association set an export target of 188m kg for the current year on the assumption that Russia would lift the agreed quantity of 65m kg and the other constituents of CIS would import about 10m kg. While there is great uncertainty about export to Russia, India hopes to be able to step up tea sales elsewhere, in Iran, Poland and Egypt, for example. But these markets, according to Mr Barooah, are no substitute for Russia in the short term. Last year, India exported 104.5m kg of tea to the Soviet Union, more than 80 per cent of that going to Russia. According to Mr Barooah, even though India will be harvesting a lower crop of about 715m kg in 1992, compared with 742m kg last year, the industry will not find it easy to dispose of the crop because of the poor Russian buying. In the long run, however, there remains immense scope for stepping up domestic consumption of tea. Annual consumption of tea in India is about 600 grammes a head, compared with about 3 kg in the UK. Sri Lankan tea production fell by 41.4m kg in the first half of this year, nearly 50 per cent of the world crop reduction, writes Mervyn de Silva in Colombo. World production in the January-June period fell by 86m kg, says Forbes and Walker, a leading local broker. Production in India and Kenya, Sri Lanka's main competitors also dropped, by 23.4m kg and 12.5m kg respectively, but Sri Lanka's fall of just over 20 per cent is the highest of all major producers. Only Bangladesh and Tanzania registered increases in the period. 'The prolonged drought hit our tea industry hard,' said a plantation ministry official. While production has dropped, prices have improved, however. 'The slump and more especially, the Russian demand have influenced prices,' said a leading Colombo broker, who pointed out that 'each time the Russians were present at auctions in the past three months, our tea fetched better prices'.</p>

			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Motoring: The Metro's transplant an automatic and a diesel - went on sale this week. They are so good that it really is high time the car was given a name properly reflecting its status. Eleven years ago the Austin Mini-Metro was launched as an intended successor to the already 21-year-old Mini. It was quite successful, not least because it was the obvious car for Mini owners to trade-up to. But there were quality and reliability problems. The power train - the Mini's growly pushrod engine with a 4-speed gearbox buried in its sump - was past pensionable age. Gradually, people who might otherwise have bought Metros went in for more up-to-date Ford Fiestas and Nissan Micras, Vauxhall Novas and VW Polos instead. Two years ago everything changed. The Metro had a heart and lung transplant. Out went the geriatric engine and four-speed box. In came Rover Group's outstandingly efficient K-Series overhead camshaft engine; a new Peugeot-designed but Rover-made four or five-speed gearbox; and a new Hydragas suspension.  It was virtually a new car, even though it still looked much the same as the old one. And build quality had improved beyond recognition. From trailing the supermini field, Metro had found its second wind and was up near the front. Two years on, it is still there, which brings me to its name. Why not recognise its role as starter model for the Rover marque and badge it as a Rover 100? It is already called that on mainland Europe, where they think of a Metro as an underground train. Giving it the title of Rover 100 in Britain would lay the Austin ghost and be an honour long overdue. The five-door Metro 1.4S automatic with an exhaust catalyser which I tried last month was the best small two-pedal car on the market. Its Volvo-developed continuously variable transmission (CVT) is much simpler than a conventional automatic. I found it quick off the mark and very lively indeed when overtaking. It romped up steep hills and restarted easily on a 1-in-4 gradient. Finish inside and out was good, the whole car felt taut, the seats were soft yet supportive and the ride by far the best in the Metro's size and price class. It may not be important to those who will buy it as an easy-to-drive runabout, but it handles beautifully on corners and has all the roadholding one can safely use. The steering is very light on the move and not objectionably heavy when parking. Even so, I have to admit there is nothing quite like power assistance, which is not available on the Metro, for truly effortless parking and low speed manoeuvring. Early cars with CVT were odd to drive. When accelerating from a standstill, their engines raced up to high revolutions and the car's speed rose slowly in response. But the Metro behaves more like a car with a super-smooth conventional automatic in which gear changes are undetectable. (The CVT has no gears at all). It is very quiet mechanically. At a motorway cruising rate the loudest noise was the swish of tyres and a fair bit of wind roar from the sunroof. The CVT is available in seven Metro models from the entry level 1.4L to the sporty GTa at list prices ranging from Pounds 9,197 to Pounds 12,418. All have the same performance - a 100 mph (161 kph) maximum and will reach 60 mph (96 kph) from a standstill in just over 11 seconds. Fuel consumption should be around 38 mpg (7.43 l/100 km) provided you are not leaden-footed or make only very short journeys. The new Metro diesel is just as impressive. Its 1.4 litre engine, a PSA Group product, is used in the Citroen AX and will soon appear in the Peugeot 106. Like the two-pedal version, the Metro diesel is also best in class. Inevitably, it is throbby at start up and it chuckles loudly when idling. But on a motorway the diesel Metro is quiet enough to be taken for a petrol engined car. Even when accelerating - and its pick up in third and fourth gears in the important 30-60 mph (48-96 kmh) range is positively vigorous - it sounds subdued. The small amount of extra weight up front has no effect on the handling or ride comfort. It steers easily, too, on the move though inching into a parking slot is just that much more of an effort. The Metro diesel comes as a three or five door in two trim levels with a five-speed gearbox. Prices start at Pounds 8,509. An economy-minded owner will have no difficulty in averaging over 60 mpg (4.7 l/100 km).</p>

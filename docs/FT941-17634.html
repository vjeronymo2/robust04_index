			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Arts: Find the dancers a home - Ballet Hope may spring eternal, but there seems little good to anticipate on the British dance scene this year. Our two leading modern dance troupes - London Contemporary and Rambert - are in a state of flux: in its infinite wisdom the Arts Council has arranged that the former will be cut down to size, while the latter will be given boots too big for its present capabilities. Our smaller modern ensembles offer dull creations and low dance vitality, but are promoted above their station. (What Jonathan Burrows does this year will be a matter of real fascination: he has an original creative talent, unlike most of the dabblers whose offerings are the commonplace of dance-going.) The Royal Ballet is on reduced performance rations at Covent Garden, and is repeating too many of last season's repertory mistakes. Evenings are being marketed under flatulent titles - The Immortal Hours, so likely] - rather than on merit. The natural wealth of the company, which is the great store of its productions, is not shown on artistically credible or logical terms. If New York City Ballet can mount a Balanchine Festival, why should not Covent Garden give us an Ashton Festival, a MacMillan celebration, and excite public response to two of the central figures in ballet of our time? The Royal Opera House must close for refurbishing in 1997, with a scheduled re-opening in 2000. Where the resident ballet and opera companies will find a nest is by no means clear. Drury Lane is persistently bruited, and were it to become available this theatre would also answer a further long-standing problem: our need for a dance house. If I have one hope for the coming year, it is that definite moves be made towards securing a home for national and international dance in London. We have but to study the example of the Paris Opera. With the opening of the spiffing new Opera Bastille, Garnier's adorable palace has become a great European centre for dance. The Opera Ballet is resident there, and the theatre also offers hospitality to many visitors. (The Royal Ballet should have played there last summer.) The present season's immediate example shows that, by July, the Palais Garnier will have presented ten varied programmes by its house company, and will also receive five guest ensembles, ranging from Twyla Tharp to the San Francisco Ballet. A comparable theatre in London might rescue our ballet and dance troupes from their doldrums, and it would provide a much-needed location for large visiting ensembles, who otherwise have to fight for free weeks at the Coliseum or Covent Garden. I do not believe in the Albert Hall as a serious dance house, whatever the advantages in size for a troupe like the Bolshoi. I do believe in the idea of a dance house which would allow the Royal Ballet to play seasons in addition to its Opera House schedules, which would provide a home for English National Ballet, would adapt in size to take in smaller companies, and, most significantly, would help broaden the experience of our dancers and our dance public. Once upon a time (the 1940s-'60s) London was a major dance centre, and we saw an exceptional variety of performance. We are now starved, and our audiences are shrinking as much because of the predictability of the dance on offer as because of exorbitant prices. We could do worse than provide the space in which our own companies, and our visitors, might show us not just what we have missed in recent years, but what marvels dance can achieve in a proper setting.</p>

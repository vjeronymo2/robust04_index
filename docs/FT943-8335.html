			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / European car sales up 4.8% The pace of recovery in west European new car demand slowed last month as sales rose by an estimated 4.8 per cent to 962,000. New car sales rose sharply year-on-year in both May and June with increases of more than 13 per cent, but carmakers do not expect such growth to be sustained in the second half. Sales declined by more than 15 per cent last year, the steepest fall in the post-war period, but demand has begun to recover during the first half of 1994. In the first seven months new car sales rose by an estimated 6.6 per cent to 7.5m from 7.0m a year ago. The recovery faltered last month in Britain, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium, but the sales declines in these countries were offset by higher new car registrations in France and Spain as well as by continuing strong demand in Scandinavia. Overall new car sales in July were higher than a year ago in 11 of 17 markets across west Europe. Sales fell by an estimated 2.5 per cent year-on-year in both Germany and Britain, although in the first seven months UK new car demand has risen by 13.3 per cent. All six big volume carmakers in west Europe have increased sales volumes in the first seven months, while Japanese carmakers have lost ground. Peugeot Citroen has performed strongly supported by a 14.2 per cent rise in the overall French new car market in the first seven months. It increased its sales volumes by an estimated 12 per cent in the first seven months and is challenging General Motors of the US (Vauxhall in the UK and Opel in continental Europe) for second place in west Europe. Mercedes-Benz and Saab have both increased sales by more than a third in the first seven months helped by the launch of important new models last year. Japanese carmakers have suffered a significant loss of market share with their competitiveness hit hard by the rapid appreciation of the yen. Only Honda raised sales volume in the first seven months.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- WEST EUROPEAN NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- January-July 1994  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Volume   Volume     Share (%)    Share (%)                          (Units)  Change(%)  Jan-Jul 94   Jan-Jul 93  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL MARKET             7,466,000    +6.6        100.0        100.0 MANUFACTURERS: Volkswagen group         1,234,000    +5.0         16.5         16.8  -   Volkswagen            799,000    +1.9         10.7         11.2  -   Seat                  203,000   +22.4          2.7          2.4  -   Audi                  197,000    +0.5          2.6          2.8  -   Skoda*                 34,000   +16.2          0.5          0.4 General Motors***          955,000    +6.1         12.8         12.9  -   Opel/Vauxhall         915,000    +5.3         12.3         12.4  -   Saab**                 32,000   +41.4          0.4          0.3 PSA Peugeot Citroen        940,000   +12.0         12.6         12.0  -   Peugeot               564,000   +10.4          7.6          7.3  -   Citroen               376,000   +14.6          5.0          4.7 Fiat group****             877,000    +6.7         11.7         11.7  -   Fiat                  675,000    +9.6          9.0          8.8  -   Lancia                116,000    -1.5          1.6          1.7  -   Alfa Romeo             76,000    -5.6          1.0          1.2 Ford group***              852,000    +7.0         11.4         11.4  -   Ford                  846,000    +7.1         11.3         11.3  -   Jaguar                  6,000    -0.8          0.1          0.1 Renault                    813,000    +9.1         10.9         10.6 BMW group                  453,000    +6.6          6.1          6.1  -   BMW                   236,000    +1.5          3.2          3.3  -   Rover                 217,000   +12.9          2.9          2.8 Mercedes-Benz              261,000   +34.7          3.5          2.8 Nissan                     236,000    -1.9          3.2          3.4 Toyota                     189,000    -3.1          2.5          2.8 Volvo                      124,000   +23.8          1.7          1.4 Mazda                      112,000    -9.9          1.5          1.8 Honda                      100,000    +2.8          1.3          1.4 Mitsubishi                  74,000   -17.0          1.0          1.3 Suzuki                      49,000   -20.1          0.7          0.9 Total Japanese             804,000    -6.5         10.8         12.3 MARKETS: Germany                  2,024,000    +0.4         27.1         28.8 Italy                    1,229,000    -1.4         16.5         17.8 France                   1,150,000   +14.2         15.4         14.4 United Kingdom             991,000   +13.3         13.3         12.5 Spain                      556,000   +18.9          7.4          6.7  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * VW holds 31 per cent and management control of Skoda. ** GM holds 50 per cent and management control of Saab Automobile. *** Includes cars imported from US and sold in western Europe. **** Fiat group includes Lancia, Alfa Romeo, Innocenti, Ferrari and Maserati.

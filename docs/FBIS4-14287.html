			<p>BFN     [Text] President Husni Mubarak, Palestinian President Yasir  'Arafat, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, and  Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres held a news conference at  the end of their meeting at the Presidential Palace in  Heliopolis today. President Mubarak made a statement at the  beginning of the conference. He noted that today's meeting was  good. He said: I met first with U.S. Secretary of State  Christopher and then with President 'Arafat, and the Israeli  foreign minister. He added: The four of us then held a lengthy  meeting together, during which we discussed numerous issues that  are still unresolved. Indeed, we found solutions for some of  these issues but certain small issues that may prove difficult  remain unresolved. These issues, he said, will be discussed and  resolved in the next two days. He noted that 'Arafat and  Israeli Prime Minister Rabin will meet before signing the  agreement because two issues must be resolved by the two  leaders. He said: I hope they will succeed and I proposed that  they sign the agreement in Cairo on 4 May. The two sides agreed  on this. He said that the two parties also agreed that 'Arafat  and Rabin will meet on 3 May. He said: I asked Secretary  Christopher to postpone his work in Europe and to stay in the  region to attend this meeting. He said: We are all aware of  the U.S. role in advancing the peace process.    Secretary Christopher then made a statement in which he  thanked President Mubarak. He said: We held a good meeting  during which tangible progress in major issues was achieved. He  said: I am touched by both parties' interest in quickly finding  solutions to their problems and starting to implement the  agreement. He added: I agreed to stay until 3 and 4 May, the  date for signing the agreement and I am happy that the two  parties set 4 May as a specific date to sign the agreement on  implementing the Declaration of Principles. He thanked  President Mubarak and expressed his appreciation for the role he  played during the protracted talks at the end of which the two  sides were persuaded to set a date to sign the agreement.    President 'Arafat then made a statement in which he thanked  President Mubarak and Secretary Christopher. Here President  Mubarak remarked: I thank you both. 'Arafat said: I thank  you, U.S. President Bill Clinton, and Secretary Christopher for  what we achieved today. He added: We hope that we will achieve  a tangible result of substance, as you have said, to offer to  our two peoples.    Peres made a statement in which he thanked President Mubarak  and the U.S. Secretary of State for their participation in and  support for the peace process to put an end to a long journey  and usher in the start of a new journey in relations between the  Palestinians and Israelis and to take a new step on the path  toward peace in the Middle East.    Responding to a question on the pending issues and the  others  on which agreement was reached, President 'Arafat said: Wait  and see. Peres commented saying: The two points involve the  size of Jericho and security at the crossing points, adding that  'Arafat and Rabin will discuss these points at their meeting.  Christopher remarked: There are also other issues. Peres  said: Yes, but these are the two points that Rabin and 'Arafat  will decide how to settle.    In response to a question on whether this would mean  reaching  an agreement on other issues such as registration, Peres said  that there are still certain secondary issues that will be  discussed today and tomorrow, adding: We hope that we will  settle them.    In reply to a question on the steps that can be taken to  motivate the peace process on the Syrian track and on the new  ideas he is bringing to the two sides to return to the  negotiating table and bring about Israeli withdrawal from the  Golan, Christopher said: Regarding efforts to advance the peace  process, I believe that the parties will consider what is  happening here and will listen to President Mubarak's statement  that there is a specific date for signing the implementation of  the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, which in  itself would generate considerable momentum. He said: I will  meet with the Israeli prime minister tomorrow and I hope that  the facilities that I will be able to achieve during these two  meetings will generate new momentum. I hope that you are aware  that our current role does not allow us to disclose more details.    Responding to a question on his feelings about security in  Egypt, particularly in view of the presence of four leaders and  of the upcoming date of a meeting to sign the agreement in  Cairo, Christopher said: I have learned that the current  situation in Egypt is encouraging. President Mubarak told me  that tourists are coming back to Egypt in large numbers. I  believe that this is a strong indication that the convoy is  proceeding on the right path under the leadership of President  Mubarak.</p>

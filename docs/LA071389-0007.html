			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ENCINA SEWAGE PLANT TO PUT A LID ON ODOR PROBLEMS  </P> <P> Carlsbad residents downwind from the Encina sewage plant will have to hold  their noses a while longer while workers hustle to solve the odor problem, but  they shouldn't have to worry about the quality of the ocean water during the  summer sunbathing months.  </P> <P> The 12-member Joint Advisory Committee of the Encina Water Pollution Control  Facility voted Wednesday to move as fast as possible to cover the stench that  has been affecting nearby residents since the plant increased its treatment of  the sewage to the secondary level last October. At the same time, the committee  members unanimously rejected the idea of reverting to advanced primary  treatment to lessen the smell, to the great relief of local environmentalists.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Happy With Decision  </P> <P> "We're elated that the board has decided to do the right thing here," said  Richard MacManus, spokesman for People for a Clean Ocean. "We have empathy for  the local residents that have to deal with the odor issue, and hopefully there  will be a quick solution to that problem, but you can't jeopardize the public  health.  </P> <P> "Hopefully, the days of lower sewage treatment are gone forever."  </P> <P> People for a Clean Ocean lobbied extensively for a switch to secondary  treatment, which more effectively removes toxins, bacteria and viruses from the  effluent before it is dumped from the plant's ocean outfall 1 1/2 miles  offshore. But, when the new system was kicked into gear last fall, it soon  became obvious that more intensive treatment resulted in a more intense smell.  </P> <P> A recently completed study, done jointly by the John Carollo engineering firm  and TRC Environmental Consultants, concluded that most of the odor was coming  from the plant's uncovered aeration basins, where the sewage settles, and from  the channels running between the basins.  </P> <P> Engineer Dennis Wood told the committee Wednesday that simply covering the open  basins and channels would virtually wipe out the problem.  </P> <P> The study's recommendations, which were unanimously approved by the committee,  called for the the basins and channels to be covered as soon as possible with  plywood. The makeshift plywood covers will be replaced with interim covers  designed to last about three years -- which could be in place before the end of  1989, "with a little bit of hard work and a lot of luck," Encina General  Manager Rick Graff said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Permanent Covers Are Goal  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the facility will seek a contract to build permanent fiberglass or  aluminum basin covers, which could be removed for occasional maintenance. If  work proceeds quickly, the permanent covers could be in place by July, 1990,  the study said.  </P> <P> The committee also explored the possibility of reverting to less-intensive  treatment until the end of the year to mitigate the smell, but Graff  recommended against it.  </P> <P> Such a switch would have negligible financial benefits and could actually cause  more odor because of the complexities of switching systems, Graff said.  Furthermore, the plant would have to go back to secondary treatment in November  or December, when the federal Environmental Protection Agency issues its new  five-year license, which will provide for secondary treatment only.  </P> <P> After hearing the presentation, the entire board seemed to agree with the  remarks of Carlsbad Councilman Eric Larson, who said that reverting to advanced  primary treatment is "not even a viable alternative."  </P></p>

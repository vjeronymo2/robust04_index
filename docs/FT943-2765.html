			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Car a persuasive option Sir, Richard Donkin asks (Jobs: September 14): 'Why do we persist with the company car as a form of reward?' The answer is quite simple. It is still a very cost-effective way of providing a benefit to employees. The typical cost to an employer of providing an employee with a car priced at Pounds 20,000 is about Pounds 9,000 a year (including private fuel and Class 1A national insurance contributions). The cost (including employer's National Insurance contributions) of paying an employee a sufficient cash allowance to operate a similar car himself out of after-tax earnings is about Pounds 12,500 a year. Employees understand this quite well. Our recent survey, Company Cars and Flexible Benefits, shows that 90 per cent of employees who are offered a cash allowance instead of a company car choose to stick with the cars. The average cash allowance of Pounds 6,000 a year for Pounds 20,000 cars is not sufficient in most cases to persuade them to take on the costs of running their own cars.

Officials at the French Embassy, the UK High Commission, the  US Embassy and the Canadian High Commission said last week that  they hold ad hoc, informal meetings to consider the requirements  of the T&amp;T Government and how best they can each serve these  needs.    The objective of these meetings, they say, is to exchange  information so that projects are co-ordinated and to ensure that  efforts are not duplicated.    The French have been identified as the experts on money  laundering, the Canadians on training and equipment, the US on  drug interdiction and the British on training.    Jacques Venne, delegate for the Eastern Caribbean Technical  and International Police Co-operation (SCTIP) attached to the  French Embassy, said that Trinidad and Tobago was designated the  regional centre of SCTIP operations on September 27. Director of  SCTIP (International) Jean-Louise Ottavi visited for the opening  on his way to Aruba to attend an Interpol Conference.    This country, he said, was chosen because of its  geographical  location and because of this Government's interest in dealing  with the illicit drug trade. The Jamaican office, he added, was  closed in favour of reinforcing the newly-opened centre in  Trinidad and Tobago.    The Paris Government, he said, has already released "a good  budget" for training a special team of police officers in money  laundering, starting from the end of October. The officers are  expected to undergo an intensive training session in Martinique.    Emphasising that his Embassy offers assistance on the basis  of discussions with this Government, Venne said: "We are here as  advisers, not to say what to do."    Head of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) Lance Selman  pointed out that the Customs and Excise Division as well as the  banking sector needed to be educated about money laundering.  "One can't talk of counter-narcotics and not money laundering.  In the final analysis it is money that drives the trade," he  commented.    His office, Selman said, has been mandated to develop the  capabilities to deal with money laundering.    Stating that his country's contribution has been "very  modest" to date, Canadian High Commissioner Jean Nadeau said on  Friday that Canada has been offering participation in short-term  observer/attendance programmes. These exercises, he explained,  involved exposure to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in their  drug control operations.    Two T&amp;T officers will be attending such a session later  this  month. Besides training sessions, Nadeau said, Canada has  donated a small amount of communications equipment to the  Ministry of National Security and has made a financial  commitment to assist in the renovation of the Narcotics Unit.    Indirectly, the Canadian Government has also provided  assistance to Trinidad and Tobago, he said, through a 1992  contribution of Can$800,000 to the Inter-American Drug Control  Commission (CICAD) and Can$2.5 million to the United Nations  International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP).    Canada, said Nadeau, is also discussing with Trinidad and  Tobago the setting up [of] a communications trunking system  linking the protective services and perhaps Customs and Excise.    Press officer at the British High Commission Simon Bond said  that the UK is placing emphasis on training especially in money  laundering within the Customs and Excise Division.    "In the past we have given small-scale material assistance  to  the police and Coast Guard. But more significant from the UK's  point of view is training. We also give advice in terms of  legislative drafting in the drug area," Bond said.    Besides donating vehicles and equipment to the protective  services, the US Government in August funded a US$18,000 drug  prevention programme aimed at young people.</p>

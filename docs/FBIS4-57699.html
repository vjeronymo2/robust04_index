			<p>BFN     [Text] Port-au-Prince, 23 May (AFP) -- According to  eyewitnesses, the bodies of four youths gunned down yesterday  evening were found this morning in Cite Soleil, the largest  low-income neighborhood in northern Port-au-Prince.    According to some residents, those murdered were followers  of  President-in-exile Jean-Bertrand Aristide. They reportedly were  killed shortly before dawn by a group of unidentified armed men.    Since the toppling of President Aristide on 30 September  1991, Cite Soleil has been the site of numerous acts of violence  aimed at his followers.    It was also reported today that 278 "boat people" (fragile  vessels packed with Haitian refugees) were intercepted on the  high seas as they were trying to reach Florida. They were  escorted back to Port-au-Prince by U.S. coast guard vessels.    Meanwhile, a Haitian business organization, the Center of  Free Enteprise and Democracy (the equivalent of the young  economic chambers), denounced today the "immorality" of UN a  resolution reinstating a nearly full embargo against Haiti and  the "inconstitutionality" of provisional President Emile  Jonassaint and his government.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A small audience assembled for the news conference  of Anatoliy Zlenko [Ukrainian minister of foreign affairs] at  NATO headquarters. The journalists were interested in why  ratification of START I by the Ukrainian parliament is being  rejected by the participants of the North Atlantic Cooperation  Council [NACC] or why it is being criticized. The minister of  foreign affairs of Ukraine noted:    Now one should consider that opinion is changing since a  Ukrainian proposal for the formula was adopted in the joint  communique. The word -- unreservedly -- was removed from the  draft [which said] -- Ukraine should ratify START I unreservedly  and fully. So this means that ratification of START I by  Ukraine is a fact.    In his replies Anatoliy Zlenko found quite a successful  comparison concerning the unreserved ratification of START I and  said that Ukraine had received a terrible gift from the USSR --  the Chernobyl plant and the accident there. Ukraine has been  left alone with this tragedy. It spends 15 percent of the state  budget on eliminating the aftermath of the accident.    And so Ukraine has learned from misfortune, and that is why  it is demanding compensation for nuclear weapons. Therefore, if  our state hands over the whole nuclear arsenal to Russia, it  will be left alone with its problems and the world community  will forget about Ukraine. Another paradoxical fact ensues --  Ukraine needs nuclear materials for its electric power stations  and buys them from Russia. It pays vast amounts of money for  this, and it has not received a cent for that nuclear arsenal,  which it handed over to Russia.</p>

			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ONLY WEALTHY CAN AFFORD THE FARES AT JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT  </P> <P> Now that all the hoopla for the Orange County airport has died down, let's stop  and realize that this airport is basically just for the rich.  </P> <P> Recently, four friends and I decided to spend a weekend in Scottsdale.  </P> <P> Flights from Ontario, Long Beach and Los Angeles airports averaged between $48  and $68. The same flight out of Orange County was $220. Moreover, the cost of  overnight parking is ridiculously high.  </P> <P> Needless to say, my friends and I will be driving past John Wayne Airport on  our way to Los Angeles International Airport (and adding to the rush-hour  gridlock) because the air fares are too high for us middle-class peons.  </P> <P> Another thought. All the executives in my office demand that we secretaries  book their flights out of John Wayne Airport when they are traveling for  company business.  </P> <P> However, when these same executives are planning their vacations and thus every  nickel is their own, they make sure their flights are out of any airport but  Orange County.  </P> <P> NINA KING  </P> <P> Garden Grove  </P></p>

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / The Monday Interview: A whole new ball game: Jan Leschly tells Daniel Green of his plans for SmithKline Beecham in the changed climate for drugs companies At 2 pm today, in London's Barbican Centre, a former tennis champion is scheduled to be installed as the chief executive of the world's sixth biggest pharmaceuticals company. Jan Leschly, a tall 52-year-old with a passing resemblance to Paul Newman, once played for Denmark's Davis cup team. In 1968, he was ranked tenth in the world. From today's annual general meeting, he will be ranked first at SmithKline Beecham, a company emerging from five years of turmoil following the merger of its US and UK parents. His task will be to adapt the company to a world eager to cut the costs of healthcare and in so doing assault the legendary profits of drugs companies. The intensity and toughness that served him so well on the tennis court contrasts with the urbanity of Bob Bauman, the man he replaces. Leschly is keen to state that they have little difference in their approach to the company, but he comes across as a harder man than the orchid-growing Bauman. Leschly says he is a 'nice guy' at a dinner party but that things are different in business. He draws a parallel between himself and his former tennis adversary, the rebellious Ilie Nastase. 'He was awful on court and very enjoyable off it. I'm pretty serious in meetings, but that doesn't mean I can't be a good friend on the golf course.' Being 'pretty serious' has taken Leschly the businessman beyond anything he achieved in sport. A qualified pharmacist, he rose through the ranks of Danish drugs company Novo during the 1970s. In 1979, he moved from being president of Novo's pharmaceuticals division to Squibb, the US company, as a vice-president. Driven by what Squibb chairman, Richard Furlaud, calls 'superb leadership skills and creative approaches to new business opportunities', Leschly became president, chief operating officer and heir apparent in 1988. But Squibb merged with US rival Bristol Myers a year later and Bristol Myers was the senior partner in the deal. With the route to the chief executive's job blocked, Leschly left 'to pursue opportunities outside the group'. Jobless, he sought a breathing space to consider his options and was attracted to the study of philosophy and religion at Princeton. He describes how he was able to get away from feeling 'impressed with yourself as a big shot in a big company'. The experience gave him the freedom to think about what to do with his life, he says. By the end of his study year, he had come to the conclusion that he wanted to work in a new company and a new country. The Dane, now with a US accent, came to live for the first time in the UK and to work as a board member of SmithKline Beecham. From SB's perspective, he was a useful neutral party in the struggle to merge the elitist culture of UK company Beecham with the all-American SmithKline Beckman. In many areas, the US culture won out; among other things, he and Bauman abolished Beecham's seniority-based staff restaurants. There were many pockets of resistance to such changes and Leschly's background enabled him to avoid accusations that he was promoting the culture of one parent over the other. At the time the merger was received with some scepticism. Now it is looking like a success story. The first three months of 1994 saw pre-tax profits rise 15 per cent to Pounds 353m. But the success of the first quarter of the year was really a flourish in the last quarter of Bauman's reign. The first three months under Leschly threaten to produce a less auspicious story. Tagamet, the ulcer drug that propelled SmithKline Beckman to prominence in the 1980s, loses patent protection on May 17. SB concedes that the market will be flooded with cut-price copies and that sales will fall quickly. Yet Leschly will return to SB's headquarters in the unprepossessing west London suburb of Brentford with his thoughts on more than just Tagamet. The whole drugs industry is struggling to come to terms with price competition imposed by drugs buyers  - governments or companies. As a consequence, companies in the US, Europe and Japan are in the throes of a jarring transformation from decades of high profits to the cost-conscious late 1990s. His speech on the 'paradigm change' is well-rehearsed. Leschly insists that SmithKline Beecham will be transformed from a sprawling empire that sells everything from toothpaste to cancer drugs into an integrated healthcare company. He needs no prompting to contrast this plan with that of arch UK rival Glaxo, the biggest drugs company in Europe. 'Glaxo is dedicated to being a pharmaceutical company based on science, development and new compounds. In the next five years we are not going to be only a pharmaceutical company. My aim is to integrate our businesses.' He is far more sympathetic to the strategy followed by Merck, the biggest US drugs company, which last year bought drugs distributor Medco. Every large drugs company operating in the US is now considering whether to adopt Merck's strategy of buying a distributor through which to offer packages of different treatments at a discount. Leschly has no doubts about the principle but thinks Merck paid too much. 'Strategically I believe it was a stroke of genius, but would I pay Dollars 6.6bn?' he asks rhetorically. He refuses to say whether Merck's is the example that SB will follow. He prefers to argue that the new healthcare environment means that economics is now as much part of the drugs industry as clinical trials. Europeans as well as the US are going down this route, he says. Cost cutting and improved distribution might be one way for pharmaceuticals groups to bolster their margins as prices come under pressure. Another will be to invest in new ideas coming from biotechnology companies. 'They have a big advantage over us. They can recruit geniuses because they give them (share) equity,' says Leschly. Even for a company based in Europe, spending money on biotechnology companies means investing in the US. Biotechnology in the UK is 'insignificant', says Leschly. The emphasis on the US is nothing new for SB. Under Bauman, a US citizen, SB became a London-based transatlantic company, that was particularly well-placed to find good US partners. Under Leschly, the Dane who speaks with an American accent, SB seems just as likely to buy its brains in the US.</p>

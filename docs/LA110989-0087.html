			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FISHING NOTES;  </P> <P> CABRILLO MUSEUM STUDY TRIP PROVIDES EXCITING LOOK AT SEA LIFE  </P> <P> The Cabrillo Marine Museum sponsored its first in a series of ecology marine  study trips over the weekend.  </P> <P> Larry Fukuhara, the museum's program director, selected a group who showed  interest in the study of marine life. The Shogun out of L.A. Harbor  Sportfishing was equipped for a trip to Catalina Island with gear for observing  marine activity.  </P> <P> The Shogun was just an hour out in the channel when four playful dolphins put  on a show on both sides of the boat's bow.  </P> <P> When the boat reached Catalina just before daylight, floodlights were turned on  so everyone could see how squid float and are brought into waiting nets.  </P> <P> Lloyd Ellis, marine diver for the museum, made dives and brought up many sea  creatures and some kelp. He also surfaced with sharks he had baited, which were  tagged and released.  </P> <P> Traps brought up calico bass, perch and whitefish, all of which were released  after studies.  </P> <P> Fukuhara said more trips will be offered as part of a series he calls "Above  and Below Catalina Marine Ecology Studies."  </P> <P> Tours of the museum's tanks, holding many exotic fish, are available Tuesday  through Sunday.  </P> <P> Tim Yarbrough of Torrance was first-place finisher in the 13th annual Dive and  Surf lobster contest.  </P> <P> He brought up seven lobsters of legal limit with a total weight of 45 pounds.  The contest was sponsored by Redondo Beach Dive and Surf stores, which launch  the lobster season opener every year in October. About 300 divers participated  in this year's contest.  </P> <P> South Bay Catches: Charles Pfluven of Long Beach, fishing aboard the El Dorado  on a two-day albacore trip, caught the whopper of the week when he brought to  gaff a 46-pound yellowfin tuna.  </P> <P> Thelma Sorenson of Carson, fishing at the oil rigs aboard the Hitless Miss, won  the jackpot with a 29 1/2-pound yellowtail.  </P> <P> Chang Chow of Santa Monica, aboard the Spitfire, used cut squid to win the  jackpot with a 24 1/2-pound Santa Monica Bay halibut.  </P> <P> Richard Cox of Torrance, on the Sea Spray at Twin Roads, caught a 24-pound  halibut.  </P> <P> Paul Chatelain of Carson, fishing at Catalina Island aboard the Sportking,  cinched the jackpot with a 22 1/4-pound yellowtail.  </P></p>

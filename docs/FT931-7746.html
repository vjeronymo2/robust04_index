			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Seed capital starts to bear fruit - In a Nutshell A European programme to provide seed capital finance has exceeded expectations and led to the creation of 126 new businesses providing more than 1,200 jobs, the European Venture Capital Association says. Nearly 70 per cent of the businesses formed have a strong technology orientation with a particular emphasis on software, healthcare and biotechnology. The three-year-old programme is expected to create more than 340 new companies employing more than 4,000 people when European Commission backing ends in 1995. A further 30 businesses are expected to fail. The European Seed Capital Fund Network consists of 23 new seed capital funds set up with European Commission backing and a further 18 established seed funds which also joined the network.</p>

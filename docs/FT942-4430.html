			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Reappraisal of banks helps Frankfurt The markets resumed a more orderly upward path yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT recovered from the nervousness which affected the market on Tuesday as investors took the view that the sharp fall in bank shares had been overdone. The Dax index finished 10.10 up at 2,145.20, but slipped slightly in the after market to 2,143.85. Turnover totalled DM6bn. Sentiment was also assisted by another slight easing of the repo rate to 5.10 per cent ahead of today's Buba council meeting, although a cut in interest rates today was not expected. The bank sector had fallen on Tuesday as news broke that executives of a manufacturer of floors for sports halls had been arrested on suspicion of fraud involving up to DM1.6bn. Analysts commented that by itself the development was not particularly serious for the creditor banks since a consortium of up to 50 were involved, with no single bank believed to have an exposure in excess of DM100m. However, coming soon after the Schneider affair, and with rumours that another property company might be in trouble, the outlook was less reassuring, they added. Among the banks, Deutsche eased DM4 to DM737.50, Commerzbank rose DM4.50 to DM330.50 and Dresdner slipped DM2 to DM376.50. PARIS was driven higher by strength in the bond market, and the CAC-40 index closed the day 23.07 higher at 2,046.81. Turnover was FFr4bn. Euro Disney came into prominence again as the theme park operator announced the pricing for its rights issue at FFr10, at the top end of analysts' expectations. However, the shares initialy dropped to FFr33 before reviving to close off 90 centimes at FFr35.60. Generale des Eaux went against the trend, sliding FFr62 to FFr2,344 in spite of denying rumours that two of its directors had been arrested. AMSTERDAM was lifted by the generally more positive tone on the Continent. The AEX index closed 1.22 firmer at 406.50. Unilever rose Fl 2.20 to Fl 192.50 as investors returned on the buy side following the consumer group's buffeting in recent days over a dis-pute with Procter &amp; Gamble regarding the merits of detergent products. MILAN made early progress, in a continuation of Tuesday's rally, before the market ran out of impetus as investors awaited the outcome of the Council of Ministers meeting to discuss measures to boost employment, tax relief on reinvested profits and an anonymous, flat rate tax for dividends. The Comit index registered a 9.78, or 1.3 per cent, advance to 760.44 but the real-time Mibel index, 113 ahead at one stage, finished 2 easier at 12,078. Montedison picked up L16 to L1,480, after a high of L1,510, in heavy volume of 52.6m shares after the European Union gave qualified approval to its plastics joint venture with Shell. SME, the supermarket and restaurant chain, added L78 to L3,978 after reporting a 42 per cent rise in 1993 net profit. ZURICH resumed its advance and volume picked up as foreign demand increased. The SMI index added 23.0 to pierce the psychologically important 2,800-point level and finish at 2,801.1. Banks encountered some profit-taking but still finished mostly higher. UBS rose SFr4 to SFr1,253 while SBC put on SFr6 to SFr426. Among chemicals, Sandoz rose SFr18 to SFr745 in response to positive analysts' comments and Roche added SFr50 to SFr6,890. SMH was marked another SFr9 lower to SFr801 in further response to Tuesday's comments on the outlook. MADRID edged marginally higher, although Wall Street's early performance chipped away at early gains. The general index rose 1.33 to 324.87. Banco Santander rose Pta150 to Pta4,850 as Merrill Lynch raised its near term rating on the stock. STOCKHOLM turned higher in response to declining bond and money market yields and positive trends in other European markets. The Affarsvarlden index picked up 4.7 to 1,469.1. Trading activity dropped sharply, with turnover down to SKr1.6bn from SKr2.2bn on Tuesday. Interest rate sensitive bank and insurance stocks lead the advance. S-E-Banken jumped SKr2 or 3.9 per cent to SKr50.50. ATHENS finished 1.10 per cent lower in active trade of 1.6m shares as investors held back, awaiting details of the government's plans to part privatise the state telecommunications company, OTE, and two subsidiaries of the Public Oil Corporations. The general index fell 9.4 to 845.14.

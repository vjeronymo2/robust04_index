			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / End of barter leaves N Korea short of oil CHINA'S decision last week to end barter trade with North Korea has increased Pyongyang's problems in gaining badly-needed crude oil and grain supplies from abroad. North Korea, which lacks any appreciable foreign currency reserves, has asked South Korean trading companies to serve as intermediaries in finding new barter trade partners who would supply these goods. Grain shortages have led to reports of malnutrition in some rural parts of North Korea. A lack of crude oil to supply power to factories has caused the North Korean economy to contract since 1990, when the former Soviet Union ended its barter trade with Pyongyang. North Korea has since relied on China for oil supplies, while it has also developed relations with Iran by shipping missiles in exchange for petroleum. China was North Korea's largest trade partner last year with total bilateral shipments valued at Dollars 620m, followed by Japan, the former Soviet Union and Iran. In one sign of the seriousness of the energy problem, North Korean President Kim Il-sung called for increased coal production in his New Year's address to the nation. 'Only when the production of coal is sharply increased is it possible to ease the strain on electricity and to put production. . . on a steady basis,' he declared. North Korean coal, however, is of low quality and would serve as a poor substitute for imported petroleum, which is the country's main energy source. North Korea had expected an end of its barter trade relations with China, which originally had planned to stop the arrangement last year but delayed the move until last week to mollify Pyongyang over Beijing's establishment of diplomatic ties with Seoul in August. Pyongyang early last year requested South Korea's main trading companies to arrange supplies of grains and crude oil from third countries in exchange for zinc and steel from North Korea. Demand for grain supplies has increased in the last two months with the onset of winter. North Korea is seeking rice from Vietnam, Taiwan and Ukraine as well as Chinese corn and North American wheat. However, North Korea is refusing to purchase rice directly from South Korea because of a dispute between the two countries over Pyongyang's nuclear programme that has consequently frozen economic relations. North Korea made its requests through the branch offices of South Korean trading companies in Beijing and Hong Kong. It is uncertain whether the Seoul government will give its approval for the trading companies to conduct the deals. Meanwhile, Pyongyang has asked Beijing for a loan for the purchase of petroleum and grain from China.</p>

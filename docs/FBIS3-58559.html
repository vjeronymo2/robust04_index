ANATOLIA Agency reports that Cetin drew attention to the  fact  that the U.S. secretary of state, raised PKK [Workers Party of  Kurdistan] terror at a previous meeting he held with his Syrian  counterpart.    Pointing out that it is not sufficient for world countries  to  establish ties with Israel in order to bring a lasting peace to  the Middle East, Cetin noted the importance of the security  issue in the region. He added that the region has to be purged  of terror organizations if a lasting peace is to be established.  Cetin noted that Turkey attaches importance to its ties with  Syria, but that Syria should put forward its [word indistinct]  regarding the separatist organization, the PKK.</p>

Speaking at a local  government seminar in Durban, Mr Miller said there should be "no  question" about kwaZulu and the IFP's commitment to the Local  Government Transition Act which was signed into law last week.  This was in spite of the IFP and kwaZulu government having  withdrawn from national negotiations on the act.    At the signing of the act last week, Mr Miller caused  excitement when he said the IFP would "participate fully and  absolutely in third-tier government". Some political observers  said his announcement might have paved the way for IFP  participation in national elections on April 27. However, IFP  national spokesman Ziba Jiyane said Mr Miller was probably just  expressing his own "hopeful" opinion. But, speaking in  Pietermaritzburg on Monday, Mr Miller said IFP leader Mangosuthu  Buthelezi had personally endorsed his party's full participation  in new, democratic local government structures.    In Durban on Tuesday, Mr Miller said he also had the full  backing of the kwaZulu government in committing it to  participation in transitional local government structures.  "We'll participate fully. We want to be part of the solution,  not the problem. Let's go into this process together,  determined to make it work."    While Mr Miller is known to support IFP participation in the  April 27 elections, a final decision on the party's stance will  become clear only at the weekend at a special general conference  in Ulundi.</p>

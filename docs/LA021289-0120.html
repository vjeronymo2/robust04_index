			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> West German automobile giant Daimler-Benz sold trucks to the military in  Pakistan without proper export permits, the news magazine Der Spiegel reported.  A spokesman for Daimler-Benz, Friedrich Loesch, denied that export rules were  broken, saying the trucks were "multi-use vehicles" not specifically designed  for military purposes. However, he conceded that the trucks could be used by  the Pakistan military. Der Spiegel said that Daimler-Benz, based in Stuttgart,  sold Pakistan 237 trucks and 30 tractor-trailers from November, 1986, through  November, 1987. It also said that the shipments were not inspected by customs  officials because they were registered as civilian vehicles. Export permits are  required for the shipment of military equipment or hazardous materials to areas  of tension.  </P></p>

			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Spain considers easing restrictions THE BANK of Spain, chastened by the tremors in domestic equity and debt markets that followed its reintroduction of capital controls to protect the peseta, was yesterday considering easing the restrictions. The impact of the measures was 'huge and far greater than we thought', said Mr Luis Linde, director general of the bank's foreign department. 'This allows us to introduce a degree of flexibility.' From Wednesday domestic and foreign institutions trading in pesetas have been required to match loans with an equivalent sum deposited, interest free, at the Bank of Spain. This triggered the biggest fall in domestic stock markets since 1986 and a 4 per cent drop in the price of the 10-year government bond, whose yield rose by nearly a full point to 13.5 per cent. 'We were acting against speculators. The measures were brutal and we recognise that a lot of other investors have been hit,' Mr Linde said. Analysts said the effect owed a lot to misunderstandings among financial instititions over the full impact of the measures, but that these were to a great extent caused by the confused wording of the Bank of Spain's circular announcing the restrictions. Mr Linde said the measures would remain in force for 'as short a time as possible, perhaps just a matter of days.' Relaxations under consideration include exemptions for currency operations dealing with imports or to balance company books and a lowering of the obligatory deposit, proportional to amount of foreign currency held, that domestic institutions have to make with the Bank of Spain. Mr Carlos Solchaga, economy minister, meanwhile said Spain wanted to avoid 'at all costs' a two-speed Europe, but 'if there must be two speeds for monetary union, then Spain must be be in the top speed.' He was speaking after a cabinet meeting that approved a highly restrictive 1993 budget and proposed a freeze on public sector salaries next year.</p>

			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Ulster-style deal for Scots urged by SNP: Salmond tells government to 'let the people choose' The government was urged by the Scottish National party yesterday to offer Scotland the same degree of self-determination over its future as it has promised the people of Northern Ireland. Mr Alex Salmond, SNP leader, said in his keynote speech to the party conference in Inverness that if popular sovereignty was right in the north of Ireland, 'how can it be wrong in the nation of Scotland where the process of change has always been peaceful and always will be peaceful'. He added: 'If the London government is not prepared to openly declare that it has 'no selfish or strategic interest in Northern Ireland', then let them declare the same for Scotland and make provision now for the people to choose.' The SNP, which had its 60th anniversary this year, has been in celebratory mood at its conference following unprecedented success in this spring's regional and European elections. It won control of two of Scotland's nine regional councils and took a second seat in the European elections with a record 33 per cent of the Scottish vote. Mr Salmond said success had been characterised by total unity in the party that had not always been obvious in the past. 'That's the way it's going to be in the next two years (up to the general election) and woe betide anyone who attempts to put personal vanity before the unity of his party,' he warned. Mr Salmond told the party it had to represent both the Protestant and the Roman Catholic traditions in Scottish society. 'These traditions have jointly helped forge our national identity,' he said. This was a veiled reference to the party's role in the Monklands East by-election in June where it became identified with the Protestants in a campaign that was polarised on sectarian lines. Mr Salmond compared Mr Tony Blair, the leader of the Labour party - the SNP's main rival in Scotland - with the 18th century South Sea Bubble, when companies were floated on the stock exchange before their purpose was determined. Mr Blair was 'the new southern bubble, floating along on hot air, sound bites and photo-opportunities, the party whose purpose will hereafter be determined'. He said Mr Blair had 'taken that extra mile into Tory territory - there is nothing to choose between Toryism and Tonyism '. If Labour's commitment to devolution ever became embarrassing in Slough it would soon 'join the other junked pledges in the dustbin of Labour policy'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Nusa Dua, Bali (JP) -- Senior officials of the Asia  Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum have agreed to  recommend improved cooperation on infrastructural development  and on the nurturing of smaller-scale businesses.    At the close of the second three-day APEC senior officials  meeting (SOM) on Friday, delegates expressed the need to deal  with the region's growing infrastructure demands.    Saodah Syahruddin, director for economic relations among  developing countries at the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign  Affairs, said APEC's member economies have responded positively  to Indonesia's proposal to focus on infrastructure as a central  area for cooperation.    APEC groups the United States, Mexico, Japan Taiwan, Hong  Kong, China, South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, the  Philippines, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Canada, Brunei  Australia and New Zealand.    "The senior officials agreed to discuss cooperation on  infrastructures at their next meeting," Saodah explained.    Indonesia, as chairman of APEC, has identified developing  human resources small and medium-scale enterprises, private  sector participation and improvement of infrastructures as key  areas of concentration.    During lunch after the closing of the SOM, Saodah explained  that the region, which represents 40 percent of the world's  population, will require about US$1 trillion in infrastructure  investment by the year 2010.    The Indonesian Government has also anticipated this need by  assigning the Ministries of Transportation, Mines and Energy,  Public Works and Tourism, Post and Telecommunications to deal  with the challenges.    Speaking on small and medium enterprises, Saodah said the  definitions of "small" and "medium" have yet to be made.    "Some would say that a small business is run by 10 people  and  others say 100 people," she said. "We are still trying to work  it out."    During the SOM, delegates reviewed the results of last  month's meeting in Jakarta of APEC's Expert Group on Small and  Medium Enterprises and endorsed it as an initial program which  will be further discussed at the group's next meeting in  Yogyakarta in September.    Johan Syahperi Saleh, the chief of the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs' bureau for economic affairs of the ASEAN National  Secretariat said the problems of small and medium enterprises  are related to access to markets and financing facilities,  limitations in management abilities and technology and limited  access to information.    "We need policies that are conducive to overcoming these  obstacles," he said.    The SOM also agreed that the expert group should begin to  study strategies for promoting financing for small and medium  enterprises.    The SOM also set tentative dates for the upcoming events.  The third SOM will be held in Yogyakarta on September 10-14 and  the fourth in Jakarta on November 6-10.    The APEC Ministerial Meeting will be held in Jakarta one day  after the fourth SOM on November 11-12 and prior to the APEC  Economic Leaders Meeting to be held at the Presidential Palace  in Bogor, West Java, on November 15.    The senior officials also agreed to invite Chile, APEC's  newest member, to take part in their next meeting.    The SOM, however, failed to reach a consensus on requests by  non-member economies to participate in the meetings of APEC's  working groups. Countries such as Vietnam have recently  conveyed to President Suharto their wish to take part in these  discussions.</p>

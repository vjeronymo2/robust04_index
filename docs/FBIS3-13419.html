			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Shim'on Schiffer] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  is due to depart for Washington this evening. At the beginning  of April he will travel to Moscow for political talks with  Russian President Boris Yeltsin.    Yeltsin sent Rabin a message yesterday with a special  courier  in which he invites Rabin for a meeting to discuss the political  process, as well as issues pertaining to Israeli-Russian  relations. Rabin accepted the invitation.    In recent days, the prime minister has voiced his concern  about Russia's wish to resume an active role in the region.  Rabin publicly voiced his displeasure after meeting with the  Russian foreign minister and his deputy, who recently came to  Israel in a bid to mediate between it and the PLO.    It seems that the Russians were hurt by the way their envoys  were received in Israel and consequently proceeded to arrange a  meeting between Rabin and Yeltsin. [passage omitted]</p>

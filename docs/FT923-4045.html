			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Nordic Markets in Turmoil: Insurers' shares plunge THE gloom enveloping Scandinavia's battered insurance sector deepened yesterday when the share prices of Swedish insurers fell sharply amid fears of heavy credit insurance losses. Shares in Sweden's two biggest companies, Trygg Hansa and Skandia, plunged following reports that the credit insurer, Svenska Kredit could face losses of SKr5bn (Pounds 500m) to Skr10bn (Pounds 1bn). Skandia and Trygg each own 47 per cent stakes in Svenska. Insurance shares were also hit by interest rate worries following the Swedish government's decision to raise marginal lending rates by 8 points. Trygg fell by 5 krona to close at SKr27, while Skandia fell SKr7 1/2 to close at Kr55. Yesterday's falls follow a steady erosion this year in share prices of the region's insurers, which have been damaged by property and investment losses. 'Investors have been badly burned. They are not interested in Scandinavian financials at any price,' says Mr Jonathan Walker, analyst with Baring Securities.</p>

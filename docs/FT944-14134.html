			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Teachers call for action on pensions Compensation arrangements for those who were wrongly advised to take out personal pensions must include reinstatement in the original occupational scheme, the Association of Teachers and Lecturers said yesterday. The call for reinstatement came ahead of today's report from the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator, on compensating the victims of poor advice. The union estimates that full settlement of all the cases it took up where teachers seemed to have received bad advice could cost life insurers more than Pounds 2m for just 140 individuals. Compensation in each of the 10 cases settled so far has been between Pounds 3,800 and Pounds 30,000. Mr Peter Smith, ATL general secretary, expressed anger that many life companies had refused to agree compensation before publication of SIB's guidelines. SIB intended to publish its guidelines by the end of July but said it wanted to assess how workable its approach would be.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Newsletter" by XINHUA correspondent Chen Peng (7115 7720): </F> "A Factual Account of the Capturing of a Crime Gang in  Qiongshan"; Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service in Chinese at 0935  GMT on 9 May transmits a service message replacing the following  item with the item published above]    [Text] Haikou, 9 May (XINHUA) -- It was early in the  morning on 28 April 1994, and Aopo, a village 20 kilometers  southwest of Xinpo Town in Qiongshan City, Hainan, was engulfed  by darkness.    At 0330, four white police vehicles quietly parked by the  village. Hopping out from the first was Yang Shouhua, deputy  chief of the Hainan Armed Police Corps. He was followed by Xu  Mingzhi and Cheng Zhongli, respectively chief and deputy chief  of staff of the third detachment; and Wei Gang, a training  section chief. After they consulted with each other for a short  while, they motioned the other vehicles, and over 40  awe-inspiring special police force members -- wearing helmets,  camouflaged uniforms and bullet-proof vests and armed with  submachine guns -- jumped out from the vehicles.    What happened in the village? It turned out that six  villagers who loathed honest labor -- Chen Pixiong, Zhou Nucai,  Liang Jiujin, Liang Piliu, Liang Pisan, and Liang Pier -- had  assembled a dozen or so young men, who loved pleasures but  loathed labor, and formed themselves into a gang. With such  lethal weapons as handguns and submachine guns -- which they  purchased, and daggers, and home-made machetes and spears, the  gang members made it a regular practice to stop vehicles  travelling on the expressway by the village late at night and  robbed the passengers of their money and belongings. The ways  they committed their crimes were quite ruthless. They also  openly and brazenly went into villagers' houses to rob and  burglarized them. So far this year they have robbed and stolen  money and belongings amounting to more than 200,000 yuan.    Determined to annihilate the gang, the Qiongshan Municipal  Public Security Bureau had on many occasion sent police to the  town to detect the gang's whereabouts.    At 2315 on 27 April, the police, with the villagers'  assistance, learned that the main culprits and other gang  members had returned to the village to rest, and immediately  reported the situation to the Hainan Provincial Public Security  Department, which in turned informed the Hainan Armed Police  Corps, demanding that personnel be sent to the village to  destroy the gang and remove a menace of the people.    After receiving the information, the Hainan Armed Police  Corps immediately met to discuss ways to capture the robbers.  It soon decided to select 50 officers and men from the corps'  third detachment to encircle and capture the gang.    At 0250, four police vehicles with over 50 armed police  officers and men proceeded to the town.    They arrived at the village at 0330. Knowing that the  residences of the ringleaders and other gang members were  scattered, the armed police divided themselves into six teams,  and they adopted the tactics of closing in various locations  secretly and quietly, and acted unexpectedly and quickly.    Soon after they closed in on ringleader Liang Pier's house,  Wei Gang, chief of the third squad and leader of his six fully  armed special force members, kicked the door open and stormed  into Liang's room with lightning speed, and yelled: "Hand over  your gun or die!" Awakened from his sweet dream and staring at  the muzzle, Liang slumped down limply.    When Third Detachment Staff Li Long and members of his  second  special force squad stormed into the room of another ringleader,  Liang Pisan, and turned on the light in the room, Liang was  still sleeping like a dead pig in his underwear.    "Get up, quick!" The officers and men yelled at him.    "Hey, what are you guys so upright about!" Liang still  thought that it was other gang members calling him.    "Open your dog eyes, we are an armed police force!" Upon  hearing this, Liang Pisan sat up in bed. His body trembled  uncontrollably, and he wetted the sheet.... [ellipses as  received]    Liang Jiujin was not yet asleep. He sensed the movements  outside and he realized something had gone wrong. Hurriedly he  put on his clothes, opened the door and tried to flee.    "Stop!" shouted Cheng Zhongli, the third detachment deputy  chief of staff, at the culprit, when he and his squad swooped  down on Liang's residence. In desperation, Liang Jiujin, like a  mouse seeing a cat, dashed toward the village entrance. But he  was soon tripped on the ground by a strong fighter, then he  groaned with excruciating pain.    Without firing a single bullet, the armed police officers  and  men captured each and every gang member by 0410.    From their lodges, the armed police found a 45mm handgun,  two  submachine guns, five long and short muskets, and 18 bullets, as  well as the money and other loot that the robbers had robbed,  including color television sets, a tractor, and a gold necklace.  The armed police had now removed a big menace for the people by  completely destroying this gang, which had committed many crimes.</p>

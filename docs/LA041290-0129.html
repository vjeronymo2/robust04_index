			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> 3 FACES OF EVE;  </P> <P> IN 'PATIO' AND 'GRACELAND' AT THE GEM THEATRE, PLAYWRIGHTS ELLEN BYRON AND JACK  HEIFNER HAVE CREATED CHARACTERS TOO HEAVY WITH QUIRKS.  </P> <P> There's something about Southern women that makes playwrights go goofy. It's as  if a spell -- a cloud of unreason -- settles over them as they create  characters so heavy with quirks they can seem more cartoon than human.  </P> <P> Beth Hansen, with her eccentric nervous Nellie having hissy fits all through  her works, has to be the prototype, but she's not nearly the only one. Take  Ellen Byron and Jack Heifner, for instance.  </P> <P> In the one-acts presented by Cal State Fullerton's new Contemporary Repertory  Theatre Company at the Gem Theatre (in repertory with John Murrell's  full-length "Waiting for the Parade"; see related review), we find three ladies  and a girl, all afflicted by Southern peculiarity.  </P> <P> The more amusing, probably because the topic is so bizarrely familiar, is  Byron's "Graceland." By the title, you can guess that Elvis is the centerpiece  as Bev (Arlyn McDonald) and Rootie (Renee Simoneau) fight over who's going to  be the first to set foot in the everlasting one's mansion when it is initially  opened to the public.  </P> <P> Bev arrives first, pitching a pup tent by the famous music staff gate and  placing a comforting assortment of Elvis junk nearby. She's a middle-aged type,  a little soft in the middle and prone to wearing bad wigs. Bev's got a tart  mouth, but she's all mush inside.  </P> <P> Rootie comes a little later, plopping down on a pillow and eating hard-boiled  eggs from a paper bag. While Bev is obsessed with Elvis as the usual  love/fame/sex object, Rootie sees him as something more.  </P> <P> In a satiric but muddled metaphor for the transcendence of stardom and  idolatry, Byron has Rootie envision Elvis as a spiritual conduit to her brother  Beau, who died in Vietnam. She needs to get in the mansion first so she can  commune with Elvis and ask him to contact Beau.  </P> <P> Bev and Rootie fight, but eventually become pals. Rootie doesn't need a friend,  though; she needs a therapist.  </P> <P> Byron is making a point -- about the danger of replacing real feelings for real  things with real feelings for unreal symbols -- but it's a pretty tired idea.  </P> <P> The sisters in Heifner's "Patio" are both idiosyncratic, especially the  talkative, high-strung Pearl (Karlie Cook). She worries about lots of stuff, in  particular how her going-away party, done in a Snoopy motif, for her sister  Jewel (Kathleen Dunn) will turn out.  </P> <P> Jewel is leaving town to become something better. She's slightly more sensible  than Pearl, with a real career as a hairstylist. (Why is it that these Southern  women are always beauty-shop types? Why not a Southern meter maid, or a  Southern hot-dog vendor?)  </P> <P> Anyway, they squabble about who Pearl's husband loved more, Pearl or Jewel, but  end up showing how much they care for each other in a creamy denouement.  </P> <P> Both playlets are directed by Cherie Brown in a comic, eager style that  escalates the nuttiness of the characters. The acting is also too hyperactive  for its own good.  </P> <P> 'PATIO' and 'GRACELAND'  </P> <P> A Cal State Fullerton Contemporary Repertory Theatre Company production of the  one-acts by Jack Heifner and Ellen Byron.

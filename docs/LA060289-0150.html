			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LABATT WIDENS EUROPEAN DRIVE BY MOVING INTO ITALIAN MARKET  </P> <P> Canada's Labatt Brewing Co. Ltd., fresh from breaking into the British beer  market, Thursday elbowed its way into traditionally wine-drinking Italy with  the purchase of a 70% stake in Birra Moretti SpA.  </P> <P> "Italy is a growth market. Most of the other European markets are not growing,"  said Sid Oland, president of Labatt Brewing. "We will be the third-largest  brewer in Italy with 10% of the market."  </P> <P> Oland would not say how much his company, Canada's largest brewer, had paid for  the controlling stake in Moretti, but industry analysts put the cost as high as  $80 million U.S.  </P> <P> Oland said the remaining 30% of Moretti, based in Udine, will be held by the  Moretti family and the company will continue to be managed by Luigi Menazzi  Moretti, its president.  </P> <P> As part of the agreement, Moretti, which makes a premium beer, has itself taken  over Bologna-based Prinz Brau, Italy's sixth-largest brewer, which, in Oland's  words, makes a "bargain basement brand."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fraction of Labatt Sales  </P> <P> Oland estimated the combined sales of Moretti and Prinz Brau at around $80  million, a small fraction of Labatt's 1988 sales of $1.3 billion.  </P> <P> Analyst Neil Wickham at Canarim Investment Corp. Ltd., guessing at the price  Labatt paid for Moretti, said, "It's probably not more than a dollar in costs  for a dollar in sales."  </P></p>

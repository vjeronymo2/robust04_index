			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Hurd admits regrets over Pergau dam Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, yesterday gave the first clear admission that the government had regretted its handling of a Pounds 300m aid grant for Malaysia's Pergau dam project by admitting that Whitehall officials had conducted an internal inquiry into the affair. In a written memorandum to a group of MPs yesterday, Mr Hurd said that the Overseas Development Administration had instigated 'a review of the lessons to be learned from Pergau'. Mr Hurd said: 'The objective was to avoid a repeat of the way in which key stages in the project approval process were handled.' The inquiry was completed in August 1991, only one month after the ODA had given the final go-ahead for the first tranche of aid to be forwarded to Malaysia. It proposed sweeping changes to the Britain's aid-and-trade (ATP) provision, which supports development projects of value to UK industry. Mr Hurd's memorandum was sent to members of the Commons foreign affairs committee. They will cross-examine him next week about the Pergau project, which government auditors have condemned as 'a very bad buy'. The memorandum repeated the government's claim that there was no linkage between the aid package and a Pounds 1bn deal to buy British defence equipment which was signed at the same time. A formal connection would have broken long-standing government guidelines on aid provision. However, a Foreign Office paper accompanying Mr Hurd's testimony reveals that - shortly before the arms deal was finalised in September 1988 - Baroness Thatcher, then prime minister, sent the Malaysians a letter confirming that aid for civil projects would continue. The letter, dated August 8, was sent to Dr Mahathir, the Malaysian prime minister, and followed similar assurances made two months earlier by the British High Commissioner in Kuala Lumpur. In his memo Mr Hurd said 'a number of important lessons were learned from the Pergau review' and incorporated in changes made to the ATP programme last year. These included: Project appraisals should be as comprehensive as possible and 'involve government-to-government dealing on all important issues like price.' One of the criticisms made by ODA officials in 1988 was that they had been left with too little time to make a proper project appraisal. Any change to the basis of an ATP offer should lead to an immediate review of the project, and the recipient government should be informed of that review. Last year, the National Audit Office noted that the government had repeatedly renewed its offer of aid to Malaysia, in spite of significant increases in the project's cost.</p>

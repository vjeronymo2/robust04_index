			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Heavy penalties imposed over milk quota failures THE European Commission yesterday agreed to claw back Ecu2.3bn (Dollars 2.59bn) in unnecessary subsidies to Italy, Greece and Spain which systematically failed to enforce milk production quotas in the 1980s. The penalties are among the most severe in recent memory, although they fall short of the original Ecu5.38bn in excess spending incurred by the European Community between 1984 and 1992. The reduced penalty was settled upon because the three member states have pledged to respect new rules to curb overproduction, and partly because the EC is offering an extra Ecu240m of special assistance to Italy and Spain to remove 2m tonnes of excess milk capacity. Both Italy and Spain face net payments this year of Ecu100m and Ecu50m only. However, Italy faces a total bill of Ecu1.345bn - which it will 'pay' through a reduction in EC subsidies. The EC will recover Ecu960m from Spain, but only Ecu5m from Greece. EC officials said the penalty levied against Italy was the toughest in more than 20 years. It underlined the determination of Mr Rene Steichen, EC farm commissioner, to make the new milk quota reforms work. A Brussels spokesman stressed that the one-year increase in the Italian milk quota of 900,000 tonnes was only provisional and would be withdrawn if the Rome government failed to respect the rules. The same applied to Spain's increase of 500,000 tonnes and Greece's extra quota of 100,000 tonnes. As late as 1991, neither Italy, Spain nor Greece had a system in place to supervise milk production or to collect the levy, according to a report by the Community's Court of Auditors. The Commission continued to pay full subsidies even though failure to collect the additional levy should have disqualified the three countries from obtaining matching levels of spending.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed response to reader inquiry: "How Many Generals </F> Do We Have?"]    [Text] I remember that in 1991 Marshal Akhromeyev,  chief of the General Staff, stated that there were 1,939  generals for the 3.8 million servicemen in the USSR Army. How  many generals are there in today's Russian Army and the  countries of the CIS?    [Signed] A. Lesovets, Vorkuta    After August 1991, the Russian Federation Army was rapidly  reduced in size, and by April 1993 its numbers constituted  approximately 2.3 million, but the number of generals had grown  to 2,218. Just prior to last year's referendum the president  conferred the rank of general on 256 officers. As of today,  judging by figures that have appeared in the press and that have  not as yet been refuted by the Ministry of Defense, there  are approximately 2,500 generals or one general per 720  servicemen for 1.8 million servicemen in the Russian Army.    There are problems with the surfeit of generals in other  armies of the CIS also. Thus Georgia, for example, has been  forced to increase the length of service between ranks to three  years for junior officers and to five years for senior officers.  The same trend has emerged in the Ukrainian Army, where, despite  an appreciable reduction in troops, the number of generals has  tripled.    For comparison: The U.S. Army has approximately 1,250  generals, that is, one general per 1,500 servicemen (not  counting the reserve).    There were 80 more generals in the Russian Army by the  time of the May holidays....</p>

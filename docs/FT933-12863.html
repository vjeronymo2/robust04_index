			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Sedgefield battles with surprise rivals: With the new map of assisted areas due tomorrow Chris Tighe reviews the fight for funds WHEN THE government reveals the redrawn map of assisted areas Mr John Litherland, planning director for Sedgefield district council, will be listening on his personal stereo at the office. It will be a tense moment. For years the County Durham district has battled to replace jobs lost by the rundown of traditional industries in its area. But this time round its economic development team has been astonished to discover the identity of its rivals. For the announcement, expected tomorrow, will be of equal interest in the south-east. At a conference on economic development held as the recession hit southern areas, Mr Litherland found himself in the company of delegates from the home counties - even, he recalls, from Hertfordshire - searching for ways to tackle the unfamiliar problem of unemployment. 'There was a degree of suspicion at their presence from people from the longstanding assisted areas,' he admits. Caution, it seems, was merited. 'They were learning very quickly.' Just how quickly can be judged from the intense competition unleashed last June when the government announced its assisted areas review. The map designates development areas and lower-ranked intermediate areas where companies which set up or expand can qualify for regional selective assistance and regional enterprise grants. About 2,000 submissions pleading to retain, or gain, designation swamped the Department of Trade and Industry. Sedgefield district has more at stake than most. Its south-west is in the Bishop Auckland travel-to-work-area, currently a development area. The rest of the district is in Durham travel-to-work-area, an intermediate area. According to DTI figures assistance grants worth Pounds 45.4m were approved between 1984 and 1992 for companies in the Bishop Auckland area. In the Durham area the figure was Pounds 12.5m. Mr Litherland realised there could be no complacency about the review. The Bishop Auckland area's jobless rate of 11.7 per cent, just 1.4 percentage points above the British average, means its development area status could be at risk. The Durham status looks vulnerable too, due to below national average unemployment. But by scouring the league table of the 322 travel-to-work-areas, Mr Litherland's team found a possible trump card. Durham ranks seventh in youth unemployment. Development area rating, Mr Litherland argues, is imperative to attract job-creating inward investors. Sedgefield has netted many inward investors including the Japanese electronics group Fujitsu, whose microchip manufacturing site at Newton Aycliffe, an eventual investment of Pounds 600m, has been promised Pounds 30m in regional selective assistance. Yet, in spite of many years of regional grants Sedgefield's job creation is not even standing still. The growth of small businesses has been unable to compensate for heavy job losses by bigger companies. Total employment in the district fell from 35,000 in 1981 to 31,340 at the end of 1989. Mr Litherland's southern rivals argue that they too face the challenge of economic restructuring. But Mr Litherland said: 'The move out of recession is likely to evaporate their problems. In our case it's going to be a continuing battle to attempt to achieve self sustaining growth.'</p>

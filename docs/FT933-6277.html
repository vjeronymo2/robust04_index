			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Reach for the sky It is is a measure of how much the world has changed that the Bundesbank's decision not to cut interest rates this week barely disturbed the upward march of equities. With the ERM in tatters it is taken for granted that other European countries will cut rates even if Germany does not. To the extent that the Bundesbank's stoicism soothes nerves about inflation at home and keeps German bond yields low, gilts also stand to benefit. While that sounds like the logic of a market able only to look on the bright side, it is no coincidence that yesterday's rise of the FT-SE 100 index through 3,100 was underpinned by another strong gain in gilts. A closer look at equities reveals an increasingly desperate search for value. Sectors that led the market higher during August are those that have hitherto been shunned: food manufacturers, food retailers, and pharmaceutical companies. Investors' thirst for yield against a background of low inflation and low interest rates is the driving force. Having underperformed the market by almost 20 per cent since sterling left the ERM last September, for example, the food retailing sector now yields close to the market average. Should that buying continue the index may have further to run. Regaining the market value lost by Glaxo, Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham alone would add another 100 points to the Footsie. While there are good reasons for remaining cautious about drugs stocks in particular, the combination of a low price/earnings ratio and a decent yield is proving a powerful attraction. With no sign of resurgent inflation - and growing confidence that the hoped-for recovery in corporate earnings will indeed appear - it is likely to remain so.</p>

			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CHULA VISTA KEEPS PACE WITH SWEETWATER  </P> <P> Jim Conlin is in his first year as boys' basketball coach at Bonita Vista. But  he is being taught the nuances of the Metro Conference early and rudely.  </P> <P> In a match-up of undefeated Metro teams Wednesday night, host Chula Vista  defeated Bonita Vista, 77-71.  </P> <P> Trailing, 73-71, Bonita Vista had a chance to tie or take the lead with fewer  than 10 seconds left, but Chula Vista's Carnell Penn wrested the ball from Rope  Perry at the top of the key.  </P> <P> Penn then hit Trenell Hicks for a fast-break layup that was ruled good after a  goaltending call on Perry. A technical foul called on the Bonita Vista bench  resulted in the final two points, free throws by Penn with five seconds left.  </P> <P> The victory left Chula Vista (13-4, 4-0) and No. 2 Sweetwater (15-1, 4-0) as  the leaders in the Metro title race. Bonita Vista fell to 8-5, 4-1 and  essentially -- barring upsets -- faces a situation of having to defeat  Sweetwater twice for the championship.  </P> <P> "This is the game that would decide who is going to challenge Sweetwater,"  Conlin said.  </P> <P> Mike Collins, Chula Vista's coach of 18 years, says any victory in the league  is big. But his players are looking forward to a week from Friday, when they  visit Sweetwater.  </P> <P> "Now we know we're one step up in the Metro," Hicks said. "We know we're going  to have to play Sweetwater for the championship."  </P> <P> After Bonita Vista scored 10 consecutive points and took a 63-62 lead moments  into the fourth quarter, Penn, who had a team-high 25 points, took charge and  scored Chula Vista's next six.  </P> <P> Bonita Vista's Allen McNamee (20 points) hit his third three-pointer and made a  pair of free throws, and Penn made two of his own to tie it at 71-71 with 2:57  left. Daniel Johnson's five-foot bank shot made it 73-71.  </P> <P> It remained there until Bonita Vista rebounded a missed Spartan free throw and  tried to set it up for Perry, a 6-foot-5 junior who had 25 points and seven  rebounds.  </P> <P> "He's a big player for them," Penn said. "He's the guy they want to shoot that  last shot. I just stuck my hand in and knocked the ball away." JIM LINDGREN  </P></p>

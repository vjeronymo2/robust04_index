			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kuang Zong (6782 4844): "Social Management </F> Department of the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television Holds  Meeting to Discuss Ways To Develop Strong Points and Avoid Weak  Points in `Call-in Hotline' Programs"]    [Text] The Social Management Department of the Ministry of  Radio, Film, and Television recently called a meeting in Beijing  to discuss "call-in hotline" programs. On the basis of summing  up and exchanging experiences, the meeting mainly discussed  measures to strengthen the management of "call-in hotline"  programs so that this kind of programs can develop the strong  points and avoid the weak points and create a fine media  environment for reform, opening up, and socialist construction  in a still better way.    "Call-in hotlines" are a new form in broadcasting reform.  This form of programs has broken through the traditional mode  of "one-way" broadcasting and increased the opportunity for the  audience to participate so that broadcasting can be much closer  to the masses, life, and reality. "Call-in hotlines" have not  only won an audience but also injected vitality and vigor into  broadcasting in competition with the numerous other news media.  But because management has not kept up with "call-in hotlines"  since their launching, many problems have surfaced in the course  of the promotion of this form of broadcasting by radio stations  of various localities. Some have indiscriminately set up  "call-in hotline" programs without considering program content  or whether or not it is appropriate for the programs to be  broadcast, resulting in too many "call-in hotline" programs and  too much indiscrimination. Some "call-in hotline" programs  discuss topics that are devoid of positive meaning. Some  broadcast boring content and fail to interest the audience.  Some program hosts are of low caliber, have weak ability of  expression, and are long-winded. They talk empty words or  nonsense with the audience, wasting broadcasting time. Some  "call-in hotline" programs of a few radio stations produce  content deviating from the principles and policies of the party  and the government.    Strengthening the management of "call-in hotline" programs  and developing their strong points, while avoiding their weak  points so that they have their own characteristics and enhance  social efficiency is an important question in the deepening of  broadcasting reform. Participating comrades held that it is  first necessary to strengthen general management and refine the  programs, saying: It is necessary to integrate "call-in  hotlines" with traditional form of broadcasting so the two forms  develop their own strong points and are continuously innovative  and the tendency of indiscriminately producing "call-in hotline"  programs in the absence of ripe conditions can be avoided. It  is necessary to exercise control over "call-in hotline"  programs. Radio stations that do not have the conditions should  not indiscriminately launch this kind of program. Those with  some conditions should also consider their own strength. This  kind of program should not be too numerous. It is necessary to  make efforts to improve the quality of call-in programs.  Second, it is necessary to define the guiding principles for  all "call-in hotline" programs and set up sound operational  mechanisms suited them. Programs for conversational purposes  should have their finger on the pulse of the times. They should  keep abreast of the changes in social life and the feelings of  the masses and choose topics in which the masses are interested  and which have a bearing on the national economy and people's  livelihood and on tens of thousands of households. They should  exchange views with the audience through hot lines, propagate  the party's and government's principles, policies, and new  measures and should dismiss the masses' misgivings, vent their  feelings, enhance their confidence, and play a correct role in  guiding public opinion. Hotline programs for entertainment  purposes should integrate education and entertainment. Their  ideological and cultural standards should be enhanced and they  should nurture the audience with healthy and forward-looking  programs. Service "call-in hotline" programs should ensure the  accuracy, truth, and reliability of the broadcast content,  embodying the principle of earnestly and sincerely serving the  audience. Programs that involve social problems should first be  recorded, examined, and selectively broadcast. Moreover, they  should report the results of reporters' interviews so they play  the role of supervising the media. Radio stations that launch  "call-in hotline" programs should establish a sound monitoring  system, a checking-monitoring system, and a responsibility  system that match this kind of programs. They should have  corresponding technical equipment and ensure that this kind of  programs is safe and of good quality through systems and  technical measures. Moreover, it is necessary to continuously  improve the political and professional quality of "call-in  hotline" program workers, including program hosts, editors, and  reporters and to enhance their sensitivity and adaptability to  news to guarantee the quality of this kind of programs.</p>

I am  satisfied with my previous visits to your country and the  meetings with Russian leaders I have had here in England."  British Prime Minister John Major, who will pay a official  visit to Russia on 14-16 February, said this in an interview  with ITAR-TASS, Russian TV, and Ostankino. President Yeltsin  and I are planning to discuss a wide range of issues that will  include the situation in Russia, bilateral relations, and,  naturally, a wide range of international problems and economic  and political issues, he said. The discussions will be very  broad in scope.    John Major stressed that he considered the recent changes in  the Russian Government's cabinet to be the business of the  Russian people. I and all my colleagues in Great Britain am  interested in seeing the continuation of the program of reforms  in your country and the achievement of success on the path  toward economic prosperity, he said. This is in the interests  of Russia, and we too are striving for this. Russia is a great  and powerful country and we are interested in having equal  relations with it. We are happy to help it in any way we can,  but Russia too can offer a great deal to the rest of the world,  including Great Britain. I intend to discuss this in Moscow  with the Russian president and prime minister, John Major said.    Concerning the situation in the former Yugoslavia, the head  of the British Government pointed out that he was looking  forward to the talks in Moscow on this problem. We believe the  aims of the Russian Government are similar to those the West is  also setting itself. We want a halt to the military actions and  to the unnecessary and senseless loss of lives. The main aim,  which I think is also shared by Russia, is to achieve a  political settlement to the conflict through talks, the prime  minister stressed.</p>

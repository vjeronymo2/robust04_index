Of late, there have been accusations about the Thai Army  helping the Khmer Rouge by firing artillery shells against  communist Vietnamese puppet troops.    2. The NADK spokesman categorically and totally rejects  those (?shameless) accusations.    3. It is common knowledge that the communist Vietnamese  puppet troops of the two-headed government has been conducting  the military offensives against the Democratic Kampuchea party  and the Cambodian people at the current 16th dry season. Those  fallacious accusations are part of their bad political scheme  aimed at concealing their defeats on the battlefield and  (?against) the national reconciliation policy and the five-point  guideline of his majesty the king toward national  reconciliation, peace, and national unity in Cambodia.    [Dated] 9 January 1994</p>

			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BANK PRESIDENT LUCE IS 1 OF 9 TO RECEIVE ARTS AWARD  </P> <P> Gordon C. Luce, president of Great American Bank in San Diego, is among nine  California artists, arts patrons and community leaders who will be honored for  significant contributions to the arts with the first Governor's Awards for the  Arts, the California Arts Council announced Wednesday. The annual awards,  sponsored by the council, will be presented by Gov. George Deukmejian and Mrs.  Deukmejian at a black-tie fund-raiser Nov. 2.  </P> <P> The artists chosen are painter Richard Diebenkorn, visual artist;  musician/producer Quincy Jones, entertainment industry; choreographer Bella  Lewitzky, artist, and author Maxine Hong-Kingston, literary artist.  </P> <P> The awards will also honor individuals and organizations involved in arts  education and those that have provided financial support to the California arts  community. In addition to Luce, who is being honored as a community cultural  leader, recipients are: California State University Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds,  arts in education (individual); Phyllis Wattis of San Francisco, individual  patron; Times Mirror (Los Angeles headquarters), corporate patron, and the Los  Angeles Music Center Education Division, arts in education.  </P> <P> "By honoring these outstanding individuals and organizations," Deukmejian said  in a prepared statement, "we also acknowledge the enormous artistic resources  of our state. California is a giant in its creative talent."  </P> <P> The awards, which consist of a certificate from the governor and an artwork  being created by sculptor DeWain Valentine, are the brainchild of Joyce  Pollack, member of the California Arts Council and chair of the statewide  awards program. Pollack said the official awards are welcome recognition that  is long overdue.  </P> <P> "The governor agreed to establish the award at the urging of the California  Arts Council," Pollack said, "the main reason being that California is one of  the few states in the Union not to have an official awards program honoring  arts people."  </P> <P> The awards ceremony Nov. 2 at the Beverly Hilton Hotel will benefit the  California State Summer School for the Arts Foundation, a five-week program for  talented high school students aspiring to careers in the arts.  </P> <P> Gloria Deukmejian will present "The First Lady Award," to a young artist from  the summer-school program.

			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP BEAT / ALTERNATIVE: MAZZY STAR DEBUT A FINE FIX OF VELVET BLUES  </P> <P> The former leader of one of Los Angeles' prominent "paisley underground" bands  and his new femme fatale have made the L.A. record that has drawing the most  attention in the alternative/college rock world at large. But Mazzy Star isn't  the only Southern California band that's been busy in the studio. Pop Beat's  alternative-rock edition focuses today on independent releases by Southern  California performers, rated on a scale of one star (poor) to five (a classic).  </P> <P> *** 1/2 Mazzy Star, "She Hangs Brightly," Rough Trade. Through the early '80s,  David Roback led the Rain Parade on a quixotic quest to restore some of the  values of psychedelia to contemporary rock. Leaving that to others, he then  teamed with the Dream Syndicate's Kendra Smith in Opal, establishing an  aesthetic centered on moody atmospheres and haunting female vocals.  </P> <P> Mazzy Star is more in the Opal tradition: austere country blues with Velvet  Underground bloodlines (one guitar solo practically quotes the Velvets' "I'll  Be Your Mirror"). Singer Hope Sandoval isn't quite Nico: Her cool detachment  rarely translates as aloofness. Electric or acoustic, the settings are stripped  down to basics -- often just a guitar strum, bass cushion and tambourine  timekeeping. A juiced-up Cowboy Junkies for the Bohemian set, Mazzy Star  sustains a dark beauty.  </P> <P> *** Swamp Zombies, "Scratch and Sniff Car Crash," Doctor Dream. These Orange  County cutups' beatnik-folk-punk is sometimes abrasive, but it ultimately  yields an authentic and affecting depiction of the uncertain emotional  geography between the stages of schoolboy and young man. Setting its context in  the Southern California youth/rock world, it has the real flavor of living this  life in this specific place (not to mention the literally real aroma of burned  rubber promised by the title).  </P> <P> ** 3D Picnic, "Dirt," Earth Music/Cargo. Someone must have told this L.A. band  that it should stay unpredictable by emphasizing variety. That's true to a  point, but it's self-defeating when it leaves you with no identity. This  unfocused collection is a long march through punk, folk, country and pop  terrain with little in the way of memorable words or sounds, and the thin lead  vocals often adopt that warbling, smarty inflection that afflicted so much "new  wave" music back in the late '70s. When they don't try so hard, the group shows  some possibilities. But they're usually trying too hard.  </P> <P> * 1/2 Christine in the Attic, "Christine in the Attic," Christine in the Attic.  Beware of fledgling bands in the hands of "superstar" producers. Englishman Ken  Scott's career encompasses greatness (David Bowie's "Hunky Dory") and infamy  (Missing Persons), and his heavy hand on this five-song, 23-minute collection  is more reminiscent of the latter's crassness than the former's artistry. With  huge, throbbing, crashing, orchestral arrangements framing Christine Russell's  theatrical, aggressive rock vocals, it's so preoccupied with being right that  it lacks all personality and spirit.  </P> <P> ** 1/2 Clay Idols, "Falling Down Backwards," Genius. Chamber folk-rock for the  Bruce Hornsby crowd? The L.A. band makes it sound like a good idea through much  of this album, which is marked by a sparkling sound and an ornate weave of  guitars, strings and voices. Steven Schayer's gruff voice -- a bit Bruce  Springsteen and a lot Richie Havens -- is convincing in small doses as he  delivers lyrics obliquely evocative of emotional distress. But over the course  of a whole album it becomes overly dominant and self-absorbed.  </P> <P> ** Nick Pyzow Band, "Adobe &amp; Diamonds," AsFab. The singer-songwriter is  painfully earnest, some of his folk/country/rock is agreeable enough, and he  displays some decent songwriting craft. But Pyzow's dry voice is way too  expressionless to do anything memorable with his lyrics, and the whole  undertaking bespeaks journeyman competence.  </P></p>

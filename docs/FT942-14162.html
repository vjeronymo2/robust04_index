			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / UK Company News: Country Casuals static at Pounds 2.62m Country Casuals Holdings, the women's wear group, yesterday reported flat pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.62m following a year of unsteady demand and rising start-up costs for new outlets. Although profits rose marginally on the Pounds 2.58m reported last time, the improvement was due wholly to increased interest receivable - up from Pounds 40,000 to Pounds 155,000 in the year to January 22. Mr John Shannon, chairman, said the underlying business was held back by a weak first half and disruption caused by the reorganisation of its Wild Women chain and the restructuring of House of Lerose, the clothing supplier acquired last year for Pounds 10.8m. 'There were operational difficulties at Wild Women and the name was too extreme for a national chain,' he said. The outlets have since been relaunched under the Koto banner. The group, meanwhile, sold the Dutch printing subsidiary inherited from Lerose and set about withdrawing from the wholesale business. The reorganisation led to a Pounds 45,000 loss on new operations and contributed to reduced operating profits of Pounds 2.51m (Pounds 2.58m). The performance was also dented by 'pre-opening expenses' at Elvi, the new chain of larger-size clothing outlets, which were written off against profits. Nevertheless, a second half upturn in the core Country Casuals business  - representing 163 of its 205 outlets - helped lift turnover to Pounds 40.9m (Pounds 34.8m), including Pounds 3.6m from new acquisitions. Earnings per share fell from 10.64p to 9.57p. An increased final dividend of 2.89p is proposed, making a 4.3p total for the year, against a pro forma 4.05p.</p>

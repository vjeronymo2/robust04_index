			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jesus Ortiz Nieves] </F>   [Text] Cartagena -- The first live broadcast debate between  two presidential candidates took place yesterday in Cartagena  during a Socialists International seminar.    Ernesto Samper spoke first before an audience of 500.  Antonio Navarro followed; both received the same amount of  applause. It was a formal setting, but there were some small  quips on coastal humor.    The Liberal and the Colombian Commitment candidates  addressed  issues such as the scope of social investments, the size of the  state, job policy, and the results of the economic opening.    There was a sort of unexpected referee: President Cesar  Gaviria, who actually had Samper and Navarro as ministers during  the first phase of his government. Navarro arrived on time,  impeccably dressed in a suit and tie. He read a speech critical  of the government's economic policy and against Samper's  proposal. Gaviria and Samper wore guayabera shirts and left the  text of their speeches aside.    The president said he strengthened the Armed Forces and  justice system. Samper said production will be his priority,  because it is the only way to create jobs and provide integral  social security for all Colombians. According to Navarro,  everyone wanted to take a picture with the neoliberals four  years ago, but today, he said, "no one wants to be in this  picture."    President Gaviria's participation was a type of testament.  He did not hide the fact his government's priority was national  security. He defended it by saying all other problems can be  considered secondary in view of the incredible threats from  violent people. That is why, he said, he substantially  increased resources for the Armed Forces and also strengthened  the justice system. At the same time the president defended his  government's work in the social field. He said social  investments were greatly promoted during his administration and,  in addition, he reprimanded those who try to turn the  macroeconomic debate into the central topic of discussion.    "That is not a relevant topic, at least in Colombia," the  president said. His participation was received with a certain  skepticism, even irony. When Gaviria said the 50,000 people  left unemployed by the state's process of modernization had been  replaced by new jobs for professional soldiers, policemen, and  teachers, a student said: "Aha! You are playing musical  chairs."    The first speaker of the evening was Pierre Mauroy,  president  of the Jean Jaures Endowment, which had convened the  international seminar. The public listened carefully to the  president's speech. Despite the Caribbean atmosphere, the  guayabera shirts, and a few previous, humorous comments, the  audience behaved very formally. After the president spoke there  was a brief intermission. Navarro took advantage of the  opportunity to say the head of state "is reading the figures  backwards," because according to him the number of people with  jobs has increased, but its quality has dramatically dropped.  According to Samper, we cannot speak of security if we have not  yet spoken about production, social investment, and jobs, "lots  of jobs."    Gaviria emphatically said his government has not been a  neoliberal one. He mentioned the subsidy policies for housing  and the policy of administrative decentralization, which has  turned over abundant resources to the municipalities so as to  provide them with drinking water. Navarro said later it seemed  like a paradox how four years ago everyone wanted to be a  neoliberal. Samper also said he believes the neoliberalism  pendulum is on its way back.    The president was dismissed with a thunderous applause. The  fact the president did not bring a written speech forced Samper  to leave his behind as well. His speech was eight paragraphs  long, and even though its main points were an important part of  his presentation, he always made reference to, with a good dose  of humor, other topics that were not included.    He said, for example, Kissinger was once paid $1 million to  get a lion and a lamb to live together in the same cage.  Kissinger did it. They asked him how, and he charged another  $1 million to answer the question. When he finally revealed the  secret, he said he had simply put into the cage one lamb after  the other so that the lion would devour them until he was  exhausted.    "That is not the peace we want for Colombia," according to  Samper, for whom reconciliation must be achieved via a good dose  of productivity, which can generate another good dose of jobs, a  total of 1.5 million, according to his estimates, for the next  few years.    The political debate ended with a handshake and with  Navarro's promise they would see each other again before the  runoff elections and with Samper's promise there would not be a  runoff election, "because I will win by a knockout."</p>

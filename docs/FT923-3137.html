			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Neo-Nazis gaining ground, say voters MOST French voters believe neo-Nazis are gaining ground in Germany but only a minority fear their newly-unified neighbour, according to an opinion poll published yesterday, Reuter reports from Bonn. German ZDF television said it ordered the poll from the French opinion institute, BVA, to find out how far fear of Germany might influence next Sunday's French referendum on the Maastricht treaty on European union. ZDF said that when asked if they believed neo-Nazis were on the rise in Germany in view of rightist attacks on foreign asylum-seekers, 59 per cent of respondents said Yes and 35.5 per cent said No. But nearly 60 per cent said they had little or no fear of Germany and 51 per cent saw Germans as partners. Only 2.2 per cent saw Germans as enemies. The 1,500 French voters were polled last Thursday and Friday, a week after Chancellor Helmut Kohl appeared on a French television show to reassure France of Germany's good intentions in the run-up to the referendum. Meanwhile in Lyons, unidentified attackers knocked over a dozen tombstones and wrote pro-Nazi graffiti at a Jewish cemetery in the city yesterday, eyewitnesses said. The desecration at the cemetery followed an attack two weeks ago on a Jewish cemetery at Herrlisheim in Alsace, where about 200 tombstones were broken. Incidents of vandalism against Jewish and Christian cemeteries, usually by gangs of youths, take place every year in France. Lyon dissident Gaullist mayor Michel Noir and about 2,000 people later gathered at the cemetery with leaders of the city's Jewish community for a protest meeting. Mr Noir, an outspoken opponent of extreme right-wing leader Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, is the son of a non-Jewish resistance fighter who was sent to a concentration camp.</p>

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / FT Christmas Books: The pick of the publishing year - From politics to poetry, history to humour - our writers choose the best books of 1994 Two of my three books focus on England. Adam Sisman's AJP Taylor, A Biography (Sinclair Stevenson, Pounds 18.99) is all that the biography of a historian ought to be. As a controversialist Taylor offended nearly as many people as he delighted, and that in itself gave him pleasure. Sisman sets out to explain not only what Taylor did but what made him do it. Evelyn Waugh, the subject of another excellent biography, presented Taylor with a copy of his Sword of Honour trilogy. What could be more English than that? Arthur Jacobs in his Henry Wood, Maker of the Proms (Methuen, Pounds 20) reveals far more about Wood than Wood ever did; and while nothing could be more English either than the last night of the Proms (even with an intrepid Welshman singing 'Land of Hope and Glory') Wood was a pioneer in introducing thoroughly non-English composers like Mahler and Schoenberg. Iain Banks, choosing a topical and universal word for his title, Complicity (Abacus, Pounds 6.99 pbk), brilliantly and terrifyingly uncovers all the raw, rough violent strands in contemporary British (not just English) society. As a novelist he writes superbly, taking as many risks as did Taylor as a historian. No one would present him with a sword of honour, but he deserves an accolade.</p>

			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Rough Seas: It was a bad time at sea for George Bush. And we're not talking the  Persian Gulf here. On Monday, the President's speedboat conked out off  Kennebunkport, Me., with Canada Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and his wife,  Mila, aboard.  </P> <P> Alternator burnout was the alleged culprit. The party transferred to a trailing  Coast Guard boat. Then on Tuesday, Bush got hooked in the ear while fishing  with son Jeb and Mulroney. "It was not a hostile act," Mulroney joked.  Diplomatic sources said it was Jeb who landed his father.  </P> <P> * Now See This: A group of women protesting what they said were unfair,  outdated laws about public wear led a topless march Monday through downtown  Madison, Wis. "My breasts are not disorderly," read a sign carried by one  protester; another sign read "Breasts, not bombs." The march followed a court  hearing in which Marcia Weisman pleaded innocent to a charge of disorderly  conduct for refusing to wear a top at a Madison public beach. She said it was  unfair that men could go shirtless in public but not women. There were no  arrests.  </P> <P> * Oh Say Can You See: Leona Helmsley, whose husband, Harry, has a controlling  interest in the Empire State Building, said Monday the skyscraper will be lit  in the colors of the American flag until the Persian Gulf crisis is resolved.  The lights go on today. Helmsley is appealing a federal tax conviction.  </P> <P> * A Little Respect: Businessman Warren Meyer wants to enshrine junk mail in a  museum. "There's a lot more to junk mail than Ed McMahon's handsome face," said  Meyer, known as the "junk mail king." He said junk mail suffers from a negative  image; he hopes his museum, due to open in mid-1991 in Los Angeles, will  deliver some respect.  </P></p>

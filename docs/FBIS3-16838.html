According to the present regulations, only deputy groups  numbering at least 35 members are eligible for official  registration. The official registration gives such a group the  right to be represented in the Council of the State Duma and all  rights of party factions.    So far only one deputy group, New Regional Policy, with 65  out of the 219 deputies elected in one-mandate constituencies,  has been officially registered. Thus, a large number of  deputies are not represented in the Council of the State Duma.  Two deputy groups -- December 12 (leaders Irina Khakamada,  Aleksandr Braginskiy and Yevgeniy Bushmin) and Russian Way  (leaders Sergey Baburin and Anatoliy Lukyanov) do not have the  required number of deputies.    During the discussion of the corresponding amendment to the  regulations of the State Duma, Chairman of the Russian Liberal  Democratic Party [LDPR] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said that his  faction will support this amendment only in exchange for the  introduction of the so-called "imperative mandate" which will  give the faction the right to deprive any deputy elected on the  party ticket of the deputy mandate.    "It is not possible for a party to get rid of criminals,"  Zhirinovskiy said. As is known, lately two deputies, Viktor  Kobelev and Aleksandr Pronin, have left the LDPR faction because  of disagreement with the leader of the faction.    The leader of the December 12 deputy group Khakamada  stressed  in her speech that the refusal to register their group means  violation of equal rights of the deputies and the aggravation of  conflict inside the Duma.    Sergey Baburin (Russian Way) in turn spoke against the  imperative mandate because, in his opinion, "each deputy should  be free in voting," and "the discipline in the faction should be  established by persuasion, not by whip."    In respone Zhirinovskiy accused Baburin of "already having  led one parliament to being shot" and demanded that he should  not interfere in the internal affairs of the party.    Nevertheless, a majority could not be found to support any  of  the variants of the corresponding article in the regulations. A  package proposed by Zhirinovskiy also failed to get a majority  of votes. So, the article determining the number of deputy  groups required for official registration was sent for  elaboration to the working group.</p>

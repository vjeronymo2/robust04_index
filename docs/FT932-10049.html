			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Observer: Mixed feelings Good news and bad news in a Mori survey soliciting executives' views on corporate governance. Music to the ears of the sponsors - two executive placement companies - is that most of those questioned were in favour of changes which would boost the number and power of non-executives on company boards. More dispiriting, by contrast, is that not many supported a more objective selection process to govern the employment of their services. The bulk of positions still seem to be filled via the old boy network, and most of Mori's interviewees opposed a majority of non-executives on appointments committees.</p>

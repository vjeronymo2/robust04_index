			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> SIMI VALLEY;  </P> <P> 225 WEAPONS SEIZED IN RECORD RAID  </P> <P> An arsenal of knives, grenades and machine guns uncovered last week at a Simi  Valley residence was the largest collection of weaponry ever seized during a  drug raid in Ventura County.  </P> <P> Police said they found 125 firearms and 100 bladed weapons -- along with  $750,000 worth of cocaine -- in an upstairs bedroom when they stormed a house  and arrested Gardner Ernest Flockhart, 31, a suspected high-level cocaine  dealer.  </P> <P> Flockhart and Robert Dale Lloyd, 27, were charged Thursday with one count each  of possession with intent to distribute about one kilogram of cocaine,  Assistant U.S. Atty. Sally Meloch said. Other charges may be filed in  connection with the remaining cocaine and the weapons, she said.  </P> <P> Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury said it was the most extensive collection found  during a drug raid in the county.  </P> <P> The seizure culminated a six-month investigation by local law enforcement  agencies into a ring suspected of distributing cocaine to residents of Ventura  and Los Angeles counties.  </P> <P> Flockhart was convicted of possession of narcotics for sale in Los Angeles  County in 1986.  </P> <P> As a convicted felon, it is illegal for Flockhart to possess any firearms,  Bowman said. If convicted in federal court, Flockhart could receive a 40-year  prison sentence, Bowman said.  </P> <P> Among the 125 firearms were 12 illegal weapons. They included four  semiautomatic Uzi-type weapons, which had been converted to fully automatic  machine guns. Some guns had been outfitted with silencers, five rifles were  fitted with illegal short barrels, Bowman said.  </P> <P> The departments involved in the investigation stand to gain $700,000 to $1  million through state asset-forfeiture laws from the house, guns, six vehicles  and other belongings.  </P></p>

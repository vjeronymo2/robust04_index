			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MIKE PENNER: FEAR HAS SETTLED IN ON 49ERS  </P> <P> Suddenly, something new fills the air above Nob Hill and Fisherman's Wharf.  Suddenly, fog is out and doubt is in, the mighty 49er dynasty cast adrift like  the runaway Fuji blimp that threatened to turn Ram Sunday into Black Sunday.  </P> <P> "When we lose one, it's like a death in the family," says San Francisco tight  end Jamie Williams. "We kinda take it hard."  </P> <P> So does the city. On most days, it prefers its proper designation, The City,  but during this week of civic mourning, in lieu of black arm bands, all letters  are at half-mast.  </P> <P> The city has been shaken and this time, not by Mother Nature. The city has seen  the Falling of the Forty-Niners, for the first time in a full year, but worse  than that, the team failed to go down nobly, as the local gentry would have  imagined it.  </P> <P> There was no Joe Montana gallantly firing away until time ran out.  </P> <P> There was no Ronnie Lott lunging after his man in the end zone, gripping a  pulled hamstring as the winning pass eluded him by inches.  </P> <P> There was no comeback, no overtime, no one-point loss to an opponent deemed  worthy of the feat, such as Sir Phil Simms and the esteemed New York Giants.  </P> <P> No, this loss was as ugly as the quagmire that passed for the field at  Candlestick Park. This loss was about Captain Montana throwing three  interceptions; about 49er ballcarriers fumbling three times; about Lott getting  beat for a pivotal 53-yard completion; about the Red &amp; Gold defense  surrendering a 95-yard scoring drive in the mud and the rain late in the fourth  quarter -- a total system shut down in the clutch.  </P> <P> Moreover, this was a loss to the riffraff and the rabble, to the black sheep of  the division, to the louts from down south -- the Rams, owners of a pregame  record of 3-7 and the kind of defense Montana usually dunks into his morning  coffee.  </P> <P> Deep-fried and glazed, with a hole in the middle.  </P> <P> Against this defense, which would rank last in a league without the Detroit  Lions, the 49ers committed six turnovers, converted three of 10 third-down  attempts, scored two touchdowns and were held to 291 yards -- nearly 90 shy of  their weekly average.  </P> <P> Not quite sure how to react -- the Niners hadn't lost since Nov. 19, 1989 --  the city has overreacted. Sunday morning, it was God, country and 49er  football. By Monday morning, it was Faith No More.  </P> <P> Some postgame headlines:  </P> <P>  Why Can't They Run?  </P> <P>  49ers' Ground Game Worries Seifert  </P> <P>  Secondary Isn't Too Impressive, Either  </P> <P> The sure sign of panic in San Francisco: When they start second-guessing  Montana. Tuesday, one newspaper printed its weekly 49er report card and graded  Montana out at D-, wondering why St. Joe didn't scramble when "he could have  run for a two-yard TD in the third quarter but (instead) threw incomplete and  the 49ers didn't score."  </P> <P> Next, an appointment awaits with the team they call the Giants, which, this  year, is both a nickname and a description. It will be 10-1 vs. 10-1 in front  of the Monday Night Football cameras.  </P> <P> The 49ers keep saying they aren't worried, but why do we keep hearing nervous  talk?  </P> <P> Offensive lineman Harris Barton says, forebodingly, "The Giants play better  defense than the Rams, I can tell you that right now."  </P> <P> Coach George Seifert labels the week ahead, the limbo between defeat and the  Giant struggle, as "kind of a glum situation." He warns, too, of pressure. "You  don't want to be the team that winds up with two losses in a row."  </P> <P> The concern is justified. Say this for the Rams: They've finally found their  purpose in life. They're not going to the playoffs and they're not going to get  the No. 1 draft choice, but they have served as a valuable barometer in trying  to gauge the weather next Monday night.  </P> <P> Rams 28, 49ers 17.  </P> <P> Giants 31, Rams 7.  </P> <P> Those are the clues as to what's in store -- and good clues they are. The  Giants should beat the 49ers for the same reason the Rams split their games  with the NFL's elite. It involves moving the football on the ground and only  one of the teams involved can do it with power, consistency and precision.  </P> <P> They might be Giants.  </P> <P> New York's rushing offense has the big (Ottis Anderson) and the short (Dave  Meggett) of it, plus a mid-sized rookie (Rodney Hampton) who's a threat inside  and out. Against the Rams, three running backs scored for the Giants.  </P> <P> With San Francisco, the problem is Montana. The 49ers now depend so heavily on  their quarterback that their running game is a victim of neglect. After 11  games, San Francisco ranks dead-last in average gain per rushing attempt (3.3)  and 24th in average rushing yards per game (88.6). Against the Rams, the 49ers  netted 66 yards on the ground -- 44 in 13 carries by Roger Craig, with Montana  outgaining his fullback, Tom Rathman, 15 yards to seven.  </P> <P> Do the 49ers have enough ground force to overtake another Super Bowl? "I don't  know," Seifert says. "I think it's a good question." It wasn't raised before  because 10-0 teams tote few questions. "You win ballgames," Seifert says, "and  you may have a tendency to overlook some things."  </P> <P> In San Francisco, they're not overlooking anymore. In San Francisco, the  two-time defending Super Bowl champion 49ers have lost to the Rams.  </P> <P> Once that happens, you begin to fear that anything is possible.  </P></p>

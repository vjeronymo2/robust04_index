			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Probe uncovers police racism EVIDENCE that managers in the police force are ignoring cases of serious sexual harassment and are even joining in 'racist banter' has been uncovered by an official investigation into equal opportunities in the police service, published yesterday by the Home Office. Strong evidence that women police offers were 'suffering persistent low-level harassment unchecked by supervisors', was found by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary. The inspectorate also found 'evidence of personal physical harassment which had been brought to the attention of supervisors and had not been dealt with'. Some senior managers were not prepared to recognise harassment as a problem and victims had no faith that grievance procedures would protect them from further victimisation and isolation by their colleagues, according to the investigation. The study was based on a sample of 12 of the 43 forces in England and Wales, and covered more than 35,000 officers out of a total of 127,000. 12 per cent of police officers in England and Wales are women. Interviews were held with police officers and civilian employees of all grades. The inspectors report that during the meetings with officers, including supervisors, 'it was obvious that an underlying level of racist banter was accepted; supervisors were unprepared to challenge or, worse, were prepared to join in'. The report says that one force collected no data on recruitment, while in another there was a wide disparity one year between failure rates for male applicants (56.5 per cent) and female applicants (73.2 per cent). The report notes: 'Of equal concern, the force was unable to offer any explanation for this.' Study of recruitment literature found 'a considerable domination of white male images', and there was little evidence of special efforts being made to attract ethnic minorities to the forces inspected. There was no evidence of specialist posts being officially closed to women or ethnic minorities, although women were found to be 'seriously underrepresented in mainstream CID posts', the report notes. A small number of women interviewed 'thought the pendulum of equal opportunities had swung too far and that men were being discriminated against, particularly in terms of promotion', it concludes.</p>

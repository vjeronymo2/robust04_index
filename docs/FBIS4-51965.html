			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 2 [date as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- Public  figures of Japan denounced most brutal crackdown on the Osaka  prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon [General Association of  Korean Residents in Japan] and its branches by the Japanese  police.    A member of the House of Councillors, Hideo Den, said that  the police suppression of Koreans in Japan is creating an  anti-DPRK atmosphere under the pretext of "nuclear suspicion  against the North" faked up by the United States. "The Japanese  Government must probe the truth and apologize," he demanded.    A lawyer, Shigeru Tokoi, said that the recent search reminds  one of the crackdown on Koreans in Japan including the  suppression of national education on the eve of the Korean war.    Akira Iwai, chairman of the Japan Committee for Supporting  the Independent and Peaceful Reunification of Korea, said he, as  a Japanese, cannot tolerate the assault on a Korean girl student  and unreasonable police search of Chongnyon when the DPRK-USA  talks had collapsed and the Korean situation had become more  strained.    Yasusaburo Hoshino, an honourary professor at Rikkyo  University, said the recent search was like a rehearsal to  mobilize the "Self-Defence Forces" in Japan in case a war breaks  out in the Korean peninsula. He denounced this as an  unpardonable act to incite the fever of the second Korean war.</p>

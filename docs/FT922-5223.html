			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / International Company News: Ferruzzi down sharply as debt expenses climb FERRUZZI Finanziaria (Ferfin), the holding company for Italy's second biggest private-sector industrial group, suffered a sharp drop in net attributable profits, to L115bn (Dollars 93.8m) for 1991, against L248bn the previous year. The decline, on the back of a 6.3 per cent rise in sales to L17,790bn, stems from a mixture of heavy debt costs, ambitious investments, and the non-recurrance of the extraordinary items which enhanced earnings in 1990. Ferfin reaped substantial capital gains in 1990, principally from the sale by its Montedison subsidiary of its 40 per cent stake in the public-private Enimont chemicals joint venture. Asset sales in 1991 were more limited, despite the group's goal of concentrating on core sectors. Gross operating profits rose 11.2 per cent to L1,962bn, despite lower margins for polymers, owing to lower demand from big industrial users. The group balance sheet weakened further, with a rise in net debt to L8,198bn from L6,665bn in 1990 and a debt equity ratio down to 0.88 from 0.76. Investment spending remained high at L1,156bn, although a small fall from L1,397bn in 1990 reflected the gradual completion of a heavy spending phase. The dividend will remain at L45 for ordinary shares, and L75 for savings stock. Ferfin made a characteristically upbeat forecast for the current year. Sales in the first quarter rose 5 per cent to L4,420bn, while the gross operating margin rose 7.5 per cent. The Parisian banker, Mr Jean-Marc Vernes, 69, has announced he will retire at the end of the year as chairman of Beghin-Say, the French sugar group controlled by Ferruzzi, writes Will Dawkins from Paris. Mr Vernes helped engineer the merger of two French sugar groups to form Beghin-Say in 1972.</p>

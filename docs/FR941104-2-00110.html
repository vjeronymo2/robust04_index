			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Connecticut Light and Power Co., et al. (70&hyph;8451) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Connecticut Light and Power Company (``CL&amp;P''), Selden Street, Berlin, Connecticut 06037, and Western Massachusetts Electric Company (``WMECO''), 174 Brush Hill Avenue, West Springfield, Massachusetts 01089, both public-utility subsidiary companies of Northeast Utilities (``NU''), a registered holding company, have filed an application-declaration under sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, and 12(b) of the Act and rules 45, 53, and 54 thereunder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each company proposes to organize a special-purpose limited partnership (``Issuing Partnership'') to issue limited partnership interests. Each company will act as the general partner of its Issuing Partnership, and either Northeast Utilities Service Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NU, will act as the initial limited partner of the Issuing Partnerships, or each company will organize a special-purpose, wholly-owned corporation to act as the initial limited partner. The initial limited partners will withdraw from the Issuing Partnerships upon issuance of preferred limited partnership interests. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each company will make an equity contribution to its Issuing Partnership when first formed and thereby acquire all of the general partnership interest therein. The equity contributions of each general partner to its Issuing Partnership will at all times constitute at least 3% of the equity contributions by all partners. In addition, each company will, indirectly through the initial limited partner, make an equity contribution to its Issuing Partnership when first formed and thereby acquire all of the initial limited partnership interest in its Issuing Partnership. Upon the withdrawal of the initial limited partner from each of the Issuing Partnerships, each initial limited partner will be entitled to withdraw its equity contribution. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Issuing Partnerships will issue and sell through August 31, 1996, preferred limited partnership interests (``Preferred Partnership Interests''), $25 per share stated liquidation preference, in an aggregate amount of, in the case of CL&amp;P, up to $150 million, and, in the case of WMECO, up to $100 million. The holders of the Preferred Partnership Interests will be the limited partners of the Issuing Partnerships, and the amounts paid for the Preferred Partnership Interests will be treated as capital contributions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each company will issue and sell subordinated debentures (``Subordinated Debentures'') to its Issuing Partnership. Each Issuing Partnership will use the proceeds from the sale of its Preferred Partnership Interests, plus the equity contributions made to it by its general partner, to purchase the CL&amp;P Subordinated Debentures or the WMECO Subordinated Debentures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each series of the Subordinated Debentures will mature within 50 years. Prior to maturity, the companies will pay interest only, at a fixed rate set forth in the Indentures, on the Subordinated Debentures. The distribution rates, payment dates, redemption, and other similar provisions of each series of Preferred Partnership Interests will be substantially identical to the interest rates, payment dates, redemption, and other provisions of the related Subordinated Debentures. The interest paid by the companies on their respective Subordinated Debentures will constitute the only income of the Issuing Partnerships and will be used by the Issuing Partnerships to pay monthly distributions on the Preferred Partnership Interests. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each company may also enter into a guaranty (``Guaranty'') pursuant to which it will unconditionally guarantee (i) payment of distributions on the Preferred Partnership Interests, (ii) payments to the holders of Preferred Partnership Interests of amounts due upon liquidation of its Issuing Partnership or redemption of the Preferred Partnership Interests, and (iii) certain additional ``gross up'' amounts that may be payable in respect of the Preferred Partnership Interests. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each company's Subordinated Debentures and related Guaranty will be subordinate to all other existing and future indebtedness for borrowed money of the company. Each company will have the right to defer payment of interest on its Subordinated Debentures for up to 60 months. However, neither company will be permitted to declare and pay dividends on any class of its equity securities unless all payments due under its Subordinated Debentures and Guaranty have been made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

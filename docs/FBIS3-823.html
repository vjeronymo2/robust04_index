He warned that any attempt by the  rightwing to disrupt the election process would lead to tragedy,  "and (still) the process will continue".    Addressing businessmen in Johannesburg during his one-day  election tour of Pretoria and the East Rand, Mr de Klerk said  the events which unfolded during the demise of the  Bophuthatswana government should make the rightwing "stop in  their tracks" and think. Referring to the Afrikaner  Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance Movement, AWB] invasion  of the homeland which led to the death of three rightwingers, Mr  de Klerk said "the chaos caused by the AWB and (Freedom Front  leader Constand) Viljoen's people, should make the Conservative  Party's Dr (Ferdi) Hartzenberg stop and think".    Mr de Klerk said a government of national unity under a new  dispensation would supply a political framework which would  create growth and encourage investment. He said South Africa had  an important role to play on the African continent and the  international community saw South Africa as the gateway to  Africa.</p>

			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Economics Notebook: Back on track with a policy to fight inflation It has taken six months. But Britain now has a comprehensive monetary policy to replace sterling's membership of the European exchange rate mechanism. The final touches were provided by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in his Budget. The logic behind the policy was fleshed out by Mr Mervyn King, the Bank of England's chief economist, at a seminar in London last week. The chancellor devoted only six paragraphs of his 1 hour 51 minute Budget speech to monetary policy. The two innovations contained in the paragraphs disappointed monetarists and appeared to mark a dilution of the government's previous stance. M0, the narrow measure of money supply, which had been targeted by the government since 1984, is now subject to a 'monitoring range'. If growth of M0, which consists mainly of notes and coins in circulation, strays outside the 0 to 4 per cent range during the period of the government's medium-term financial strategy to 1997-98, it will be 'likely to be a cause for concern'. The existing monitoring range for annual growth of M4, the broad measure of money supply which also embraces bank and building society deposits, was modifed to 3 to 9 per cent from the 4 to 8 per cent set last November for the period to the end of March. The M4 monitoring range will also apply for the full life of the MTFS and movements of broad money outside its bands should sound a warning to the government. The purpose of monetary policy is to achieve low inflation. Shortly after leaving the ERM, the government announced an explicit inflation target of keeping underlying inflation, measured by the retail prices index minus mortgage interest payments, in a 1 to 4 per cent range over the life of this parliament. This inflation target is now at the centre of the government's anti-inflation strategy. According to the Treasury 'Red Book' published on Budget day, the interest-rate decisions needed to keep inflation in the target range will be based on a continuing assessment of monetary conditions, measured mainly by the growth of M0 and M4, as well as movement of the exchange rate and asset prices. While there are no targets or monitoring ranges for sterling or asset values, sharp movements in these indicators would also trigger official concern. These four indicators are therefore the main determinants of interest rates in the UK. Although the framework for policy decisions falls short of the simple triggers beloved by financial markets, UK monetary policy should be more predictable than previously. Interest-rate decisions will still be based on judgment but not driven wholly by the seat of the pants. But what are we to make of the Budget innovations of the new monitoring range for M0 and the broader monitoring range for M4? M0's annual growth rate has been higher than 4 per cent since February, while M4 growth, at just over 3 per cent in recent months, has been below the lower limit of the old monitoring range. A cynic might suppose that the ranges were modified in the Budget to accommodate these two wayward indicators. The Treasury's feeble explanation that it had widened its monitoring range to 6 from 4 percentage points 'because it now applies to a longer period' might excite such suspicions in the case of M4. But there is a sound intellectual reason for abandoning the M0 target. So long as underlying inflation is targeted, it is illogical and impractical to have an intermediate target as well. Moreover, the Treasury believes that M0 may be subject to special factors that might justify a more relaxed attitude to its recent rapid growth. The Treasury's monthly monetary report in February said that low interest rates could be encouraging higher cash holdings, so fuelling the growth of M0. A more esoteric explanation was provided in the Red Book. It says the growth of velocity of circulation of M0 has slowed in recent years and was close to zero in 1992-93. If this trend persists, M0 could grow at a higher rate than the 4 per cent upper limit of its monitoring range without indicating any resurgence of inflationary pressures in the economy. So much for the policy framework. But the best designed monetary policy is of little use if it lacks credibility. It is here that the UK authorities have a problem. In February, the Bank of England noted that expectations of inflation had not yet adjusted to levels compatible with the 1 to 4 per cent target range for inflation. The message was hammered home last week by Mr King. He pointed out that long-term interest rates in Britain, at 7.8 per cent, were higher than Germany's 6.6 per cent and France's 7.4 per cent. Although British inflation is currently below German levels, the difference in long-term rates suggests that monetary policy in Germany enjoys more credibility than in the UK. The new monetary policy has some institutional trappings for boosting credibility in which the Bank sets much store. One is its quarterly inflation report, which according to Mr King, will be a 'visible demonstration' of the Bank's 'resolve to signal when remedial policy action' such as higher interest rates is required. Another is the specific mandate given to Mr Eddie George when he was appointed the next governor of the Bank. Mr George, who takes over on July 1, has been told that 'his central responsibility should be to support the government in its determination to bring about a lasting reduction in the rate of inflation'. But ultimately, it will be the actions of the UK authorities and their ability to keep inflation within the prescribed target band that will determine whether the new monetary policy gains the credibility it currently lacks. This will take time. At the very least, Mr Lamont will have to avoid changing interest rates for purely political reasons, as was the case last October when interest rates fell in response to the pit closure crisis, or in conditions of muddle, as happened on January 26 when base rates were reduced to their present 6 per cent level.</p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of Sri Lanka (6): Humanitarian effort to feed civilians - The battle for hearts and minds WHEN Colombo put down in bloody fashion a Singhalese nationalist uprising in 1989 it soon found itself having to contend with a volley of international condemnation. Its systematic abuse of human rights also alienated many of its own people, writes Richard Cowper. Today, Sri Lanka is still fighting a guerrilla war but it has put greater efforts into winning hearts and minds at home and abroad. The country is now known overseas for its unique humanitarian effort in providing virtually all the food and necessities to more than 500,000 Tamil civilians living in the rebel-controlled Jaffna peninsula, where Tamil Tiger guerrillas have been waging an 11-year struggle for an independent homeland. 'Normally, civilians trapped in guerrilla-controlled areas have to find their own food,' says Mr Dominic Dufour, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) based in Colombo. 'The government has realised that no rebel with a Kalashnikov ever starves. But this programme is unique. It's the only country in the world where you can officially mail a letter from the capital to a rebel stronghold.' The government started the programme in 1990 and now spends more than Dollars 500m a year, despatching an average of 10,000 tonnes of food each month to Jaffna in a fleet of cargo ships under the supervision of the ICRC. The food is distributed free to about 240,000 people who have been displaced from their Jaffna homes. The rest is sold in shops to civilians and guerrillas alike, under the watchful gaze of highly-efficient Tamil Tiger tax collectors. Mr Christie Silva, in charge of the programme at the Ministry of Reconstruction and Rehabilitation says: 'It's true we do not want hundreds of thousands of civilians fleeing south. But neither do we want to see starvation. 'We have to think of the future: after all, they are our people; they are also Sri Lankans.' No one is pretending the government is without fault. There are reports of malnutrition in some areas of Jaffna. A ban on diesel shipments, to deny guerrillas fuel for their vehicles, means there is a power blackout for most nights of the month. The country's 80,000-strong army sometimes oversteps the mark in its bitter struggle to recapture large areas of the north and some patches of the east which are still controlled by the guerrillas. In a visit this month to the Palaly army-controlled zone, just north north of Jaffna city, I saw several night-time bursts of 150mm howitzer shells. In an area so densely populated anything less than perfect accuracy is likely to kill or injure non-combatants. Reports of civilian Tamil deaths by army shelling are not uncommon. But in the war for hearts and minds, there is some evidence that the government may be winning. A proposal to hold local elections in the country's troubled eastern province is seen as a further step towards normality in an area once largely controlled by the Tamil Tigers. In the north, the growing financial predations of the guerrillas against a hard-pressed and besieged civilian population are beginning to take their toll. Some Tamil civilians appear to have become heartily sick of the war and might even welcome a return to civilian control. But Mr Velupillai Prabhakaran, the ruthless Tamil Tiger leader, does not appear to be willing to negotiate a political solution and Colombo therefore sees itself compelled to pursue a military one. All the hard-won gains could disappear overnight if the army attempts to recapture the Jaffna peninsula, as it is threatening to do. Thousands of Tamil civilians might be killed and the Tigers would do everything in their power - including using human shields - to ensure that Sri Lanka's image was again tarnished in the eyes of the international community.</p>

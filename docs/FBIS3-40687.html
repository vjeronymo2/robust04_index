			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ujjwal Chowdhury: "Farmers Trading Places"] </F>   [Text] It will come as a surprise to many to hear a  sizeable group of Indian farmers not only applaud economic  liberalisation but even have fond thoughts regarding the Dunkel  draft. On October 31 this year at Aurangabad, Indian peasant  leaders from six states under the leadership of Mr Sharad Joshi,  of Shetkari Sangathana fame, took a major step towards putting  together a united farm lobby in favour of economic  liberalisation. A national level Kisan Coordination Committee  was formed to pool the resources of farmers who support all out  liberalisation, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and  the Dunkel proposals.    An earlier attempt to form such a union fell apart after  farmer leaders fell out with each other during the Delhi Boat  Club rally in October last year. Against this backdrop the birth  of a revamped KCC assumes added significance. The new committee  includes Mr Bipin Bhai Desai of Gujarat, Mr Sharad Joshi and Mr  Pasha Patel, both of the Shetkari Sangathana, Mr S.P. Sharkara  Reddy, president of the Andhra Ryotu Sangam, Mr Bhupinder Singh  Mann, member of parliament and Mr Harpal Singh, president of the  Bharatiya Kisan Union (Harpal faction) of Uttar Pradesh, and a  couple of other leaders on its executive council.    The KCC has delineated a platform that positions itself  carefully in the present ideological debate within India's  farming community. It has endorsed the resolutions adopted at  the fifth convention of the Shetkari Sangathana in October. It  also drew up a list of demands and planned a programme of  agitations. Provided the KCC mobilises even one million of  farmers in this country, 1994 will witness a gruelling contest  for peasant leadership. The KCC will represent one point of  view. It will be battling it out with Mr Mahendra Singh Tikait,  Mr R. Nanjundswamy, president of the Karnataka Raja Ryota  Sangha, and other leftist leaders.    Though opposition to the Dunkel draft and attacks on  multinationals like Cargill by some farmers have received wide  publicity, the KCC represents widespread antagonism among  farmers to the statist Nehruvian model under which they have  suffered for 45 years. A major source of disgruntlement is the  belief they have for years been forced to sell their crops at  below market rates under this model.    Echoing the stand the Shetkari Sangathana, the KCC's main  grievance is that the government has done little about lifting  restrictions in agriculture other than to produce considerable  rhetoric. Mr Mann and Mr Desai are particularly harsh about the  fact that monopoly purchasing systems, zonal restrictions,  barriers to the self-processing of agricultural produce and  export restrictions will remain.    They point to the government's accepting of "dumped"  products  from abroad. They complain that three million tonnes of wheat  was imported last year from North America and Australia to fill  up the public distribution system when farmers from Punjab  boycotted government purchasing. Farmer representatives contend  the government was refusing to pay them Rs 300 per quintal while  it paid over Rs 525 for the imported wheat.    The KCC argue the Indian farmer is internationally  competitive. Under the Dunkel draft proposals, they argue, there  will be a curbing of subsidies for European and United States  farmers. Coupled with the lifting of the Indian government's  restrictions this will allow the more cheaply produced  vegetables, fruits and even grains of India to capture markets  the world over.    It also believes that in a totally open global agrarian  economy Indian farmers and other primary producers who have the  benefits of relatively low cost methods of production can  outsell the "modern" farmers of Europe and North America. The  latter they argue have become slaves to an agricultural system  of government subsidies and energy intensive chemicals and  industrial inputs.    The KCC has endorsed the "fourfold" agricultural policy  envisaged by the Shetkari Sangathana. The key elements to this  manifesto include agricultural exports, the establishment of  shops to build direct links with consumers of agricultural  produce, the direct home processing of such produce, and  experimental agriculture which seeks to minimise the costs of  chemical fertilisers and other inputs.    Pro-Dunkel farmers groups are organisationally far weaker  than those standing for swadeshi and restrictions on  multinationals. Except for Maharashtra and Punjab, they do not  have a significant presence in most states, irrespective of the  claims of the leaders. However if the KCC sticks to some popular  demands--like raising the government's procurement prices--their  support base may expand in the long run.    The KCC also voices the popular view that in the name of  ending subsidies, the rates for electricity, water and so on  were being unreasonably increased. But there was no effort to  improve these services. It suggests that administrative  expenditure should be slashed through the introduction of a  fixed tenure system, stopping all further recruitments and  freezing the scales of salaries and allowances.    The KCC in principle also supports the abolition of  subsidies  and the provision of only commercial loans by banks for farmers.  For obvious reasons however the organisation is not pushing  these points of view too loudly when it speaks to ordinary  farmers.    The KCC main challenge will be to ably answer the criticisms  of the Dunkel proposals and liberalisation put forth by other  farmers' leaders. Mr Nanjundaswamy, for example, argues that the  proposed Dunkel patenting of agricultural products and processes  will deprive third world research and development and poses  ethical questions regarding the ownership of biodiversity.    After making the Indian peasantry dependent on subsidies,  quotas, chemical fertilisers and high yielding seeds promoted by  the West, the sudden withdrawal of all these under  liberalisation may cripple the Indian farmer rather than teach  him to stand on his own. This is something else the KCC needs to  give some thought to.    The leftist farmer groups are critical of the KCC's  opposition to radical land redistribution and the strong support  it receives from the rich farmer class. The KCC needs to respond  to these questions before Indian farmers will lend their full  support to Dunkel.</p>

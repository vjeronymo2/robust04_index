			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- The largest opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) submitted a no-confidence motion  Thursday [23 June] to the House of Representatives against the  government of Prime Minister Hata shortly after the Diet passed  the overdue budget for fiscal 1994.    The LDP decided to submit the motion during its Executive  Council meeting Wednesday, saying the government has not made  sufficient efforts to clarify former Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa's suspected personal financial irregularities.    If the lower house approves the motion, Hata must either  resign en masse with his cabinet or dissolve the house for a  snap general election.    But it is not clear whether the LDP will have the support  from the second largest opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP)  needed to muster a majority of votes to pass the motion.    The SDP, which split from the ruling alliance in April,  indicated earlier it may join the LDP in pushing the motion but  displayed willingness Wednesday to mend frayed ties with the  coalition.    Hata and SDP head Tomiichi Murayama were scheduled to meet  later Thursday to discuss a possible realliance.    The LDP and the ruling coalition are courting the SDP since  both sides are short of a majority in the Diet.    The LDP urged the SDP earlier Thursday to hold a meeting of  the two parties' leaders to discuss a plan to set up a new  government.    The current Diet session ends next Wednesday.</p>

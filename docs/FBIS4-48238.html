			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   PWV Provincial Cabinet Viewed -- "The ANC, entitled to seven  out of 10 portfolios in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand,  Vereeniging], has retained the real heavy-weight positions,"  begins the Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 16 May in a page  10 editorial. "It is clear that Premier Tokyo Sexwale has borne  in mind the party's allies -- Cosatu [Congress of South African  Trade Unions] and the SACP [South African Communist Party] -- as  well as SANCO [South African National Civics Organization] in  constituting his cabinet." These men are apartheid survivors,  "but their single-minded involvement in the struggle against  apartheid has a down side when it comes to assuming the reins of  power. Few have had either the training or the necessary  experience of formal, specialised administration which would  assist them in the task ahead." The move to provide "strategic  management teams" to support Cabinet ministers is welcomed, but  delivering on election promises is what will make or break the  government.  <H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>   Budget Priorities for New Government -- "This week one of  the  toughest tasks of government begins in earnest -- finalising the  settling of spending priorities ahead of next month's national  budget," states the Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 16  May in a page 12 editorial. ANC economic officials want to be  judged by the 1995/96 budget, but the 94/95 budget "will  nevertheless provide some early indications of what is to come."  The rest of the editorial questions whether Minister Without  Portfolio Jay Naidoo is "equipped" to coordinate the  Reconstruction and Development Program with other ministers.    Democratic Party's "Devastating Blow" in Election --  "Despite  the support of the bulk of the English language Press, the  Democratic Party [DP] was comprehensively rejected at the  polls," begins the Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 16  May in a page 12 editorial. "It was a devastating blow to a  party that so often stood alone in its dedication to democracy  itself. It played an important role, not only in opposing  apartheid in the dark years but in championing the rights of the  individual in the shaping of the interim constitution. Yet it  was defeated by what DP chairman Ken Andrew correctly described  as the forces of history -- the ANC and the National Party."  Continuing the editorial states that "there is no reason why it  should not establish itself again as a voice commanding  respect." "Zach de Beer's departure gives the party the chance  to make a fresh start."</p>

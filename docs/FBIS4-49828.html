			<p>BFN     [Text] Stockholm, May 10 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Chairman of  the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Li Ruihuan held talks here today  with Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt on joint efforts to  promote bilateral relations.    Li Ruihuan said that China and Sweden are far away from each  other, and have no conflict of basic interests.    He said that there is great potential for economic  cooperation because the economies of the two countries are  mutually complementary.    Li said China is carrying out large scale economic  development and Swedish advanced technology and management  experience could be very useful.    Bildt spoke highly of China's great achievements in economic  reform, saying that it is important not only for China but also  for Eastern Asia and the world economy.    The Swedish prime minister said that bilateral relations  between China and Sweden have developed rapidly in recent years.    He also expressed Swedish support for China's reentry into  the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT).    Sweden is the second stop on Li's five-European-nation tour  which has already taken him to Finland and includes Norway,  Denmark and Belgium.</p>

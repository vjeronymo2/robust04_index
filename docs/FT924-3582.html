			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Letter: Chapter 11: a good means to get things right Sir, The article, 'Stepping back from the brink' by Mr Thomas Wyatt (Management, December 1) was of great interest. CVAs (Company Voluntary Agreements) appear remarkably similar to Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code, save some of the legal safeguards. The benefits of Chapter 11 often outweigh the risks, even in the litigious US. The company remains in operation. Employees still have a job. Contingent liabilities, which are often very sizeable, can be retired in an orderly manner. Furthermore, and rarely considered, customers are not left high and dry. Most important, management which best knows the business and how the company got into trouble, is empowered legally with the responsibility to get things right. The result is often a company which reinvents itself. A company which is forced to focus on every available resource in order to extract maximum value. Chapter 11 thus has not only the obvious economic rationale. It is also a potent fine-tuner of human capital. Assuming that those most damaged by the past will learn from mistakes, the Debtor in Possession (as called in the US) of necessity becomes a more flexible, a better 'educated' and a more creative manager. A step back from the brink can be a galvanising event on the way to greater capabilities for the survivor.

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Italian PM in pledge on Fininvest Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, yesterday pledged a speedy introduction of legislation to prevent a conflict of interest with his ownership of Fininvest, Italy's second largest private business group. The promise came in the wake of the weekend publication of a report by three jurists, commissioned by Mr Berlusconi in May, recommending a conflict of interest law. Mr Berlusconi hinted he was not entirely happy with the report's recommendations. 'It seems to me the solution found is tough and inflexible, more inflexible than in other countries,' he said. The jurists said Mr Berlusconi could not to be forced to divest ownership of Fininvest; but he would have to consider voluntary divestiture or the appointment of a trustee to control the group while he held office. By committing himself to early legislation, Mr Berlusconi appeared anxious to resolve the conflict of interest issue. Since becoming prime minister five months ago, he has come up against many problems arising from his ownership of an empire which spans television, films, publishing, chain stores and financial services. As debate on the report began yesterday in the senate, members of the right-wing coalition government were arguing on the need for a prior agreement on the legislation. This would ensure a smooth and speedy parliamentary passage - providing the populist Northern League co-operated. The League has been mild in its comments on the report despite the threats of Mr Umberto Bossi, the leader, that he would cause difficulties over the conflict of interest. However, the opposition voiced concern over the lack of provision in the proposals for independent monitoring of abuses. The two bodies nominated in the report - the anti-trust authority and the media watch-dog commission - are both controlled by parliament.</p>

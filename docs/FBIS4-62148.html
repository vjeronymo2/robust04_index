			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yevgeniy Bovkun and Boris Vinogradov report: "Boris </F> Yeltsin Believes Helmut Kohl, Who Promises That Germany Will Not  Turn Its Back on Russia When Its Troops Leave"]    [Text] Bonn -- The Russian president and the FRG  chancellor have eliminated with surprising ease the  misunderstandings over the Russian troops' withdrawal procedure:  The send-off will take place in Berlin 31 August, without the  allies. They will leave, as agreed earlier, in September.  There will be a meeting of the two countries' cultural figures  in Weimar. The annoying incident in bilateral relations is  considered closed. As Boris Yeltsin said, his friend Helmut  Kohl detected the mood of the guest from Moscow and of the  Russian public in his first sentence. Sacrificing election  considerations, Helmut Kohl found within himself the courage to  abandon in time a procedure that was humiliating for the Russian  Army.    General Matvey Burlakov, commander of the Western Group of  Forces, declared with relief that "it is even simpler" to leave  separately [ukhodit po otdelnosti].    Boris Yeltsin proposed appending the final period mark to  the  past at the conference of heads of state and government of the  CSCE countries which will be held in Budapest in December. In  the president's opinion, new principles of an international  structure for the year 2000 must be formulated there. The 50th  anniversary of the end of World War II can also be a suitable  moment for the collective drawing of a line under the past.    Military topics were thereby virtually exhausted in the  talks. The establishment of Russia's closer relationship with  NATO was postponed to a future date. Helmut Kohl confirmed the  FRG's fidelity to the "partnership for peace" concept.  President Yeltsin replied that he cannot sign this document  until the Russian side has drawn up and agreed an additional  protocol taking into account the special features of the  3-million-strong army with its unique armament, which not one  Western state possesses.    A protocol amending the "partnership for peace" concept for  Russia's part will start to be prepared within the next few  days. German commentators point out that Russia is increasingly  confidently declaring its geopolitical interests and the need to  reckon with it as a great power. Kohl, incidentally, did not  stint epithets when recalling Russia's greatness and its  historical role in Europe's development.    To all appearances, Moscow diplomats still do not know which  way Germany will go after it has seen off the last Russian  soldier. Will its desire to support the Russian reforms not  cool, preferring closer and more reliable partners in the West?  Much attests that it is already pretty tired of being one of  Moscow's most active and generous helpers. Boris Yeltsin  believes in the chancellor's decency and political experience  and considers him the guarantor of a further strengthening of  bilateral ties. But what if another chancellor accedes to power  here in November, after the Bundestag elections?    In conclusion, about the work of the Russian officials who  organized the visit. They operated in the best traditions of  the stagnation period. On a directive from the Russian Embassy  the texts of Boris Yeltsin's after-dinner speeches were kept in  the press center's desk practically until the need for them had  evaporated. On the eve of the news conference the press service  not only decided who would put questions to the president and  the chancellor but also thought up these questions itself. In  the space of some two years, if you recall his previous visit to  the FRG, the president has been clothed in impenetrable  bureaucratic armor.</p>

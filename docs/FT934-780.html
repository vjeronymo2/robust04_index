			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / French probe is launched over Tapie business Mr Bernard Tapie, the flamboyant French politician and businessman who owns the Olympique-Marseille football club, is to be officially investigated by magistrates over alleged financial malpractice at Testut, one of his businesses. Mr Tapie, who was minister of urban affairs in the last socialist government and is a protege of Mr Francois Mitterrand, the French president, was questioned yesterday about the Testut affair by judges at Bethune in northern France. His parliamentary immunity was lifted earlier this month by a special National Assembly vote so that he could be questioned. The judges announced after questioning that Mr Tapie had been formally placed under investigation. The case concerns allegations that Testut bought Trayvou, a loss-making company also owned by Mr Tapie, at an inflated price, only to sell it back to him for a token sum after increasing its capital by FFr30m (Pounds 3.4m). Mr Tapie has repeatedly denied that any financial irregularities occurred. The next stage of the French legal procedure would be for Mr Tapie to go on trial. If he were found guilty he would risk losing his parliamentary seat and face personal bankruptcy. Recent estimates have suggested that he has personally-guaranteed bank loans of up to FFr1bn. Mr Tapie was until recently lauded as a working class hero by the French public, but his image has been badly damaged by this summer's scandal over alleged match rigging by Olympique-Marseille officials and more recently by the Testut affair. He topped the 'biggest disappointment of the year' poll in this week's Paris-Match magazine, beating the French football team, which failed to qualify for the World Cup, into second place.</p>

			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Kinnock in pledge on nursery places  -Women COUNCILS would be required to use all the spending that the government estimated they needed for nursery education, under Labour plans outlined yesterday as part of an offensive to capture women's votes. At a press conference to launch 'Woman Today', a magazine pulling together Labour policies for women, Ms Hilary Armstrong, who speaks for the party on education, said a Labour government would ensure local authorities did not underspend on provision for the under-fives to keep poll tax bills down. If all the money was spent on nursery education, almost 23,000 extra places could be provided at no extra cost to central government, Ms Armstrong said. Labour did not have a figure for what this would mean for poll tax bills. Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour leader, emphasised that the best providers of nursery education were Labour authorities, many of which were in areas of social stress. 'If it can be done there, it can be done in a lot more places,' he said. Mrs Ann Taylor, a member of Labour's shadow cabinet, hailed the magazine - which will be distributed primarily in marginal seats - as the first of its kind for any political party. It showed 'the relevance of Labour party policies and Labour priorities to millions of women of all ages throughout the country'.</p>

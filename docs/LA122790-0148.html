			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLA WAR IS HELPING RESCUE NATION'S SCHOOLS  </P> <P> Buy a soft drink, help a school. Budget's tight, call a cola company.  </P> <P> That is the thinking behind the unusual partnership between the nation's  leading beverage companies and many parents and principals.  </P> <P> In Moodus, Conn., the entire town is collecting Pepsi caps to save the  dilapidated Nathan Hale-Ray High School. In the first three weeks, children  saved 20,000 caps. At a nickel apiece, the caps won't cover $9 million in  expenses, but the fund-raising drive has raised hopes. The students have even  suggested renaming the school "Pepsi-Cola High School."  </P> <P> It's also good business for Pepsico Inc., Pepsi-Cola's parent company. Local  stores have increased their orders; one pharmacy ordered 6,000 bottles, said  teacher Adam Friedman.  </P> <P> At Weymouth High School in Massachusetts, Pepsi and Coca-Cola are fighting over  the chance to erect a new $5,000 scoreboard. Pepsi has warned it won't donate  the board if the Coke vending machine remains in the school gym. Coke has made  a counteroffer to provide a similar board.  </P> <P> School officials, once hesitant to mingle educational purposes with commercial  ventures, say tight fiscal times have made these partnerships more appealing.  </P> <P> "I generally oppose endorsing products," said Francis Corbett, a school  committee member. "But if we're going to make a pact with the devil, let's get  the best deal we can."  </P> <P> The National Assn. of Secondary School Principals supports school-corporate  partnerships if children aren't corrupted in the process.  </P> <P> "They should not cross the line where they are using students for their own  profit motives," said spokesman Lew Armistead. He said the association had  objected to Channel One, a project of Knoxville, Tenn.-based Whittle  Communications, which provides schools with special television news programming  that is mixed in with advertising.  </P> <P> The beverage makers, already renowned for innovative ways to reach consumers,  have become more creative about reaching young buyers.  </P> <P> Pepsi's "Be Excellent" video, a montage of pop stars and athletes preaching  anti-drug and -alcohol themes, has been shown to 3 million students in 2,700  high schools across the country this year, said spokesman Andrew Giangola.  </P> <P> Students at Pinkston High in Dallas and Southwestern High School in Detroit are  eligible for $2,000 in scholarships if they meet attendance, grade and  drug-free goals.  </P> <P> Coca-Cola donated $50,000 to the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Assn.  to keep the state's high school basketball tournament afloat.  </P> <P> The cola companies, maintaining they have always been dedicated to community  service, say interest in the programs has jumped dramatically in the last year.  </P> <P> "Schools are extremely cash-strapped and looking to corporate America to help  out wherever possible," Giangola said. "This is a great example of how  businesses can help schools and schools can help businesses."  </P> <P> Pepsi usually requires schools to install its vending machines in return for  scoreboards, computer equipment or cash bonuses.  </P> <P> Coca-Cola, according to one vice president, does not make such deals.  </P> <P> "We don't hold anything over their head," said Donald Dowd, noting Coke  sponsors high school athletic events, rewards athletes of the week and donates  money to local boys and girls clubs.  </P> <P> But, he added, "We've been very fortunate, because of our activities, to get  the endorsement of these schools. That's business."  </P> <P> For Pepsi, "We're selling the product by virtue of the fact we have a vending  machine on site," said Ken Kimmel, New England marketing director.  </P></p>

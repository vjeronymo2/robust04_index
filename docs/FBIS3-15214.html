Karimov: "Islam Karimov: We </F> Are Reliable Partners"]    [Text] History itself has predestined Uzbekistan to be at  the crossroads of the main roads in Eurasia linking West and  East, South and North. Our republic can become a Eurasian  economic and cultural bridge where preconditions are created for  the movement and exchange of goods, technologies, investment,  and cultural assets.    Amid the breakdown of the once unified financial and  monetary-credit systems, the severing of economic ties, and  galloping inflation Uzbekistan found itself in a difficult  starting position two years ago, which set us two complex tasks:  On the one hand, we had to implement the in-depth reforms  involved in the transition to a market economy and, on the  other, adopt urgent measures to stabilize the economy and  prevent a drastic drop in the population's prosperity.    In these conditions, in order to overcome the grave legacy  of  the past, enable the all-around transformation of the economy,  and secure economic independence for Uzbekistan based on  historical, national specific conditions, our people's way of  life and mentality that have developed over the centuries, and  at the same time the difficult experience gleaned by countries  that have covered this thorny route, we chose our own means of  development based on five basic principles, which boil down to  the following:    the priority of the economy over politics. At the same time  both domestic economic strategy and foreign economic relations  must be completely rid of the influence of any political  ideology;    the regulating role of the state as the initiator of  economic  reforms and the main implementer thereof. Since it is  accountable for choosing strategic priorities in the economy and  shaping a legal base and assists in forming and developing  entrepreneurial and reforming state managerial structures as  well as credit, tax, and currency policy and creating conditions  to attract investment, and prepare the population for reforms;    the supremacy of the law in all spheres of public life;    the implementation of a strong social policy designed to  protect the population, particularly socially vulnerable groups,  the disabled, children, and large families. The state can only  consider itself humane when it can defend its population,  particularly during the crucial transitional period;    a phased transition to the market.    The real economic situation, specific demographic  conditions,  and the low standard of living of the overwhelming number of  families make the "shock therapy" route unacceptable for the  republic during the transition to the market. Time is needed to  change the organizational, economic, and financial-credit  systems, create the appropriate legal base and a market  infrastructure, and train cadres.    Uzbekistan has a wealth of natural economic and mineral raw  material resources. Prospected stocks of over 750 kinds of  mineral resources alone are estimated at around $3 trillion.    Today we have a program and a fairly clear idea of how to  implement reforms in the republic. Our domestic policy is  geared to a gradual phased transition to a socially oriented  market economy which precludes revolutionary upheaval and the  mass impoverishment of the people.    Reforms are not an end in themselves for us but a means of  really giving broad strata of the population access to property,  reviving the sense of ownership, and creating on this basis the  conditions for the development of initiative and enterprise.    The Uzbek Constitution well and truly paves the way for  market relations, ensures freedom of enterprise, and prevents  the state having the monopoly to interfere in economic activity.  Our Fundamental Law stresses that private ownership comes under  state protection.    We regard the stage-by-stage implementation of reforms as a  necessary condition for the preservation of sociopolitical  stability. But it is also true that the very stability of the  situation in turn enables reforms to be carried out in a  well-considered, well-gauged manner without artificially  speeding events up for political motives.    The implementation of a strong social policy is a clear  priority during all stages of reform and a guarantor of its  irreversibility for us. Over the years of independence a new  mechanism of social protection has in effect been created for  the population, oriented to targeted support for the most needy  strata during the transition to the market.    This has been reflected in a guaranteed minimum wage and  pension, the organization of rationed supply of the most  important foodstuffs, the provision of compensatory payments,  etc.    Attaching great importance to deepening multilateral  cooperation between the republics of the former Union,  Uzbekistan from the outset supported the idea of forming the  Commonwealth of Independent States. We think that its potential  has by no means been exhausted. The Treaty of Economic Union  reveals good prospects in this respect. At present there is the  task of ensuring the real fulfillment of the provisions  enshrined therein.    While cooperating within the CIS framework, we do at the  same  time attach great importance to the process of integration  within the Central Asian region. Considerable progress has been  made here in our relations with the Republic of Kazakhstan and  Republic of Kyrgyzstan.    Needless to say, by no means all our problems have been  resolved, we still have a very difficult life. Over the  previous decades our republic's economy developed a great  dependence on imports of a wide range of output and consumer  goods. The severing of economic ties and the worsening of the  payment problem owing to unilateral actions taken by certain  circles to bring down the ruble zone are having a painful effect  on many of our enterprises and the economy as a whole.    Of course, it would be wrong in present-day conditions to  raise the question of literally reviving all the economic ties  on which the old Union-wide division of labor was based. It is  a question of preserving partnership in mutually beneficial  spheres and organizing new ties in order to ease for each state  not only the process of economic stabilization, but also its  structural reorganization in line with the inexorable  requirements of the world market.    The move to international principles of settlement has  considerably reduced our once extensive links with partners in  East Europe. Whereas in 1990 CEMA countries accounted for  around 60 percent of Uzbekistan's exports, these days they  account for less than 8 percent. However, we have no intention  of abandoning procurements of transport systems from the Czech  Republic, medicines and food from Hungary, and certain kinds of  agricultural produce from China.    The current stage of economic reforms involves the  considerable liberalization of foreign economic relations. It  is envisaged that customs duties on imports of all kinds of  goods will be abolished, export duties reduced, and a  competitive procedure for licensing exports from the republic  introduced; a state insurance company for Uzbek and foreign  investments has been set up to which some of Uzgoskhran's assets  will be transferred. All this creates a good base for  expanding our cooperation and for jointly resolving the problems  of overcoming crisis processes.</p>

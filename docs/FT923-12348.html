			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Survey of International Capital Markets (3): Directors' dilemma - Companies widen their search THE search for reliable sources of debt finance is likely to be one of the central concerns of companies and corporate financiers in the 1990s. One reason is that the level of corporate borrowing has risen sharply over the past decade. But there are also concerns that banks - working to restore profitability and lending margins - will be less willing providers of debt finance over the next few years. The growth of corporate indebtedness was a strong feature of the US and UK economies in the 1980s. In the US, company debt rose from 36 per cent of gross national product to 49 per cent of GNP over the decade, according to figures from the Bank for International Settlements. In the UK, the proportion rose from 41 per cent to 82 per cent in the same period. The over-hang of corporate debt concerns policy makers. In January, for example, the US treasury proposed a phased removal of tax relief on debt service payments. The measure would, it hopes, stop companies over-borrowing next time around the economic cycle. From companies' perspective, however, increased dependence on fixed-term debt finance has led to additional 'funding risk' - since borrowings need to be refinanced periodically whatever the state of the markets. For example, this year and next many UK companies must refinance cheap syndicated bank credits arranged in 1987/1988. So far, refinancing has taken place with barely a hitch. However, some high profile cases of corporate distress have convinced many companies that banks are unreliable sources of finance. One response by companies has been to reduce the number of banks from which they borrow. Most big syndicated loans have been refinanced by bi-lateral lending agreements or smaller, semi-syndicated credits. For example, last year Grand Metropolitan arranged a Dollars 2.5bn four-year loan to refinance an expiring three-year facility. The number of banks involved in the deal was cut to 34 from more than 60. At 37.5 basis points over Libor, the interest margin was higher than the 25 basis points over Libor Grandmet paid in 1988. However, the company believed it had more leverage over the lending banks by restricting the number of banks with which it was prepared to deal. Other UK corporations look set to follow a similar route. This month Rank Hovis McDougall, the foods group, is replacing a Pounds 250m multi-option facility with a smaller, simpler syndicated credit. Companies are also keen to diversify sources of funding, raising cash from institutional investors in the bond market to supplement bank lines. By funding core borrowings in the bond market, bank credit lines are free to meet short-term financing requirements. However, by no means all UK companies have access to the public bond markets. Since 1987, only 31 UK companies - some of them banks and other financial institutions - have made more than five Eurobond issues. Bankers estimated that only perhaps the top 50 UK companies have access to the public bond market. Others companies must be more subtle. Investment bankers see great potential in raising institutional funding for 'second tier' UK corporations. For example, last year four smaller brewery companies clubbed together to make a bond issue through an innovative joint venture company. The structure has also been used by investment trust companies and could be applied to other industrial sectors. Smaller UK companies have also placed bonds privately with institutional investors in the US. Even mid-sized companies such as Senior Engineering, which has a turnover of around Pounds 300m, have raised long-term debt finance from US institutions. UK investment institutions generally remain more conservative. The sterling private placement market is far smaller. Kleinwort Benson, for example, estimates that it has raised Pounds 500m for UK companies from private placements over the last year. But investors tend to be other companies investing surplus liquidity, rather than investment institutions. Hence most placements are short-term, rarely more than two-years maturity. UK company treasurers would like to see the development of a more open sterling bond market. This is unlikely, however, unless UK institutional investors switch substantial amounts of cash from the equity market and into fixed-income investment. Sterling bonds account for just three per cent of the average UK pension fund portfolio, with the majority of this modest amount devoted to government securities. There are early signs of change, with some institutions starting to nudge fixed-interest investment higher. However, even if this trend continues it will take years for a deep, flexible sterling bond market to develop.</p>

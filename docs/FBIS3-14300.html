Indeed, while the Rabin  government is in the middle of negotiations with the PLO on a  possible international presence in the occupied territories, the  Israeli Army launched a particularly brutal attack on observers  already on the spot, in this case a Belgian woman, An Mertens,  from Scherpenheuvel who has been working on the West Bank since  September 1992 for the UNRWA [United Nations Relief and Works  Agency] as a refugee affairs officer. [passage omitted]    Israel has never officially recognized the refugee affairs  officers but tolerates them and generally allows them to travel  round without too many hindrances. Until last Tuesday. On a  routine mission with her Palestinian assistant in the Tulkarm  region of the West Bank, An Mertens saw soldiers in the  Nur-al-Shams refugee camp "beating up" two young Palestinian  children, and a television crew arriving on the scene. Trying  to calm down one of the soldiers, she was suddenly thrown to the  ground, her hands bound by plastic handcuffs, dragged to the  camp exit, and left for several minutes, forced to remain  kneeling, her head down, with the tight handcuffs cutting into  her skin. Shortly afterwards her assistant suffered the same  fate.    The two were finally released without any other proceedings  but are still finding it difficult to recover from their bruises  and shock. [passage omitted]    Was this excessive zeal on the part of a local junior  officer? Is it general nervousness on the part of the Army in  the wake of the Hebron massacre? At all events, the UNRWA  intends to inform UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali and make a  complaint against Israel.</p>

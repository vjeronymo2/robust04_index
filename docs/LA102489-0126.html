			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> This is Judgment Day for the Beverly Hills Cop-Slapper. And to give you an  inkling of what Zsa Zsa's fate in Beverly Hills Municipal Court may be, we  offer some suggestions that the San Jose Mercury News recently received when it  held a contest to find an appropriate sentence.  </P> <P> Readers variously decreed that Gabor should be forced to:  </P> <P> * "Sell her biography rights to Bob Woodward."  </P> <P> * "Appear on a 'Hollywood Squares' reunion, with herself in the middle square  surrounded by her ex-husbands."  </P> <P> * "Be confused with Eva for the rest of her career by everyone she meets."  </P> <P> One entrant rhapsodized:  </P> <P>  Zsa Zsa in jail?  </P> <P>  She'd soon grow too pale;  </P> <P>  Public service's a must,  </P> <P>  The Humane Society we can trust;  </P> <P>  They've animals galore,  </P> <P>  She can help clean up the store!  </P> <P> And the envelope, please . . .  </P> <P> The winner was Cindy Gum of Los Gatos, who wrote:  </P> <P> "Recipe for Hungarian goulash: Toss Gabor, Imelda and Leona together into one  cell. Add one toilet, a small cracked mirror with NO MAKEUP LIGHTS, and one  half-sink. Wait for goulash to boil. For dessert, add Tammy Faye."  </P> <P> Gum's prize was dinner for two at the Hungarian Huszar restaurant, the  newspaper said, "in that Budapest by the Bay, otherwise known as Newark."  </P> <P> From the streets of Beverly Hills to the lanes of the Harbor Freeway. . . .  </P> <P> Motorists crawling along in jam-ups are pretty much limited in what they can do  to pass the time -- listen to the radio, apply makeup or shave, talk on the  phone, shake a fist at the maniac who cuts in front.  </P> <P> But hostages of the Harbor Freeway the past few evenings near the Coliseum had  another option. They could buy hats, T-shirts and tickets related to the  Rolling Stones concert.  </P> <P> Vendors stood on the freeway hawking items. Not pleased by the service, the  California Highway Patrol says about a dozen of them were cited.  </P> <P> However, no charges were brought against service station operators near the  Coliseum who charged $30 for parking.  </P> <P> You wouldn't usually expect to find a church featuring (1) a stained-glass  window depicting a soldier in a tank and (2) a statue of a uniformed soldier in  front.  </P> <P> But the Church of Our Saviour in San Gabriel has some unique pioneer roots.  </P> <P> One of the founders of the 122-year-old Episcopalian church was Benjamin  Wilson. An extensive landholder, he was mayor of Los Angeles from 1851-52 and  later a state senator. Mt. Wilson is named for him.  </P> <P> His grandson grew up on his rancho in San Gabriel and gained fame as a general  during World War II. After the general's death in 1945, his sister dedicated a  window to him in the church. And, in 1985, on the centenary of the general's  birth, a statue was dedicated to him.  </P> <P> Thus, the unique testaments to Gen. George S. Patton (1885-1945).  </P></p>

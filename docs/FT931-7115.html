			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / South Korea president sets goals MR KIM YOUNG-SAM, who was inaugurated yesterday as South Korea's seventh president, said the main goals of his administration would be to deregulate the economy, eliminate corruption, and reverse a declining work ethic, writes John Burton in Seoul. He also offered to meet Mr Kim Il-sung, the North Korean president, 'at any time and any place' to discuss unification in what would be the first summit conference between the leaders of the two Koreas. The 65-year-old former dissident leader declared in his inaugural address that his government, the first civilian administration in 32 years, would build a 'New Korea.' Mr Kim said South Korea threatened to 'become bogged down at the threshold of the developed world' after achieving considerable economic progress in the post-war era. He blamed the country's problems on a declining work ethic and its centralised economic structure.</p>

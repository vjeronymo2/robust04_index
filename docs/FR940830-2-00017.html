The ELO is available for the 1994&hyph;95 award year for institutions of higher education that participate in the Federal Perkins Loan Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To be eligible to participate in the Federal Perkins Loan Program ELO for 1994&hyph;95, an institution must have a Federal Perkins Loan cohort default rate of 15 percent or less as of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> June 30, 1993, and must have participated in the Federal Perkins Loan Program for the two previous award years (1992&hyph;93 and 1993&hyph;94). In addition, an institution must enter into a special ELO participation agreement with the Secretary. An institution that elects to participate in the ELO must complete, sign, date and submit the ELO Participation Agreement by the closing date to obtain approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Institutions that become Federal Perkins Loan Program ELO participants will be required to increase the Institutional Capital Contribution (ICC) to at least a dollar-for-dollar match with any portion of the 1994&hyph;95 award year Federal Capital Contribution (FCC) received. Only new FCC received on or after July 1, 1994, would be matched at the increased rate. Institutions would not match funds received prior to July 1, 1994, at the higher rate. Institutions receiving no new FCC for the 1994&hyph;95 award year may still elect to participate in the Federal Perkins Loan Program ELO.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Institutions that become Federal Perkins Loan Program ELO participants may make loans to eligible students at higher maximum annual and aggregate limits than is the case with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonparticipating institutions. ELO participating institutions that do not ultimately make any loans at the higher ELO levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the 1994&hyph;95 award year must still honor the ELO Participation Agreement to deposit in the Federal Perkins Loan Program Fund an ICC at least equal to the 1994&hyph;95 award year FCC deposited into the Fund. All other administrative procedures would remain the same as for institutions not participating in the Federal Perkins Loan Program ELO.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

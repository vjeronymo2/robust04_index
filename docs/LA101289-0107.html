			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EAST GERMANS CONCEDE REFORMS ARE NEEDED;  </P> <P> EUROPE: THE BELEAGUERED HARD-LINE POLITBURO CHANGES ITS TONE AND WILL DISCUSS  'ALL BASIC QUESTIONS OF OUR SOCIETY.'  </P> <P> East Germany's ruling Politburo, in a startlingly high-level change of tone,  conceded Wednesday night that reforms are needed in the Communist state, which  has been racked by demonstrations and the recent flight of thousands of its  citizens.  </P> <P> The Politburo said in a special statement that "together, we want to discuss  all basic questions of our society." The statement was read over East German  television and distributed simultaneously by the official news agency ADN.  </P> <P> It came after a long Politburo meeting Tuesday night that continued into  Wednesday morning, at which the regime's leadership reportedly came under heavy  criticism.  </P> <P> It also came after sharp remarks by the party's chief ideologist, Kurt Hager,  who argued that policy changes are necessary in the hard-line Communist  country. Hager, 77, spoke out Sunday in an interview with the Soviet news  agency Novosti, after a two-day visit to East Germany by Soviet President  Mikhail S. Gorbachev. His remarks were published widely Wednesday.  </P> <P> He complained that East German policy regarding the news media must be revamped  and that ordinary people must be drawn somehow into the policy-making process.  </P> <P> It was the first time that a senior East German official had publicly  recognized the refugee crisis. He admitted that "too many obstacles have been  put in the way of youth" and that "something needs to be done about it."  </P> <P> There were reports that lower-level Communist Party officials in 20 districts  of East Germany have demanded that the government discuss the problems with the  people and that local talks were already under way in some districts.  </P> <P> Also Wednesday, the ADN reported abruptly and without explanation that East  German leader Erich Honecker has canceled an official visit to Denmark  scheduled for Oct. 25-26.  </P> <P> The agency quoted an East German diplomat in Copenhagen as saying only that "we  think it would be better to have the visit at a later date."  </P> <P> Political observers speculated that the cancellation could be due to the health  of Honecker, 77, who reportedly has not recovered from the effects of a  gallbladder operation.  </P> <P> But they also suggested that major political developments might be in the  making and that Honecker may not wish to be away from East Berlin at a critical  time.  </P> <P> The Politburo statement, referring to the thousands of East Germans who have  recently fled to the West, said:  </P> <P> "They had a homeland that needed them and that they needed. The causes for  their decision may be many. We must and will look for them here, everyone in  their place, everyone together."  </P> <P> The Communist leaders agreed that among the questions that need to be aired are  economic efficiency, consumer goods, a freer news media, foreign travel and  democratic cooperation. They said that such matters will be discussed at the  next meeting of the larger Central Committee, which usually meets in late  autumn but may meet earlier.  </P> <P> The Politburo insisted, however, that any dialogue with the people will not  involve the essence of the socialist state.  </P> <P> "We will not allow the power of the workers and peasants, the values, ideals  and achievements of socialism to be infringed upon," the statement said.  </P> <P> In the past few weeks, East Germany has seen thousands of its young people flee  to West Germany and thousands of others take part in massive but nonviolent  street demonstrations in its major cities, calling for reform and more  dialogue.  </P> <P> The demonstrations came at the time of the country's 40th anniversary  celebration and were the largest since the workers' uprising of 1953, which was  suppressed with Soviet tanks.  </P> <P> Hager, in the interview with Novosti, said the time is right for reform.  </P> <P> "First of all," he said, "it is necessary to draw up a clear-cut concept. But  the will is there, and I believe we will succeed in bringing about the  necessary renewals. We have discussed our achievements, but now it is necessary  to talk about what is needed to change and renew in the run-up to (next year's)  party congress."  </P> <P> Asked what sort of changes are needed, he said: "It is possible to perfect  everything. There are many such questions -- for instance, the more active  involvement of the population in deciding on social problems and the  improvement of information policy."  </P> <P> Another Communist party official, Herrmann Kant, said in a letter to the  Communist party youth organ, Junge Welt, that "clearer and better " press  reports are necessary.  </P> <P> Diplomatic analysts said the emphasis on the press suggests that the man in  charge of the Ministry for Agitation and Propaganda, Joachim Herrmann, is being  discredited and may be blamed for the demonstrations.  </P> <P> Until Wednesday, the Politburo and the official news media had taken a severe  line, arguing that no reforms were necessary and that the demonstrations were  the work of thugs and "hooligans." According to this line, the people who fled  the country are traitors.  </P> <P> But on Wednesday, the trade union daily Tribune quoted popular actress Ursula  Werner as expressing concern about life in East Germany and the unrealistic way  it has been described in the media.  </P> <P> "Because of this, there has been a great loss of confidence that worries us,"  she said, and she pressed for free discussion of political and economic  reforms.  </P> <P> One of the groups urging reform is New Forum, which in three weeks has obtained  more than 10,000 signatures on a statement of principles but has been  proscribed by the government.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Rolf Henrich, a New Forum founder, told West German Radio it is  too early to ask people to suspend the demonstrations.  </P> <P> "The only way is for the dialogue to begin," he said, "and if it really  proceeds in a credible way, the streets will clear of protests."  </P> <P> Before the Politburo issued its statement, the official Communist party  newspaper Neues Deutschland accused West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl of  "flagrant interference" in urging East German leaders to undertake reforms.  </P> <P> "We will solve our problems alone, not with Kohl's recipes but with socialist  methods, in a socialist fashion, to further strengthen socialism," Neues  Deutschland said in a commentary. "Any demands and recommendations which in  reality aim at weakening or abolishing socialism will bear no fruit here."  </P></p>

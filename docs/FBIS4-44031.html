			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Goran Eriksson: "Bildt Wants To Discuss the EU </F> With Carlsson"]    [Text] A public discussion of how the various parties want  the European Union [EU] to develop.    This is proposed by Prime Minister Carl Bildt (Moderate  Coalition Party) in an open letter addressed to opposition  leader Ingvar Carlsson.    In the letter Bildt writes that he warmly welcomes the clear  decision on the question of EU membership reached at the Social  Democratic Party congress at the weekend.    But the prime minister also writes that he was "very  surprised by the message from the congress that the lid must now  be put on the Europe debate until after the election campaign."    Carl Bildt argues that the government that is elected in  September will represent Sweden in important negotiations on the  EU's future, provided that the referendum says yes to the EU.    The prime minister therefore takes the view that it is "our  democratic duty to make clear to the voters before the election  in September along what lines we want Europe cooperation to  develop after November."    Therefore Carl Bildt proposed a discussion in early August.    Yesterday the letter did not raise pulse rates in the Social  Democratic camp.    "If Carl Bildt had listened more carefully to what was said  at our congress he would not have needed to write this letter,"  said Laila Edholm of the Social Democrats' press service. She  gave assurances that the Social Democrats have not put the lid  on the EU debate, but that the actual campaign will naturally be  intensified after the election.    Ingvar Carlsson is currently on holiday and the invitation  to  a public debate will therefore have to wait until he comes back  to work in mid-July.</p>

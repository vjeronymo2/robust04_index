			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: UK seeking coherence in European defence Sir, Ian Davidson is correct in arguing ('Conflict of interest', November 16) that the US decision to withdraw from the enforcement of the arms embargo on Bosnia should force the Europeans to look much more seriously at their own defence structure. Yet he is wrong to suggest that Britain advocates a 'loose, floppy, amoeba-like' security arrangement for the continent. The creation of a European defence identity depends on deeds, not just vision or words; it ultimately requires increased military budgets, something which no member state, with the notable exception of France, is willing to contemplate. The Eurocorps structure established by France and Germany has just managed to work out joint emblems, command languages and the food served to its soldiers; in short, everything necessary for a parade on the boulevards of Paris, rather than actual fighting. And the Western European Union, presented as the EU's budding military arm, consisted until recently of little more than a few bureaucrats and some filing cabinets In transit between London and Brussels. Faced with this reality, the British position was that nothing should be done to supplant Nato as the alliance which has both the means and the command structure necessary for any serious military task. Davidson's 'amoeba-like organisms' swim in the murky waters of the Balkans, where all current institutions piled in, and achieved nothing in particular. Far from seeking to place spanners in the works, the British government is now actively pushing for a more coherent European defence arrangement. At the weekend Franco-British summit the two countries created a combined air force group explicitly designed to capitalise on the experience gained in Bosnia. Britain is also working to enshrine the mechanisms by which Europe could use US military equipment in future crises. London's stance is no longer dictated by some wistful hankering for a 'special relationship' with the Americans: this was shattered by President Bill Clinton fairly early on in his presidency. Instead, the British behaviour is governed by a perfectly logical assumption that the security structures currently touted for the continent must be real in order to be credible. But perhaps your correspondent is right after all: bashing Britain in every article on European affairs is much more predictable and tidy than setting out a host of complicated arguments.

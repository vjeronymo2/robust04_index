			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / International Company News: London acquisition fund to buy Swedish group Iro, the Swedish company which is the world's biggest producer of yarn feeding equipment, is being bought for SKr620m (Dollars 83m) by CWB Capital Partners, the London-based acquisition fund. CWB, which specialises in acquiring market-leading manufacturing companies in northern Europe, is buying Iro from Handel och Industri, the industrial holding company of Sweden's Svenska Handelsbanken. Iro, which is expected to have turnover this year of SKr815m, created the market for yarn feeders, which are used on weaving and knitting machinery. It has 750 employees and manufacturing plants in Ulriceham, Sweden, Biella, Italy and Dornstetten, Germany. Mr Nigel Doughty, CWB's chief executive, said Iro's profits were rising, but would not disclose details. The company is well-positioned to benefit from the upswing in the textile machinery investment cycle as US, European and Asian economies pulled out of recession, he said. As part of the transaction, Iro's management is taking a 10 per cent stake in the company, and Mr Hans-Eric Ovin is staying on as non-executive chairman. Financing is being provided by Mezzanine Management, a UK-based specialist provider of mezzanine finance. Dresdner Bank will provide local working capital facilities in Germany. Handel och Industri was formed by Svenska Handelsbanken following the bankruptcy in the early 1990s of Kongsbo, controlled by the Swedish financier Mr Anders Wall. Kongsbo had owned Iro and other industrial companies. CWB has offices in London, Frankfurt and Stockholm, and its shareholders include Standard Chartered Bank and WestLB. Its biggest acquisition was last year's SKr3.46bn buy-out, in partnership with Goldman Sachs, of Tarkett International, the German flooring company.</p>

			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEA UNNECESSARY  </P> <P> The Times has once again proved how far its editorial viewpoint is from the  mainstream of Orange County political reality with "Good and Bad News for the  Art Scene" (Aug. 19). The arts will do just fine in Orange County -- as shown  by the number of art dealers, showplaces and festivals -- without government  support as advocated by The Times.  </P> <P> Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Long Beach) is correct in exposing the "avant-garbage"  that is financed by the National Endowment for the Arts.  </P> <P> The Times should be reminded that there will be no censorship of the arts if  the government is not required to pick up the tab for NEA grants to "advanced"  thinkers producing non-marketable trash masquerading as art.  </P> <P> D.A. SMITH  </P> <P> Seal Beach  </P></p>

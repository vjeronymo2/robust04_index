			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Evans seeking to oust Labour whip MR JOHN EVANS, the doughty anti-Militant campaigner, was first out of the traps yesterday in the race to contest the post of Labour's chief whip with the incumbent, Mr Derek Foster. Within minutes of the campaign timetable being announced, the St Helens North MP said his candidacy aimed to shake up the party's management of parliamentary business, which, he claimed, 'was frequently criticised for lacking logic or dynamism'. Mr Jeff Rooker, the Birmingham Perry Barr MP, also confirmed yesterday that he was discussing a bid with his colleagues. But the odds are still on Mr Foster, who has held the post in spite of a series of challenges since 1985. He is said to enjoy the tacit support of Mr John Smith, now seen as a certainty for election as party leader. Under the timetables announced to the parliamentary Labour party yesterday, nominations for chief whip and the PLP chairmanship will open on June 18 and close on June 25. An exhaustive ballot will begin on July 9, repeated, if necessary, for each week that follows with the last-placed name dropping out, until one candidate has secured 50 per cent of the vote. That means the race will be completed before the electoral college meets to conclude the leadership issue on July 18. For the shadow cabinet elections, party officers have agreed a complex arrangement that opens nominations on July 9 and closes them before the leadership result is known on July 16. Voting for the 18 places will take place up to July 23 to allow MPs to take account of the outcome. Some MPs were complaining yesterday that the planning for the chief whip and party chairmanship contest - each ex-officio shadow cabinet posts - further helps the incumbents as backbench MPs must 'bid' for select committee places  -in effect, decided by recommendations from the whips' office - from today.</p>

			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Education climbdown is claimed - News in Brief LABOUR yesterday said that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the education secretary, had been forced into a humiliating climbdown to salvage the schools bill on which the government was defeated by peers earlier this week, Alison Smith writes. Opposition party managers said that they had agreed to take the remaining stages of the legislation next week only on the basis that the government would not reverse the defeats. Without opposition agreement, the government would not have been able to secure the legislation if there is an election on 9 April, and the move was seen as a further sign that the government was clearing the decks for an election next month. Peers insisted that the chief inspector of schools, rather than individual governing bodies, would be able to choose private sector inspection teams, and that local authorities should still have an automatic right of inspection. ***** TAXATION: The Conservatives last night accused Labour of retreating on its pledge not to increase value added tax. Mr Bryan Gould, Labour's environment spokesman, said the party was 'committed to measures such as varying the rates of VAT so that environmentally benign goods face reduced rates of tax, while environmentally damaging goods carry an increased mark-up'. Labour party officials said last night that Mr Gould's comments did not imply VAT rates would rise - only that there may be an increased differential between products. ***** POLLING: The Liberal Democrats yesterday released opinion poll results showing it 'neck and neck' with the Tories in ten constituencies they hope to win. Mr Chris Patten, Tory chairman, was a 'probable' loser in his Bath constituency, Mr Des Wilson, the party's election campaign director, said. The other constituencies polled by PS Opinion Research since Christmas were Cheltenham, Colne Valley, Conwy, Edinburgh West, Falmouth &amp; Campbourne, Hazel Grove, Littleborough &amp; Saddleworth, Portsmouth South and Richmond and Barnes.</p>

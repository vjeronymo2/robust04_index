Front spar cap cracks developing on certain Twin Commander model airplanes not affected by that AD prompted this action. In addition, the manufacturer has updated the inspection procedures through improved service information. This action retains the inspection and repair requirements of AD 65&hyph;06&hyph;01, and requires inspecting in accordance with updated service information and increases the applicability to include other model airplanes. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the wing structure caused by cracks in the spar cap. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Effective April 12, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of Twin Commander Service Bulletin (SB) No. 90C, dated March 30, 1992, and Twin Commander Service Publications revision notice of SB 90C, Revision 1, dated June 5, 1992, is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of April 12, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The incorporation by reference of the instructions to Twin Commander Custom Kit No. CK&hyph;145, dated August 21, 1992, was previously approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of April 11, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Service information that applies to this AD may be obtained from the Twin Commander Aircraft Corporation, 19003 59th Drive, NE., Arlington, Washington 98223.

The action proposed to supersede AD 65&hyph;06&hyph;01 with a new AD that would (1) retain the inspection and repair requirements of the spar caps required by AD 65&hyph;06&hyph;01; (2) incorporate the updated service information into the proposed AD; and (3) increase the effectivity of the current AD to include other airplane models of the Twin Commander 500, 600, and 700 series. The proposed inspections would be accomplished in accordance with Twin Commander SB No. 90C, dated March 30, 1992, and Twin Commander Service Publications revision notice of SB No. 90C, Revision 1, dated June 5, 1992. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the 10 comments received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nine commenters concur with the proposal as written. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Twin Commander supports the proposal and makes recommendations. Twin Commander states that the Compliance section of the proposal contains the following: ``*&blank;*&blank;* or 500 hours after the wing front lower spar cap was replaced in accordance with one of the three modifications referenced in paragraph (b) of this AD *&blank;*&blank;*'', and points out that paragraph (b) of this AD only specifies two modifications and that the wording in the Compliance section of the proposal should be changed accordingly. The FAA concurs and has changed the proposed AD by inserting the words ``in accordance with one of the two modifications'' in place of ``in accordance with one of the three modifications'' under the Compliance section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Twin Commander also states that the proposed AD should include the Model 680F(P) airplanes in the applicability to coincide with SB 90C. The FAA concurs that these airplanes should be included. Adding this airplane model to the applicability goes beyond the scope of what was originally proposed, and would obligate the FAA to issue a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to allow additional time for the public to comment. The FAA has determined that the additional comment time is unnecessary for the model airplanes included in the applicability of the proposed AD, and, after the proposed rule becomes final, the FAA will issue an NPRM to add the Model 680F(P) airplanes into the applicability of that AD. The proposed rule is unchanged as a result of this comment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review of all available information including the comments referenced above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed except for the minor wording change and other minor editorial corrections. The FAA has determined that these minor corrections will not change the meaning of the AD nor add any additional burden upon the public than was already proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 1,303 airplanes in the U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 32 (average) workhours per airplane to accomplish the required action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Parts are not required for 1,054 airplanes, and parts cost approximately $700 per airplane for 105 airplanes and $1,700 per airplane for 144 airplanes. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the inspections specified in this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $2,611,580 (cost per airplane varies by model). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

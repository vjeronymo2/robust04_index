			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Dolores Rugama] </F>   [Text] Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo stated yesterday  that the $40 million disbursement [of U.S. aid] "will boost this  year's economic program," since it will raise the country's  reserves and foster confidence among businessmen. Lacayo met  yesterday with members of the American Chamber of Commerce and  affirmed that businessmen, rather than creating problems, think  of opportunities for greater cooperation between government and  business for the benefit of the country.    The agenda for the meeting between Lacayo and the  businessmen  included topics such as finance, fiscal matters, laws for  foreign investments, the labor code, and the attention public  employees give to businessmen. When a reporter asked him if the  four deputy presidency ministers were named to pave the way for  his presidential campaign, he replied, somewhat annoyed, that  "to talk of a campaign in 1994 is irresponsible. I hope I am not  asked that question again."    He was satisfied that the National Assembly began work with  great stability, overcoming a year and a half of conflict. He  also noted that a renewed Supreme Court of Justice will give a  great boost to the Judicial Branch. Business leader Carlos  Reynaldo Lacayo indicated that great stress was placed during  the meeting on the need to promote investments so that at the  start of 1996 "we will have a well consolidated free enterprise  system."    Banaexpo [expansion unknown] Manager Gilberto Wong stated  that businessmen asked Lacayo for a general revision to allow  banks more flexibility with fewer restrictions. The bankers  demanded a nondiscriminatory banking system, "because we have  watched with concern the large withdrawals by autonomous  entities to be put into state banks."    This measure, according to Wong, can cause serious  inconveniences to the financial system, since it restricts  credit and makes operations more costly.</p>

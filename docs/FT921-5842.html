			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / International Company News: Axel Springer to omit dividend AXEL SPRINGER, one of Germany's leading media groups, will pay no dividend for 1991 because of losses in foreign operations and high start-up costs in the east German newspaper market. The payout last year was DM12 a share. After-tax profits, which fell to around DM20m (Dollars 12.5m) compared with DM65m in 1991, would be paid into reserves, the company said. Turnover during the year had increased by only 4 per cent to DM3.7bn. Springer last year started a restructuring programme under its new chairman, Mr Gunter Wille, which included the closure of a Spanish tabloid newspaper, Claro. Later this year, the loss-making Die Welt will move offices from Bonn to Berlin and will be given a complete face-lift aimed at boosting sales, currently 230,000 a day, and lifting advertising revenues. The paper, a conservative daily, comparable in tone with The Times in the UK, is believed to lose more than DM40m a year. While the management wants to brighten up the paper with a new look, comparable with that of USA Today, the editorial staff would prefer to keep the sober image and increase pagination. The group, in the middle of a DM800m printing press investment programme in east Germany, is also being hit by losses on daily papers taken over in Rostock and Leipzig.</p>

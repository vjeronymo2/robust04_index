			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> 2 KILLED AFTER MATTRESS FIRE SETS PALMDALE BOARDING HOUSE ABLAZE  </P> <P> A mattress fire set a boarding house in Palmdale ablaze early today, killing  two men who lived there, investigators said.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Fire Investigator David Westfield said officials believe  that the blaze was accidental. The names of the victims, ages 57 and 78, were  withheld pending notification of relatives. The victims were roommates who were  overcome by smoke and died at the scene, Westfield said.  </P> <P> One of the eight other residents suffered a seizure and was treated at Palmdale  Hospital Medical Center and released, officials said.  </P> <P> The fire was reported about 3:31 a.m. by a passing motorist who was flagged  down by a resident, Westfield said. He said the occupants first tried to call  the Fire Department with a phone in the burning building, but the fire  apparently interfered with the phone lines. That delay may have led to the  deaths of the victims, one of whom was an amputee with a prosthetic leg, he  said.  </P> <P> It took 17 firefighters to extinguish the blaze. Neighbors and officials said  many of the residents of the boarding house in a desert area on the edge of  Palmdale were low-income or elderly.  </P> <P> Joseph Harris, a cook and caretaker at the home, said he was awakened by  another resident yelling that a mattress was on fire. He said the smoke was so  thick that he was forced to climb out a back window.  </P> <P> Officials said their initial investigation indicated that the building had  properly functioning smoke detectors.  </P></p>

The 45-year-old Lahti former  businessman was arrested in October by Swedish Customs  authorities, with a quantity of almost 8.5 kg of hashish in his  possession. A body search of the man after his arrival in  Finland additionally turned up four kg of amphetamines.    The man has kept silent during the court proceedings. In  addition to being sentenced for two cases of aggravated drug  smuggling, he was also convicted of four firearms violations. He  did admit to having four illegal weapons in his possession.    The man received a prison term of 46 months. He will have to  reimburse authorities in the amount of 120,000 markkas. This sum  will pay for a reward in the amphetamines case and the cost of a  fancy rental truck he used for transporting the hashish. It will  also pay the fine for the illegally obtained firearms.    Lahti Municipal Court determined the value of a submachine  gun to be 500 markkas, or the amount that the Armed Forces will  have to pay for a replacement.</p>

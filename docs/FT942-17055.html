			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Union fights Thorp changes Electricians at Thorp, British Nuclear Fuels' Pounds 2.8bn waste reprocessing plant at Sellafield, Cumbria, are fighting changes in manning arrangements which they claim threaten safety, Chris Tighe writes. The Sellafield electricians' section of the AEEU engineering and electrical union is holding a meeting today of its 970 members to decide on whether to hold a ballot on industrial action. Sellafield manual employees work in teams which have an electrician and an instrument mechanic, but BNF has ruled that at Thorp some teams will not include both. Mr Alan Westnedge, union convener, said: 'We don't believe this is a safe working practice. They are putting people in the situation where they have to deal with whatever comes up.' BNF said it wanted to solve the issue by further discussion using established company procedures. It added: 'We are fully committed to safe working. We believe all the procedures implemented within Thorp are perfectly safe.'</p>

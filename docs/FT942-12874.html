			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (1): Time to be more sober  -Over the past decade, returns have been extraordinary and, on the face of it, pension fund managers have done an excellent job. But the level of risk in portfolios is now concerning actuaries At one level, 1993 was a wonderful year for investment returns for the UK's pension funds. The average rate of return was some 28-29 per cent, depending on the degree of exposure to property. This was the best year since 1989 in nominal terms, and in real terms was even better, given the much lower levels of pay and price inflation. Over the past decade the returns have been extraordinary: an average annual return for the median fund of 15.9 per cent, according to Caps, one of the two performance measurement services. This has shown a vast margin over the 5 per cent average inflation rate, and 7.4 per cent a year over pay inflation, which is more relevant to the large majority of pension schemes which offer benefits linked to pay at or near retirement. On the face of it, pension fund managers have done an excellent job but they have achieved this by pushing the investment strategy of UK schemes towards new extremes of risk. The exposure of funds to equities, according to the other measurement specialist WM, is now 80 per cent, against only about 60 per cent ten years ago The level of risk in pension fund portfolios is now beginning to cause concern among actuaries, who are worried that the increasing maturity of many schemes may require the adoption of a lower-risk strategy. There is also concern at government level, following last autumn's publication of the report of the Goode Committee on pension law reform. The department of social security is currently preparing a White Paper on proposed legislation, including rules on a minimum solvency standard. The government is likely to follow the line of the Goode Report and legislate, perhaps in 1995, to improve the security of pension scheme members when companies get into trouble. A minimum solvency standard might mean that companies would be forced to pump more capital into their schemes at the bottom of a stock market slump. There are moves to moderate the impact by calculating solvency on an age-related basis. Only schemes with a large proportion of old members would be seriously affected. In such cases, nevertheless, avoiding such risks could cost companies money, if they come under pressure to invest in safer but lower-returning assets, or alternatively if they feel obliged to purchase portfolio insurance against the risk of equity market slumps. Nevertheless, the high returns of equities have greatly contributed to the currency prosperity of most schemes. One of the leading investment firms, Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management, has been publishing a statistical review called Pension Fund Indicators for 21 years and it has data going back 31 years in all. Over this period UK equity returns have beaten pay inflation by 4.8 per cent a year, but the returns on fixed income government bonds have failed to match pay inflation and have underperformed domestic equities by 5.5 per cent a year. Over the past decade government bonds have performed much better against inflation, but have continued to return about 5.5 per cent a year less than shares. Somewhat curiously, however, overseas equities have also markedly underperformed UK equities in the past decade. They have returned 4.3 per cent a year less on average, even though the underlying economic performance of the UK has been uninspiring. An explanation could be that valuation factors have distorted the returns recently; consequently, an unfavourable rebalancing of the UK market is quite possible in the future. Certainly UK equity valuations have looked quite demanding recently. The dividend yield on the All-Share Index of only 3.2 per cent when the market reached its peak at the beginning of February was close to the lowest ever reached in modern market history. In fact, for the purposes of scheme valuations, many actuaries will almost entirely disregard the surge in share prices last year. They will value the assets on the basis of dividends, which failed to grow last year: modest underlying rises were wiped out by the 6 1/4 per cent hit which resulted from changes in dividend taxes. The equity market's gain was a valuation effect related to the sharp fall in government bond yields. The rise in asset values was effectively cancelled out by the higher present value of scheme liabilities, because long-term interest rates were much lower. These effects of valuation changes were seen even more dramatically in the US, where long-term Treasury bond yields also tumbled. General Motors' pension plan, for instance, revealed that each one percentage point fall in the long bond yield added Dollars 5bn to its deficit. US pension schemes began to speculate in risky assets, even including emerging market bonds, in a search for adequate returns. A subsequent jump in the long bond yield to well over 7 per cent has imposed widespread capital losses, but has restored some balance to the long-term institutions by improving their longer-term funding prospects. In the UK, too, pension funds could not meet their rate of return requirements in the sterling fixed interest bond market last year. Although the government sold a record Pounds 50bn of gilt-edged, pension funds failed to make any net additions to their fixed interest sterling bond portfolios, although they bought a small amount of index-linked gilts. On both sides of the Atlantic pension funds were effectively priced out of the bond markets because of the massive intervention of speculators such as hedge funds and bank proprietary trading departments. But it looks as though a very different scenario may develop in 1994. Whatever happens, however, UK pension funds will no longer be substantial net investors of new money. Although the total of funds under management may have neared Pounds 450bn at the end of last year, the net cash flow was only about 1 per cent of that. Stripping out capital gains and investment income, the funds showed underlying shrinkage of about 3 per cent. So far, however, there is little sign among big UK schemes of another feared development, a switch to a money purchase (or defined contribution) structure rather than the conventional final salary (or defined benefit) scheme design. The latest NAPF survey showed that only 7 per cent of schemes (covering just 3 per cent of the aggregate membership) are run on a money purchase basis. However, another recent survey, covering small to medium-sized companies, by consultants Sedgwick Noble Lowndes, showed a 19 per cent proportion of money purchase schemes. There are concerns that as scheme valuation surpluses disappear and the high costs of final salary schemes become more evident, the money purchase approach will become much more common in the UK. Because money purchase schemes transfer investment risks to the scheme member, such a trend would require investment managers to take much more notice of the short-term risks facing scheme members, especially those approaching retirement. This shift is already taking place in the US, where corporate sector defined benefit plans showed a negative cash flow of Dollars 36bn last year, according to consultants Greenwich Associates. Corporate defined contribution plans, in contrast, enjoyed positive cash flow of Dollars 11bn. Defined contribution plan assets now represent 37 per cent of all US corporate pension assets, and the proportion could be 60 per cent in ten years' time on current trends. Brilliant returns by UK pension fund managers over the past three years, when the typical fund has produced annual returns of 22 per cent on average, while annualised pay inflation has been only 5 per cent, have distracted attention from some of these problems. But 1994 is striking a more sober note. The typical return will have been a negative 4 or 5 per cent in the first quarter. From now on fund managers may need to pay at least as much regard to risk as to reward.</p>

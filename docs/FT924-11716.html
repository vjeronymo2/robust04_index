			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / International Company News: GAN profits sharply lower after six months GROUPE GAN, the third-largest French state-owned insurer, has announced that profits almost halved in the first six months, due to a rise in car thefts and industrial accident claims and an increase in bad debts at CIC, its banking unit. GAN's net profits slid from FFr962m in the first half of 1991 to FFr487m (Dollars 94.56m) in the same period of this year, on premium income up by 11.9 per cent to FFr21.9bn over the same period. GAN warned that, barring an economic recovery, full-year profits would be down sharply because of the extra claims from Hurricane Andrew and the recent floods in southern France.</p>

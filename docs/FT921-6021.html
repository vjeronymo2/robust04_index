			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Bureaux de Change face new controls THE Department of Trade and Industry has announced measures to tighten controls on Bureaux de Change. Edward Leigh, consumer affairs minister at the DTI, revealed the new measures in a written reply to a parliamentary question. They mean that: Bureaux must give full information on commission rates and any other fees, and give them the same prominence as the exchange rates themselves. Advertised exchange rates must give full details on the terms on which transactions are made - if operators buy and sell currency at different rates, or offer different rates for travellers' cheques, these must be shown. Rates must be visible as customers approach the premises. Leigh also announced that customers should be given receipts setting out the details of the transactions, and that companies will be required to give a clear explanation of the basis on which rates will be determined when currency is ordered for a later date. These regulations come into force on May 18 this year. However, bureaux will be given until May 18 next year to display fees and commissions with the same prominence as exchange rates.</p>

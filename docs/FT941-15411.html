			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Bundesbank chief says EU bank should follow German policies Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, gave notice yesterday he would fight hard for the adoption of German monetary policies by the future European central bank. Medium-term money supply targets, mainstay of the Bundesbank's policy, were the best way to ensure price stability, he told a banking audience in Oldenburg, north-west Germany. Such measures allowed inflationary pressures to be spotted early and helped avoid the mistakes which were part and parcel of a stop-go policy. Minimum reserve requirements for commercial banks were 'indispensable' to slow down money creation, he said. The finance sector should also contribute to stability by encouraging the dominance of longer-term lending rates. The European Monetary Institute (EMI), forerunner of the proposed European central bank, had a lot of work ahead of it, Mr Tietmeyer said. The Bundesbank would campaign heavily for the adoption of the German central bank's policies. Speaking within days of the institute's first formal meeting in Frankfurt, he reiterated his scepticism on the timing of the introduction of a common currency. Mr Tietmeyer, who has in the past effectively written off 1997 as a starting date, said that if there was 'a serious clash between the political deadline and economic necessity,' then monetary union would have to wait. He also rejected suggestions that the EMI should establish an EU-wide money supply target in the run-up to monetary union. That would lead to grey areas between the responsibilities of the institute and individual central banks. Mr Tietmeyer supported his case for a German-style European central bank with a catalogue of successes, which he attributed to the Bundesbank's 'dogged' adherence to its policy. 'Inflation is slowing, inflationary expectations have been broken, long-term interest rates have been at unusually low levels for some time . . . and the external value of the D-Mark has stayed stable,' he said.</p>

They expressed the hope  that commanders and fighters will strengthen army building in an  all-around way in line with Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and his concept of army  building in the new period, as well as the general requirements  for army building set forth by Jiang Zemin.    Prior to visits by the commission members, Vice Chairmen Liu  Huaqing and Zhang Zhen had already called on the first company  of a unit under the Beijing Military Region to extend the CMC's  Spring Festival greetings to all officers and men.

While  meeting scientific and technical personnel, Chi Haotian said:  Chinese scientists and technicians have made great  contributions to defense modernization. The explosion of the  first atomic bomb and the launching of the first artificial  satellite reflect, in a concentrated form, their widsom, hard  work, and dedication. It is hoped that they will bring into  play the pioneering, self-sacrificing spirit and make new  contributions to China's reform, opening up, and economic  development in the coming year.    On the morning of 3 February, Zhang Wannian, CMC member and  chief of the General Staff, visited the Air Force Command Post,  where he heard a briefing on their duties and extended greetings  to officers and men in the electronic chart, communications, and  radar offices. He said: Communications is the core for  coordinating combined forces and commanding modernization. It  is hoped that officers and men will constantly study and work  hard to accelerate the development of the Army's communications  undertaking.    On the morning of 4 February, Yu Yongbo, CMC member and  director of the General Political Department, called on teachers  and researchers of the Armored Force Engineering Academy and  extended Spring Festival greetings to comrades of all military  academies. After viewing the teaching and research office, the  simulation training center, and the computer center, he thanked  teachers and researchers for helping train large numbers of  talented personnel needed for the Army's modernization. He  exhorted them to step up efforts to improve the academy in line  with Deng Xiaoping's demand for "gearing education to meeting  the needs of modernization, the world, and the future."    On the afternoon of 4 February, Fu Quanyou, CMC member and  director of the General Logistics Depaprtment, called on the  Navy General Hospital to extend greetings to medical experts,  professors, and health care personnel; as well as to comrades of  all military hospitals. He urged them to continually improve  health-care and service quality and turn the General Hospital  into a first-rate hospital with political integrity, superb  technique, advanced facilities, and scientific management. He  visited the otolaryngological ward, inquired about patients'  conditions, and wished them a happy New Year and early recovery.

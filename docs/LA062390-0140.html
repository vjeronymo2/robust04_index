			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OUTDOORS;  </P> <P> CAPTURING A GARDEN'S BLOOMS  </P> <P> Maybe your flower garden doesn't rival the ones adorning the covers of Better  Homes and Gardens magazine. That's no excuse not to capture your own home-grown  color on film.  </P> <P> After spending so much time digging, planting and pulling weeds, photographing  the brilliant results of your labor can be a rewarding experience.  </P> <P> And who knows? Maybe the same flair you've exhibited in growing beautiful  blossoms will show itself in your photographs. Your garden variety snapshots  could be upgraded to works of art, suitable for framing or sale.  </P> <P> All you need is someone to show you the way.  </P> <P> A walk through a garden with photographer Carol Leigh may be the answer. The  Santa Ana-based photographer organizes workshops to help people improve their  garden photography.  </P> <P> One of the most important factors in garden snapshots is the light source.  Leigh recommends shooting on cloudy or overcast days, when the light is even,  which eliminates harsh shadows.  </P> <P> Early morning is the best time to shoot flowers because they look fresh.  Flowers look tired after a long day in the sun.  </P> <P> Leigh also suggests that you move in tight. If you're taking pictures of a  rose, don't show the chain-link fence in the background. For close-up shots,  she prefers using a 90 or 100-mm macro lens because it allows her to work  farther away than a 50- or 55-mm macro. If there is a butterfly on a pedal, a  longer focal length keeps her from hovering too close and scaring it off.  </P> <P> "I think what's wrong with most pictures is that people are concentrating on  the emotion of the moment and (their) camera is not capturing that same  emotion, it's capturing everything (in view)," says Leigh, 41. "As you progress  as a photographer, you need to learn how to be disciplined and tighten up your  pictures to eliminate the extraneous."  </P> <P> A tripod is also helpful in photographing flowers. You need the camera to be  stable to get the greatest amount of sharpness and depth-of-field at a slow  shutter speed.  </P> <P> Leigh uses either Fujichrome 50 or 100 slide film. "The colors are terrific,"  she said. "I always prefer slides, what you see is what you get. With print  film, depending on the lab, your color could be off."  </P> <P> If your photography starts to impress other people, consider entering the  professional market. Leigh sells her photographs to greeting card makers,  calendar companies and magazines. The "Photographer's Market," published by  Writer's Digest, lists thousands of buyers and offers advice on how to pedal  your photographs.  </P> <P> "It gives you a real good clue as to who's buying pictures, what format they  are looking for and how much they are willing to pay," Leigh said. "You also  have to take the initiative and search out your own publications."  </P> <P> Photographers looking to improve their flowery images can join Leigh as she  leads a photo walk at Sherman Gardens in Corona del Mar on July 28. The flower  photography workshop costs $15.  </P> <P> Other classes offered by Leigh include one at Mission Interiors in San Juan  Capistrano on July 14 for $25 and a Back Bay Bird Walk in Newport Beach on Dec.  15 for $15.

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Channel 5 bid delayed by video worries THE Independent Television Commission has decided to delay the advertising of the fifth television channel because of fears about the need to retune several million video recorders. The new channel, which should be able to reach three in four homes in the UK, will use frequencies at present used in linking television sets to video recorders. The winner of the franchise, to be awarded by competitive tender, would not only have to pay for setting up a new national transmitter system but also for retuning about 3m video recorders that might be affected. The ITC has decided it needs much more information on how potential applicants propose to tackle the matter. Additional draft guidance notes will be issued this week, including an expected extra section on retuning. Comments have to be sent to the ITC by the middle of next month. The commission previously said it intended to advertise the licence in January, with a closing date three months later. A March or April date now seems more likely. The commission took the view at a meeting last week that a few weeks' more delay was preferable to technical chaos later. Some potential applicants are concerned about the targets set by the ITC in draft documents issued in November. The ITC said the channel should begin broadcasting no later than the end of December 1994 and that at least 40 per cent of the population should be covered from the outset. The ITC decision not to renew Television South West's broadcasting licence for south-west England was influenced by a misleading ITC assessment of the television company's business plan, the Appeal Court was told yesterday. On the second day of TSW's legal challenge to the ITC's decision last October to award the south-west franchise to Westcountry TV, Mr Gordon Pollock QC, for TSW, said the assessment led the commissioners to proceed on a 'mistaken view of the facts'. He said the commissioners had been led to believe that, in effect, TSW's forecasting methodology for growth in national net advertising revenue was 'off the wall'. There was, however, overwhelming evidence that TSW's forecasts were credible, he said. The hearing continues today.</p>

This modernization includes the upgrading of Missile  Frigates, the French-made AMX-30 tanks, and the purchase and  replacement of equipment for the Venezuelan Air Force [FAV] and  the National Guard [GN]. The allocation amounts to some $500  million or approximately 8 billion bolivares.    Vice Admiral Rafael Huize Claviel, inspector general of the  National Armed Forces (FAN), made this announcement here  yesterday. The FAN began their annual government inspection and  supervision program for the operational readiness of Tactical  Combat Units at the installations of the four military branches  in Zulia State. With regard to the administrative aspect, the  FAN also began a program to check infrastructure conditions in  command posts, barracks, border vigilance posts, and assistance  centers.    Huize Claviel was accompanied by a high-ranking delegation  that included 10 top officers with the rank of colonel from the  four military branches. These officers are also members of the  inspection teams. GN Brigadier General Simon Jose Lunar Ortega,  chief of the Inspector General's Office also accompanied  Claviel. [passage omitted]    Claviel made statements to PANORAMA noting that the  Inspector  General's Office, within the framework of its annual activities,  scheduled this inspection visit to the Zulia Garrison for today.  A group of officers from this office are accompanying me to  conduct an inspection of the garrison. The 1st Infantry Division  commander will give me a report on matters he considers we  should become aware of. I will take this report with me to  Caracas, where I will try to find solutions to any problems. We  will also visit such offices in this military division as the  Center for Military Recruitment and the National Armed Forces  Social Security Institute. I will also visit the four big  commands that operate here beginning with the 1st Division. We  already visited the General Rafael Urdaneta Air Base, BARU, and  next, we will visit the GN Regional Command No. 3 and the 11th  Army Infantry Brigade Regional Command. We will close our tour  with a visit to the command post of the Pedro Lucas Urribarri  Main Coast Guard Station. [passage omitted]    Adm. Huize Clavier stressed that with the Umbrella Law, the  Armed Forces hope to obtain the necessary funds for the  maintenance and modernization of its military equipment. He  added that through the Umbrella Law, the Armed Forces have  designed a development and consolidation program for which it  will receive $500 million, which is equivalent to approximately  8 billion bolivares to cover the Umbrella Law 93.

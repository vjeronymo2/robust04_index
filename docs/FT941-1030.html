			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Travel: Fiddles, pipes and pubs in County Clare - Dowdy or not, any town with 19 pubs deserves serious scrutiny. Nicholas Woodsworth was equal to the task Miltown Malbay is the kind of town people drive through to get somewhere else. Surrounded by hay field and cow pasture and rhubarb patch, it sits in the Irish county of Clare a mile or so inland from the Atlantic coast. Not far away are the sort of attractions that draw busloads of sight-seers: to the north, the battered cliffs of Moher, to the south, across the mouth of the Shannon, the lush Ring of Kerry. But no tour-buses ever stop in Miltown. I only stopped there myself for the pubs. Irish pubs are remarkable. To say nothing, for the moment, of what goes on inside them, they have a strong external visual appeal - half the arty postcards on Ireland's news-stands are of Irish pubs. It is not just that they are quaint and colourful. They demand a particular Irish genius, a flair for spontaneity. Ignore the nylon bedsheets, the plastic flowers, the porcelain ducks on the wall, the framed, illuminated Jesus over the bed in your bed-and-breakfast room. The same disingenuous, naive, confident and quirky style that produces them finds its true expression in the Irish pub. Who can decorate in forthright pink and mauve and get away with it? Only the roadside pubs and fuchsia hedges in the west of Ireland. The pubs of Miltown Malbay, though, failed to amaze with their facades. In fact, they seemed dowdy and deserted, in need of a window-washing and a coat of paint. Those with lace curtains seemed downright dusty. What was impressive was their number. No more than 600 people live in Miltown. Yet, scattered along its little high street - and far outnumbering such pedestrian establishments as M Lenihan's Hair Salon and Casey's General Drapers and Outfitters - are no less than 19 pubs. Dowdy or not, any town with 19 pubs deserves, I thought, a looking into. It does not take much asking around. Any citizen of Miltown will tell you that for a large part of the year most of these places are moribund; open, yes, but hardly busy. I stuck my head in one and withdrew it, disconcerted by the sight of one lonely white-haired drinker sitting in front of an empty pint glass. O'Briens and O'Donoghue's, Hillery's and Hennessey's, Cleary's, Clancy's and Cogan's, Tulty's and Tom Malone's, the Fiddler's Inn, the Armada Lounge, the Malbay Bar, all these and a handful more pubs survive, but only just. Why so many drinking establishments in the first place? Not so long ago Miltown was a busier, more prosperous and thirstier town than it is today, a market centre that served a countryside of cattle farms. In the age of prolonged recession and EU production quotas, though, not even the greenest grass in Europe can guarantee prosperity. As in many chronically depressed towns of the Irish west that have failed to pick up on tourism, people have lost jobs, lost heart, packed up and gone away. It is nothing new; it has been happening on and off here ever since the potato famine. Yet Miltown Malbay and its pubs hang on. In chatting over a large whiskey with Muiris O'Rochain, I learned a little about the Irish music that is keeping this town and its traditions alive. Muiris is a cattle farmer, a tall, burly man with an outdoor complexion. Yet all his life, like many other people in Clare, he has had a second activity, an occupation that amounts almost to a calling - music. In western Ireland, and in Clare particularly, traditional music - the setting of fiddle, flute, whistle, uilleann pipes or concertina to old songs and tunes - is more than a hobby; it is the vehicle that carries the memory of the past. Nor is there any question about the power of Irish music to carry such a ponderous emotional load. In the high driving lilt of the fiddle or longing of the uilleann pipes there is something compelling, irrationally stirring. Like the best, simplest and strongest of arts, this is a music that draws on something far deeper than mere intellect. What makes it different is that it is the expression not of the individual but of the group. This is clannish music, tribal music, a racial recollection. Walk into a pub where a roomful of drinkers are gathered near a table of fiddles going full tilt, or round a woman singing alone in sad lament and your tribal brain will recognise it for the old call it is. It will raise the hairs on the back of your neck and set your blood pumping. Twenty years ago, Muiris told me, he was spurred to action by the death of his friend Willie Clancy, then Clare's best known musician. Like other admirers of things Gaelic, Muiris saw that the old ways were slipping through their fingers, that knowledge of Irish music was dying with the passing of each generation. So began the Willie Clancy Summer School, a link allowing the passing on of music to younger players. Today it is a school of international repute, drawing 800 advanced musicians a year to intensive classes, lectures, workshops and recitals in Miltown. In their wake follow 6,000 enthusiastic non-enrolled musicians and music lovers who night and day crowd into every pub in town to exchange tunes, pick up techniques, and enjoy 'the crack' - the good times that flow from music and beer and Irish conviviality. When the sun shines, Miltown Malbay makes hay. For the short period the school is in session the town's bars, shops, restaurants and bed-and-breakfasts make a handsome turnover. Without the profits generated by the school, Miltown's economy, less resilient than its musical culture, would collapse. If money is in short supply the rest of the year, music is not. On the evening I spoke to Muiris, I wandered down to Spanish Point, where in a pub overlooking the sea the Wolfe Tones were giving a concert. Thirty years ago they were young firebrands, four hot-blooded musical militants from Dublin who could work a crowd to fever-pitch with republican songs of British oppression and the glory of Irish martyrdom. Today they are old firebrands, greying, red-faced, and tending to fat, but still together and still capable, through their music, of firing the emotions of Irish history. During the evening the Wolf Tones missed no chance to denounce, musically, what between songs they called '200 years of the impoverishment of Ireland by British government policies'. By the end of the evening, closing with A Nation Once Again, they had the younger and more athletic section of the audience swinging, literally, from the rafters. But Irish music is not made by cabals bent on sentimentalising violence. At its best it is poetry, and in Clare its inspiration comes less often from violence than from the gentle world of bog and farm. On the morning I met him, Junior Crehan told me he began composing songs simply by listening to the world as he worked around his farm - to the rhythmic sound of a mowing machine, or the huff of the West Clare Railway in the distance. Despite his name, Junior has silvery hair, tobacco-stained fingers and blue eyes that have turned milky with age. At 85 he is the respected doyen of Clare musicians; his jigs and reels have sent friends dancing across the great stone flags of his farm-house since the early part of this century. Junior apologised for his sleepiness as we talked in his kitchen; the evening before, in the nearby village of Mallagh, he had played fiddle in Moroney's Bar with a dozen other musicians until two in the morning. That was nothing, he said; as a young man he had often played at country house dances until 7am. 'Some people thought we were crazy,' he said, 'but they knew nothing about music. It was in our blood. For us it was a religion.' Perhaps too much so. In the 1930s the Irish clergy, citing immoral behaviour among the young, pressed for the passage of the Dance Hall Act. It was a bill which brought the days of the great country dances to an end and provoked a long decline in traditional music. Not everything from that period is lost. Traditional Irish music has undergone a great revival and, says Junior, never looked better than today. Best of all remain the late-night pub sessions that sometimes begin only when the blinds are drawn, the front door is locked, and the place appears closed. In Friel's, a Miltown pub that is second home to local musicians, no matter how tough times get, you are likely to hear an impromptu session begin any time the Guinness begins to flow. If you wait long enough you will see music, stories and poetry transform themselves as the night draws on from simple words and notes into some kind of magic. What I am waiting to see now is the week when a thousand fiddle and pipe players are let loose in the street of 19 pubs. Send inquiries about the 1994 Willie Clancy Summer School (July 3-11) to: Muiris O'Rochain, director, Scoil Samhraidh Willie Clancy, Miltown Malbay, Co Clare, Ireland.

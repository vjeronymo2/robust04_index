			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Hanoi polite but cool over lifting of embargo The government in Hanoi welcomed the lifting of the embargo in a polite but unenthusiastic statement. Vietnamese officials had come to view the embargo as unfair punishment for winning the Vietnam war and they believe they have waited far too long for the punishment to end. The deputy foreign minister, Le Mai, attacked the embargo as an abuse of power by the US and contrary to international law. Hanoi wants to see normal relations with the US but many obstacles remain. Financial compensation, the fate of missing American servicemen and Vietnam's human rights record are among issues to be tackled. Talks are due to start in Hanoi on February 15 to settle claims by governments and individuals in both countries for property seized after the end of the war. The claims are worth hundreds of millions of dollars and include assets of the former South Vietnamese government which have been frozen in the US. Full diplomatic relations between the two countries could still be a year or more away. Meanwhile, Hanoi is left wondering what it gains from the lifting of the embargo. Although American companies will now be able to sell their products in Vietnam, Vietnamese exports to the US will not be able to compete with neighbouring countries whose products attract low tariffs under their Most Favoured Nation trading status. For now, though, people all over Vietnam are celebrating; not because President Clinton has finally lifted the embargo but because next week is the Vietnamese New Year, and the anniversary of the Tet offensive 26 years ago, the turning point of the war. Vietnamese people hope this year will be another turning point, away from memories of war and towards a more prosperous future.</p>

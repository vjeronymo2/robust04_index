			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Polish lessons The debt-reduction accord signed with great fanfare in Warsaw yesterday is a case of virtue rewarded. Nearly five years after pioneering 'shock therapy' market reforms, Poland is an economic success story, by post-communist standards, with a growth rate last year of 4 per cent. The debt agreement, which halves the country's Dollars 14bn commercial debt, will complete the nation's economic transformation, by making Poland a member in good standing of the international financial community. While Poles have a right to celebrate, their less successful neighbours to the east and south would do well to consider how they earned it. The first Polish lesson is speed. Radical economic reforms work best when, as in Poland, they are implemented immediately after the collapse of the old regime, when governments have the greatest credibility and citizens the greatest endurance. The initial caution - or cowardice - of the countries which failed to follow Poland's lead has made their task much more difficult. The second lesson is steadfastness. Market reforms - as Poles know from the first six months of 1990 when prices soared, and wages and production plummeted - are initially traumatic. But the conclusion that countries like Russia need less shock and more therapy is mistaken. The wiser council, which Polish leaders heeded, is to endure the shock and patiently await the therapeutic outcome. Even so, shock alone is not enough. The third Polish lesson is that a package of reforms can be much more than the sum of its parts. Privatisation, the one area in which Russia has moved more radically than either Poland or Hungary, is no bad thing, but it is not the key to successful reform. What matters, instead, is to create a market through liberalisation and macro-economic stabilisation. Governments must force enterprises to live, or die, in that market, by severing the umbilical cord that ties inefficient state factories to the state treasury, ultimately strangling both. This is, of course, no easy task, because many inefficient state factories must be shut down and their workers be made at least temporarily unemployed. The fourth Polish lesson, which applies with even greater force to Russia and Ukraine, is that western financial backing, at the right moment, can provide a life-jacket for countries about to throw themselves into the initially frigid waters of reform. The west gave Poland that support, in the form of a stand-by stabilisation loan, followed by debt forgiveness. Kiev's leaders are, for example, still dithering on the brink of radical reforms. The time for the new government of President Leonid Kuchma to make decisive changes is running out. They must act radically and comprehensively, as the Poles did, but first they need a firm and detailed promise of substantial western support in reward for taking the plunge.</p>

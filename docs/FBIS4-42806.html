			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Views" column: "A Pipeline of Development"] </F>   [Text] The promotion of Greek-Russian economic cooperation  and the convergence of plans by the two governments for alumina,  natural gas, and primarily Russian oil confirm the extent of  Greece's possibilities for a more substantive role in the  Balkans and the further development of its economic relations  with the Eastern countries.    Upon his return from Moscow, Foreign Minister Karolos  Papoulias said the following about his talks with President  Boris Yeltsin and the Russian ministers: "In both the political  and economic sectors, we have achieved what we both -- Greeks  and Russians -- wanted. That is, we agreed on the big economic  plans that the two governments are making in such things as  alumina, gas, and oil."    The most important plan, which also has political  significance, is the plan dealing with the construction of a big  pipeline for the transfer of Russian oil from Burgas, Bulgaria,  to the port of Alexandroupolis.    This project will make it possible to bypass the Canakkale  Straits and to address Turkey's threat to ban the passage of  tankers through the straits.    At the same time, the pipeline for the transfer of Russian  natural gas to Greece as well as the further development of  economic relations with Russia, Bulgaria, and the other Black  Sea countries to Alexandroupolis port will acquire international  importance and become an interesting transit center.    All these facts strengthen the possibilities for success of  the Thrace development program, which would make the region  Greece's third economic focal point, as was proposed in the  feasibility study by the Athens Academy's Research Center.    Thrace can and must become Greece's third economic focal  point, it must become an economic and cultural center in the  Balkans.    The government must consider the Athens Academy's proposal  and utilize it. It would be a mistake to shelve it.    The development and improvement of Thrace is a task of  national significance. The Greek-Russian cooperation projects  will help in both the development and defense of this sensitive  border region.</p>

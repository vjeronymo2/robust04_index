			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / UK Company News: British Vita ahead 11% at Pounds 27m BRITISH VITA, the polymer, fibre and foam company with most of its sales in continental Europe, yesterday reported an 11 per cent increase in interim profits, after acquisitions, but reduced margins. Pre-tax profits to end-June rose from Pounds 24.17m to Pounds 26.81m but the Pounds 22m increase in sales to Pounds 372m was all accounted for by acquisitions. Earnings per share rose 0.2p to 7.9p after adjustment for last year's Pounds 73m rights issue. The interim dividend is lifted to 3.5p (3.45p). The results were flattered by a sharp reduction in the interest charge as a result of the rights proceeds and a staunching of losses in a US associated company. At the operating level British Vita was marginally below 1991 levels, despite that period being affected by the Gulf war. Mr Rod Sellers, chief executive, said there was little prospect of more than zero growth in the UK in the next year and businesses were aggressively fighting for market share. Margins were broadly maintained in the industrial polymers division on sales marginally lower at Pounds 79m, helped by cost cutting in the UK. About 18 per cent of the group's sales are into the auto industry but despite the low level of new car registrations, production in the UK remains fairly buoyant, Mr Sellers said. About 60 per cent of group turnover is now produced and sold in continental Europe. In cellular polymers, the group's largest business area, sales increased as a result of the addition of European and the US subsidiaries but margins were hit by increased losses of Pounds 2m in Spain and the drought-affected Zimbabwe where the group has a long-standing investment. COMMENT British Vita's diversity, both in terms of products and spread through continental Europe, is a strength more UK-centric companies would do well to contemplate if a true single market is to become a reality. Even with European economies slowing there is little to support fears that British Vita has over-extended in Europe; few markets anywhere are, after all, in really good shape anywhere. On the other hand, with markets flat and the company pursuing a policy of cutting margins where necessary to protect market share, there is little prospect of any excitement. Indeed, British Vita will have to work hard just to stay put. For the rating to be revitalised, British Vita needs another acquisition for its respected management team to exploit. But shareholders should hope British Vita will remain cautious. With the proceeds of last year's rights tucked away in the bank, the company's greatest mistake could be to race into an acquisition. For the full year, the company is therefore heading towards Pounds 54.5m of pre-tax profits, or 15.8p of earnings, and a fairly priced prospective multiple of about 14.</p>

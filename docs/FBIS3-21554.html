			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Before White Paper Is Released -- </F> Most National Assembly Defense Commission Members Favor Limited  Atomic `Strike' Capacity"]    [Text] France's nuclear deterrent must be adapted to new  realities and include capabilities for limited and highly  accurate strikes. This is the doctrine currently advocated by a  very large majority of the National Assembly's Defense  Commission members in the 150-page report they have just written  to present their choices before the government presents its own  White Paper on Defense and military planning bill.    This is the first such parliamentary initiative in the 30  years that the Assembly has been required to give its opinion on  a military planning bill.    RPR [Rally for the Republic] Ain representative and  Commission President Jacques Boyon has denied charges that the  commission views the report as a "counter White Paper"; the  document lists the issues on which the majority and the  opposition are in agreement, those on which there is some  agreement between them, and those on which they disagree. PS  [Socialist Party] Ille-et-Vilaine representative and former  Commission President Jean-Michel Boucheron speaks of a  "French-style consensus" on defense, with the only differences  relating to nuclear testing and possibly the potential benefits  of an antimissile defense system.    Commission members have more particularly focused on three  basic issues: nuclear deterrence, the national service, and  defense-related industries.    1. As for nuclear deterrence, the report states that "it is  clear that while the current doctrine must be maintained, it  needs to be adjusted to new realities. Our nuclear weapons must  be designed bearing in mind a range of actions meant to defend  our basic interests, and no longer our vital interests only.  Deterrence can no longer be defined in `weak-to-strong' terms,  but we will need capabilities for limited and highly accurate  strikes. Such enlarged deterrence must prompt us to renew our  nuclear weapon systems," which, according to a majority of  commission members, presupposes resumed atomic testing even  though "our current weapons are perfectly operational until  2005." The commission notes that a broad consensus has emerged  in favor of two nuclear "components": strategic submarines and a  nuclear missile carried by the Rafale [fighter-bomber] (without  choosing among Matra's competing Apache missile and  Aerospatiale's ASLP [long-range air-to-surface missile]).    2. Conscription: This is the commission's preferred option  as opposed to that of an exclusively professional army. The  report notes that "developing civilian forms of national service  must entail very high requirements with regard to equality of  implementation -- equality among such new forms as well as with  the military service. In any event, the search for new civilian  forms must remain compatible with national defense requirements,  and the needs of the Defense Ministry must retain priority  status."    3. Industry: Most commission members -- a few of whom are  the elected representatives of regions which boast armament  production concerns -- condemn the general planning  commissioner's recent report which suggests that, since France  cannot do everything on its own due to financial considerations,  it should abandon some activity areas in order to concentrate on  priority sectors.    The report states that "clear differences have emerged as to  the idea of focusing on some sectors of excellence and  abandoning others, as apparently suggested in a recent planning  report. A broad majority of commission members oppose this  notion, deemed suicidal and unrealistic for our defense  industry, and dangerous for our national independence. On the  other hand, the commission acknowledges the need for European  cooperation on a number of weapon types."</p>

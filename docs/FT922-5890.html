			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: High hopes for Lake Michigan diamonds AN AREA west of Lake Michigan in the states of Michigan and Wisconsin in the US has a good chance of yielding a world-class diamond mine, said Mr John Robinson, chief executive of Ashton Mining, yesterday. Ashton is based in Australia but sees diamond mining as its core business and will go anywhere in the world to search for the stones. So the company grabbed with both hands an opportunity to buy 51 per cent of the Great Lakes diamond project from Dow Chemical, he said. The deal was completed in January. Of the 14 kimberlite pipes found by the previous joint venturers in the project - Dow and Crystal Exploration - 12 had been tested an nine contained diamonds. 'This means the probability of success is much higher than usual,' said Mr Robinson. To put this in context, of the 3,000 known kimberlite deposits in the world, only 1,000 contain diamonds and only 50 to 60 have ever proved economic. Ashton draws most of its cash flow and profit from a 38.2 per cent share of the Argyle mine in Western Australia, in weight terms the world's biggest diamond producer. Mr Robinson, in London with Ashton's chairman Sir Leslie Froggatt to talk to institutional investors, said that in Ashton's view only one of the 12 kimberlite pipes discovered by the Great Lakes venturers had been fully tested. So priority was being given to drilling the three untested and eight partly-tested pipes with a view to identifying the various phases of kimberlite present and testing the diamond content. Ashton had also used its special skills to re-examine exploration data from its joint venture in Australia's Northern Territory where it has a 65.4 per cent interest and where exploration has been going on for 14 years. Mr Robinson said the results were very exciting. 'The whole perception of the deposit has changed,' he said. The company had now identified 11 large diamondiferous targets. One loam sample collected recently from pipes located about 140 km (85 miles) north of the town of Coanjula contained a broken, commercial-sized diamond measuring 3mm by 2.7mm by 1.4mm. Ashton also has gold mining interests and of the ADollars 12m it will spend on exploration this year, most will go to look for the yellow metal. Mr Robinson suggested that De Beers' Central Selling Organisation, which controls 80 per cent of the world's rough (uncut) diamond trade and markets most of Argyle's gem diamonds, would not put up prices this year. The latest rough diamond price rise (of 5.5 per cent) was as long ago as March 1990. But the CSO would probably make an increase early next year, he said.</p>

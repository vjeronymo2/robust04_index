			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Observer: Green surprise Europe's 'green' parties come in all sorts of political shades, but none comes near to matching the performance of the Hungarian 'greens'. Instead of campaigning for population control, the Hungarian greens' TV broadcasts call on Hungarian men to do the 'daily triple' with their wives. The party does not spell out in detail what it is Hungarian men should do three times a day. But party officials believe it would 'increase the birth rate and lead to a decline in homosexuality, prostitution and the divorce rate'. However, this brave rallying cry has yet to capture the imagination of the Hungarian electorate. Early returns suggest that the party has as much chance of capturing a seat as Britain's Screaming Lord Sutch.</p>

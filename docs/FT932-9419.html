			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Bangkok fire 'will not harm company' THE Hong Kong owners of a Thai toy plant where at least 204 workers, mostly young women, died in one of the world's worst factory fires said yesterday the disaster would do their company's finances little harm, Reuter reports from Hong Kong. Kader Holdings, which has a 40 per cent stake in the Bangkok factory, said it regretted the blaze and had sent condolences to the families of the dead. The announcement made no mention of compensation for the victims' families. The company said it 'believes that the accident will have no substantial financial impact'. Guards at the Bangkok plant said workers had been locked in to prevent pilfering. Workers said there were no fire alarms or fire escapes. Mr Kenneth Ting, chairman, told the South China Morning Post a smaller blaze had hit the factory in 1989. 'Every precaution was taken after the 1989 fire to improve the situation, but nothing could be done to stop Monday's fire as it was caused by an electrical spark.' However, Thai police said initial investigations indicated an electric fault was not to blame, suggesting either arson or carelessness instead.</p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Germans split on economic way forward SHARP differences emerged yesterday between the German government and the opposition over ways of tackling the country's growing unemployment crisis, and fears over its weakening international competitiveness. Chancellor Helmut Kohl issued an urgent appeal to both sides of industry to slow down the rise in wages, and take drastic action to improve labour flexibility. In response, Mr Oskar Lafontaine, deputy leader and economy spokesman of the opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD), called for cross-party and cross-industry agreement on a national employment pact, with measures from the government to boost investment spending specifically to create new jobs. He set out a 10-point programme, intended to be the basis of the SPD election campaign next year, setting unemployment and economic recovery in east Germany at the top of the election agenda. The two statements of economic policy came in a parliamentary debate on the government's report on securing the country's future as an industrial location - the so-called Standort Deutschland. Mr Kohl warned that Germany urgently needed to create up to 5m new competitive jobs. He attacked not only labour market inflexibility, but the failure of German industry to invest enough in research and development, citing in particular the micro-electronics industry. German companies registered patents for just 181 micro-electronic inventions in 1992, compared with 289 in 1987, he said. In Japan, the number registered in the same two years rose from 17,408 to 23,082. He also criticised German red tape, and the slow progress in negotiations on privatisation in two key areas: the Deutsche Telekom, and the German railways. He warned that the German small business sector was endangered by the growing trend towards academic education, and away from industry-oriented professional training.</p>

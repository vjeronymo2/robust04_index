Tensions Grow as  Yeltsin's Visit to Tbilisi Draws Near"]    [Text] The relative political calm in Tbilisi seems to be  ending. The impression is that the government and the  opposition "who retired to their corners" are preparing for a  fresh "bout." Shortly before Russian President Boris Yeltsin's  visit, the council of one of the leading socialist parties had  formulated and put forward its stance on the Abkhazia problem.  As the Social Democrats, for example, see it, there are three  ways to regain Abkhazia. First, by Eduard Shevardnadze's  pressuring Russia with some help from Western politicians.  Second, according to the parliamentary majority, the  renunciation of all talks and the use of military force. Third,  friendship with Russia and the regaining of Abkhazia using  Russia's means. The third option is what constitutes the stance  of Social Democrats on this question.    Such a point of view is also held by the majority of  political parties that pin certain hopes on the settlement of  relations with Russia precisely in connection with the upcoming  visit. But the more radical forces in Georgia still remain  supporters of a confrontation with Russia. The first among them  is perhaps Boris Kakubava, a deputy of parliament, the leader of  the organization "Liberation of Abkhazia." During a recent  press conference he once again accused the Georgian Government  of inaction. He assessed the Geneva talks as extremely negative  and called upon the public, primarily refugees from Abkhazia, to  stage protest actions against Russia's interference in Georgia's  internal affairs in the course of the Abkhazia conflict and to  blame Russia for defeat in the war. Irakliy Tsereteli, leader of  the "National Independence of Georgia" party, made a similar  statement. He thinks that President Yeltsin should know that  there are forces in Georgia that are far from delighted with  Russian policy toward Georgia. He calls upon the Georgian  Government to come forward with a statement on the restoration  of Georgia's jurisdiction in Abkhazia and in so-called South  Ossetia.    In the meantime, Conservative-Monarchist Party chairman  Temur  Zhorzholiani declared that he welcomes Boris Yeltsin's visit in  every way and that he is awaiting a constructive dialogue of the  heads of the two states in whose course both political and  economic problems would be settled. Incidentally, the number of  such statements is considerably greater because it has finally  become clear that Russia cannot be easily pressured, the forces  are far from equal, and it is impossible to pass overnight from  the sphere of Russian influence into the sphere of Western  influence. Thus, the points of view of the government and those  of the opposition have grown somewhat closer on this matter.    A conference of mainly opposition political organizations to  which were invited representatives of nearly all parties and  organizations of the republic, persons prominent in science and  culture, was held in parliament hall yesterday. Eduard  Shevardnadze, who did not attend, sent a written apology which  seemed to have cooled the speakers' aggressive ardor a bit. But  there was criticism galore. For example, Republican Ivlian  Khaindrava stated that ever since the weakening of the communist  regime in Georgia the signs of a power crisis, which was showing  in varying degrees of acuteness under the old regime and which  is showing under the present regime, have been starkly evident.  This is to be explained, according to him, by the lack of a  clear separation of powers between the legislative and the  executive branches and by their failure to perform their own  functions. As a result, virtually unlimited power is  concentrated in the hands of one individual. A situation has  taken shape in the country in which, according to Khaindrava,  all questions starting from the problems of the Tbilisi zoo and  ending with Georgia's joining the CIS are solved singlehanded by  the head of state.    The speakers of virtually all opposition parties showed  solidarity with the Republicans in this regard and in the  supposition that the cabinet was unable to solve economic and  financial problems and follow a purposeful policy in the area of  economic reforms. Trying to explain the reasons for the  economic failure during yesterday's parliament session, Prime  Minister Otar Patsatsiya asked for another 10 days to study this  problem. The time was sufficient, he thought, for a specially  created commission to find the reason for the plunging of the  coupon.    Many complaints about the head of state and the policy he  follows were voiced by People's Fund of Georgia chairman Nodar  Natadze. In his opinion, the current leadership had been  artificially stoking up the atmosphere and deepening the crisis  in which joining the CIS should appear the only way to save  Georgia. The same is being done regarding the idea that is  floating in the air about joining the ruble zone, which would  deprive Georgia of one of the main trappings of an independent  state --its own currency. Georgia's course toward Russia,  Natadze stated, is nothing but an open recognition of the  latter's diktat. But it should be noted that not only  criticisms were voiced, but also constructive proposals on  overcoming the crisis. Those gathered generally arrived at the  conclusion that in order to get out of the situation that had  taken shape it was necessary first and foremost to revise  downward the powers of the head of state, to increase the role  of parliament, and to create a cabinet able to at long last to  work out and carry through economic reforms. Tough demands, no  doubt about it. It is hard to say if Shevardnadze and the  government agree on a compromise. This newly emerging situation  too will perhaps become clearer during Boris Yeltsin's visit.</p>

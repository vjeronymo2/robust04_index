			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zoran Petrov: "Black Clouds From the Bosnian </F> Sky"]    [Text] With any possible airstrike against the  Serbian positions in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the first to suffer  will be the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR]; can the UN  peacekeeping forces be pulled out of the Bosnian hell?; the  direct involvement of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY]  in the conflict is almost certain, through which the war would  actually spread beyond Bosnia-Herzegovina's borders; an  "extraordinary chance" to include other forces as well in the  possible conflict.    The long-announced military intervention by the Western  allies to break the 22-month-old blockade of Sarajevo is  becoming more and more certain, especially after the massacre in  the Sarajevo market, in which 68 people died and over 200 were  wounded by a shell's explosion, and after the UN's official  request to NATO for authorization for airstrikes in Bosnia, or,  more specifically, for bombing the Serbian artillery positions  around Sarajevo. It seems that the international community's  prolonged hesitation and wait-and-see attitude are finally over.  The key decision was adopted the day before yesterday in the  evening in Brussels at a meeting of ambassadors from the 16 NATO  members, with the declaration of the critical date--21 February,  one hour after midnight, when NATO planes will bomb artillery  sites within a radius of about 20 kilometers around Sarajevo.  The ultimatum, formulated as a warning primarily to the Serbian  side, refers to the withdrawal of all of the heavy weapons and  their placement under UNPROFOR control by a set date and time.    Regardless of the announcement of the international  community's last argument of persuasion, military intervention,  which the world public received in a way with a great deal of  relief and support, many unresolved questions nevertheless  remain despite everything. Will the air intervention against the  Bosnian Serbs' artillery positions around Sarajevo settle the  Bosnian conflict? To what extent would such a step by the  Western alliance serve to establish the peace that is so much  desired in the embattled region, especially after the statements  by the leaders of the so-called republic of Srpska that they  will defend themselves by all means available? Are there  possibilities that after such an action the war might spread  beyond Bosnia-Herzegovina's borders? Where is Macedonia [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] in such a possible  course of events, and what are the realistic chances that it  might also become involved in the conflict?  <H5>  UNPROFOR the First to Suffer </H5>   According to the chief of the General Staff of the Army of  the Republic of Macedonia [ARM], Major General Dragoljub  Bocinov, the airstrike by NATO or UN forces against the Bosnian  Serbs' artillery positions will complicate the already extremely  delicate and complex situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This will  already nullify even the present limited control over this  military hot spot, thus creating broad possibilities for the  conflict to spread and for it to be regionalized in southern  Europe, with complete destabilization of the Balkans and with  their being drawn into a zone of constant conflicts. One of the  most essential aspects of the already announced intervention and  the possibilities of its escalation into an open conflict  between two or more combatants, according to General Bocinov, is  the Serbs' attitude toward the UNPROFOR units deployed in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. In an operational sense, the UN forces have  an enclave deployment, which means that they are not linked in a  combat line and are in a situation of strategic encirclement. In  other words, the chief of the General Staff emphasizes, to a  certain extent they are already hostages. According to our  interlocutor, an extremely significant element in this context  is the attitude of the Western governments which have their own  peacekeeping contingents in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In their  assessments at any level of the balance of power, human life is  the number one factor, and thus saving and protecting the troops  in the UN multinational contingent can play the deciding role  here. Thus, Bocinov emphasizes, these countries can be expected  to decide to withdraw their forces, which in the first place is  almost impossible in the present conditions, and in the second  place, even then the conflicts will increase in intensity,  ferocity, and uncontrollability.    This position coincides with the view of retired Major  General Todor Atanasovski, namely the possibility that the UN  may decide to abandon the battlefield and continue political and  economic pressure, leaving the combatants to themselves. The  only logic of this goal, according to General Atanasovski, is to  maintain the conflict within the present limits. Many problems  arise in this case, however, as he emphasizes. In the first  place, whether the world can accept such an inhuman step with a  clear conscience, and whether it is even possible for the UN  forces to be withdrawn from Bosnia-Herzegovina at such a  juncture. One has to bear in mind that their main goal at  present is to protect humanitarian convoys, which in a way are  the last crumb of hope for numerous unfortunates in Bosnia. With  the possible withdrawal of the peacekeeping forces, in addition  to the loss of any control and any sort of influence and  mediation among the combatants, UNPROFOR may become their common  enemy, and be attacked on all sides. This is the most difficult  alternative to implement, Atanasovski emphasizes, although the  governments of the countries that have their own contingents in  Bosnia-Herzegovina are becoming more and more nervous about the  fate of their troops, and some of them, like France recently,  have already announced the possibility of withdrawing them.  <H5>  Will the Bosnian Cauldron Overflow? </H5>   As an area that objectively gravitates toward the unsettled  region and in a way is located in the critical zone, Macedonia  is directly affected by the Bosnian military outcome. As  Slobodan Dimiskovski, a doctor of military sciences and an  expert on this problem, emphasizes, the FRY's attitude toward  military intervention against the Bosnian Serbs is a significant  aspect of a speculative situation thus formulated. One can  assert with a considerable degree of certainty, Dimiskovski  says, that the FRY would become involved in supporting, i.e., in  the actions and operations of, the army of the so-called  republic of Srpska. The general situation would thereby become  more complicated not only in the area of Bosnia-Herzegovina, but  also in a much broader area, including even the entire Balkans,  and within them Macedonia as well. Retired Lt. General Mitre  Arsovski, the former chief of the ARM's General Staff, has an  almost identical view of things; in his opinion, the most  natural thing is to expect direct intervention by the Republic  of Serbia and its involvement in the conflict. General Arsovski  emphasizes that this directly raises the possibility of an  expansion of combat operations into the FRY as well, which, by  the way, also borders on the Republic of Macedonia. In his  opinion, a second significant element in assessing the possible  course of events after air attacks against the Serbian positions  in Bosnia-Herzegovina is the fact that fighter-bombers will fly  from the aircraft carriers in the Adriatic and from the NATO  bases in Italy. And what will happen, Arsovski asks, if the  bases in Greece are used, even if the latter country still  opposes it? In his opinion, if this possibility is realized,  which is fairly likely in a given course of events, then by  yielding its air space for overflight by American aircraft  Macedonia would indirectly be joining one side, in all of this  development of the conflict assumed so far.    This is essentially the worst alternative for the country's  security, since in one speculative situation thus formulated the  reality would be a response by Serbia using the so-called  retaliatory strategy, at first against the U.S. troops on the  Macedonian-Serbian border and then in a later phase against the  Republic of Macedonia, thus creating a hot spot with  unforeseeable consequences for the entire Balkans, or for the  security of Europe in general. The situation can also be  complicated in another way. According to General Bocinov's  estimates, the Bosnian barrel can overflow at the moment when  Izetbegovic's Bosnian army sees its own chance in the escalation  of the entire conflict, and it will very likely also be joined  by the Muslims in Sandzak and Montenegro. Bocinov says that  this, at the same time, will also be an extraordinary  opportunity for the Albanians from Kosovo, and then from Western  Macedonia, who in a situation in which there would be military  pressure and the expulsion of the Serbs from their positions in  Bosnia, to join in the conflict. In effect, the chief of the  ARM's General Staff emphasizes, this would mean the beginning of  a hellish cauldron in which everyone would be against everyone.  <H5>  Will the Americans Attack? </H5>   The model for the outcome of the Bosnian conflict that is  now  being applied did not arise as a well-considered military system  but rather arose step-by-step and was carried out partially,  gradually, and in a palliative manner, General Atanasovski  thinks. In his opinion, that lack of coordination is also  reflected on the formal level--from resolutions, through  conferences, to one more partial measure, namely the threat of  air attacks against the Serbian positions. Obviously,  Atanasovski emphasizes, the results of the latest initiative  will be the same as the ones to date, i.e., this maximalization  of the pressure indicates the counterproductive nature of the  entire action. Instead of ending the war, it will lead to an  even greater intensification of combat operations. The only  model for resolving the Bosnian war, according to Atanasovski,  should start with noting that the status of the conflict in  Bosnia-Herzegovina has already passed the level at which it is  not important who is the aggressor and who is the victim. That  former definition, Atanasovski claims, no longer makes any  sense. "I agree and I accept the fact that the Serbs are the  cause of the war," he says, "but the future operation will have  to disarm all the armed sides in the Bosnian region, regardless  of which side they belong to. That means their forcible  immobilization and forced isolation in the entire war hot spot,  and furthermore for a long period." According to Atanasovski,  this is the only good solution for the Bosnian conflict.    On the other hand, as Dr. Dimiskovski emphasizes, it is  unlikely that the airstrikes will even be carried out,  regardless of all the seriousness of the NATO ultimatum. There  were decrees in the past and they were almost always  counterproductive, and thus Karadzic also said in response to  the last warning that the Serbs would defend themselves by all  means available. A similar attitude is also displayed by General  Mitre Arsovski, according to whom airstrikes by NATO forces  against the Serbian positions in Bosnia will not be carried out,  and at the moment they serve to intimidate and exert  psychological pressure and coercion for new negotiations. "I  personally think," he says, "that by using air power alone one  cannot resolve the situation on the front in Bosnia, and if it  is used, it will be more demonstrative in nature."    In any case, regardless of whether these are empty threats  or  a warning that will be carried out at any cost, the fact is that  a new, and perhaps the most serious trial for peace in the  entire region to date is in sight. Everything else is entering  an area of great uncertainty.  <H5>  [Box, p 16] </H5> <H5>  Dragoljub Bocinov, Major General and Chief of the ARM </H5> General Staff: "NATO Cannot Repeat `Desert Storm'"    For the time being the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina is on  the brink between war and peace. It is balancing between these  two options, since it is already clear that there cannot be a  middle solution. At the moment, the most problematic is the  answer to the question of whether Serbian wants peace and a  peaceful settlement of the war, since if it is achieved there  will be serious internal upheavals, and even its  destabilization. Imagine what would happen if 200,000-300,000  armed soldiers returned to the FRY, which has already been  devastated by the international sanctions. In other words, it is  an extremely likely assumption that ending the war does not suit  Serbia at all.    On the other hand, it is more than clear that NATO or the  United States cannot implement in Bosnia-Herzegovina or repeat  the model of the ground-air-sea battle of January 1991 from the  "Desert Storm" operation, since at the moment they do not have a  ground base organized. Without ground forces, territory cannot  be conquered and the war cannot be resolved.  <H5>  [Box, p 16] </H5> <H5>  Slobodan Dimiskovski, Doctor of Military Sciences: "The Most </H5> Horrible War in All Human History"    Hypothetically, in my opinion at least two options are  possible for a Bosnian settlement. The first would be concrete  implementation of the Karadjordjevo agreement between Milosevic  and Tudjman, i.e., combined Serbian-Croatian forces would  definitively defeat the Muslim army. This would achieve the main  strategic goal--preventing, at any cost, the formation of an  Islamic state in the Balkans, and creating a Greater Serbia and  Croatia within their historical borders.    The second option is based on the assumption that the UN,  the  EU, and NATO will not succeed in using negotiations, political  means, and even airstrikes to settle the Bosnian crisis, and  then it is likely that the UNPROFOR units will be withdrawn from  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The fate of the three hostile ethnic groups  would thus essentially be left to their leaders and armies. That  would constitute a horror in comparison with all wars in the  course of all human history.</p>

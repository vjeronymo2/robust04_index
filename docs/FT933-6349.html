			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Bugatti takes over Lotus sports cars TWO FAMOUS marques of the European motor industry are to be brought together with the takeover of Group Lotus, the UK sports car maker and automotive engineering group, by Bugatti International. The Bugatti holding company, registered in Luxembourg, was formed in the late 1980s to revive the Bugatti marque. It is understood to be paying about Pounds 30m to buy Group Lotus from General Motors of the US. Bugatti International's main operating company is Bugatti Automobili, which started production in Italy last year of a L550m (Pounds 230,000 pre-tax) supercar, the EB110, the first Bugatti to be made since the early 1950s. Group Lotus, which was acquired by GM in 1986 for Pounds 22.7m, has run up heavy losses in recent years, and the US carmaker has been searching for a buyer for several months following the breakdown of talks on a management buy-out. Group Lotus, founded by Colin Chapman, one of the most creative designers of racing cars, suffered its biggest setback last year when it was forced by rapidly mounting losses to end production of its Elan sports car less than two-and-a-half years after launch. The Elan cost Lotus a write-off of Pounds 24.4m. The company acquired by Bugatti has no connection with Team Lotus, the Formula One motor racing operation. Bugatti is taking over the entire Group Lotus business, including its engineering, consulting and car production operations based at Hethel, near Norwich, as well as Lotus assets in the US, where it sells through a 59-strong dealer network. The Italian carmaker said Lotus and Bugatti would remain separate companies but would pool their resources in development and marketing. Mr Romano Artioli, president of Bugatti Automobili, said Lotus engineering would be used to accelerate the development of Bugatti's planned EB112 sports saloon due for launch in 1995. The Lotus name is expected to be used for branding other products. The Bugatti name is currently exploited on items ranging from champagne to table ware and men's clothing.

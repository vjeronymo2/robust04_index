			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Management: Nothing is forever in business alliances We will probably never know exactly what Nobuhiko Kawamoto told the chairman of BMW in Tokyo on Monday. The disgruntled president of Honda had two main agenda items: in the wake of BMW's bold purchase of majority control in Rover three weeks ago, he informed the German car company boss of Honda's decision to sell its minority stake. And the two men explored the future of Honda's various joint projects with Rover. If Kawamoto had been entirely frank and open - which is most unlikely given the cross-cultural sensitivities involved, and Honda's patent need to display maximum outrage in order to squeeze higher licensing and other fees out of Rover - he would have said something like: 'Don't cry for me, Pischetsrieder.' The hurt which Honda is suffering is far less than politicians and commentators of various nationalities have suggested in a spate of emotional outbursts. The complainers are right to the extent that breakdowns of the Honda-Rover kind are rare. Alliances usually end amicably, either in parting, or by one side acquiring the other. But it is not unknown for one partner to leave the other in the lurch, either to go it alone or to team up with a rival. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the loser is occasionally Japanese. Kawasaki drew the short straw two years ago, for instance, when its close and long-standing collaboration in helicopters with MBB (by then part of Deutsche Aerospace) ended after the German company created a joint venture, Eurocopter, with Aerospatiale of France. On a smaller scale, Mazda was dropped by Ford on a minivan development project, in favour of Nissan. But in most other senses the tears of the pro-Honda lobby are unwarranted. Contrary to all the allegations of 'betrayal', there are only two sensible interpretations of the way Honda allowed Bernd Pischetsrieder and BMW to steal a march on it. The less likely, in spite of Honda's display of jilted honour, is that in its hour of need the Japanese company somehow lost the adroit political instinct which it has always displayed in the past, in every aspect of its dealings with business partners and governments. According to this reading of events, Honda was caught out because it forgot several fundamental rules for collaborating in the sort of 'strategic alliance' it has had with Rover. As Jordan Lewis, an American alliance specialist, says, a key maxim is that 'alliances survive only as long as each company regards the other as its best partner. So each must take what steps it can to ensure that the other continues to need it'. Another rule is that each partner should negotiate an 'exit strategy' at the beginning of the relationship - and revise it as the years pass  - in case mutual need disappears, or the shared objectives change. The second interpretation of events seems far more likely: that Honda realised precisely what was going on, but that it took a cold business decision that a majority stake in Rover was either not worth the cost, or would tie its hands too much in the long run. According to this reading of events, Honda had its exit route well-prepared. Unusually for the junior partner in an alliance, Rover certainly did too, by developing its independent skills in engines and other key areas of the business. In stark contrast to the division of opinion among politicians and journalists, there is a remarkable convergence of views among the academics and consultants whom I have polled this week. From vantage points in Italy, France, Washington and California, they all argue that, even without BMW's intervention, the 15-year-old Honda-Rover alliance would have come to an end or been scaled back within the next five years. It was already more than twice the average age of similar partnerships. This would have happened in one of three ways: through a complete parting; through Honda's full integration of Rover; or through the sort of watering down which is now occurring. As these experts argue, there is a natural life cycle for the sort of alliances which, as with Honda-Rover, are constructed to give one company market access and initial production scale in a particular region of the world, while in return its local partner borrows technology and management skills - and sometimes also reaps a production benefit. 'For most companies, that's all part of the process of internationalisation  -such agreements make sense for a while, but not for ever,' says Yves Doz, an Insead professor who is writing a book on global alliances. 'Eventually, the partners call it quits, or one takes full control.' Once the incoming company gains sufficient market access and production scale to be viable on its own - including through the supply of parts or complete products from its factories elsewhere in the world - the need for a regional partner often disappears. Honda can already meet the first of these conditions, now that it has decided to continue - at least for a few years - the cross-supply of parts with Rover. Such a relationship is perfectly normal between rivals these days in all sorts of industries, including cars. With local sales from its US production base stagnating, it also meets the second condition. It has plenty of capacity to supply its UK assembly plant with parts from the US, even if some of them will have to be redesigned. And it already exports several complete models from the US to Europe. So the value of the Rover alliance to Honda was set to decline in any case. In the words of Joel Bleeke and David Ernst of McKinsey &amp; Co, alliances are a form of 'arbitrage' in which the value of each partner's contribution varies over time. In the alliance business, nothing is forever.</p>

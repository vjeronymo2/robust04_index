			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Mackay criticised on fees: Law Society Conference MR MARK SHELDON, president of the Law Society, criticised the Lord Chancellor yesterday for refusing to delay implementation of standard fees for criminal legal aid work in magistrates' courts. Mr Sheldon told the Law Society's annual conference in Birmingham that Lord Mackay's proposals were 'ill-judged, ill-planned, ill-structured and unfair' and posed a threat to the fair operation of the criminal justice system. Lord Mackay, who is expected to reply in a speech at the conference on Saturday, sees standard fees as a means of curbing legal-aid expenditure, which will reach Pounds 1bn this year. At the present rate of growth, legal-aid costs will double within three years. Mr Sheldon, senior partner of City solicitors Linklater &amp; Paines, said Lord Mackay should put his plans on hold until after the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice had reported next summer. The commission was bound to recommend fundamental changes in the way criminal defence and prosecution work should be conducted. But Lord Mackay had made clear that he would not take any changes into account when setting fees in future, Mr Sheldon said. 'At a time when concern about the integrity of the criminal process has never been greater is it right to be introducing standard fees which could compromise the fair administration of criminal justice?' he asked. Mr Sheldon also warned Lord Mackay on wider advocacy rights for solicitors in the higher courts. He said the society would submit one application to the Lord Chancellor covering all solicitors, including those employed by the Crown Prosecution Service and the government legal service. If the Lord Chancellor rejected that application, it would bring the whole rights-of-audience process - the central plank of his reforms - to a halt, Mr Sheldon warned. The Lord Chancellor's advisory committee and Lord Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice, are opposed to CPS lawyers having rights of audience in the Crown Court.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Libyan leader Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi in </F> Tripoli on 15 April -- recording]    [Excerpts] Today's rally is added to other mass rallies by  various sections of the Libyan Arab people who have moved by  themselves and said that they have joined the ranks of  confrontation in order to be at the historical frontline so that  they can face the enemies who beat the drums of war and threats  and blow the trumpets of departure for war. They do this as it  is their custom, which history has made us accustomed to, as  they are barbaric and savage peoples who have not ceased to  attack us from one century to another out of injustice and  hostility.    We, along with the whole world, do not belive that the  problem is the so-called Pan Am or Lockerbie incident. This is  only an excuse. When one of these countries -- namely Britain,  which is one of the great powers confronting us now, confronting  this small nation -- wanted to occupy an Arab country, Egypt in  1882, Britain said there was a fortress [tabiyah] in Alexandria  that was in conflict with Britain's security and should be  removed and that Egypt's building a fortress in Alexandria  constituted a threat to Britain's security.    When 'Urabi [Ahmad 'Urabi, an Egyptian nationalist who  fought  against British occupation] refused to remove that fortress,  Britain attacked Egypt on the pretext of self-defense. This  mockery was recorded in history, and convoys of martyrs became  victims of it.    Matters such as these are what made important sections of  the  Libyan people, such as writers, artists, religious jurists, and  lawyers, along with great masses of revolutionary people in all  the places I have visited [sentence as heard]. Because they  realized that the issue here is an attempt to seek unjust  aggression and find justification for this aggression.    What adds to our steadfastness and strengthens our stance is  that the struggling forces against injustice and insolence in  all parts of the world stand by us. We salute today the  presence of representatives of peoples and international  organizations who raise their voices and say that America,  Britain, and France are states that are transgressors and  aggressors and have no right in anything they do against the  Libyan people. The Libyan people are innocent people who have  been wronged, and consequently, they deserve that all strugglers  and honorable people stand by them. This is the reason of their  presence with us today. [passage omitted]    France rejects the Security Council, the so-called Security  Council, resolution. It refuses to resolve its problem with  Libya. It refused to solve the problem although the Security  Council calls on Libya to respond to investigations by France.  Libya responded but France refused to cooperate with Libya to  resolve its problem concerning the French UTA plane.    This is a clear violation by France of the Security Council  resolution. The Security Council should hold a session and try  France, which violated that resolution and refused to implement  it. Sanctions should be imposed on it according to Article 7,  since we are talking now about Article 7. It is false.    This festival is taking place in conjunction with an  international power to support the Libyan people's rights and to  demonstrate clear international condemnation of the aggressive  policies of Western states. It is taking place in the shadow of  a type of mourning, sorrow, and pain that is cast over Tripoli,  Benghazi, and Libya as a whole. Tens of families lost their  children, on a day corresponding to today in 1986, when America  and Britain violated UN resolutions prohibiting the use of force  or threats for the use of force in international relations after  World War II.    They perpetrated unjustifiable barbaric aggression and a  blatant violation of Article 7. This article should have been  implemented on America and Britain. The UN Security Council  could not implement this as long as the assaulting countries are  the ones that can veto the Security Council resolutions.  Therefore, what kind of a Security Council we are relying on?    Brothers, from the legal aspect, this meeting is that of  defiance. This is a nice thing and a law on facing force. We  see it only as a meeting of defiance of a people, of an  important part of a people who are exposed to injustice,  attacks, and hostility. [passage omitted]    After Western capitalist imperialism becomes a tyrant and  wants to impose the impossible on the world, confrontation is no  longer between money and law, but between money and blood. It  said it was inevitable that blood replaced law. Exactly the  amount of blood offered by peoples in their struggle in  defending their dignity, humanity, and their right to life and  existence becomes the deterrent law. There is no hope at all in  this respect to resort to the UN charter. The UN charter has  been destroyed. The 1986 raid on Tripoli burnt the UN charter.  They had lied to us. America, France, and Britain had lied to  us, and also the Soviet Union in the Stalin era. They had lied  to us and said the United Nations is good news to the peoples of  the world. [passage omitted]    They told us that this is the United Nations Organization,  come and join us. So, we the poor and good people came. Then,  we found that this organization was a sword brandished over our  necks and that nations are not equal. [passage omitted]    Brothers, who would now dare to say that we are deceived and  let's get out of the United Nations? We say it now. We  (?explain) getting out of the United Nations because it has  proved to be a lie. In the name of the United Nations,  thousands of Iraq's children are dying.    Children of Iraq were burnt (?in the occupation of Kuwait).  Do Iraqi children still occupying Kuwait deserve to die by the  thousands in the name of the United Nations? (?We) have left  Kuwait and all of us said it was unjust and an invasion, and we  were against all the things Iraq's ruler did in Kuwait. All was  condemned.    We are facing, without Kuwait, the same fate of Iraq. Did we  occupy Iraq? We are facing the same tragedy. Did Korea occupy  Kuwait? Is North Korea the only state on the earth that reached  nuclear energy and thus makes them attack it, threaten it, and  bomb it? It is the last state to reach nuclear energy, if it  has reached it, that is.    What is this abuse, law, and ethics. There is no such thing.  When the Soviet deterrent came to an end, the Western states  appeared in their true colors without any fear or shame and  appeared barbaric and savage.    When Khrushchev and Brezhnev were present, the Western  states  had ethics, and they respected international law within the UN  framework because they were afraid of the missiles of Khrushchev  and Brezhnev. Since the deaths of Khrushchev and Brezhnev and  the demise of the Soviet Union, America, Britain, and France  have no more ethics, human rights, or humaneness. [passage  omitted]    Can they answer why they killed dozens of children of Libya  (?in a day like this one)? Who can even interview them? Let us  go and submit it to the United Nations and inform Libya's  delegate at the United Nations tomorrow to submit, on the  occasion of this sinister anniversary, the following question:  Why did America and Britain kill dozens of children while they  were asleep?    When they submit it to the UN Security Council tomorrow,  America, and Britain will put their conditions because they have  the right of veto. How can we be reassured about the UN and the  UN Security Council? What is this Security Council?    [Passage omitted] If there was a law, my brothers, do you  think it would have been possible for America, Britain, and  France, the plaintiffs, to vote in the Security Council? Never.  In the Lockerbie case, they do not legally have the right to  participate in the vote because they are the plaintiffs. They  are not neutral towards Libya. [passage indistinct] If they  vote, and they are the plaintiffs and have the right of veto,  what is the meaning of the Security Council, what is its set-up  and decisions that [words indistinct] Arabs adhere to. We, the  Libyan people, condemn Arab governments that adhere to that  resolution. The sanctions against Libya are Arab.    Why don't they say that this is rubbish, this aggression.  These are controlled [qararat manzura] resolutions that cannot  be recognized, or they can at least be tolerated for some years  after which Arabs should say enough. We should defy the  deformities [a'hat]. Next to us are Tunisia, Algeria, Sudan,  and Egypt. Let them bring their planes to us and Libyan planes  go there. The sanctions will end, Jordan, Syria, Saudi Arabia,  too.    Saudi Arabia is preventing the pilgrims. Mecca has become  part of the sanctions. The house of God has become part of the  sanctions. [passage indistinct] Is it possible for the house of  God to become part of the sanctions? If a Libyan plane should  take off with pilgrims, Saudi Arabia should say that it was a  plane carrying pilgrims and allow it to land. But if it was for  trade, tourism purposes, or carrying other passengers, I would  abide by the sanctions. Saudi Arabia has the right to adhere to  America's Security Council resolutions.    Pilgrims cannot land in Riyadh or even in Jeddah. We can  [words indistinct] in Medina and then have to go by foot to  Mecca. They are pilgrims, but Saudis say no, Mecca is part of  the sanctions. Didn't you bring American troops -- who did not  have any control on Mecca and Medina -- on to the peninsula.  Here you are, [word indistinct]. The American resolution has  proved that it has control over Mecca and Medina. These are  facts.    But we cannot blame our brothers in Saudi Arabia for not  defying Security Council sanctions. They may be wishing to be  with us, and indeed we and them talk to each. We talk about  American injustice, American tyranny, American contempt to the  Arabs and all the peoples that want to liberate themselves. The  poor, they cannot. Saudi Arabia does not dare defy America.  Impossible. It is its destiny. Americans change governments,  borders; they change, they assassinate, they unleash the CIA in  the world to destroy at will. People raise a hue, a cry over the  KGB and remain silent over the CIA. What is the difference  between this and that, they are all evil. There is a law,  gentlemen. America and Britain should not vote at the Security  Council in this precise case [Lockerbie]. Besides, there is also  this contempt for the world. Is not there justice in the world  except in America and Britain? We said to them: try them in  Malta, they say no; we say in Egypt, they say no; in France, no;  in Holland, no. Justice in America and Britain only? This means  that all other countries have no justice, and there is justice  only in America and Britain. This is another contempt to all  peoples. This is not permissible. From the legal point of view  the two suspects cannot be tried in America and Britain. Why?  Because over there they already guilty. When they speak now  they do not say: the suspects, they say: those who have blown up  the Pan Am and UTA planes. If they already say guilty then the  case is no longer a case of accusation. They say: Libya  committed the Lockerbie operation. Therefore that is it: the  punishment of Libya, all these resolutions put an end to the  case. They put an end to the case because they constitute  punishment.    Look, as far as international law is concerned, the air  embargo, the blockade, and so on, including the losses incurred  by Libya because of the Lockerbie affair, are tantamount to  punishment. Normally when this punishment is over, the  Lockerbie affair ends automatically. Some say Libya carried out  Lockerbie and it has been punished for it. That's it then. The  matter should have stopped there. You said Libya carried out  the Lockerbie operation and you punished her for it. Fine then.  You thought Libya carried out the operation and that Libya was  guilty. If a person commits a crime and pays the price for it,  well that's it; he has paid the price. If you tell someone: You  have committed a crime and its punishment will be 10 years  imprisonment; and if you jail that person for 10 years, he must  be released at the end of that period. You cannot detain him  again by telling him: No, we cannot release you because you  committed that crime in the past. But if you committed it and  served 10 years in jail for it, why should you be detained any  longer? That should be it.    Let us suppose Libya carried out Lockerbie. Well, they have  already made her pay for it. The matter is over and there  should be no further legal prosecution. If we need to use  international law as an argument, then this is one of the  arguments we are presenting to the world. We have paid the  price and that's it; so don't talk about Lockerbie anymore and  close the file.    If there is a law, how come they forget the Montreal  agreement? How can they make light of the Montreal agreement?  The Montreal agreement allows Libya to try the suspects on  Libyan soil. The agreement is clear.    The Scottish prosecutor, the Scottish prosecutor general,  says hand them to a court in Scotland because courts in Scotland  are just and neutral. This prosecutor a month ago made a  statement swearing at Libya as if he was a diplomat or a lowly  journalist. Is it conceivable that this prosecutor general who  should be making legal statements is so filled with anti-Semitic  racist hatred? Semitism means Arabs. It should not be  interpreted the way Israelis do. We are Semites. [passage  omitted]    The Scottish prosecutor says Libya is a liar and has no  credibility or integrity. How could a suspect or the accused go  to his court when the Scottish prosecutor general makes these  statements? What would the judge be like when the prosecutor  behaves in such a way? [passage omitted]    He has said that the so-called Libyan parliament had  rejected  their trial in [word indistinct] and left it to public opinion.  This a tendentious political action against Libya. He  overstepped his position as a prosecutor general.    Who is trying to gain time? Is it the accused who has been  condemned politically and by the media before a trial and eager  to be tried to prove his innocence before the world, or is it  the person who has falsified the facts, doctored charge sheets?  Maybe the falsification was carried out with the full knowledge  of the prosecution itself.    If there was a law, this case would not have been referred  to  the Security Council, just like a civil case, an ordinary crime.  How was it referred to the Security Council? They have a  political objective. This should not at all have been referred  to the Security Council. When they spoke about referring it to  the Security Council, all law experts, and you among them, said  this was not possible. This is an ordinary crime, not a case to  be referred to the Security Council. It is not a dispute  between two states and should not have been referred to the  Security Council. [passage omitted]    Brothers, they have no scruples. This is not possible. They  are hunting a small people, the Libyan people, who have been  living under threats and infringement for so many years because  it wants to live free.    UN Security Council members think they could remain their  slaves for ever. Could they protect the Israelis in the occupied  territories? They could not. They could not because there is a  people there that is struggling. There is an ordinary  individual who is no governor or king, he has no power or  medals, he is not prominent, an individual who is barefoot and  has no identity who could carry out a suicide attack and kill  whomever he likes among the enemies. When we told them that the  Gaza-Jericho agreement was meaningless, they said: You are  against peace. I replied I was for real peace and told them  that they were the ones who were falsifying the truth and lying  to the Jews and the Palestinians, because Jews are at risk  because of this agreement.    It showed that 'Arafat is not all of the Palestinian  fighters; he is only the head of a single organization called  Fatah and not of the Palestine Liberation Organization. 'Arafat  is not a fighter. The solution is down to the fighters who have  destroyed this agreement and showed that it was... [pauses].  The Palestinian people have now started to fight. They have  said: To hell with the Gaza and Jericho agreement. A new power  has emerged over which Yasir 'Arafat has no control. From the  beginning, on the first day the Gaza-Jericho agreement was  signed, I made a statement and said I would deceive neither the  Jews nor the Palestinians and that the agreement was a big lie  because Yasir 'Arafat does not represent all the Palestinians  and because there is a power fighting in the arena now and it is  the one to hold negotiations with if there are to be any  negotiations. I said negotiations should be held with the  Palestinian people and all of the Palestinian people have to  return to their land. They said no, we want Fatah.    There you are, that is what you got from Fatah. There even  was a split within Fatah itself. Fatah hawks are now being  killed by the Israelis and they are killing the Israelis [words  indistinct]. Fatah are 'Arafat's followers, and they have  revolted against him. He has even deceived the Jews. Why do  [word indistinct] tell the Jews this is peace? This is  swindling. By the way, they all hate the Jews, they all are  Hitlers, all of them, from the United States to Russia. They  all wish the Jews to be eradicated, and they tell us that those  Jews are an evil that has to be eradicated; they hate them more  than we do. We eventually say we and the Jews are both Semite  and cousins, but they say that those ones are Semite and they  have destroyed the world. This is what the French, English, and  U.S. officials are saying; it is written in their agendas.  [passage omitted]    How do they give a machine gun to a doctor? Why did not the  Security Council convene to say that Israel is a terrorist  state? Why does the United States support terrorism? The United  States gives billions of weapons to so-called Israel, and  so-called Israel armed the doctor who perpetrated the massacre  at the al-Ibrahimi mosque. How do they give a machine gun to a  doctor? If an Arab country had armed a doctor and he was  witnessed fighting, they would have immediately put it in the  blacklist, declared it as a terrorist state, and put it under  siege, ban exports to it, humiliate and wipe it out. Why? They  would say because it had armed the doctor. [passage omitted]    How come the government gave him a machine gun? Before the  massacre, many days before, in front of the government, the  army, the Israeli officials, he used to go out and address  people and incite them. Are America, Britain, and France  civilized states? America, of course, does not pretent to be  civilized. It says we are [word indistinct], cowboys, and  criminals. They say all criminals are there and they had formed  America. America itself does not at all claim to be a civilized  state, and no one can confer on it such a certificate, but are  Britain and France civilized states? If Britain is civilized  and if France is civilized, then to hell with civilization.  This is not civilization. These are biased, very biased  nations. [passage omitted]    We defy the Americans to come and negotiate with Libya, and  we will not negotiate secretely with them. We are not a gang.  States negotiate openly. We challenge them to negotiate openly  with Libya. Even if they want to negotiate, they would say let  us negotiate secretly. We are not a gang to negotiate secretly.  If you are a gang, we are not a gang. It is the Israeli and  Palestinian gangs that go to Norway or Denmark or I do not know  where, in Oslo, to negotiate secretly. They are right, they are  gangs: the Zionist Hagana or I do not know what gangs and the  Palestinian armed gangs. All gangs, and they have the right to  negotiate secretly. They are all gangs struggling for  Palestine. But we, independent states and members of the United  Nations who do not negotiate secretly.    What right has America to supply the Israelis with weapons?  Against who? They say: it is to strike the Arab Maghreb, the  Gulf, Sudan. They said to the Israelis: We have now done away  with the ring countries, and now we give you weapons. Yesterday  we saw a report on 25 aircraft whose range attains the Arab  Maghreb, Sudan, Yemen, the Arab Peninsula. [passage omitted]    The so-called Israel has admitted to possessing nuclear  weapons, why then don't they treat it like Korea? Like the  Rabta? This is not possible. The so-called Israel is exempt of  article 7. No matter what crimes it may commit, which fall 100  percent under article 7, America cannot permit that article 7 is  applied to Israel. Therefore, the charter of the UN is  finished. [passage omitted]    Therefore, it is not a case of justice or injustice and  legality or illegality. The UN Security Council member states  have told us that the United States had threatened and told them  to vote against Libya otherwise they would suspend economic aid  to them; vote against Libya to get economic aid. It is like a  judge going to witnesses and members of a court and threatening  them, ordering them to pass unjust sentences or else. [passage  omitted]    You hear statements made by the United States, Britain, and  France; they say that Libya is against the international  community. You three are against the international community and  swimming against the current. You have been afflicted by  conceit. However, this conceit will shatter on the rock of  peoples' resistance and the Libyan people's [word indistinct].  This arrogance and superciliousness will escalate the  resistance. This arrogance and audacity will inevitably  shatter. We enter the battle with resilience, good patience,  and unique courage. Let the battle between us and them continue  until doomsday. They are the ones who are seeking quick profits  and [word indistinct] without loss. They will lose in this  battle. We are fighting on our land, while they are fighting  outside their borders; in the seas, oceans, and continents.  They are opening fronts to terrify the whole world.    As a matter of fact, this gathering of Libyan men of law,  supported and backed by honorable men outside Libya in the Arab  homeland and the world, is an extremely important message  directed to America, France, and Britain precisely, the arrogant  and leagued states that have trampled under foot international  law, the sovereignty of peoples, the UN charter and conventions,  which do not permit comparison between what is done against the  Israelis and against the Arab countries. Double standards.  This is an extremely important message if they respect world  public opinion. But it should be made clear that it is they who  are isolated. Setting aside the [word indistinct] between Libya  and America, Britain and France, all the world stands on the  side of Libya.    In reality they have served the Libyan people because the  Libyan people were going along on their way, not paying  attention. They have awakened you and told you that they wanted  to harm you a second, third, and tenth time. They told you  their ambitions have been continuous since Caesar's time, since  the first century AD until today. They have warned you. In  fact we thank them for warning the Libyan people, who were not  vigilant. We have felt that their rifles were directed at the  chest of each one of us. On a night like this, innocent young  people were killed. Who blew up the the Berlin night club? In  the end, it became clear that Libya had nothing to do with the  Berlin nighclub. What should we do then about the dozens of  young people who died that night? Does this mean that this is  going to be repeated? Every Libyan is feeling that his child  might be killed, that he might be killed, that his home might  collapse on him at any time. He knows there is no Security  Council any more, no United Nations or international law; there  is a jungle. [passage omitted] We are resisting. Thank you.  The struggle continues.</p>

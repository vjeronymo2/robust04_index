Inc. seek damages from the three Nakash brothers, founders of Jordache  Enterprises Ltd. In an earlier trial, a jury found the Marcianos and Guess were  defrauded in a 1983 partnership agreement signed with the Nakashes. This jury  will determine if damages are owed to the Marcianos. The Nakashes charge that  the Marcianos filed the suit out of their own "seller's remorse." (Filed Nov.  29, 1984; Case No. C524347)  </P></p>

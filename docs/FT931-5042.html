			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Monday Interview: No time like the present - Edzard Reuter, chairman of Daimler-Benz, talks to Christopher Parkes Edzard Reuter, chairman of Daimler-Benz, has been preaching revolution for years. Now he has decided that the time and the conditions are right for action. Off his soapbox and up in arms, he has set about transforming the strategy and culture of Germany's biggest industrial group. 'We now have the impression that the time has come when we can really implement radical changes of a dimension and kind we had perceived as necessary earlier,' he says. Appropriately enough, his more public actions have been focused on the elite Mercedes-Benz car division. This is to expand 'horizontally' in its upmarket niche, he says. The traditional range will be extended with a leisure vehicle, a people carrier, and a new compact car below the current entry-level 190 series, and embellished with more coupe versions of the existing models. If not quite revolutionary, he insists that the switch is nonetheless a 'very courageous adaptation' which should not be seen as an attempt to clash head-on with typical full-range manufacturers. 'We would never try to get our fingers into the mass production business,' he promises. In one sense, Mercedes will remain as it was: 'A car producer in the upper market bracket, aiming at well-to-do customers, producing the highest-quality cars at the highest technical level - but at a price affordable to the necessary number of people.' As a result, unit output will increase 'quite visibly'. Strategy has changed because markets and the world have changed, he says. 'Competition in our traditional market segment has increased dramatically. We have to face worldwide competition from people working on different cost assumptions and in different situations.' These are the factors steering the group's change of direction and which have obliged Mercedes in the first instance to reject the ancient dogma which insisted that its cars must always bear the 'Made in Germany' label. 'These additional vehicles probably have important markets outside Germany or even outside Europe. This means that for exchange rate reasons alone we needed to consider producing abroad,' he says. Accordingly, there is a fair chance that a decision will be made later this year to build leisure vehicles in the US, Reuter adds. Meanwhile, small-scale car assembly is just starting up in Mexico. A joint venture with Ssangyong in Korea could also extend the brand's reach into new markets. People carriers, compact cars and installing capacity close to markets are hardly new concepts, and Reuter admits Mercedes has been late to move because it was hobbled by dogma. But that was only part of the problem, and rejection of fixed ideas is only part of Reuter's response. Throughout the group he has implemented measures to slice through the bulky bureaucracy built up since the second world war, and decentralise the entire business. 'We want to give more responsibility to more people and ask them to participate in the success of the company themselves,' he says. Such moves lie at the heart of the revolution which has been waiting until now to happen. Again, they are hardly new, but Reuter's ability to introduce them has been hampered in the past by the difficulties of pinpointing the moment when there was the best chance of achieving the necessary company-wide consensus - one element in German management practice which remains inviolable. 'Lean management used in this context is only a very rough description of what is going on - what we are aiming at is a change of behaviour,' he says. Postwar German attitudes to work and responsibility have been conditioned by continuous economic growth, occasionally interrupted by very short periods of slowdown, he notes. 'At the same time, there has been a steady increase in well-being. That apparently has come to an end for the time being.' The arrival of recession, heralded by the group's announcement last year of the loss of almost 40,000 jobs, has fulfilled one of the conditions necessary for Daimler's domestic revolution - and possibly for sweeping changes in attitudes throughout the rest of German industry and society. The slump's coincidence with growing awareness of the international competitive threat to Germany, plus the harsh economic realities of unification have 'added to the general feeling that things have to change', he says. Now that his strategy is clearly defined, he is talking again, taking his soapbox to every level of the company, 'talking to hundreds of people, for hours and hours . . . talking and taking decisions. But decisions alone are not enough,' he admits. 'People must understand the necessity to change their behaviour. I may be over-optimistic, but I think this company is on its way.' Other companies are moving, too. By the end of 1994, he says, the German motor industry will employ 300,000 fewer workers. He insists that rationalisation has to be accepted in Germany as a 'normal development', but he refuses to speculate on the political implications of rising unemployment. 'All I can say is we need an economic policy aimed at growth.' He seems to despair of such action from Bonn where he sees 'a vacuum caused by the sudden impact of unification and the drama of the economic collapse'. Government failure to develop convincing measures has led to politicians losing all credibility, he says. Instead, he turns hopefully to Europe. 'Look at France. The economic, political and unemployment situation is at least as tense as in Germany. Look at Italy, not to mention the UK.' No individual government has been able to find answers. Protectionism is out of the question and any government trying to buy its way out of trouble by spending huge amounts of public money risks ruining its country. 'There is no alternative. The answer must be that we press on to economic and monetary unification. But the Community must also talk seriously about an industrial policy. The root of our problems lies in the lack of convincing European solutions,' he says. Reuter dislikes the dirigiste ring of the term 'industrial policy'. But, he insists, 'one will never be able to find a perfect way of running a free market without any kind of framework'. Indispensable elements would include common income and value-added tax systems, a regional policy to iron out structural economic distortions such as imbalances in employment patterns, and a joint, measured approach to research and development. 'I am talking about a market economy governed by a pragmatic, professional approach . . . We need further policy co-ordination and this can only be achieved with a common European currency,' he concludes. With his unshaken belief in the capacities of European integration and frustrated by the lack of activity and even comprehension in Bonn, Reuter appears for the moment a lonely figure. But on the basis of the popular belief that what is good for Daimler is good for Germany, and the more reassuring premise that he has the full support of Deutsche Bank (Daimler's biggest shareholder and the leading power broker across the upper reaches of German industry), he is unlikely to be short of followers for long. An admirer describes him as 'a true architect of German culture', which probably suits this modest intellectual better than the 'revolutionary' tag. But like a true revolutionary, Reuter has recognised that timing is everything. Those who get it wrong - be they in politics or business - are the ones whose heads finish up in the basket.  ------------------------------------------------------                       PERSONAL FILE  ------------------------------------------------------ 1928 Born Berlin. 1933 Moved with family to Turkey after his prominent      Social Democratic father Ernst Reuter was      persecuted by Nazis. 1946 Returned to Berlin, joined SPD. 1957 Joined Ufa film company. 1962 Joined Bertelsmann. 1964 Joined Daimler-Benz. 1976 Daimler board member. 1987 Daimler-Benz chairman.  ------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Observer: Protective practitioners First the good news. The future of world trade is largely in the hands of two men of identical age and ethnic and professional background. Sir Leon Brittan, the EC trade commissioner, and Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, are both 53-year-old lawyers of Lithuanian Jewish origin. The bad news is that since their ancestors emigrated from Lithuania, much has happened to transform the pair into very different people: one a baseball-loving social campaigner on the left of the Clinton administration; the other a one-time acolyte of Margaret Thatcher with a taste for bracing country walks. Quizzed on their roots after yesterday's tense Brussels trade talks, Sir Leon was cautious about the similarities. 'I don't know how much (of the Lithuanian background) has rubbed off on the way, via Tennessee and north London,' he said. Certainly Kantor has acquired, via Tennessee, a mischievous sense of humour. Asked whether he considered Kantor to be a protectionist, Sir Leon replied diplomatically that the US trade representative was obviously 'extremely good at protecting US interests and I hope I'm equally good at protecting Community interests'. Sitting next to Sir Leon, Kantor obviously decided the time had come to respond to the commissioner's widely reported comments on his US counterpart. 'Well, at least he hasn't called me a 'unilateral bully' or a 'bureaucratic thug' this time,' he smiled, to Sir Leon's obvious discomfort.</p>

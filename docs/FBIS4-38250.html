			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim by </F> Claude Lorieux at the Yemeni Embassy in Paris; date not given:  "`Aden Would Capitulate Without Foreign Aid'" -- all place  names as published]    [Text] "The Aden rebels would not last a day if they  stopped using innocent people as human shields and if foreign  aid in the form of arms and money dried up," Foreign Minister  Muhammad Salim Basindwah of the Republic of Yemen (capital:  Sanaa) told LE FIGARO.    On a visit to Paris, where he was supposed to meet with  Foreign Minister Alain Juppe yesterday, the Yemeni foreign  minister made the following accusation: "The rebels are kept  alive like a dying man on a life support system. The aid  arrives in large quantities from Ukraine and other eastern  European countries. The arms come from the black market. The  Aden separatists do not buy them directly. Other people do it  for them. I will not say who. I do not want to fall out with  my neighbors. After flying over the province of al-Mahrah  (which borders Oman and Saudi Arabia), the airplanes unload  their hardware in Rayyan, near Mukalla (the eastern province of  Hadramaout). Boats transport the arms and ammunition to Aden."    Although he has spent "half his life in South Yemen and the  other half in North Yemen," Mr. Basindwah says he is "more  attached to North Yemen," where he was often a minister before  1990, the year of unification. Loyal to the unitary line of  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, the minister gets irritated when  mention is made of the establishment of a "democratic Yemen"  (capital: Aden). "I would prefer," he said, "to dig my grave  with my own hands."    He jumps up when asked if the embassy in Paris, where he met  with LE FIGARO, is the embassy of North Yemen or South Yemen,  which are once again separated: "It is the embassy of the  Republic of Yemen. There is only one state in Yemen, the other  one (the Aden one) is illegal, and no capital has recognized it.  Yemen was unified by referendum and elected a government in  1993."    The minister, who visited London, the Hague, Bonn, and  Copenhagen, and who is leaving Paris today for Moscow, stressed  that the ministers with whom he met were generally "in favor of  unity and democracy in Yemen."    Could one of the causes of the south's insurrection be the  muscular conception which (northern) President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih has of democracy? "President Salih's party won the  elections held in April 1993," retorted Mr. Basindwah.  "Nevertheless, we insisted that the country be run by a  coalition government. We chose this formula so that the country  could get used to democracy. We need time. Do not forget that  we live in a region where democracy is not liked."    No matter how much the envoy from Sanaa emphasizes that the  current crisis "is not a fight between North and South, but  between the majority of Yemenis and the renegades," the  survivors will have a lot of trouble picking up the pieces of  the shattered unity. The authorities have solutions to propose:  "Each government (province) could benefit from very broad  autonomy, while naturally ruling out functions such as defense  and diplomacy."  <H5>  `KGB and Stasi' </H5>   This kind of development would apply both to the 12  governorships of the North and the six governorships of the  South. President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih is in effect rejecting  any compromise which would give the South different treatment  than the North. This means there is no question of a  federation. "This kind of solution can be applied to different  peoples in a single state, but not to Yemenis. We are a single  people in terms of race, religion, and language," Mr. Basindwah  stressed.    The conciliatory -- to say the least -- attitude of the  monarchies in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) toward the  separatist regime in Aden clearly embarrasses Sanaa, which was  formerly the capital of a conservative North Yemen pampered by  Saudi Arabia. The minister explained his discretion in this  matter: "My role is to heal the wounds, not make them worse."  He did acknowledge, however, that "some of our neighbors would  like Yemen to explode. They do not want a strong, unified  Yemen." This is an example of a "short-term vision, because a  strong, unified Yemen would bring greater peace and stability to  the region."    "The oil wealth of the southern part of Yemen could be one  reason for the crisis," the Sanaa foreign minister felt. "I  think that certain leaders in the Yemeni Socialist Party  (comprised primarily of southerners) were unable to resist the  temptations, and that they received money from everywhere. It  must not be forgotten that some were paid by the KBG and the  Stasi."    Weakening -- not to mention crushing -- the South is likely  to strengthen conservatism in the North, which is more tribal  and more religious. Mr. Basindwah admits that "the existence  of the Yemeni Socialist Party helped to maintain a balance  between secular and traditionalist groups," before adding that  "Muslim fundamentalism has not gained a lot of ground among the  Yemeni people."</p>

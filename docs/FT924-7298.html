			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / International Company News: Telebras profits reach Dollars 447m TELEBRAS, Brazil's state-owned telecommunications holding company, turned in profits of Dollars 447m for the first nine months of this year. The results partly reflect attempts to recover a drop in real rates suffered between March 1990 and September 1991. During the first six months of the year, average real rates were 5.3 per cent higher than in 1991. In 1991, the company posted a year-end profit of Dollars 106m. By August, however, real rates were still about half of their level in March 1990. There are indications from acting president Mr Itamar Franco that rate increases may not continue to outpace inflation. This, together with uncertainty over Mr Franco's attitude towards privatisation of the company, appear to be responsible for the fall in Telebras shares of American Depository Receipts (ADRs) in the over-the-counter market. Last Friday, a lot of 1,000 shares closed at Dollars 12 - 31.4 per cent lower than the opening price of Dollars 17.50 on October 23. On paper, nothing has changed with respect to the sale of Telebras and its 28 operating companies. Privatisation can only take place after an amendment to the 1988 constitution, which would reverse a monopoly in telecommunications for the state. However, while Mr Fernando Collor de Mello, the president now suspended to face impeachment charges, was expected to push for privatisation, Mr Franco has not displayed a similar commitment.</p>

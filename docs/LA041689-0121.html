			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> YANKEES' DAVE RIGHETTI IS ON TRIAL ONCE AGAIN  </P> <P> Dave Righetti's life has become a series of intertwining, frustrating Catch-22  situations.  </P> <P> Righetti was limited to seven innings of work in spring training because the  New York Yankees wanted to make sure his arm was healthy for the start of the  season.  </P> <P> Now, Righetti says, his arm feels fine but his strength is not what it should  be. The result: three rough outings, a 21.00 ERA and a new spate of questions  concerning his arm.  </P> <P> Righetti says all he needs is to pitch a lot to pitch better. But because he's  pitching poorly, the Yankees are turning to others.  </P> <P> Righetti, who will never be confused with a defiant, shuck-off-failure stopper,  needs to work in a peaceful vacuum to rediscover the magic that made him the  game's most dominant reliever three years ago.  </P> <P> Instead, he works in situations where every minute detail of his struggles  and-or successes is intensely scrutinized.  </P> <P> A perfectionist, Righetti is the reliever former Yankees coach Mark Connor once  said took defeat harder than any pitcher he'd ever seen. And undoubtedly,  Righetti's entry into 1989 is killing the left-hander.  </P> <P> "Over the winter, you hope it (the negatives) all gets cleansed out," Righetti  said. "But all it takes is one bad game to bring it back."  </P> <P> Tuesday he wore the excruciating pain on his face. That was the night Righetti  was brought into a 6-6 game against the Toronto Blue Jays in the 10th inning  moments after a two-run rally by the Yankees had forced extra innings.  </P> <P> Righetti struck out the side. He also allowed hits to the first four Blue Jays  he faced, a brutal lead-in to what became a five-run, six-hit inning and an  11-6 Jays' victory that also was the Yankees' seventh straight loss.  </P> <P> Jesse Barfield, one of Righetti's strikeout victims, wondered aloud why the  pitcher would throw an 0-and-2 changeup. That's baseball parlance for saying  something's not right with a hard-throwing pitcher.  </P> <P> Up in one of the Yankees' many television booths, 300-game  winner-turned-commentator Tom Seaver also said Righetti didn't look like the  pitcher who has saved 162 games for the Yankees since 1984. Seaver said  Righetti looked like a guy with some arm troubles.  </P> <P> "I tend to agree with Tom," said another former pitcher, Yankees Manager Dallas  Green. But, Green said, he and Righetti have this deal, one struck in spring  training: If Righetti is hurt, he has vowed to tell Green.  </P> <P> "I don't think Dave's protecting anything," Green said. "I hope he's not. If  his arm hurts, he's got to tell us. I haven't been led in any direction other  than he's fine."  </P> <P> Righetti insists he's fine. Even after Tuesday's bashing, in which Righetti's  pitches just seemed to hang enticingly in the Jays' pull zone rather than  explode on by. He admits that in the past, the sore shoulder has led to a  tender elbow. "Then, I was trying to protect the shoulder," he said. "But I'm  healthy now."  </P> <P> Righetti did not resent Seaver's comments. He said it was a compliment that  such a pitcher expected better of him. "But that's the problem," Righetti said.  "Just because you get your butt kicked doesn't mean anything's wrong.  </P> <P> "I felt good. I have no excuses."  </P> <P> For Righetti, that refrain is becoming familiar. It's one he's had to turn to  with alarming frequency the last two seasons.  </P> <P> Righetti blew nine saves in 1988, 13 the year before and 10 in 1986, when he  saved a record 46 games. Righetti saved only 25 games in 1988. He also lost  four games. The league hit .257 against Righetti in 1988, down slightly from  the .262 of 1987, but still drastically worse than the .226 in Righetti's  record-setting season of 1986.  </P> <P> The falloff increases the doubts with every poor outing. That, in itself, takes  a toll. Righetti admits he's trying to find the middle ground emotionally,  trying to find the groove physically to end the constant reassessment of his  abilities.  </P> <P> So, three games into the 1989 season, Righetti is in that white hot spotlight  again: his fans, his team, wondering what's wrong with him.  </P> <P> Wednesday, Green needed a stopper, but he could not turn to Righetti, who had  faced 10 batters Tuesday. Instead, Green used Lee Guetterman, who saved the 5-3  victory over the Blue Jays.  </P> <P> Even if Righetti were rested, the save situation might not have been his. Green  says he might temporarily move the pitcher to middle innings. There's more work  to be found there. Less pressure, too.  </P> <P> So Righetti must wait and wonder if and when prime time will be his time again.  And he must wait to see if the Yankees believe him when he says he's only  rusty. Green does right now. But Green also knows Righetti has been known to  suffer pain in silence rather than offer excuses.  </P> <P> "We've talked about that," Green said. "That's something Dave would have to  live with. I've told him how I feel. That's all I can do."  </P></p>

			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Hungarian-American fund chief resigns THE HEAD of the Hungarian-American Enterprise Fund has resigned in the face of severe criticism from the US Congress of the way it invested US government money, reports George Graham in Washington. Mr Alexander Tomlinson, the fund's president and chief executive officer, said its operations had been paralysed by the controversy. He complained of political interference from Congress. In Washington, government officials said they were pleased that Mr Tomlinson had decided to resign before he was fired. The enterprise fund, like similar institutions operating in other eastern European countries, was set up as a private, non-profit organisation with Dollars 60m of US government money so as to foster private sector investment in Hungary. The fund, however, has repeatedly stumbled. It was criticised for backing businesses run by former communists and, this year, came under attack for paying a large part of the salary of Mr Pal Teleki, chairman of Hungary's state holding company AV RT. Its most contested decision, however, was a Dollars 4m investment in EurAmerica Capital, a merchant bank started 14 months ago in Budapest. Eur-America paid salaries of up to Dollars 400,000 a year to its founders, incurring the wrath of Mr David Obey, who chairs the House of Representatives sub-committee which controls foreign aid spending. Mr Tomlinson, in his letter of resignation, said that Eur-America was now operating at a profit.</p>

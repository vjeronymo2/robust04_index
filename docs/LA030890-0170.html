			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLISEUM OFFERS PRIVATE FUNDS TO DAVIS;  </P> <P> RAIDERS: PROPOSAL IS MADE AS A NEW STUMBLING BLOCK ARISES IN PLAN TO RETURN  TEAM TO OAKLAND. ALAMEDA COUNTY WANTS DAVIS TO SPEND SOME OF HIS OWN MONEY ON  STADIUM.  </P> <P> As a new impediment arose in a proposal to return the Los Angeles Raiders to  Oakland, the private managers of the Los Angeles Coliseum met Wednesday with  team owner Al Davis to offer him an advance payment of private money if he  stays in Los Angeles while the Coliseum is renovated.  </P> <P> Those close to the negotiations said Davis has asked for $15 million in  staggered payments before and during work on the Coliseum, in exchange for his  agreement to hold off on any move elsewhere and wait to see if the Los Angeles  entrepreneurs can perform on their promises.  </P> <P> They said Ed Snider, head of Spectacor Management Group, was meeting with Davis  on Wednesday evening to make the offer of private money. The specific amount of  Snider's offer was not revealed.  </P> <P> Earlier, Los Angeles Coliseum Commission President Matthew Grossman said that  the commission does not expect to receive any request that it put public  Coliseum money into the Spectacor offer of advance money.  </P> <P> In 1987, the Irwindale City Council gave Davis $10 million in earnest money to  keep if Irwindale was unable later to provide full financing for a stadium for  the football team. Since then, the money has apparently been forfeited by the  inability of Irwindale to go ahead with the project.  </P> <P> Word of the new talks in Los Angeles came after disclosure that Oakland and  Alameda County negotiators are now asking Davis to put some Raider money into a  projected expansion of the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum if the costs, as now  expected, exceed the original estimate of $53.5 million.  </P> <P> The request for what could amount to several million dollars came at a meeting  between local authorities and Davis Tuesday night. The city and county, as part  of a $660-million offer to the team scheduled to be voted on by the Oakland  City Council and the Alameda County Board of Supervisors next Monday, had  agreed to put $53.5 million into the stadium expansion, but are refusing to put  up more.  </P> <P> Davis had no public reaction to the new conditions stated by Oakland  authorities after the meeting. A call to Davis on Wednesday for comment on both  the Oakland and Los Angeles developments was not returned.  </P> <P> However, a close Davis friend, Donald Sterling, the owner of the Los Angeles  Clippers basketball franchise, said in an interview that a deal between the  private Los Angeles Coliseum managers and the Raiders "could be close" to  fruition. "I think it would be in L.A.'s best interest," he said. "It would  take seven or eight years at least, I think, to secure another pro football  franchise if the Raiders left."  </P> <P> The Coliseum Commission, meeting Wednesday, voted unanimously to issue  specifications for an environmental impact report on Coliseum work in Los  Angeles and seek a firm to prepare it. Such a report would be necessary before  any reconstruction or renovation could proceed.  </P></p>

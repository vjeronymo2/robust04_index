			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By XINHUA reporter Zhu Yuquan (2612 3768 3123) and TIANJIN </F> RIBAO reporter Wang Hong (3769 1347)]    [Text] Tianjin, 19 May (XINHUA) -- While inspecting work  in Tianjin, Qiao Shi, member of the Standing Committee of the  CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and chairman of the  Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, stressed  that it is necessary to take advantage of the opportunity that  the international and domestic situations are favorable to  China's modernization drive, deepen reform in a down-to-earth  way, open wider to the outside world, and promote development.    From 15 to 18 May, Qiao Shi, accompanied by comrades Gao  Dezhan, Li Jianguo, Li Shenglin, and Nie Bichu, inspected  Tianjin Steel Tube Company, Tianjin Mini Automobile Plant,  Tianjin Forging Press Plant, Changcheng Television Company  Limited, Honda Motorcycle Company Limited, and Xiaonanhe Duck  Farm in Xiqing District. He also visited the Tianjin  Broadcasting and Television Tower. While in Tianjin, Qiao Shi  heard work reports made by the municipal party committee and  government and held a discussion meeting with the principal  leaders of the municipal people's congress standing committee.    As Tianjin is the largest open coastal city in north China,  Qiao Shi shows great concern for its reform, opening up to the  outside world, and economic development. He said: Since the  Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, Tianjin  has done a good job in making an early start in opening to the  outside world. As a result, it has achieved faster and better  results in developing its economy. So long as it advances in a  pioneering spirit, deepens reform, and opens up wider to the  outside world on the basis of its current foundation, Tianjin  will achieve better results in development and will be able to  play an important role in promoting opening up and economic  development in China's northern region.    Expressing concern for the implementation of reform  measures,  he said: The current international situation is developing in a  direction favorable to China's development. Domestically, China  enjoys social stability and the economy is growing in a  sustained way. The general situation is good. We must seize  this rare historical opportunity and deepen reform in a  down-to-earth way. Since the fourth quarter of last year, big  strides in reform have been taken with the introduction of more  reform measures. This is absolutely necessary, and the  direction is correct. Practice has proved that the results are  good. Regarding the implementation of these reform measures, we  still have a lot of practical work to do. With regard to the  specific problems encountered in the course of deepening reform,  we should, after investigations and studies, solve them one by  one according to the order of urgency. Only thus can we  thoroughly implement reform measures. Leaders at all levels and  cadres must understand the strategic significance of the reform  measures drawn up by the party Central Committee, and lead the  masses of people to vigorously push forward our reform cause.    As state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises account  for  a large part of Tianjin's industry, Qiao Shi seriously inquired  about their conditions. He fully affirmed the merit of the  Tianjin leadership in attaching importance to deepening the  reform of enterprises. He said: To improve state-owned large  and medium-sized enterprises, leaders must pay attention to  these enterprises, strive to solve some crucial problems for  them, guide them to compete in the market, and encourage them to  deepen reform, to enliven their operating mechanisms, and to  raise efficiency. We should encourage enterprises to study and  introduce advanced technologies and management experiences.  Through reform and studying advanced experiences, enterprises  will be able to upgrade the quality and level of their  equipment, technology, products, and management. We should  enhance the skills of workers through various forms of training.  We must strive to reduce enterprises' burden by establishing,  step by step, a social insurance system, so as to create a good  condition and environment for enterprises to develop.  State-owned large and medium-sized enterprises will show great  vitality in market competition after they truly improve their  operating mechanisms and enhance economic efficiency.    Turning to agricultural issues, Qiao Shi stressed: China is  a huge country with a large population. We must never slacken  the production of major farm products such as grain, cotton, and  oil-bearing crops. At the same time, we should also develop a  diversified economy in light of local conditions. In suburban  areas, particular attention should be given to the "vegetable  basket project." Qiao Shi said: We should regard the surplus  labor in rural areas as an important resource and make use of it  through different ways. For example, we should organize them to  build roads and water conservation facilities. He also said:  The development of village and town enterprises and the  building of small towns step by step will further change the  outlook of China's countryside. At the same time, the surplus  labor will have an important role to play in the course of  construction.    During a discussion meeting with the principal leaders of  the Tianjin Municipal People's Congress Standing Committee, Qiao  Shi said: Tianjin has done a great deal of work to improve  socialist democracy and strengthen the legal system. I hope  Tianjin will strengthen studies and do a better job in this  regard. He stressed: Strengthening democracy and the legal  system is very important to the smooth progress of modernization  and the building of socialism with Chinese characteristics.  People's congresses bear heavy responsibilities in making laws,  in exercising supervision, and in doing other fields of work.  We must work hard and strive to gradually establish a framework  for a legal system for a socialist market economy. People's  congresses at all levels should forge close ties with the  masses, expand democracy, proceed from fundamental interests of  the people and the state, conscientiously exercise their  functions, strictly observe laws, and carry out their role  fully. Qiao Shi expressed the hope that in the course of making  laws, exercising supervision, and doing other work, local  people's congresses should vigorously make explorations, sum up  new experiences, proceed from reality, and go on playing their  role and making innovations. People's congresses at all levels,  particularly grass-roots people's congresses, should make  constant efforts to strengthen themselves to meet the needs of  work.    Qiao Shi said: So long as we stick to the central task of  economic construction, adhere to the party's basic line,  earnestly grasp two links, and effectively develop the economy  to raise the people's living standards step by step, we will be  able to gradually solve the problems we are experiencing.  Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics, if we conscientiously implement  the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, we will be  able to realize the strategic objective of quadrupling our GNP  by the end of this century and to lay a sound foundation for  development in the next century.</p>

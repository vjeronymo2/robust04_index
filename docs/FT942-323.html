			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Markets Report: US dollar marks time The truce between central banks and markets held again on foreign exchanges yesterday, with the dollar trading in a fairly narrow range, writes Philip Gawith. The US currency closed firmer in London at DM1.5849, from DM1.5758 on Monday, and at Y100.210 from Y99.865. It later slipped back in New York trading, falling below Y100 and DM1.58. It ended the US session at Y99.935 and DM1.5785. Trading remained fairly quiet, with market participants seemingly unwilling to take firm positions, faced with the possibility of central bank intervention and a raft of important events next week. Although the dollar has been stable, analysts said market sentiment remained negative with the risks still on the downside. Elsewhere, sterling received an initial fillip from a bullish set of Treasury economic forecasts before slipping back in late trading. It closed at DM2.4513 from DM2.4498 and Dollars 1.5466 from Dollars 1.5547. The dollar came off its highs for the day after various economic reports caused a drop in the US Treasury bond market. The conference board reported that US consumer confidence rose to 92 in June after a revised 88.9 in May, near to a four-year high. May single family home sales climbed by 4.2 per cent, after a revised drop of 3.4 per cent in April, while import prices rose by 1.1 per cent, the biggest monthly gain since October 1990. These figures fanned fears of inflation, causing weakness in the bond market, and the dollar repeated the pattern of recent months by falling in sympathy. Prior to the economic data, dealers said the dollar had been supported by rumours of central bank intervention, which failed to materialise. Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN-AMRO in London, said it was only Bank of Japan intervention that was keeping the dollar reasonably stable against the yen. Many in the market believe that the yen will strengthen further from current levels. Swiss Bank Corporation, for example, in its latest currency comment, argues that 'speculative purchases of yen are about to rise sharply, which makes a concerted defence of the US dollar most irrational at current levels, and unlikely'. Three main factors underpin this view: uncertain Japanese politics, the low chance of progress on trade talks, and non-Japanese investors reducing their aggressive short positions in the yen. The flip side of the more stable dollar has been some evidence of unwinding of D-Mark positions. Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist at UBS in London, said there were 'signs that people were questioning the value of extending long D-Mark positions at these levels'. 'Risk-reward suggests that you ought to be looking to lock in some short D-Mark positions for the summer, especially if you expect something might come out of the G7 meeting.' The D-Mark continued to give up ground against some of the high-yielding currencies. It finished at SKr4.802 from SKr4.812 against the Swedish krona, and at Pta82.42 from Pta82.49 against the Spanish peseta. The Portuguese escudo closed unchanged at Es102.9 per D-Mark after finance minister Mr Eduardo Catroga said the currency was correctly valued at its current level. The Treasury forecast UK growth at 2.75 per cent in 1994, up from its earlier expectation of 2.5 per cent. It also forecast a 1994/5 public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 36bn, down from the Pounds 38bn previously predicted. In addition, it revised down its forecast of underlying inflation in the fourth quarter to 2.5 per cent from the 3.25 per cent prediction made last November. The impact of these forecasts on sterling was muted by the fact that they are broadly in line with the consensus. Some banks have reported recently that orders placed by UK corporates suggest expectations of a higher pound against the dollar are increasing, but this is offset by perceptions that the downside risk against the D-Mark is also rising. The markets are expecting a further small 3 to 5 basis-point cut in the German repo rate today after the Bundesbank announced another variable rate auction. One factor acting against a larger fall is the level of German call money, which rose to 5.05/5.15 per cent, from 4.90/5.00 per cent on Monday. Although the pace of easing has slowed recently, analysts believe that the strength of the D-Mark allows further room for interest rates to decline. This view is not fully discounted in the futures market with the December Euromark contract discounting short term rates of about 5.12 per cent in December, compared with 4.95 per cent currently. The broking house GNI argues that fundamentals suggest a bullish view of Euromarks, but says the bearish tone of bond markets will probably dampen any response. In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided Pounds 670m of assistance after forecasting a Pounds 650m shortage. Overnight money traded between 4 and 4 7/8 per cent.</p>

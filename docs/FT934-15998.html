			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Tiphook down 30% after warning SHARES IN Tiphook, the container leasing and transport rental group, fell nearly 30 per cent yesterday after the loss-making group warned that it would breach its banking covenants. The UK-based group, which currently has debts of Pounds 1bn and gearing of more than 470 per cent, is forbidden by articles of association from allowing gearing to exceed 500 per cent. Shareholders will be asked to approve new borrowing limits, and the company said it had begun to negotiate new facilities with its bankers. The announcement, combined with a warning that Tiphook expected to make a small loss in the six months to October 30, was the latest in a series of shocks from the former stock market star. These have caused its market value to collapse from Pounds 630m in 1991 to Pounds 186m at last night's close. This latest setback calls into question the future of Mr Robert Montague, Tiphook's executive chairman, who founded the group in 1978. It now operates in 38 countries and has the world's second-largest fleet of containers - after Genstar - and Europe's biggest fleet of trailers. The company insisted that all the advisers were sticking by Mr Montague, who was criticised recently for receiving a pay rise from Pounds 842,000 to Pounds 851,000 in the year to end-April, a period when changes in accountancy policy caused Tiphook to plunge into net losses of Pounds 66.5m, against a retained profit of Pounds 31.7m in 1992. Last month directors told a highly critical annual meeting that they intended to take pay cuts of between 25 and 30 per cent this year. Analysts said the need for the group to obtain shareholder approval of new borrowing limits at an extraordinary general meeting would give investors an opportunity to depose Mr Montague, if they wished. The banks, which are negotiating new facilities, could also demand his departure. Since 1991 the proportion of the group's equity held as American Depositary Receipts has risen from 2 per cent to more than 50 per cent. Several UK institutional investors lost patience with Tiphook's record of seeing sharp movements in its share price before announcements were made to the market. Utilisation of Tiphook's containers has not recovered as quickly as the group had hoped, and rental rates have fallen slightly. Moody's, the US credit rating agency, said last night it might downgrade the rating on about Dollars 700m (Pounds 463m) of the group's debt from Ba-2, which is already a so-called speculative grade.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jean Leclerc du Sablon: "Paris and Beijing </F> Envisage Cooperation in Space Technology"]    [Text] Beijing -- While the visit of Gerard Longuet, French  minister of foreign trade, industry, and telecommunications, to  China at the beginning of July risks being disappointing with  regard to the conclusion of industrial and trading agreements,  the French and Chinese alike are envisaging a new area of  cooperation: space.    Jean-Daniel Levi, general manager of the National Space  Research Center (CNES), which is organizing a number of meetings  between French and Chinese space experts in Beijing and Shanghai  this week, told LE FIGARO that the Chinese "have a real desire  to establish cooperation ties, and we have decided to continue  discussions and to start a series of exchanges and expert  visits."    However, despite the interest of Chinese officials in this  sector, two major manufacturers have been excluded from these  meetings at the request of the Beijing authorities: MATRA and  Thomson. The French gave in to Chinese demands on the advice of  the French foreign minister.  <H5>  Black List </H5>   MATRA and Thomson, with Dassault, have been "blacklisted" by  the Chinese Government because of their participation in  contracts to supply arms, frigates, and Mirage aircraft to  Taiwan.    The 12 January communique which restored Franco-Sino  relations stated that China would open up its markets to French  companies "on an equal footing" with companies from other  countries.    Prime Minister Edouard Balladur raised this issue during a  meeting with Li Peng, his Chinese counterpart, in Beijing in  early April. Mr. Levi thinks that this problem will disappear  in time. A number of French industrial groups were nonetheless  surprised at the Chinese Government's "indelicate" handling of  the affair.    The CNES head believes that possibilities for cooperation  are  more likely to be found in the design of satellites than in  their launch, since the low-cost "Long March" rockets are  already a serious competitor for the European Ariane space group.    The French participants did, however, note the interest  expressed by their interlocutors in French technology and,  ironically, in MATRA equipment in particular. They were  received by two leading officials, Song Jian, the minister of  the State Science and Technology Comission, and, most  importantly, by General Ding Henggao, head of the Commission for  Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defense. This  commission controls the Chinese counterparts of the CNES, the  Atomic Energy Commission [CEA], and the General Air Office.    Gen. Ding, a member of the Central Committee who was very  recently decorated with a third star, the supreme rank in the  Chinese Army, was expected in Paris yesterday to attend the  Satory Arms Fair at the invitation of French Defense Minister  Francois Leotard. He worked with Nie Rongzhen, the "father" of  the Chinese atom bomb, and married his daughter, Nie Li, who is  herself a general and a leading official in the Chinese space  industry.</p>

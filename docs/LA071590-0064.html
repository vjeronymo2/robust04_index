			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> TRINIDAD REELING FROM ECONOMIC WOES, BRAIN DRAIN  </P> <P> The health service of Trinidad and Tobago has sunk into a crisis so severe that  nurses wrap newborns in brown packing paper and hospital patients complain  about cockroaches in their beds.  </P> <P> The health crisis is part of a general malaise whose symptoms include high  unemployment, a sharply reduced standard of living and a steady drain of  skilled citizens who seek a better life abroad.  </P> <P> After months of quiet complaints about steadily deteriorating conditions in the  country's state-run hospitals, hundreds of nurses took to the streets in  demonstrations that left no doubt that Trinidad and Tobago is going though  tough times.  </P> <P> Only a decade ago, the twin-island republic of 1.3 million people was the  affluent jewel of the West Indies, with a per-capita income higher than that of  any other island in the Caribbean chain.  </P> <P> The nurses' grievances range from poor pay to the absence of even the most  basic equipment.  </P> <P> As street protests gathered momentum in June, medical staff of one of the  country's biggest hospitals, in the city of San Fernando, ran out of baby  blankets and started wrapping newborn infants in brown packing paper.  </P> <P> Patients at another hospital, at Point Fortin, told reporters that cockroaches  and ants were routinely marching across their beds.  </P> <P> Elsewhere, hospital staff told of surgery by flashlight, urine-soaked  mattresses, patients being asked to bring their own sheets and provide their  own medicines.  </P> <P> "There are no syringes. There are not enough beds, there are no bedpans, few  wheelchairs and not enough hospital trolleys," said Dr. Kenrick Rennie, head of  the Public Services Assn.  </P> <P> "It is difficult to imagine for people in the industrialized world but some of  our hospitals don't even have gauze."  </P> <P> At the height of street protests in the capital, hundreds of nurses converged  on the "Red House," the ornate Parliament building in Port of Spain, waving  placards and chanting slogans demanding the immediate resignation of health  minister Emanuel Hosein.  </P> <P> In San Fernando, workers from other trade unions joined the nurses, represented  by the PSA, in one of Trinidad and Tobago's biggest anti-government  demonstrations in a decade.  </P> <P> Hosein promised action to tackle the crisis and blamed the problems of the  health sector on the previous government that had run Trinidad and Tobago  during the oil bonanza that turned the country into the richest in the  Caribbean.  </P> <P> "When we came (to power), there was not a cent in the kitty," Hosein told  Parliament as nurses outside demanded his removal. "We have the mandate but no  money."  </P> <P> The present government, led by Prime Minister A.N.R. Robinson, won a landslide  victory in 1986 elections, taking 33 out of 36 seats in the House of  Representatives and ending 30 years of uninterrupted rule by the People's  National Movement.  </P> <P> Diplomats here say many of the problems faced by Robinson, including the health  crisis, are typical of countries whose economies depend chiefly on oil.  </P> <P> The oil boom of the late 1970s and early 1980s brought wealth and economic  growth rates of 7% a year to Trinidad and Tobago. But since the collapse of oil  prices in 1982, the one-legged economy has been in deep trouble. Government  figures put unemployment at 23% and gross domestic product plunged from $6,856  per capita in 1982 to $3,043 in 1988.  </P> <P> To halt the decline, the Robinson Administration launched an ambitious program  to lessen dependence on oil, attract foreign investors, and cut government  spending in line with the standard prescriptions of the International Monetary  Fund.  </P> <P> The government, Trinidad and Tobago's biggest employer, introduced a 10%  across-the-board wage cut and a 15% value-added tax, which cuts sharply into  personal incomes.  </P> <P> Some 15,000 civil servants are being offered voluntary retirement under a  rationalization program. So far, there have been few takers.  </P> <P> Reaction to the austerity package has been mixed. There has been praise from  free-market advocates in Trinidad and the United States, the twin-islands'  biggest trade partner. There has been condemnation from the opposition and  labor unions who say there are no signs of progress.  </P> <P> The government disagrees.  </P> <P> "We expect a return to economic growth this year for the first time since  1983," said Bhoendradatt Tewarie, the minister of industry, enterprise and  tourism. "We are hoping for 1% growth," he said.  </P> <P> "But it is possible that we will have only 0.5."  </P> <P> According to a Central Bank report issued early in July, real gross domestic  product in the first quarter of 1990 was 0.6% below the 1989 figure.  </P></p>

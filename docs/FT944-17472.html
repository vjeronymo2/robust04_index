			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Canada The Toronto market bucked the trend in New York and posted solid gains in moderate trading as bargain hunters shrugged off caution ahead of the release of today's crucial US employment figures. In spite of a slight decline by bonds, Canadian stocks built on Wednesday's late rally, taking back some of the losses from the previous two days of trading that shaved more than 90 points off the TSE 300 composite index. The TSE 300 finished 22.96 points up at 4,276.32, while rises led declines by 367 to 350 after volume of 60.3m shares valued at CDollars 889m. Thirteen of the 14 sub-indices were up, with real estate, golds, transportation and financial services leading the way. The paper and forestry sector posted a decline.</p>

			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / France to tighten security measures The French government said yesterday it was tightening security measures after a militant Algerian group warned of reprisals if France failed to free 17 suspected Moslem fundamentalists it has placed under detention. The warning, which follows a crackdown by France on Moslem militants after last week's attack on a French embassy building in Algiers, raises concerns that the violent struggle between fundamentalists and the military-led Algerian government could trigger incidents in France. The threat of reprisals was made in a statement issued at the weekend by the Islamic Salvation Army, linked to the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS). The FIS has been outlawed by the Algerian government, which in 1992 cancelled a general election the FIS was poised to win. 'The arrest and detention of these brothers means that France has declared war on the FIS and on Algerian Moslems,' the statement said. 'France should renounce this policy of belligerence or it will assume responsibility for what will happen.' France rejected the demand, but said it took the threat seriously. It said that security had been tightened at embassies, airports and railways, while random police checks on papers and identity cards were also increased. The 17 activists, rounded up since Thursday, are held at an army camp in Folembray, north east of Paris. All have been served with expulsion orders. But the French Interior Ministry said they would not be returned to Algeria, in the interests of their own safety. They will be detained until a country is found willing to accept them, according to one government official. The French crackdown has two aims; to demonstrate firm action following last week's attack in Algiers in which five French people were killed, and to send a message to Moslem activists that France will not tolerate the planning of guerrilla actions within its borders. The militant Armed Islamic Group, which is more radical than the FIS and its military wing, claimed responsibility for the attack. France has criticised the failure of its western partners to take tougher measures against Algerian Moslem fundamentalists. The accusation has been rejected by Britain, Germany and the US. But the tough French line has highlighted differences in policy with its western partners, who see a greater role for dialogue with moderate Moslem groups.</p>

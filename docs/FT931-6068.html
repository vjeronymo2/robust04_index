			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Letter: Diversity as a function of managerial characteristics Sir, Christopher Lorenz's piece, 'Shaking off the heavy brigade' (February 26), in which he argues that diversity is dying in business, correctly knocks another nail in the coffin of 'diversity'. He rightly defines diversity as a function of managerial characteristics rather than product, market or industry. A premium product may have widely different managerial characteristics from a low-cost product, even though both are part of the same industry. As a result, speciality chemicals can be seen to be different from commodity chemicals because of their differing managerial characteristics. These different managerial characteristics demand different skills from the parent company, making the two types of chemical business awkward bedfellows. Mr Lorenz does, however, dismiss 'cross-business synergies' somewhat too readily when, summing up the axioms of what he calls the new orthodoxy in business, he says that 'cross-business 'synergies' of any kind - technological, marketing or any other - are far more elusive than was commonly thought in the 1960s and 1970s'. In our research at the Ashridge Strategic Management Centre, we have identified many situations where businesses benefit from co-ordinating with each other. Cross-business synergies are not scarce, but we have noted that only a very small portion of these synergies need a parent company to release them. The synergies can in fact be gained by the mutual consent of the businesses regardless of who owns them. Only certain kinds of synergies, that is, those involving blockages to arm's-length solutions, require the existence of a parent company. To borrow Mr Lorenz's analogy, the sap may be flowing between businesses, but it is only in a very few situations that this flow needs to be 'parented'.

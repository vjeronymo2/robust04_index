The complete application is available for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference Branch. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Representations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Principal Mutual, a mutual life insurance company, was incorporated under the laws of Iowa in 1879 as Bankers Life Association. It changed its name to Bankers Life Company in 1911 and assumed its present name in 1986. Principal Mutual sells life, disability, and health insurance, and annuities written both on an individual and group basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Separate Account B was established on January 12, 1970. It is registered under the Act as a unit investment trust. Under Iowa insurance laws and regulations the income, gains or losses, whether or not realized, of Separate Account B are credited to or charged against the assets of Separate Account B without regard to the other income, gains or losses, of Principal Mutual. Separate Account B is divided into three divisions (``Divisions'') corresponding to the three mutual funds (``Mutual Funds'') in which its assets may be invested. The Mutual Funds are diversified, open-end, management investment companies that serve as funding vehicles for variable insurance products of Principal Mutual and are not offered directly to the public. Principal Mutual may, at a later date, determine to create additional Divisions of Separate Account B to invest in any additional Mutual Fund shares which may be issued in the future or in the shares of other investment companies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Princor, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Principal Mutual, will be the principal underwriter of the Contracts. It is registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The Contracts are flexible purchase payment individual variable annuity contracts which provide for the accumulation of values on a fixed or variable basis and the payment of annuity benefits on a fixed basis. The Contracts are designed to provide individuals with retirement benefits in connection with certain plans entitled to special tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code and in connection with non-tax qualified retirement plans. Subject to certain restrictions, amounts accumulated may be transferred among Divisions of Separate Account B or to or from Principal Mutual's general account. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The owner of a Contract may allocate purchase payments among the available Divisions of Separate Account B and to Principal Mutual's general account for accumulation on a fixed basis (the ``Fixed Account''). The owner may also transfer on either a scheduled or unscheduled basis amounts accumulated in any Division or the Fixed Account subject to certain restrictions. For any unscheduled transfer from a Division made after the twelfth such transfer in a Contract year, Principal Mutual may impose a transaction fee not to exceed $30. Such charge is designed to cover the administrative expenses associated with the transfer. Transfers among Divisions of Separate Account B will be made in reliance upon the exemptive relief provided by Rule 11a&hyph;2 under the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. On the last day of each Contract year prior to the commencement of annuity payments, Principal Mutual will deduct from the accumulated value of the Contract an annual fee equal to the lesser of $30 or 2% of the accumulated value. The fee will be deducted from the owner's interest in either the Fixed Account or a Division of Separate Account B, whichever has the greatest value. The annual fee will also be deducted if the Contract is surrendered on any date other than a Contract anniversary. No annual fee will be deducted, either annually or upon surrender, if the accumulated value of the Contract is at least $30,000 at the time the fee is to be deducted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

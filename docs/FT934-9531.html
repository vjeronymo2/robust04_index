			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Nu-Swift makes progress on privatisation NU-SWIFT, the fire protection and property group which is being taken private, reported pre-tax profits up from Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 4.3m for the first half of 1993. The company said yesterday that 'significant progress' had been made towards the privatisation. The Yorkshire-based group, quoted on the USM, is 66 per cent owned by its chairman, Mr Jacques Murray, through European Fire Protection. Mr Michael Ashcroft's ADT holds 22.8 per cent. Group turnover fell from Pounds 154.5m to Pounds 152.1m. Turnover from discontinued operations accounted for Pounds 132.3m, reflecting the contribution from the US office cleaning and maintenance division which was sold in June. Turnover from continuing operations rose from Pounds 18.2m to Pounds 19.7m. The group said that its fire protection business had 'continued to make a considerable contribution to profits', with a new production unit in Yorkshire helping to cut costs. The division contributed Pounds 2.7m to operating profits, down from Pounds 2.8m last time. Operating profits from the property investment division rose from Pounds 5.6m to Pounds 6.3m. The group said that while no independent valuation of its investment property portfolio had been made since December 31 last year, the board was confident it had more than maintained its value. It continued to yield gross rental income of more than 10 per cent. Earnings per share were 7.52p (5.09p). No interim dividend will be paid. However, the group said that if the privatisation talks were terminated, with no subsequent offer to shareholders, the board 'will recommend a special interim dividend for 1993.'</p>

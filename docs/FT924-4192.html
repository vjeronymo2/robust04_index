			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / International Company News: Henkel aims to hold payout as profits fall HENKEL, the German chemicals, cosmetics and personal products group, expects profits to fall this year, but will maintain its dividend. Forecasting a moderate fall in pre-tax and net earnings, Mr Hans-Dietrich Winkhaus, chairman, said sales after nine months had risen 11 per cent to about DM11bn (Dollars 7bn), due mainly to the effects of acquisitions, and profits were still level with 1991 rates. However, sales growth had slowed in the final quarter and the company expected turnover for the year to grow only 8 per cent to around DM14bn. Germany's leading chemicals groups have been hit by a recent sharp fall in both volume sales and prices. The effects have been compounded by the appreciation of the D-Mark. Henkel is likely to suffer less than others, however, because of its wide interests in consumer products such as detergents and toothpaste which are less susceptible to cyclical swings. Even so, the company plans to reduce its workforce, increased by acquisitions, by 2,000 over the next two years. Investment next year will total DM730m, down from this year's DM800m. Henkel's dividends last year were DM10 for preference stock and DM7 for preference shares.</p>

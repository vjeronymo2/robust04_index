			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News and Current Events" program] </F>   [Text] On 18 March, the mainland's Association for  Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] wrote a letter to  Taiwan's Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF] on a recent incident  wherein Taiwan's defense troops stationed on offshore islands  fired at Fujian fishermen. The letter says: As informed by  relevant Fujian provincial authorities, at about 0400 on 6  March, (Zheng Baoxing) and other fishermen from (Simu) Village,  Huangshi Town, Lianjian County, set sail on fishing boat  (?Yuminyu) No. 8509 to fish at waters near Mazu's (Daqi Island).  While searching for their lost fishing hooks due to broken  lines, they were suddenly fired at by the defense troops.  (Zheng Baoxing), a crew member, was shot dead on the spot,  while (Yan Huayong) and [words indistinct] were injured. After  the incident, the boat sought medical treatment but was rejected  by the defense troops firing their guns. Fifteen minutes later,  the boat sailed to Mazu's Beigan to moor at (Huaikaicun) pier,  and was again fired at by the defense troops. Only after the  repeated requests of crewman (Lin Huoqiang), two men, who  appeared to be officers, came to investigate and summoned a  doctor to give simple dressings for (Wu Guoyou)'s wounds. One  of the officers gave $15,000 New Taiwan dollars to (Lin  Huoqiang) as compensation. At about 1300, the Mazu side sent a  boat to tow (Yuminyu) No. 8509 from the pier. The fishing boat  returned to Huangshi, Lianjiang, at 1430.    The letter says: Over a long period of time, Taiwan's  defending troops stationed on offshore islands ignored the  brotherly friendship between the people on the two sides of the  Taiwan Strait. The incidents of firing at and killing or  injuring mainland fishermen occurred occasionally. In 1993  alone, there were 18 incidents wherein defense troops in Jinmen  and Mazu fired at or shelled mainland fishermen working on the  sea, causing bloodshed, deaths, and injuries. Of these, seven  people were killed and 15 were injured. The disgusting conduct  of Taiwan's defending troops stationed in offshore islands not  only caused great harm to the feeling of mainland's coastal  fishermen but also disrupted the normal production and life of  the Taiwan Strait. In addition, it brought utmost mental agony  as well as tremendous economic loss to the families of the dead  and injured fishermen.    Recently, we made many representations to relevant Taiwan  authorities. However, not only did the defense troops' firing  not stop, it became increasingly rampant. Our country has  strongly asked the relevant Taiwan authorities to adopt positive  and effective measures to stop this kind of incident from being  repeated and pay compensation, including compensation for the  losses of dead and injured fishermen in the (?Yuminyu) incident.</p>

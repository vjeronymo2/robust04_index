			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Euro Disney sold Leisure group Euro Disney retreated in London as dealers reacted to a brief suspension of the stock in Paris after the shares lost more than 10 per cent of their value on a broker's negative comments. The 15-minute suspension, a common practise in Paris when any stock falls by more than 10 per cent, was prompted by reports that London-based Paribas analyst Mr Nigel Reed had not only advised investors to sell the shares but valued the stock at just FFr1.60 a share - they were suspended at FFr9.30. Mr Reed was reported as saying: 'I value the shares at a very low level.' The analyst, a known bear of the stock, was also said to have increased his current year estimate of losses at the group to FFr1.62bn from FFr1.2bn. The shares in London were down 10 at the day's worst, but steadied towards the close to finish 9 down at 117p.</p>

			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Travel: The forgotten desert lake - War and Peace (Travelling in Troublespots) / Mark Nicholson discovers a remote corner of Egypt There is a place, 1200km south of Cairo, of daunting calm, isolation and alien majesty; of black, silent nights illuminated only by the dim whitewash of the Milky Way, of swirling blood-orange sunsets over a remote, forgotten landscape. It can also, surprisingly, be a place where afternoon tea is accompanied by Sinatra tunes and 3,000-year-old Pharaohs are serenaded by Madame Butterfly. Few more tranquil places exist. So I decided to spice the appreciation of this idyll by departing from one of the rowdiest, most rambunctious places in Egypt, Cairo's Ramses Station, and pass through one of the most violent, the Nile valley towns around Assiut, where police and militant Islamic gunmen have traded fire and fatalities almost daily for two years. Beginning a journey which would take me the length of the Egyptian Nile, I caught the Cairo-Aswan overnight express. 'The spirit of the Orient Express, but with more sophistication,' said the brochure. And fewer passengers, it might have added. After dinner, only the staff remained in the walnut-trimmed fin de siecle bar of the first-class carriage. A lone English couple had played a hand of cards over a nightcap and retired. Essam, 14 years a barman on this route, waved towards the empty tables. 'The newspapers they make a problem for us writing about terrorists. Now it's finish, the terrorists. But the tourist, too, it's finish.' Militants have not fired at the overnight express, or tossed small bombs through its windows, since spring. Tough Egyptian policing has seen to that. Just up the corridor, a brace of soldiers peered out at the passing cane fields and dimly-lit little brick dwellings. Rifles nestled between their legs, bayonets fixed. The British government advises travellers not to pass by land through Assiut, where the train stops to change drivers. I spent my defiance of Her Majesty's government unconscious of it, asleep in my Wagon Lit. Before my train passed, though, two militants were shot dead that night near the station at Mallawi, 100km north of Assiut. At Aswan station, I took a short taxi ride to the High Dam, where, in the dam's westward lee, sat the MS Eugenie: the only cruise boat on Lake Nasser, a five-deck, mock paddle steamer, just one year old. It is a bizarre vision among the rusty boats and barges which once plied the lake to Sudan, before Egypt's relations with its southern neighbour soured. But Lake Nasser is an odd, forgotten place. It yawns, glittering and incongruous, way off into the desert. An average of 10km wide, reaching 300km to Sudan and 200 thereafter, it is, thanks to Gamel Abdul Nasser's grand design and Soviet engineering, the biggest man-made freshwater lake in the world, full of perch and crocodiles; but by man, virtually uncharted in its 30 years. Eugenie, though, is its queerest fish. It is an elegant, white, perky-looking craft, 73m long with 50 cabins, each with its own balcony. Inside, from a marble-tiled entrance hall beneath a star-spangled atrium with stylised Egyptian motifs, the boat opens up a curling wood staircase to a long, elegant bar upholstered in rich reds and greens, a saloon of leather chesterfields and card tables, framed prints of Egyptian treasures between its windows. The whole decorated as if Terence Conran had designed a set for Death on the Nile. On this cruise, on the rear deck beneath a white Italian panama, sat Mustapha Guindy, the boat's dapper 34-year-old owner, showman and one-man evangelist for the forgotten Lake Nasser. He sold his Aswan-Luxor cruise boat to build Eugenie, completed with two year's work and 800 men on the lake itself. 'People thought I was crazy,' he says. That he may not be becomes clear after just an hour's sailing into Lake Nasser's lost horizon. Beneath a Nubian sun, a low tableau of distant, mysterious peaks and bluffs, hidden lagoons and virgin dunes glide by. Wind-hewn natural pyramids suggestively litter the timeless horizon. As the lake's remote shores converge on Eugenie at the Tropic of Cancer and the breeze stills, the calm of this lunarscape only becomes more riveting. Thousands of miles of desert shores touched only by a few gazelles, monitor lizards or basking crocodiles, the empty sky punctuated by a graceful wing of pelicans. After a day's sailing grows the odd sense that this enormous empty expanse is a private lake for Eugenie and you. And not an Islamic militant in sight. It becomes easy to understand Mustapha's missionary zeal for this remarkable resource. 'The government sees it only as a big reservoir,' he says. 'But look how much more it is. It can be a dream. It just needs a plan - like the High Dam or the Suez Canal.' But while it remains his to play with, our host turns his lake into an extraordinary theatrical set. Eugenie several times moors beside temples rescued before the dam flooded this stretch of the Nile - less impressive than Nile valley treasures such as Karnak, Luxor or Philae temples, but incomparably more grandly and evocatively sited. A third stop, by night, is beside the craggy ruins of the ancient fortress of Qasr Ibrimm, now an isle. Under the stars, an improvised son et lumiere; the citadel is lit by dozens of flaming torches as Rimsky Korsakov's Sheherazade is blazed out from its midst, aptly the first movement: The Sea and Sinbad's Ship. By the second day of this three-day voyage a week might have passed. Short guided tours at one of the stops create the fiction of an appetite for the uncharacteristically - for Egypt - good food at lunch. Tea and Frank Sinatra in the lounge at five. A general evacuation into the roomy cabins for a snooze, or perhaps a sauna or steam bath. Then dinner. By mid-afternoon on the final day, Abu Simbel hoves into view - the 3,000-year-old temple of Ramses II, who proclaimed himself a god and carved himself an appropriately grandiose tribute: four implacable seated colossi 20m high, and a massive inner hall of statues, chambers and dramatic reliefs, hewn from the rock. It was rediscovered, deep beneath dunes, by Swiss Egyptologist John Lewis Burckhardt in 1813, cleared and entered four years later by Giovanni Belzoni, the Italian bodybuilder turned Egyptologist, and moved from its now submerged original location under Unesco's auspice 30 years ago. Before Eugenie moors beneath the colossi's gaze, the engines are cut, the boat glides to shore and Madame Butterfly rings from the boat's speakers. More theatre. After dark, the boat also has this magnificent temple to itself. The crew serves glasses of wine, and Mustapha, clearly relishing the role of latter day pied piper, leads us into the temple's innards of dramatic friezes and statues. Then, alas, flights depart at dawn from Abu Simbel's tiny airport bound for what passes as civilisation. Of course it is perfectly possible to fly directly to Abu Simbel, but as we walked from the temple gates to our airport bus, and the first pack of visitors scrambled past, our collective sense of smug self-congratulation was palpable. Eugenie departs Aswan-Abu Simbel on Saturdays and returns on Wednesdays. Double berths cost Dollars 155 (Pounds 94.50) a night for a double, Dollars 96 a single. The suite is Dollars 400 a night. Belle Epoque, which runs the cruise, is on Cairo (202) 352 4775/8734. Jules Verne travel is UK agent.</p>

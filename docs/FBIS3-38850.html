			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Interior Minister Charles Pasqua by </F> Annette Ardisson on 9 February -- live or recorded]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Ardisson] There is a NATO  meeting today. Do you favor military intervention in  Yugoslavia? Are we to wage war or not?    [Pasqua] What I think is that, if we continue to stay under  the current conditions, we shall bear a responsiblity, not only  [words indistinct], we already take great responsibility in  what is happening -- but we shall also suffer dishonor. So,  either NATO decides to intervene -- or else I don't see what we  are still doing in Bosnia. There will be only one thing left to  do, and that is to leave. I think that is what [Foreign  Minister] Alain Juppe said last night: Everyone must be made to  face up to their responsibilities. We cannot stand and watch  with indifference what is happening, content ourselves with  counting the dead, and say: Yes, well, Sunday wasn't very nice,  there were 65 dead, 200 injured, children and so on; it's all  very sad, but we cannot do anything about it. No, that isn't  true. I think the time has come for everyone to face up to  their responsibilities.    [Ardisson] What does that mean?    [Pasqua] It means....    [Ardisson, interrupting] Does it mean: Let's go?    [Pasqua] It means we have to call on the Serbs to withdraw  their artillery positions from around Sarajevo; if they do not,  we have to intervene with air strikes. Otherwise, we should  leave.    What's the point of it? We have already had 30 dead. We  already have 30 French soldiers who have been killed, and we  have had 300 wounded. And all of that for what? For nothing.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, [no dateline as received] -- At the evening  plenary session of the Ukrainian Supreme Council held behind  closed doors today, the president of Ukraine submitted a draft  resolution of the Supreme Council of Ukraine "On stopping the  effect of the Law of the Republic of Crimea `On restoring the  constitutional fundamentals of the statehood of the Republic of  Crimea.'" It, in particular, states that today the Supreme  Council of Crimea, as a matter of fact, restored the provision  of the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea in its 6 May 1992  wording, which deals, first and foremost, with the establishment  of relations between Crimea and Ukraine on the basis of treaties  and agreements, and the introduction of Crimean citizenship.  All this is a step toward Crimea's secession from the  composition of Ukraine, which violates the territorial integrity  of Ukraine, its state sovereignty, and contradicts the  principles of international law.    According to the legislation currently in force, the top  state power bodies in the Republic of Crimea have no right to  solve the issues that are within the competence of the state  bodies of Ukraine. The volume of the plenary powers of the  Republic of Crimea cannot be changed without the consent of the  Supreme Council of Ukraine.    The resolution envisages "with the aim of protecting state  sovereignty and ensuring the supremacy of the laws of Ukraine on  its entire territory TO STOP [capitals as per original text] the  effect of the Law of the Republic of Crimea of 20 May 1994 `On  restoring the constitutional fundamentals of the statehood of  the Republic of Crimea' as such that contradicts the declaration  on state sovereignty and the Constitution of Ukraine." The  Supreme Council of Ukraine proposes that the parliament of  Crimea should bring the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea  in line with the Constitution and the legislation of Ukraine  within 10 days.    Today, political leaders, parties, and public organizations  expressed their attitudes toward the decisions by the Supreme  Council of Crimea.    Vasyl Durdynets, chairman of the parliamentary group  "Tsentr"  [Center]:    In general, my attitude toward any sanctions is very  cautious. But with regard to the concrete situation in Crimea,  when Ukraine allocates its last money, withdrawing it from other  regions (for example, 50 billion karbovantsi were transferred to  Sevastopol on 18 May), while the leadership of Crimea  intentionally continues to act contrary, sanctions on the part  of Ukraine would be logical and legitimate in order to bring  those who stake their all against our state down to earth.  Probably, it is not expedient to resort to extremities and  introduce a state of emergency, however, I do not know any state  that would respond to such actions of its region so reluctantly.  I believe that in the last resort we will appeal to the world  public.    Deputy Prime Minister Mykola Zhulynskyy, people's deputy of  the Supreme Council of Ukraine:    I am extremely worried about what I have seen in Crimea of  late. First and foremost, this is the opposition between the  Majlis of the Crimean Tatar people and President Yuriy Meshkov.  The Crimean Tatars favor Ukraine's territorial integrity and  openly declare that they smell gunpowder in the air. In my  opinion, Yuriy Meshkov is provoking the aggravation of the  situation. Serhiy Tsekov, chairman of the Supreme Council of  Crimea, whom I met at a mourning ceremony in connection with the  50th anniversary of the Crimean Tatars' deportation, declared  that he was inclined to the necessity of setting up a commission  of the Supreme Council of Crimea to hold consultations with the  representatives of the Supreme Council of Ukraine on issues of  Crimean Tatars and relations between Ukraine and Crimea. (As  UNIAN reported today in a special release, such a commission,  chaired by Serhiy Tsekov, was set up at the Supreme Council of  Crimea session on 20 May).    The People's Movement of Ukraine [Rukh], in its appeal to  the  citizens of Ukraine, states that the actions by the Supreme  Council of Crimea endanger Ukraine's territorial integrity and  lead to igniting a fratricidal war as a result of which peace in  Ukraine and, therefore, in the entire European and Black Sea  region, is endangered. The appeal asserts that all the actions  by the "helmsmen of Crimea are encouraged by the deputies to the  Russian Federation State Duma, with the president of Russia  being aware of this." In the opinion of the authors of the  appeal, the interests of the 700,000-strong Ukrainian population  in Crimea and also the interests of the Crimean Tatars are  totally ignored.    Stepan Khmara, people's deputy, chairman of the Ukrainian  Conservative Republican Party:    This antistate act must be stopped by the most radical  means,  because this is an attempt upon the integrity of the state.  Yuriy Meshkov and his company must be arrested as conspirators.  The president's veto is insufficient at this point, more  radical actions are necessary, all structures must be involved  to protect the state.    Volodymyr Marchenko, people's deputy of Ukraine, one of the  leaders of the Socialist Party of Ukraine parliamentary group:    Socialists will not agree to Crimea's secession from  Ukraine.  The territorial integrity of the state envisages Crimea within  the composition of Ukraine. This is unequivocal.    Participants in the Political Parties Club, which is taking  place in Kiev (the Ukrainian Party of Justice, the Party of Free  Peasants, the Constitutional-Democratic Party of Ukraine, the  Social- Democratic Party of Ukraine, the Democratic Party of  Ukraine, the Ukrainian Republican Party, People's Movement of  Ukraine, the Labor Congress of Ukraine, and the Congress of  Ukrainian Nationalists), adopted an appeal to the president and  the chairman of the Supreme Council of Ukraine "in connection  with the aggravation of the political situation in Ukraine,  first and foremost, connected with Crimea" to hold a joint  meeting for consultations and the soonest possible solution of  the existing problem.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On the occasion of the first founding anniversary  of Nanchang University, State Council Premier Li Peng and Vice  Premier Li Lanqing wrote inscriptions for the university.  Premier Li Peng's inscription reads: Raise the level of  running a school and rejuvenate Jiangxi's economy. Vice Premier  Li Lanqing's inscription reads: Bring the combined strong  points into play, further improve teaching quality and the  social benefit of running a school, and contribute to running  well a new-type university.    Under the correct leadership of the provincial party  committee and government and with the support of the State  Education Commission, Nanchang University has achieved  gratifying results in teaching, scientific research, production,  and spiritual civilization building, and enhanced its overall  management capability since its founding on 4 May last year.  In the past year, the university has strengthened teaching  reforms focusing on the credit, elimination, and rolling  competetion systems, thus improving teaching quality. The first  acceptance rate on the national English examination of 1992  students increased from 47 percent scored before the merger of  two schools to 64.98 percent. At the same time, the university  has achieved initial results in expansion of key disciplines.  It has become a pre-doctoral education unit with an additional  unit of Ph.D. graduate students, two doctoral tutors, and nine  units of students studying for a master's degree, thus ending  the situation in which there has been not any unit of Ph.D.  graduate students in Jiangxi for a long time.</p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / The Queen's Speech: Scottish bail rules will be tightened The criminal justice bill for Scotland will include measures to increase penalties for people who commit crimes while on bail and make it difficult or impossible for people convicted of serious offences such as murder or rape to get bail when charged with a similar offence, James Buxton writes. The bill will also streamline court procedures in an attempt to reduce the number of trials adjourned or cancelled at the last minute. Scotland's unique 'fiscal fine' - a fixed penalty fine similar to a parking ticket - will be extended to deal with a wider range of minor offences. The appeal system will be amended so that two judges instead of three will preside over many appeals against sentences.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Chongqing, April 26 (XINHUA) -- A forum was  recently held in Chongqing to tackle navigation problems during  the construction of the Three Gorges Dam on the Chang Jiang  River.    Nearly 30 experts in hydropower and navigation took part in  the forum, sponsored by the office of the Three Gorges project  of the State Council and the Ministry of Communications.    Experts from the South-West Marine Transport Institute  reported their latest research on the navigation channel,  silting and other issues that have to be solved during the  17-year construction of the dam.    The institute suggests that instead of building a temporary  ship lock and a ship lift, vessels could pass through a channel  during the construction.    The institute has since early 1992 been doing lab research.</p>

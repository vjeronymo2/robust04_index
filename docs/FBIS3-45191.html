At the  meeting, it was decided that all outstanding pay for teachers  and workers should be paid by the Spring Festival.    For historical and geographical reasons, economic  development  in our region has been rather uneven over the years, and some  prefectures remain quite impoverished. This plus mismanagement  and inefficiency of many enterprises have resulted in back pay  in many localities. To solve this real difficulty for teachers  and workers, the regional government convened a meeting of  leading officials of the economic commission, banks, financial  departments, labor departments, planning commissions, and  education commissions to look into the situation of back pay and  come up with a solution.    At the meeting, regional leaders Abulaidi Amurdurexiti, Wang  Lequan, Wang Yousan, and (Ufuer Abudula) asked in great detail  about the back pay situation in various sectors, offered their  views on how to settle the problems, and criticized some  departments for incompetence and mismanagement.    It was decided at the meeting that the regional treasury  should come up with 200 million yuan to pay the arrears.  Outstanding wages owed by enterprises should be paid with bank  loans. All back pay for teachers and workers must be paid by  the Spring Festival so they will be able to have a satisfying  holiday.</p>

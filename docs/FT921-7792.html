			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Car chief confident of Budget stimulus MR Geoffrey Whalen, chief executive of Peugeot Talbot, said yesterday he was confident that next month's Budget would produce a 'significant' cut in the 10 per cent special car tax on new-car sales. He said the car market had been 'artificially depressed' by high taxation. Mr Whalen also called for a change in the balance of power between the Department of Trade and Industry and the Treasury, with the DTI 'playing a more powerful role in government and being consulted before the Treasury or other departments adopt measures which might damage the interests of manufacturing industry.' Mr Whalen is the second motor-industry leader within two days to criticise some aspects of the government's policies towards the motor industry. On Monday, Mr George Simpson, Rover Group chairman, was severely critical of the UK economy's volatility compared with its main rivals. He called for a national industrial strategy - involving close consultation between government and industry - along the lines of Germany or Japan. However, Mr Whalen defended the government's overall record on reducing inflation and dismissed as 'prophets of gloom' critics sceptical about the industry's ability to recover. Quality, productivity and industrial relations had all improved, 'and I am convinced that when we are out of the current recession huge opportunities will appear for those companies able to respond quickly and effectively', he said. Peugeot Talbot's productivity had risen 30 per cent since 1988, 'and we will improve further'. Most in the motor trade and industry believe that higher value added tax - not reclaimable by companies on car purchases - and company car taxes introduced in last year's Budget have played a significant role in the steep decline in sales of new cars. Like Mr Simpson, Mr Whalen emphasised his opposition to direct government intervention in industry. 'There is a world of difference between a DTI which is influential in creating the right operating environment for industry and one which seeks to interfere in detail in the management of our undertakings,' he said. A survey by KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, found that there could be a substantial cut in the use of company cars by businesses if an uncertainty involving VAT was resolved. More than 90 per cent of the largest responding companies - those running fleets of 500 cars or more - said they would offer a cash alternative to company cars if fears of large VAT penalties on that cash sum were removed. The survey drew responses from 335 companies operating between them more than 90,000 cars.</p>

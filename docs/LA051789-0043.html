			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MUSIC  </P> <P> Tenor Luciano Pavarotti walked off stage during the third act of Puccini's  "Tosca" Monday night in Pittsburgh after throat problems made his voice crack.  The production began 45 minutes late as doctors attended to Pavarotti  backstage. He decided to go on, but was forced to end the opera early when his  voice cracked on a high note. Pavarotti mumbled "Sorry" and signaled the  conductor to start again, but he approached the same note with the same  results. "I cannot do it. I am sorry," he told the audience. He then put his  head down and walked off the stage. After a few moments, the curtain fell and  the houselights came on. The audience applauded. ALEENE MacMINN and CLAUDIA  PUIG  </P></p>

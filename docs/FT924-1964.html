			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil price rallies after dipping to Dollars 17.85 a barrel VOLATILE OIL prices edged higher in late trading yesterday after opening the day on a weak note as the market struggled to find a new direction. North Sea Brent crude for February delivery touched Dollars 17.85 a barrel in thin morning trading. But later in the day, a stronger New York market pushed London prices higher to Dollars 18.05 a barrel - 15 cents lower than Friday's close. 'The market is still in the mood to be bearish, but it has stopped reinterpreting everything as bad news,' said Mr Joe Stanislaw, industry consultant at Cambridge Energy Research Associates. Traders are still looking for evidence in the market that members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries are restraining their production of oil. Iran yesterday stressed that it had cut 300,000 barrels a day from its output. Iran has been shaken by the recent drop in oil prices which have fallen by Dollars 3 a barrel since October, and yesterday issued a statement reiterating its offer to cut below its latest production allocation. The statement, issued to Reuters news agency, called on Opec members to consider further ways of strengthening the market. However, some market observers believe prices have gone down too far: 'The market has oversold and overreacted,' said Mr Ken Miller, at Purvin and Gertz, the oil analysis group, in Houston, Texas. Mr Miller believes the market is fairly well balanced without a great overhang of stocks. He expects demand for Opec oil to reach 24.7m b/d in the first quarter (excluding Ecuador) - roughly in line with Opec's new production ceiling of 24.58m b/d. The weak market for oil products in the US could improve over the next month as some refineries cut their production runs in response to slim profit margins. Mr Miller expects this to bring some strength back to the crude market early next year.</p>

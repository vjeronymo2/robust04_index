			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Gartmore to be floated - Banque Indosuez to sell 25% holding for Pounds 75.7m BANQUE INDOSUEZ, the French bank, is to raise Pounds 75.7m via the sale of 25 per cent of its UK fund management company, Gartmore, through a flotation at 168p a share. The sale values Gartmore, the UK's fourth largest pension fund management company, at Pounds 338.6m, well above the company's own internal estimates prior to flotation of between Pounds 270m and Pounds 300m. Of the 45m shares to be sold, 3 per cent will be bought by Gartmore directors at the offering price. Of the remainder, 14 per cent are to be placed with institutional shareholders in the UK and Europe and 8 per cent will be offered publicly. In its prospectus, issued yesterday, Gartmore said its funds under management had risen to Pounds 18.1bn by the end of September, up Pounds 2bn in three months. In the first nine months of this year, its funds under management have soared by 41 per cent, according to Mr Philip Gibbs, financial industry analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. By contrast, Mercury Asset Management, which is also 25 per cent publicly owned and is the UK's largest pension fund manager, has been growing at an annual rate of 4 to 5 per cent, he said. The surge in Gartmore's business has been driven by the pension fund consultants, who have been impressed with its consistently above-average performance in recent years. In 1992, Gartmore's median fund outperformed the industry median by nearly 4 percentage points. Gartmore is forecasting earnings for 1993 of Pounds 24.5m or 8.4p per share, and said it intended to issue a notional net dividend for the year of 4p per share. The notional gross dividend yield will be 3 per cent. Mr Paul Myners, Gartmore's chairman, said that the company's earnings could be hurt if there were to be significant changes in the way pension funds were regulated. COMMENT Gartmore's shares, at 20.7 times earnings, look expensive when compared to those of, say, MAM, which trades at a more modest multiple of 16.7 per cent. But the growth in Gartmore's business is staggering, and if you believe it will continue to grow at its present rate the shares look cheap. However, it is unlikely Gartmore's chief marketing edge, the superlative results of last year, will be repeated. But even average results for the next two years will still give it an impressive three-year returns picture to sell to prospective clients. The big questions for Gartmore are whether it can keep its returns up over the long haul and whether it has allowed itself to become too dependent on a single source of new business, the UK pension fund market.</p>

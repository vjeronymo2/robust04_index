			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Nice, but not up to it 'It is so easy to condemn,' says one of the characters in Barchester Towers. 'I know no life that must be so delicious as that of a writer for newspapers, or a leading member of the opposition - to thunder forth accusations against men in power; show up the worst side of everything that is produced; to pick holes in every coat; to be ignorant, sarcastic, jocose, moral, or supercilious; to damn with faint praise or crush with open calumny]' I offer this little passage from Trollope, his favourite novelist, to Mr John Major. He may take it as an assurance that what is said about him is nothing personal, only business. The prime minister may particularly savour the conclusion to the above-quoted paragraph, which I am sure he knows well: 'What can be so easy as this when the critic has to be responsible for nothing? You condemn what I do; but put yourself in my position and do the reverse, and then see if I cannot condemn you.' Let us therefore put ourselves in Mr Major's position as his political life hangs by a thread. Never mind the opinions of writers for newspapers, consider those of his opponents, on both sides of the House. The leader of the official opposition was at his most jocose, moral, supercilious, etc, when he spoke on Wednesday. 'No amount of reshuffling, repackaging or re-presentation,' thundered Mr John Smith, who rose with ease to a delicious opportunity, 'can now disguise from the British people the stark reality of a discredited government, presided over by a discredited prime minister.' This was harmless compared with the publicly spoken words of the former chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont. He charged that the cabinet, of which he was in the immediate past a member, was in office but not in power; that the government that he had served with such limpet-like devotion for the preceding 2 1/2 years deserved to lose. Mr Lamont's strictures are as nothing to the calumnies whispered, not in the open, but behind sleeves among Conservatives everywhere. The kindest summary of these is that Mr Major may be a nice enough chap, but he is simply not up to the job. There is a defence to this charge, which Mr Major doubtless clings to. It is that he is the victim of the recession, and Maastricht. This is the tale told by Mr Michael Heseltine, the president of the board of trade, who claims to view the scene with some detachment. His perspective is that of an old sweat who has seen it all. He argues with a skill that only he can muster that many heads of government, or of state, are in difficulties not unlike those of the British prime minister. He cites France, Germany, Spain, Japan, the United States and others as countries struck by recession and in consequence discontented with their political leaders. Up to a point, Mr President. Germany's chancellor, Helmut Kohl, brought his troubles upon himself by promising what could not be delivered after unification. Spain's prime minister, Felipe Gonzalez, nearly lost the recent election, but actually won. President Bill Clinton's difficulties are the product of his eclectic campaign and his butterfly personality. Special, and different, factors apply in France and Japan. In short, the recession is buffeting governments, but it is not the complete explanation for voters' revolts. The Maastricht excuse is no more convincing. The anti-Europe vote on the Conservative benches is larger than the government's overall majority, which stands at 18 and shrinking. As Mr Major protested in his ashen-faced defence of himself on Wednesday, 'dealing with the problems of a small majority is a fundamental fact of democracy that no one dare or should even attempt to overlook'. This will continue to be true, only more so, as the years until the next general election go by and successive by-elections are lost. The end of Maastricht makes no difference. Europhobes who have so bitterly opposed Mr Major over the ratification of the treaty will not become quiescent once it becomes law. The evolution of the European Community, or union, is a continuing process. It will always cause ripples in British political life. The prime minister can, and does, give himself credit for having stuck to an anti-inflationary policy, even when it has clearly been to his political disadvantage to do so. He also congratulates himself for negotiating the deal he did at Maastricht, and for sticking out the painful parliamentary process necessary for ratification. That too has cost him dear. If he were now to turn on his critics - those within his own party - he could find plenty in them to condemn. It was he who won the election for their party, he might say, deftly avoiding the greater truth that it was Labour that lost it. All Tory MPs fought on Mr Major's manifesto, he might again remind them; surely they should have the decency, and the loyalty, to support his government now? It will not wash. The question of the hour is whether once all the excuses and explanations have been digested - the recession, the small majority, Maastricht - we have in Mr Major a prime minister of such extraordinary ability that he can master and reunite his party, restore the government's authority, and carry through the painful decisions that must be made if the Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement is to be halved, and then quartered. The prime minister need not listen to newspaper critics' answers to this question. As Trollope noted, it is no trouble to us to write another article next week giving the opposite point of view from the one expressed this week. He need not even pay excessive heed to the irreconcilables in his party; after all, they will not bear him. He must, however, take to heart the critics in every bar, and around every dinner-table, in the land. They are saying now - they said at Newbury and may say again at Christchurch - that he does not possess the heroic stature necessary for the task before him. I express the general opinion as gently as I can. When the recession is behind us, will Mr Major be better able to explain his policies? When Maastricht is gone, will he find the nerve to take a stand at a fixed point within the Conservative party and fight off all challenges to it? Will this prime minister ever give the country a sense that he knows where he is taking it? If he does not, or cannot, he will go.</p>

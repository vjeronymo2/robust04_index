			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladislav Jovanovic, minister of foreign </F> affairs of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, by Alexandra  Andon in Bucharest; date not given: "The Embargo and the  Illusion of Peace Through the Use of Force"]    [Text] [Andon] What is the meaning of this sudden visit  to Bucharest?    [Jovanovic] It is not exactly a sudden visit, we have had a  steady practice for quite some time now, to carry out political  contacts regularly. We have continued this practice in spite of  sanctions. This time we have examined the stage of projects for  bilateral accords that the prime ministers of the two countries  agreed upon in October 1993.    [Andon] What kind of bilateral accords are you referring to?    [Jovanovic] We are talking about a long-term economic  cooperation accord, whose drafting has reached the final stage.  Likewise, we are talking about the basic bilateral accord and  about the cooperation accord in the area of health, culture, and  ecology. We wish that the lifting of sanctions should find us  prepared.    [Andon] How long do you think the embargo is still going to  last?    [Jovanovic] This embargo should not have been imposed in the  first place. It was imposed as an idea for the reestablishment  of peace in Bosnia but it has become the major obstacle in the  path of peace because the Muslims rely on those sanctions and,  therefore, they oppose peace. They believe that through  sanctions they will obtain victory since they could not obtain  victory in any other way in this war. An increasingly greater  number of countries are aware of this fact. The most important  thing is that the neighboring countries, which are the most  affected by these sanctions, should oppose this irrational and  absurd policy.    [Andon] Which countries give you signs that they support the  lifting of the embargo?    [Jovanovic] First of all the European Union has linked the  reestablishment of peace in Bosnia to the lifting of sanctions,  asking that Serbs should fulfill certain conditions that they  have already fulfilled. The Americans oppose the lifting of the  embargo because of their overall interests in the region. But  such countries as Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, and even Hungary  started to give positive signs in this respect and they support  the lifting of the embargo. The same can be said about big  countries such as Russia, China, India, Brazil, Ukraine,  Belarus, and among the members of the European Union Italy and  Spain have become more flexible. Sanctions are a factor that  directly influences the continuation of the war and might lead  to a rapid destabilization in the Balkans.    [Andon] How far from or how close to a result are the Geneva  negotiations? What is the major obstacle in the path of those  negotiations?    [Jovanovic] The major obstacle is the sanctions because they  give the Muslims the illusion that they can continue the war.  However, actions of support for lifting the embargo have not  been prepared yet and the international community can still not  oppose the Islamic world, those rich Arab countries which  support Izetbegovic's [Alija, president of Bosnia's Presidency]  blackmail. Through him, they aim at the establishment of a  unitary Muslim Bosnia in the center of Europe.    [Andon] You held talks in Bucharest with your Romanian  counterpart Teodor Melescanu about the relations of the two  countries with other countries in this area, namely with  Albania, Bulgaria, and Hungary. In concrete terms, what are the  results and the conclusions of those talks?    [Jovanovic] We agreed that we have to renew inter-Balkan  cooperation, as part of the process of European integration.  Certainly, it is still too early to talk about precise terms.  First we have to be out of the woods and then cry "halloo."    [Andon] What role have the relations with Romania played in  the context of Yugoslavia's quasi isolation?    [Jovanovic] They have played the role that derives mostly  from the reality that the two countries have never had conflicts  throughout their history. Thus, Romania and Greece made  possible that this monstrous wish to isolate Yugoslavia  completely has never been achieved, and this helped other  countries as well to adopt a more independent view regarding  relations with Yugoslavia. We have had scores of political  contacts and visits. First of all with Romania and Greece but  also with countries that are situated farther, such as India and  China.    [Andon] Have you received signs from any country that, after  the lift of embargo, they would like to have economic  cooperation with Yugoslavia?    [Jovanovic] Yes, from several countries. As a matter of  fact, even now businessmen from Germany and France, that is,  countries that have a very tough stand toward Yugoslavia, sell  goods to us. Others are afraid that they may lose the market.  Currently we are preparing bilateral economic accords -- the  type we have with Romania -- also with Ukraine, India, Russia,  Greece, Bulgaria, and probably with Hungary as well. Many  countries feel that sanctions will not last long and they want  to return to the Yugoslav market.</p>

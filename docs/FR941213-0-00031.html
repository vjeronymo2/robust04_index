			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Within sixty days of notification by EPA <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that the Missoula CO nonattainment area has failed to attain the CO NAAQS, the MCCHD will implement the contingency measure, Rule 1428(5)(d), immediately. This portion of the Missoula Solid Fuel Burning Devices regulations states that Rule 1428 (5)(a) and (7)(d) will be modified to delete Class I and Dealer Demonstrated permitted devices, and Rule 1428(5)(c) is void. In other words, if the area has failed to attain the CO NAAQS, then the exemption for burning during an air pollution alert for permitted Class I and dealer demonstrated woodburning devices will not be allowed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The actual wording of Missoula's CO contingency measure regulation is ``[w]ithin sixty (60) days of notification by the MDHES and the U.S. EPA *&blank;*&blank;*'' However, in a November 3, 1994 letter from Jeffrey T. Chaffee, MDHES, to Douglas M. Skie, EPA, the State indicated that the word ``and'' is not intended to imply that EPA cannot make an independent finding of Missoula's failure to attain the standard. Therefore, EPA is approving this regulation based on the expectation that all actions needed to effect full implementation of the contingency measure will occur within 60 days after EPA notifies the State of Missoula's failure to attain the CO standard,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> the State need not provide notification as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Effectiveness of the Contingency Measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Re-entrained Road Dust Contingency Measure for PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the re-entrained road dust contingency measure is implemented, the control efficiency of the re-entrained road dust measures will be 76% in the 24-hour attainment demonstration (an increase of 14% over the control efficiency of the re-entrained road dust measures in the original SIP attainment demonstration). This calculation takes into account the expanded area for using washed sand, the existing areas for using washed sand and liquid de-icer, and the existing street sweeping measures (see the TSD for the Missoula PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP for further details on the existing re-entrained road dust strategies). Total reduction from the contingency measure is calculated to be 4073 pounds of PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  per day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Residential Woodburning Contingency Measure for PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since no credit was taken for the residential woodburning measures in the original SIP attainment demonstration, control efficiency from the residential woodburning contingency measure increases in the 24-hour attainment demonstration. See the TSD for the Missoula PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP for further details on the existing residential woodburning strategies (available at the EPA Region VIII address listed at the beginning of this notice). Total reduction from the contingency measure would be 12.6 pounds of PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  per day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes this contingency measure is adequate for several reasons. First, the existing Missoula solid fuel burning device regulation (Rule 1428) is already a very stringent mandatory curtailment program. Any further emissions reductions through this program are very difficult to achieve. Second, the emissions inventory for the Missoula area indicates that re-entrained road dust contributes a somewhat higher portion of the PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions than residential woodburning. Therefore, the analysis necessary for the contingency measure selection process most likely will indicate that residential woodburning is not the major contributing source to Missoula's failure to attain the PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NAAQS or make RFP, and that the re-entrained road dust contingency measure should be implemented instead of the woodburning measure. Finally, the control measures implemented in the PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP achieve more emissions reductions than needed to demonstrate attainment of the PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 10 NAAQS, as indicated by the State's predicted 24-hour attainment concentration of 143.8  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> g/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (see 58 FR 48341&hyph;48342, 59 FR 2538, and the related TSD). Since the 24-hour PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NAAQS is 150  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> g/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , this established safety margin further supports the reasonableness of the contingency measure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Residential Woodburning Contingency Measure for CO  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With the implementation of the residential woodburning contingency measure, Class I devices will not be allowed to burn during an alert. Assuming a conservative 60% compliance rate, 7,915 pounds of CO per day will be reduced. Since the estimated one-year growth of vehicle miles travelled (VMT) is 1%, and the CO emissions inventory report has determined that 140,786 pounds of CO per day are emitted from automobiles, approximately 1,409 pounds of CO per day are needed for a sufficient amount of reduction from the contingency measure. Therefore, emissions reductions are adequately met with the implementation of this contingency measure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Early Implementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subchapter 3, Contingency Measure Selection Process, of the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program's Chapter IX_Regulations, Standards, &amp; Permits_sets out its early implementation policy as follows. For either the PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or CO contingency measures, early implementation of the measures will not result in the requirement to implement additional moderate area contingency measures if the area fails to attain the NAAQS or make reasonable further progress in reducing emissions. However, if Missoula is reclassified to a serious nonattainment area, additional planning requirements, including, but not limited to, serious area contingency measures, would be necessary. (See 59 FR 41998, August 16, 1994.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP Commitments and Variance Provision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In a letter dated August 20, 1991, the Governor of Montana submitted to EPA the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program as a revision to the Montana SIP. EPA's review identified numerous deficiencies, including inconsistencies with the State regulations, as well as deficiencies similar to those EPA identified in the State regulations. In a December 4, 1991 letter from the EPA Region VIII Administrator to the Governor of Montana, the deficiencies in the Missoula regulations were outlined in detail (this letter is available for public inspection at the EPA Region VIII address listed at the beginning of this notice). The problem areas included rules involving emergency procedures, permitting, open burning, wood-waste burners, National standards of performance for new stationary sources (NSPS), National emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAPs), and variances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, May 10 (AFP)--Southern Yemeni air force jets  attacked rival army positions north of Aden on Tuesday [10 May],  witnesses in the area said.    The witnesses, contacted by telephone did not give details  of  casualties or damage in the raids in the Ta'izz region, some 150  kilometres (93 miles) northwest of the key southern stronghold  of Aden.    Southern officials said their troops had pushed back an  offensive on the port city, formerly the capital of South Yemen.    On Monday a northern military spokesman in Sanaa said  southern units were in retreat toward Aden, and troops loyal to  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih had reached Darb al-'Amr, just  five kilometres (three miles) from the city, having broken  through the last southern defences.    But Aden residents said the city was calm with no sign of  battle on the outskirts.    A resident of Sanaa meanwhile said families were leaving the  capital in large numbers, bound for villages or the mountains.    Southern forces fired two Scud missiles at Sanaa Monday.</p>

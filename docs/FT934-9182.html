			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: China reduces tariffs on wool CHINA has agreed to reduce tariffs on wool tops to 15 per cent, following strong representation by Australian officials, including the Prime Minister Paul Keating. Agreement on the 5 per cent tariff reduction emerged from a meeting in Beijing this week between Australian and Chinese trade officials. They were reviewing ways in which the two countries could harmonise their trading relationship. Officials were unable to give an estimate of the value to the Australian wool industry of the tariff reduction, but they said the decision marked a step towards a further lowering of import duties on textiles fibres, yarns and fabrics. Australian wool exports to China in 1991-92, predominantly greasy wool, were worth ADollars 429m (Dollars 276.7m). Sales have slumped in the past 6 months partly because of a credit squeeze imposed by the Chinese government, and also because of a sharp depreciation of the local currency. China's decision to begin modest steps towards lowering tariffs on wool followed discussions in Beijing in June between Mr Keating and China's powerful vice-premier in charge of the economy, Mr Zhu Rongji. Mr Keating said Mr Zhu had assured him that China was prepared to take a serious look at removing tariffs and quotas on wool with a view to assisting the wool industry in both countries. Chinese tariffs on Australian wool are among the highest in Asia.</p>

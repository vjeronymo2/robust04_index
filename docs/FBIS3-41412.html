			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Feb 18, BNS -- The number of registered  drug addicts in Lithuania is 495, but police officials suppose  that the actual figure is at least 10 times as big.    The most widespread narcotics in Lithuania are drugs made of  poppy.    Last year, the police confiscated 963 kilograms of ground  poppy heads but only 4.5 grams of marijuana and 1.7 grams of  hashish. These figures do not reflect the actual situation in  Lithuania either, experts say.    Drug smugglers are detained by Lithuanian border officials  on  extremely rare occasions. The police catches drug peddlers only  during special operations.    41 citizens of Russia, 10 Azerbaijanians, 6 Ukrainians, 4  Georgians and 4 Uzbeks were caught attempting to sell drugs in  Lithuania last year. The RESPUBLIKA newspaper said citizens of  Great Britain and Denmark were detained for attempting to  smuggle drugs.    Opium has become a quite frequent narcotic in Lithuania  lately. Police officials suppose that pure opium started coming  in quite recently. As a rule, opium is delivered from  Uzbekistan through Belarusian territory. Lithuanian authorities  confiscated 633 grams of pure opium last year and already a  kilogram this year.    According to police reports, at least 10 criminal gangs  produced and distributed drugs in Lithuania until recently.  Part of these gangs were eliminated with the application of the  law on preventive detention.</p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Tapping a precious resource - Irrigation is taking well over half Israel's water Israel is one of the most crowded countries in the world. Even without the possible repatriation of some of its citizens from the occupied territories, from which it may have to withdraw to complete the peace process, the bulk of its population north of the Negev Desert, is more concentrated than that of either Holland or Belgium. Together with the hot climate and a shortage of rivers and freshwater lakes this means that water is the country's most precious resource. Moreover, the population is forecast to increase greatly over the next 40 to 50 years and the provision of water for both domestic use and industry, particularly agriculture, is already concentrating the minds of the Israeli government and its advisers. A study published for the World Bank a few weeks ago by Dr Avishay Braverman, president of the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Beer Sheeba, with others, spelled out the scale of the potential problem. 'Israel's population,' says the report, 'is expected to increase from 4.9m in 1990 to 7.7m in 2010 and 12.1m in 2040.' This will be as a result of continuing immigration of Jews from around the world and from the children born to those already in the country. In addition, the report continues 'the Arab population in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip is expected to increase from 1.6m in 1990 to 3.2m in 2010 and 6.3m in 2040'. For the purposes of the study, the authors considered the water needs of the entire area together. Furthermore they assumed and advocated that consumption of water, at present much lower in Arab areas, would, over the period, rise to around the same level per capita as that used by Israelis. In short, plans must be made to supply water to between 18m and 19m people who will be living in an area where existing water resources are already stretched by the current population of only 6.5m. The implications for farmers and growers are immense because they use well over half the available water to irrigate their crops. Indeed agriculture was at first seen as the main problem that would hasten the water crisis. Politicians, who once treated farmers as the most important people in Israeli society as they established idealistic co-operatives to produce food, began to question whether they could still afford them. As one insider told me 'once agriculture was a sacred cow; all at once it was just a cow'. The value of the agricultural industry's extensive exports, of horticultural products in particular, to premium western markets began to be questioned when the real costs, including those for subsidised water, were calculated. The era of free trade around the world had arrived and perhaps it would be better business to import some more food rather than keep up the flow of exports - especially if this would release water supplies for urban development. That opinion is still expressed by some of the influential elite close to the government. But Dr Braverman and his group do not see it that way at all. 'Agriculture should not be seen as part of the problem but as part of the solution,' he told me last week. And he went on to explain how sewage from the ever-expanding urban population would itself soon create a major problem if it were not dealt with adequately. His proposed solution was to part-treat sewage to the point where the liquor could be applied to crops as irrigation, thereby saving limited sweet water for drinking. The material could be pumped all around the country, as is sweet water from the Sea of Galilee already, and farmers could use it on their crops. I was taken to see a pilot plant and a farm using waste water and it seemed to work. Farmers using the treated sewage water were experiencing no particular problems provided they did not apply it to sensitive crops that could not tolerate it. The concept already seems to be generally acceptable to Israeli agriculturalists. As the waste water filters through the soil it is purified before it reaches underground aquifers. Indeed if such measures were not taken, Dr Braverman forecasts, untreated sewage, at present stored in lagoons, would soon percolate the soil beneath them and pollute drinking water reserves. Dr Braverman admitted, however, that on its own this would still not solve the entire problem. Sewage waste water would, according to his calculations, supply less than half the irrigation requirement in 2040. Also, to satisfy the urban demand and the balance needed for agriculture, it would be necessary to desalinate sea water from the Mediterranean. He was confident that this could already be done at a running cost of USDollars 1.10 a cubic metre of water and that as technology improved the figure could be cut to no more than 70 cents a cu m, which he considered entirely acceptable. There remained, of course, the matter of the capital cost. To deal with the sewage it was estimated that an investment of Dollars 3bn would be required; and to desalinate sufficient drinking water a further Dollars 3.3bn. It was clearly hoped the World Bank would provide at least part of the money. But Dr Braverman pointed out that defence spending in recent years had been Dollars 250bn. 'Therefore the proposal is viable and affordable - especially now we are on the brink of peace with our neighbours.'</p>

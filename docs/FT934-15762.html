			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Markets: Life after Taurus for shareholders - Serious Money AFTER the Taurus fiasco in March, when the stock exchange abandoned its plans for a computerised trading system, the Bank of England set up a task force to produce new proposals. It suggested a 10-day rolling system to replace the present two-week account, with the aim of reducing the settlement period further to five days. A new electronic system, known as Crest, would be set up eventually to allow 'paperless' trading so that share certificates and stock transfer forms would not need to be passed between broker and client. The exchange, which has kept a low profile after the Taurus embarrassment, announced this week that it would adapt its existing Talisman settlements system to the 10-day rolling period from July 18 next year. What will the change mean for private shareholders? At the moment, they have two weeks - sometimes longer - to settle accounts. They are also able to pay only the net amount at the end of the account. If, for example, you were to buy shares today for Pounds 500 and sell others in a few days for Pounds 400, you would only have to pay out Pounds 100 (excluding costs) at the end of the account period. Under the rolling system, if you were to buy the shares today you would have to pay out Pounds 500 10 days after the day you bought them. There is also an effect on the delivery of shares. If you sell shares and buy them back during an account period, you do not have to deliver them. But with a rolling settlement system, you would have to deliver the shares. The effect of this on 'bed-and-breakfasting' shares for capital gains tax purposes, is not yet clear. John Cobb, a member of the Bank of England task force and chairman of the Association of Private Client Investment Managers and Stockbrokers, says that since the system has the flexibility of allowing for different settlement dates, it should be possible to co-ordinate sale and repurchase of shares for settlement on one day. Whether the Inland Revenue will view this with favour is another matter. Many argue that rolling settlement will be more efficient and less risky than the present system. London's two-week settlement period is far longer than that of other main markets and regulators have been concerned that if either buyer or seller fails to deliver, other market participants with unsettled trades could face large losses. Those who are selling will benefit from rolling settlement most since they will receive their money more quickly than at present. What is more problematic is the envisaged move towards five-day rolling settlement. This will not give enough time for a shareholder to get his contract note from the broker, send him a cheque and have the cheque cleared. This system only becomes workable if private investors place their stock in the nominee name of their broker or have a deposit account with him. At the moment it appears that brokers will need to use a pooled nominee. However, many shareholders dislike the pooled nominee system because they are deprived of many of their rights. Unlike a designated nominee account, where the shares are registered jointly in the name of the nominee company and the shareholder, in a pooled nominee, the stock is not registered in the shareholder's name. He does not receive direct communication from the company and so forgoes the company's annual report and meeting and direct information on rights issues. Most brokers charge the shareholder a fee for being in a nominee and they will also charge for handling a cash account. Fortunately, investors will not be obliged to go down this route (unlike Taurus, where they were not given the choice) but they will end up paying more for the privilege of eschewing paperless transactions. It would be welcome if the Bank of England could implement measures by which private shareholders would be able to retain their shareholder rights while benefitting from the lower costs and greater efficiency which the new system is said to introduce. Preserving and refining the designated nominee system is one suggestion. Otherwise there will be considerable, and understandable, private shareholder resistence to the new system. The rebuke to North of England building society this week by the Securities and Investments Board, the chief regulator for the financial services industry, is yet another reminder of how poorly regulated the industry is. The building society's independent financial advisers encouraged employees to leave company pension schemes and buy personal pensions. They sold with-profits bonds to people who did not understand the surrender penalties. Although most banks and building societies are regulated by the SIB, this is only the first time that it has publicly criticised a company which it regulates. Unlike the self-regulating organisations, it does not have the power to impose a fine although North of England says it will pay compensation to those involved. If the proposed self-regulating body, the Personal Investment Authority, is to be credible, it should at least ensure that all those in financial services operate under the same regime.

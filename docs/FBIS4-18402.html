			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Berlin N-TV in German at 1810 GMT on 4  April carries the first edition of a new daily program called  "Newspunkt," introduced by N-TV editor in chief Hans-Peter.    In the studio, Staisch reviews the historical background and  at 1820 GMT broadcasts a prerecorded interview with Foreign  Minister Klaus Kinkel. Staisch's first question concerns why  Europe is hardly involved in the peace efforts.    Kinkel responds: "I do not think that with regard to the  Middle East peace process one can say that we are completely out  of the picture. On the contrary, within the framework of the  European Union [EU] we have done all we can politically, but  also, very important, economically, for the region. We have  supported the peace process. For example, we have tried to call  upon those who still oppose this peace process to join in and to  give up their resistance. And we have done everything possible  within the framework of the multilateral opportunities to help,  and that is not a little."    Staisch asks: "To what extent is our overheated domestic  situation, with regard to antiforeigner feeling, to new  escalations against the Jews -- I am thinking here about the  debate, one can hardly call it a debate, the slandering of  Ignatz Bubis [chairman of the Jewish Community in Germany]. To  what extent is this domestic situation a brake on our  effectiveness in becoming involved in this peace process?"    Kinkel replies: "I am very glad that this awful event in  Luebeck [the firebombing of the synagogue] was received  relatively calmly in Israel. But of course the violence from  the extreme Right here is something which burdens our foreign  policy as a whole. I always try to put it as simply as this:  Moelln and Solingen [scenes of earlier antiforeigner attacks]  have not been forgotten, not by any means. And of course the  attack on the synagogue in Luebeck gives the whole matter  another negative, unpleasant [word indistinct].    ``In my talks at home and abroad, my partners raise this  topic again and again and it is very difficult to explain how  such a thing can happen in Germany again.''    Regarding the deadline for the agreement reached on Maundy  Thursday 13 April, about nine days away, Staisch asks Kinkel  whether he is "optimistic" that on 13 April this peace process  will get a huge boost.    Kinkel says: "Well I hope that what was agreed on Maundy  Thursday will actually be put into practice. I think it is  necessary. After the awful events in Hebron it looked for a  long time as if the process had come to a standstill. The week  before last I had a long talk here with the Syrian foreign  minister. I talked to other colleagues about it; we had a full  discussion of the topic last weekend at our European Union  meeting in Greece, and we thought about how we could help. I am  glad that the talks have been resumed and we must trust that,  above all, American influence, which is the most important in  this Middle East peace process, helps to ensure that there is  decisive progress."    Staisch's final question: "It looks as if the interests of  the Israelis and the Palestinians now coincide more than they  have ever done before. The Israelis want out of the  Gaza-Jericho power vacuum. They do not want to push escalation  any further, they want to withdraw from it, and the Palestinians  want to take on responsibility very quickly. Ideal conditions  for a final agreement. Do you share this assessment, which is  made by many observers?"    Kinkel: "Basically, that is how it should be, but the  Israelis have of course quite considerable security interests.  That applies particularly to the situation vis-a-vis Syria.  The Palestinians, on the other hand, would of course like to  take on as soon as possible responsibilities of their own in  Jericho and the Gaza Strip. Basically, the interests are the  same, but there has been too much in the past for things to go  very quickly now. We hope -- and I think it's a realistic hope  now -- that things will progress. We should continue to try to  help 'Arafat, above all now directly in Jericho and the Gaza  Strip, because he needs support there. The people who believe  in him, put their hopes in him, who must also agree to the  political line he takes, must see successes for themselves.  They must be able to say, yes this peace process brings us  something personally. If that is not the case we will endanger  'Arafat's position, which cannot be in our interests.    ``Thus, what is important again is a rational stance on both  sides. We have no direct opportunities to exert influence, but  nor do the other European countries have a direct involvement.  It is essentially the Americans' affair. Previously, the  Russians were far more heavily involved in the region, but those  times are past. Now it's very much up to the Americans, and we  must ensure that by means of bilateral, multilateral, and  economic aid we show above all that we are committed.''</p>

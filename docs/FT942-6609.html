			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Oslo proposes date for EU vote Norway's government proposed November 28 as the date of a referendum on European Union membership yesterday, allowing sceptical Norwegians to decide after Nordic neighbours Finland and Sweden. The proposal is likely to win support in parliament, which formally fixes the date. Sweden is to hold its referendum on November 13 and Finland probably on October 16. Austria, the fourth country aiming to join from January 1, will hold its vote on June 12.</p>

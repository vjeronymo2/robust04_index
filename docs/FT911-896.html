			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / De Klerk and Mandela discuss ANC demands MR F W de Klerk, the South African president, and Mr Nelson Mandela, deputy president of the African National Congress (ANC), met for five hours yesterday in a final attempt to avert the threatened breakdown of talks on a post-apartheid constitution. Later Mr de Klerk said: 'We have reached the stage where we are close to solving the outstanding problems, which would result in real negotiations beginning.' Discussions would continue today, he added. The ANC has said it will suspend talks from today unless the government meets its demands on ending the township violence which has left more than 1,500 people dead in the Johannesburg area since last August. Neither side released details of the talks, which took place in Pretoria. Both made important concessions in the days leading up to today's deadline; but the issue of violence, which has severely damaged the ANC's support in black communities, is an emotive one and neither side will be keen to appear to back down. The gap between the two sides on the issue of violence has narrowed considerably since the ANC issued an ultimatum last month, calling for a ban on carrying weapons in public, disbanding counter-insurgency units, abolition of hostels, disciplining of policemen involved in killings, curbs on police crowd control methods, setting up a public inquiry into violence and the sacking of the ministers of defence and law and order. On Tuesday Mr de Klerk appeared to gain concessions from Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Zulu Inkatha Party, on the issue after summoning him to Cape Town.</p>

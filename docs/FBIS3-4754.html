The booklet says in the preface:    In the theses his excellency President Kim Il-song fully  indicated the essential contents of the socialist rural  question, the basic principles of its solution, the tasks for  socialist rural construction and ways for their fulfilment.    Under his wise leadership, the three revolutions,  ideological, technical and cultural, have been carried on  vigorously in the countryside of the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea over the past three decades to register proud  achievements in socialist construction.    The DPRK has completed electrification and irrigation in the  countryside and lifted comprehensive mechanization and extensive  use of chemicals to a high stage, turning the countryside into  an earthly paradise of the people.    The all India Indo-Korean Friendship Association, too,  published the work in booklet.    In the preface it writes that though 30 years have passed  since its publication, the work still serves as the guideline  for many leaders and revolutionaries of the world in the efforts  for the ultimate solution to the socialist rural question.</p>

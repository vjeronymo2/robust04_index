			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / International Company News: Derivative losses cost Dell Dollars 15m Dell Computer has announced an after-tax loss of Dollars 15.6m after misjudging the trend of European and Japanese interest rates. It joins a list of US companies which have reported losses on derivative instruments in recent weeks. Dell believed that medium-term European and Japanese bond yields would fall, reflecting the pressure on economies in those countries, at a time when US interest rates were rising. In the event, bond yields around the world jumped as the US Treasury ratchetted up short-term interest rates. 'We anticipated the US rate movement - we had that spot on. What we didn't anticipate is what that would mean to other finance ministries around the world,' said Mr Tom Meredith, chief financial officer. The losses were incurred in the company's investment portfolio, which at the end of last year was valued at Dollars 313m. Dell used derivative instruments to boost its returns from these investments. According to Mr Meredith, such instruments have added more than Dollars 10m to investment income in the past three years. Dell's investment strategy involved it writing (or selling) options and swaptions (options which give the buyer the right to enter a swap agreement in the future), said Mr Meredith. Writing options in this way is generally considered a high-risk exercise for a non-financial company, since the potential losses are difficult to hedge. The company said it had closed more than half of the derivatives positions in its investment portfolio, and planned to close the rest by the end of its third quarter, at the beginning of November. 'We have decided to discontinue this level of exposure, and we do not intend to engage in derivatives for investment purposes in the future,' Mr Michael Dell, chairman and chief executive, said. Dell also announced an unrelated Dollars 10.7m loss on its investment portfolio linked to a change in accounting practice. The losses reduced the company's net income in the three months to May 1 to Dollars 18.9m, compared with Dollars 10.2m a year before.</p>

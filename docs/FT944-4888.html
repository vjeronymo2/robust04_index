			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Recs weaken Several regional electricity stocks (recs) fell back sharply after Kleinwort Benson downgraded the sector. The securities house changed its recommendation from a buy to a hold on the sector as a whole, although its analysts declined to comment on reasons for the move. Electricity shares had moved sharply ahead in recent sessions after last week's Budget made no mention of plans to impose a windfall tax on proceeds from the sale of the National Grid, owned by the 12 generators. Sentiment in the sector yesterday was hit further by renewed nervousness about the outcome of today's VAT on domestic fuel debate in parliament and fears of a rise in interest rates in the near term. The day's slide included East Midlands, which surrendered 12 at 751p, Manweb, 10 lower at 794p, Midlands, 3 easier at 780p, and London, which receded 9 to 693p. However, Kleinwort Benson continues to favour some stocks in the sector, such as National Power. It urged investors to buy the stock, saying: 'Significant cost control continues to drive profits growth, while an international portfolio of projects is gradually being assembled.' National Power shares finished 5 ahead at 502p. The long awaited restructuring package at its Mercury unit left Cable and Wireless 4 3/4 better at 378p ex-dividend, with most analysts reading positive management into the group's announcement of a 22 per cent workforce reduction. Immediate adjustments to C&amp;W's earnings were minimal, although the consensus view was that the group was taking a firm bite of the bullet and that as a result the shares' confidence factor had moved up several useful points. C&amp;W trading volume was modest at 2.6m shares, with most of the telecoms action reserved for Vodafone, which put on a penny at 199 1/2 p in 8.7m turnover. Diversified industrial issue Tomkins barely flickered in response to what analysts saw as a sweeping boardroom reshuffle, firming a penny to 216p in nominal 2.2m turnover. The mooted response reflected investors' difficulties in gauging management changes, although most commentators felt that a certain amount of unease had begun to creep into stock market thinking. By contrast, BTR was again actively traded, improving 1 1/2 to 277p in 8.4m turnover. There was also heavy dealing in BTR stock options, with nearly 4,000 lots dealt. Bank shares stayed in confident mood, rising across the board as speculation on the timing of the next round of base rate rises appeared to focus on January. Barclays moved forward 5 to 604p, while Lloyds, up 2 at 555p in 5.7m volume, was the most actively dealt share in the banking stocks. Sector watchers have begun to peer forward to the next results round (TSB's preliminary figures are due early in the new year) and - more significantly  -to calculate the point at which interest rate rises actually begin to work against banking margins. Investment bank BZW feels that bad debts could start to pile up for the industry once base rates work their way back up to 7 per cent, using recent US experience as a guide. Among motor distributors, Inchcape advanced 11 to 442p following a buy recommendation from Smith New Court and a Pounds 30m disposal of two vehicle hire operations. Lex Service was a contrasting feature, sliding 14 to 307p in 3.2m turnover, with a 1.2m line of shares changing hands at 307p. The 27.8 per cent increase in half-year profits from brewing group Scottish &amp; Newcastle cheered the market, leaving the shares 6 ahead at 503p. Demand for Grand Metropolitan, which reported figures last week, continued yesterday and the stock gained a further 8 at 389p in trade of 5.7m, with the market said to be only now appreciating the cash generation qualities of the group. Freight specialist NFC dipped 3 to 162p ahead of today's prelims - and the possible announcement of a new chief executive - but it was the turnover in the shares that caught the eye, rising to 10m with a 3.5m block passing through the market at 162p. Elsewhere in the transport sector, British Airways firmed 2 to 369p, helped by better than expected traffic figures for November which showed a 7.3 per cent gain. Bus operator Stagecoach, floated last year at 112p, was steady at 215p in advance of today's interims. Food manufacturing group Hazlewood receded 6 to 110p in nervous trading ahead of today's first-half figures. One analyst said simply: 'I think it will be a bad set of results, and what is more I think the statement from the company will be cautious.' Buoyant ice cream sales, courtesy of unseasonally mild European weather, were said to have been behind an advance in Unilever of 17 to 1124p. Engineering shares were mixed, with GKN a notable casualty, slipping 8 to 613p in modest 1.8m turnover. Siebe added 8 at 553p ahead of today's interims and amid hopes for an increase of at least 10 per cent in the half-time dividend. T&amp;N showed signs of approaching a bottom after the recent rights issue-led fall-out, clawing back 6 at 165p. The prospects of strong sales of the recently released new Beatles record were reported to have been behind positive sentiment in Thorn EMI shares, which improved 14 to 1009p.</p>

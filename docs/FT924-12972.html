			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Gardening: Plant of the Week - Rosa moyesii This is one of the finest roses to grow for fruits or hips, which are long, flask-shaped and shining red. It is one of the wild roses of China and several variations of it exist. Probably the best for garden planting is called Geranium but the single flowers of this have not got the magnificent blood red of the wild plant; instead they are geranium red. The stems are stout, heavily armed with thorns and can grow 10 ft high but can be kept lower by pruning. The variety geranium is about half this height. All kinds are completely hardy, will grow in any fertile soil and need little pruning beyond removal of damaged, diseased or worn out stems in winter.</p>

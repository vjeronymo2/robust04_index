It also means how a person lives his life. One year  after his release from Huaiji Prison near Guangzhou, Mr Wang is  still trying to pick up the pieces he left behind when he was  locked away 13 years ago for urging greater political freedom.    But to the authorities, the 45-year-old Marxist philosopher  is still a target of surveillance, a dangerous person who has to  be watched. To them, Mr Wang is also a criminal. Repeated  appeals to clear his name have proven futile and he is still  required to report to his neighbourhood police station every  Friday and cannot travel outside Guangzhou without special  permission. Contacts with foreigners are still a taboo. Not  only is he prohibited from speaking to foreign reporters, he has  also been warned that he should not write articles for foreign  magazines.    Because of his criminal record, he cannot take part in any  elections or run his own business like everybody does. Although  nominally the boss of a jewellery shop in Guangzhou, the company  is registered in other person's name. Even meetings with  friends can be a problem, as he can only write to them, and even  clients who met with him are often questioned by the police.    The pressure from authorities notwithstanding, Mr Wang has  shown no signs of repentance. "If the time does not permit me  to be a political activist now, then I will do what everybody  does. I go into business," Mr Wang said. "It doesn't mean I  have given up. Instead, I want to prove that we--democracy  activists--are not only good at politics but we can also run a  successful business," he said.    The jewellery business, he said, is his bridge to a  modernised China. "I have been locked away for so many years.  I have lost touch with the people ... Since everyone is now in  business, I feel it is only right that I follow the trend of the  society and join the business world.    "I may spend one year in this business. If I am successful,  then I may open a bookstore and I plan to write a book on the  democracy movement in Guangzhou if the conditions permits," he  added.    However, Mr Wang admitted that he might not share the same  view with other political activists who believe that they should  play a more active role in the democracy movement. "I may not  agree with everything they say. But we can disagree," he said.  "I don't think we (activists in the 70s) are up to anything  now. But one thing for sure, we are not going to disappear  though," he added.    But not everyone is as lucky and optimistic as he is.  According to Mr Wang, many activists are having difficulties in  finding jobs and the authorities have never stopped their  harassment of these people.</p>

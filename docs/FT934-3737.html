			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Lloyd's Names set to reject Pounds 900m compensation offer Lloyd's of London yesterday offered loss-making Names compensation of Pounds 900m in an effort to stave off years of crippling legal action triggered by heavy underwriting losses over the past five years. Early indications were that many of the worst-affected Names, the individuals who have traditionally provided the market's capital base, were likely to push ahead with litigation. 'We have stretched the society's resources as far as we could. This really is the maximum the society can afford at this time in its history,' explained Mr Peter Middleton, Lloyd's chief executive. 'The council believes that the offer is fair and equitable and affords real advantages when compared with the alternative,' said Mr David Rowland, chairman. Acceptance now would produce certainty about the amount Names would receive for claims against the uncertain outcome of legal proceedings, he added. Mr Christopher Stockwell, chairman of the Lloyd's Names Associations Working Party, said: 'This is an inadequate offer and we are not prepared to accept it.' The working party is an umbrella group linking 17,000 Names in 38 separate action groups. Names are claiming more than Pounds 3bn in damages, mainly in legal action against their agents. Leaders of individual action groups stopped short of condemning the deal outright but there seems little hope of their recommending it to members. Lloyd's aims to fund the deal with contributions of an estimated Pounds 400m from errors and omissions insurers, which cover agents against legal awards for negligence, and Pounds 50m in voluntary contributions from members' agents, which channel Names on to syndicates. The insurance market's authorities will supplement this with about Pounds 450m from its central fund, which pays claims when Names are unable to meet their obligations. Names will receive individual offers, with compensation amounts reflecting the likelihood of success of legal actions as well as a series of other factors. Names on catastrophe reinsurance syndicates, which were hard-hit by a series of disasters in the 1980s, have been offered the most favourable terms, with most offers between 30p and 40p for every pound of claims. However, Names on syndicates that specialised in liability business and lost heavily as a result of asbestosis and pollution awards fare less well, with offers limited to less than 10p in the pound in many cases. Mr Middleton said the total available to meet all awards which might be made 'would still fall short of the total value of all claims planned or contemplated by action groups'. Names' leaders argue that errors and omissions insurers should have contributed more to the deal. Names have until January 31 to decide on the deal. If they accept, they will receive special credits, to be offset against Lloyd's debts or solvency requirements. Lloyd's tough task Page 10 Editorial Comment Page 23 Sturge profit drops Page 29</p>

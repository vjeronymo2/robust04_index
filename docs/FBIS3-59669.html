			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] On 25 August, the Agency of Industrial Science and  Technology (AIST) of the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry (MITI) completed the description of next year's  position for the Industrial Science and Technology Research and  Development Program in the Industrial Technology Council (an  advisory organ appointed by the Minister of MITI). In pioneering  research where preparatory research for projects and  pre-evaluation are performed, five new research problems will be  undertaken next year, beginning with precise polymeric  materials. Of the five pioneering research currently underway,  inorganic materials with high-order structure control will be  elevated to a project next year. The budget for next year  received as 6.2&percnt; increase over the budget for fiscal year  1993  for the whole system to &yen;25.9 billion. A 63.4&percnt;  increase of  about &yen;400 million is planned for pioneering research.    The Industrial Science and Technology Research and  Development Program established this year is integrated into the  older Large Scale R&amp;D Program. The pioneering research  program  is set up with the objective of determining which program should  become a project. Pioneering research will last two to three  years with an annual budget of &yen;4 or 5 billion for one theme.    Pioneering research programs which will begin next year are  (1) Precise Polymeric Materials, (2) Accelerated Bio Functions  Fabrication Technology (time machine bio), (3) Human Media and  Expert Machine Technology (tentative name), (4) Next Generation  Metal Resource Production Technology, and (5) Manufactured Goods  Evaluation and High-Level Measurement Analysis Technology.    In the Precise Polymeric Materials research, polymer methods  which precisely control the one-dimensional structure of  polymers and techniques to accurately analyze the structure of  polymer sequence will be investigated and developed. The  essential performance and function of current polymers cannot be  understood by perturbing the chemical structure. The intent of  this research is to solve these shortcomings. A basic technology  of polymer materials for the next generation is expected.    Accelerated Bio Function Fabrication Technology has the  objectives of clarifying the mechanisms of the evolution of  living things and building evolutionary test system with  artificial mutations at the laboratory level. Based on this, it  will be possible to create biological functions for the  objectives of ultra heat resistance and ultra pressure  resistance that are applicable to chemical material  manufacturing processes.    In Next Generation Metal Resource Manufacturing Technology,  metal recycling technology which places a light load on the  environment and conserves energy by using light and bacteria  will be developed. A precision manufacturing system which  collects uniform resources and does not use smokestacks will be  developed. The aim is to effectively use resources and to  contribute solutions to the world's environmental problems.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Federal Government has warned that it would not  condone any overtly political remarks from any group or  individual in the country. The chief of general staff,  Lieutenant General Oladipo Diya, stated this in Lagos. Gen.  Diya maintained that the law would deal ruthlessly with persons  agitating for open rebellion against the government. He  therefore asked pressure groups and agitators for the  installation of any person they conceive as the winner of the  June 12 election to refrain from such acts, in the interest of  the nation. The chief of general staff reminded such political  activists and social critics that the annulled June 12 election  was now history.</p>

			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: BIS review suggests sparse credit creation THE international bond markets will have to work hard to refinance the record volumes of bonds maturing by the end of next year, suggesting that relatively little credit will be created, according to the Bank for International Settlements. In its latest review of the international financial markets, BIS reports that the scale of bonds being repaid in the first quarter of this year, at Dollars 57bn, was unprecedented. As a result, in spite of the large number of bonds being issued - only exceeded once before - the net new finance created through the bond markets was 'comparatively small'. Bond redemptions will remain large, with a further Dollars 135bn due to repay by the end of the year and a further Dollars 260bn due in 1993. About a third of the repayments relates to equity-linked instruments launched by Japanese borrowers in the late 1980s on the back of soaring stock prices. Even taking into account the high level of bond redemptions, the securities markets have still been in the unusual position of generating considerably more new credit than the international banking system. According to the BIS figures, the bond markets created a net Dollars 150bn in the year to the end of March, compared with just Dollars 55bn of net new international bank credit. This reverses the position of previous years. In the year to March 1991, for example, bond markets generated a net Dollars 143bn, while banks supplied Dollars 405bn of new credit.

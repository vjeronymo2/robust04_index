This is a good omen for the further  development of Chinese- Russian relations," PRC President Jiang  Zemin stated at the Zhongnanhai party and political residence  today during a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev, who is here on an official visit.    The leader of the PRC said that he was glad about the  meeting  with the Russian minister and cited a Chinese proverb in this  connection: "Meetings with old friends are a source of  particular joy." Jiang Zemin recalled that during the visit to  Beijing by Russian President Boris Yeltsin in December 1992, a  conversation rich in content took place between the heads of the  two states.    Andrey Kozyrev, for his part, noted that the Chinese and  Russian new years are starting with confirmation of a course  aimed at goodneighborliness and partnership, the foundations for  which were laid during the visit to Beijing by Russian President  Boris Yeltsin. Kozyrev handed to Jiang Zemin a personal message  from Boris Yeltsin containing an invitation to make an official  visit to the Russian Federation.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Forms of Iron that May be Less Toxic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As previously discussed in this document, some evidence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggests that carbonyl iron, an elemental iron powder, seems to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be effective in the prevention or treatment of iron deficiency,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and that it might be significantly less toxic than other forms of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iron commonly used in iron-containing products. The agency requested data on the acute toxicity in humans, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particularly in children, of elemental iron. FDA stated that,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if information is received that is persuasive that the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elemental iron will substantially decrease the risk of pediatric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> poisoning while allowing for effective dietary iron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplementation, it will consider exempting iron-containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products that incorporate reduced iron from any regulations that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result from this rulemaking. FDA does not have any information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding the availability of such forms of iron for use in iron-containing products. Nor does FDA possess any information that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would allow it to determine how many products would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reformulated with less toxic forms of iron in order to take  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advantage of such an exemption. FDA requests comment on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic impact of exempting products containing less toxic forms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of iron.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Consumer Education Campaign  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two of the three petitions that FDA received advocated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> educational efforts for the public and health professionals. FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agrees that the public needs to be informed of the dangers of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pediatric iron poisoning. The fact that in 7 years over 2,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> poisonings have occurred that have required some kind of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment indicates that the public is not aware of the potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for serious harm or death in young children from accidental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ingestion of iron-containing products. FDA is developing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials for a public information campaign utilizing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> channels available to the agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

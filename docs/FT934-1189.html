			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Current account deficit lowest for two years The current account deficit in the third quarter was the lowest for two years, on the back of a healthy surplus on earnings from financial services and relatively fast growth in merchandise exports. The deficit came to Pounds 1.613bn, after Pounds 2.348bn in the second quarter. Between July and September, Britain had a surplus on invisible trade - services, profits and dividends and other financial transfers - of Pounds 777m compared with Pounds 708m in the previous quarter. The invisibles surplus offset the difference between merchandise imports and exports - the visible trade gap - in the third quarter. This was a relatively low Pounds 2.39bn, after Pounds 3.056bn in the second three-monthly period. In the first nine months of the year the current account deficit came to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 6.644bn after Pounds 8.547bn in the whole of last year. In its Budget forecast last month the Treasury said the current account deficit for 1993 would be Pounds 9.5bn. The current account deficit in the third quarter was covered by a surplus on Britain's capital account, helped by record purchases of UK government gilts by overseas groups. In the third quarter Britain had a Pounds 2.974bn surplus on trade with other countries in financial services including banking and insurance, compared with a surplus of Pounds 2.543bn in the second quarter. This large excess of exports to imports in this sector of the services industry offset deficits in other services - for instance the travel trade saw a Pounds 904m deficit in the third quarter and civil aviation a deficit of Pounds 117m. Britain earned a surplus of Pounds 1.037bn on interest, profits and dividends in the third quarter, after Pounds 876m in the second quarter. There was, however, a Pounds 1.663bn deficit on general financial transfers  -also part of the invisibles account - in the latest three-monthly period after Pounds 1.166bn between April and June. Much of this deficit was due to a large net payment of Pounds 1.595bn from the UK to overseas government institutions, mainly the European Union, in the latest quarter.</p>

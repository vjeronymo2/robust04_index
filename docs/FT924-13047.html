			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Pit closure legality to be debated in courts next week THE LEGALITY of British Coal's pit closure programme will be fought out in a series of hearings to be hurried through the courts before next Friday when the corporation is due to issue its first redundancy notices to more than 5,000 mineworkers. A timetable for the hearings - which will take place alongside mounting public campaigns and a parliamentary debate on the proposed closures - was set after British Coal announced in the High Court yesterday that no redundancy notices would be issued for another week. The National Union of Mineworkers and Nacods, the pit deputies' union, which are bringing the main action against British Coal, said the announcement was 'an enormous and significant concession'. 'This means a further week will go by during which the men will still have jobs,' Mr Mark Stephens, the unions' solicitor, said after the hearing. However, British Coal denied that it had conceded any ground, insisting it had always intended to issue notices next Friday and that the pit closures would go ahead as planned. 'British Coal wishes to make it clear that the closure programme continues and that there is no legal basis to stop it,' Mr Charles Falconer QC told the court. The unions claim that British Coal has failed to comply with European and UK law and the colliery review procedure in not consulting its workforce before implementing the closures. The case will be heard in the High Court on Tuesday. Whatever the result of the hearing, it is certain to be referred to the Court of Appeal for a second judgment before Friday. In a separate case, the Union of Democratic Mineworkers won leave to seek a judicial review of British Coal's decision to close seven Nottinghamshire pits and one in Derbyshire. Mr Justice Roch ruled that the union had an arguable case on the basis that British Coal's action was allegedly unreasonable, irrational and disproportionate and that proper consultation procedures had not been followed. The UDM case will be heard after that brought by the NUM. Mr Roy Lynk, the UDM's president, yesterday continued an underground sit-in at the Silverhill colliery in Nottinghamshire in protest at the planned closures. Two Tory MPs who tried to visit him, Mr Winston Churchill and Mrs Elizabeth Peacock, were prevented from going down the mine by British Coal.</p>

			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Cuba opens new markets for sales by farmers 'Pardon our inexperience. Tomorrow, we will do it better'. The sign in one Havana marketplace summed up the first day of Cuba's latest economic reform experiment. Nearly 150 farm markets, a novelty in the state-controlled economy, opened their doors in the Caribbean island at the weekend as state farms and co-operatives, including military units, began to sell surplus meat, fruit and vegetables directly to the public. But small peasant farmers were conspicuous by their absence, a sign that they may be initially wary about whether the move will really benefit them. Shoppers gathered early at the 15 markets opened in Havana, but the avalanche of demand predicted by many observers did not immediately materialise. Farms operated by the armed forces appeared to be setting the pace at the new markets, in terms of both prices and produce offered. Cuba's armed forces, battle-hardened in overseas wars in Angola and Ethiopia, are now being increasingly used to combat the island's internal economic crisis. They have been helping to grow food for the population since last year. Mr Manuel Vila Sosa, internal trade minister, had promised that the farm markets would operate on a free market basis. Producers, after fulfilling contracted quotas to supply the state, could set their own prices for the general public, reflecting supply and demand. Sales income would be taxed. Undercutting and eliminating the black market in Cuba is a main objective of the new farm markets. Food shortages are one of the most sensitive symptoms of the four-year economic recession gripping the country. The crisis followed the collapse of Cuba's preferential trade ties with what used to be the Soviet bloc, an economic belly-blow worsened by the recent tightening by the US of its trade embargo on Cuba. The government, which for years has paid rock-bottom prices to farmers, is hoping the price incentives offered by the new markets will help to reverse the current fall in food production.</p>

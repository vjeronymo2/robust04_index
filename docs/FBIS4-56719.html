			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ricardo Bermudez, second vice presidential </F> candidate of Papa Egoro, by Lorena Castillo and Ariel Rosas at  the Papa Egoro headquarters in Panama City on 8 May -- live or  recorded]    [Text] [Castillo] The party leaders are assessing the  Electoral Tribunal results. We will talk with Bermudez, Papa  Egoro candidate for vice president. Mr. Bermudez is here with  us.    [Bermudez] The party is just as glad as it was at the  beginning. I think we did a very productive job. I wish to  mention that only close to 43 percent of the voting sites have  been accounted for. There is still nothing final. No final  conclusion can be made before we have the final election  results. It would be venturesome for any political party to  claim victory without first having the total vote count. I wish  to stress the need to remain as civically aware as we were  today. This has been an extremely pure and beautiful election.  But we should not jump to any conclusions before all of the  voting sites have been accounted for.    [Rosas] We understand that you talked with candidate Ruben  Blades, who is in the headquarters making assessments. What  does Blades think?    [Bermudez] Blades has been in touch with us during his tour  of the city. He should be arriving here any minute now to make  remarks on the party position.    [Rosas] The figures indicate it is very difficult for the  party to improve its situation. Do you think Papa Egoro will  eventually improve its position before the million vote figure  is reached?    [Bermudez] Since the beginning, Papa Egoro was a bastion of  the party. We still do not know what percentage of the figures  released represent Panama City. May I insist, however, 50  percent of the votes are still to be counted. We should not  jump to conclusions at this time.    [Rosas] Polls were conducted in the past few months among  the  several political parties. How do you correlate past polls with  the figures released by the Electoral Tribunal?    [Bermudez] May I reiterate that the Electoral Tribunal has  not yet released the final figures. Still 50 percent of the  vote must still be totaled. Regarding the national polls, it is  worth noting the movement's progressive geometrical growth in  the past one and one-half months. I am sure that, once all the  votes are tallied, the movement's position will be seen much  more clearly.</p>

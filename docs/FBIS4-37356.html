			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Security Adviser to Palestinian </F> President Tells AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: Israel Obstructing 'Arafat's  Speedy Return to Self-Rule Area"]    [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- A senior PLO official  has accused Israel of putting obstacles in the way of President  'Arafat's return to the self-rule area in a fitting manner that  preserves the national dignity of the Palestinians and their  president.    Mamduh Nawfal, security adviser to President 'Arafat, told  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT over the telephone from his residence in  Tunis: The Israelis have been notified of the date set for the  Palestinian leadership's return to the homeland. It is the end  of the month or the beginning of next month.    But the Israeli side is still refusing to respond to a  number  of Palestinian requests, first and foremost the evacuation of  the Israeli Army from the crossing points to be used by the  president's motorcade, not subjecting any of the leaders  accompanying him to inspection, and lifting the ban on the  completion of the small airfield in Jericho. The second point  concerns approving the list of the 1,000 leadership and  administration personnel making up the main bulk of the national  administration's institutions, and the president's advisers and  their offices. As for the third point representing an obstacle,  that is that Israeli leaders are refusing to open up the Gaza  and Jericho areas to the residents of the occupied West Bank to  express their happiness and celebrate the entry of their  historic leadership.    Nawfal pointed out that Israel has not changed many of the  ways in which it deals with the Palestinians, and there is a  delay in implementing the agreements concerning the release of  the other prisoners and detainees, alleviating the hardship of  residents of the other occupied towns and villages, and reducing  the Army's and settlers' close contact with local residents.    Nawfal denied Israeli reports that he has entered the Gaza  Strip to prepare a security plan for President 'Arafat's  protection during his entry into his homeland. He said: "There  are various agencies currently carrying out this task in Gaza  and Jericho. When these procedures are completed, in addition to  the removal of the Israeli obstacles I mentioned, we will all  leave Tunisian territory with the president."    On filling the six seats in the Palestinian Authority  Council, Nawfal said: "Consultations have reached their final  stages, and all the names of the council's members will be  announced 72 hours before the president's and leadership's  return to the homeland." Nawfal said that the delay in  announcing the full list of the council is not an obstacle to or  a cause of the postponement of the Palestinian leadership's  return to the self-rule area.</p>

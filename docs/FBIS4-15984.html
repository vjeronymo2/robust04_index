			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Apr 12, BNS -- The second session of a  joint commission of the European Free Trade Association [EFTA]  and Estonia on April 11 in Tallinn was informative, Foreign  Ministry Deputy Chancellor Priit Kolbre told BNS. The  participants surveyed their countries' economic situation and  cast a glance on the future.    The session underlined the importance of the free-trade  agreements Estonia has concluded with EFTA member states. The  Baltic republic's major trade partners among EFTA members are  Finland and Sweden, but contacts are maintained also with Norway  and Switzerland, Kolbre said.    The session was attended by representatives from six EFTA  member states as well as the EFTA secretariat. The trade  organization was officially represented by Ambassador Veijo  Sampovaara from the Finnish Foreign Ministry. EFTA Secretary  General Georg Reisch also attended the meeting.    The relations between EFTA and Estonia rest on a cooperation  declaration signed in 1991 in Geneva, which affirms mutual  readiness to create conditions for commercial and economic  cooperation with the eventual aim of establishing a free trade  regime.    The EFTA-Estonian joint commission first met in 1993 in  Stockholm.</p>

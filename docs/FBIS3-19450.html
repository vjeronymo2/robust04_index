			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Dogan Duyar] </F>   [Text] It has been learned that Jalal Talabani, leader of  the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK], and General Aydin Ilter,  commander of the Gendarmerie Forces, have met secretly in  Silopi. The meeting drew attention because it came in the wake  of "the meeting on election security" held in Batman to discuss  local elections in the southeast.    The PUK leader had met PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]  leader Abdullah Ocalan during his recent visit to Damascus.    The Talabani-Ilter meeting, which was confirmed by PUK  officials in Ankara, took place a week ago. The meeting was  preceded by a "summit on election security" held in Batman on 4  March with the participation of Interior Minister Nahit Mentese;  Unal Erkan, governor of the state of emergency region; Mehmet  Agar, general director of the Security; MIT [National  Intelligence Organization] undersecretary Sonmez Koksal,; Aydin  Ilter, commander of the Gendarmerie Forces; and many provincial  governors and heads of security departments. The summit made a  number of decisions in connection with the local elections.    PUK leader Talabani held a meeting with PKK leader Abdullah  Ocalan during his visit to Damascus last week made to express  condolences on the death of President Hafiz al-Asad's son.    It is not known what issues were discussed during the  meeting  in Silopi. One view is that on the eve of the local elections,  Turkey conveyed its requests to the northern Iraqi leaders on  various issues, primarily regarding border security. Another  view is that "Talabani is continuing to act as a mediator  between Apo [Abdullah Ocalan] and the Turkish Government.  Talabani briefed the soldiers about his impressions of his  Damascus visit."    There are reports that the PUK leader, who is at present is  in northern Iraq, will leave for France in the next few days.  <H5>  Dizai: I Do Not Know What Was Discussed </H5>   After reminding PUK's Ankara representative Sefin Dizai  about  the Batman summit on security during the elections, we asked if  the Turkish government had made any requests regarding the local  elections. Dizai replied: "No. The elections are Turkey's  internal problem. I hope that the people in the region will be  calm during the elections and that there will be no violence; I  advise them to do so."    Upon being reminded of the PKK's decision to boycott the  elections and the Turkish government's uneasiness over the  situation in northern Iraq and the PKK presence there, Dizai  said: " We have a responsibility to defend the security of the  borders and the region. Our fulfilling this responsibility will  not depend on the PKK or any other organization. This issue is  completely separate from the elections."    Asked if Talabani was representing the northern Iraqi  administration at the meeting with Ilter, Dizai said: " No. I  think Talabani represented his own party. I have no information  on the subjects discussed during the meeting, but border  security might have been discussed."</p>

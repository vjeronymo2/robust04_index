			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Sales pitch that fills rooms - Tim Minogue visits a hotel that found success by creating its own cricket square Encouraging parties of amateur cricketers to leave their wives and girlfriends at home for several days and stay in a hotel with a 24-hour bar sounds like a recipe for disaster. Hoteliers of a nervous disposition might imagine fragile profits shattering along with the crockery in the course of boisterous boys' nights in. In fact, concentrating on catering for amateur cricket tours proved to be the salvation of Linda Harrison and David Buck's hotel business. The couple, who both worked in marketing and conference organisation, impulsively purchased a 15-year lease on the seven-bedroom Old Vicarage Hotel at Hinton, Hampshire, for Pounds 72,000 in 1992. The business was in receivership, having lost Pounds 88,000 in the previous year. What made Buck and Harrison believe they could succeed where others had failed? Harrison, who is 43, says: 'None of the partners worked here. The restaurant had a bad reputation. There was little control over costs and the marketing was unprofessional.' Having cut costs and raised standards, Buck and Harrison played on the hotel's strengths: a quiet rural location, 10-acre garden, in the New Forest yet only a mile from the sea. Mailshots targeted potential customers. Yet, at the end of their first season, they were struggling to break even. Buck, 42, says: 'We realised that whatever we did, we were not going to make a living out of British holidaymakers.' Foreign visitors loved the place, but usually only stayed a night or two. 'What we needed,' says Harrison, 'was to find a niche - something no one else in the Forest was doing - that would guarantee room occupancy during the week.' In the summer of 1993 they took a lease on an overgrown neighbouring field with the idea of using it as a car park for wedding receptions. When he had cleared the chest-high nettles, however, Buck realised that he was standing in the middle of what could become, with imagination and hard labour, a delightful, rustic cricket oval. Could cricket be the niche they had been searching for? A crude square was prepared and an advertisement placed in the Cricketer magazine, suggesting the hotel as a base for teams touring the area. 'We expected about six replies,' says Buck. 'We were astonished to receive more than 50 serious inquiries.' Within weeks, 25 cricket teams had booked to stay at the Old Vicarage in the 1994 season. Buck invited an old friend, former Hampshire county cricketer John Rice, to inspect the wicket. 'His advice was to dig it up.' Hampshire's groundsmen at Southampton and Portsmouth gave some tips on basic groundsmanship. An advertisement in the local paper produced a nucleus of players for a revived Hinton Admiral CC - there had not been a team in the village since the 1970s  -and offers of equipment. The local blacksmith made a roller. A scoreboard was painted on the back of a decrepit stable. The result is a ground which looks as though it has existed for 100 years, yet in fact is not a year old. Buck, who reached the pinnacle of his own cricketing career in the 1970s with three or four appearances as a fast bowler for Hampshire Second XI, was impressed by the enthusiasm if not the talent of his recruits, who range in age from 24 to 74 and include the hotel's chef, a couple of City types, an engineer, a roadsweeper, a toymaker and a retired major. Intensive coaching sessions are slowly paying dividends: Hinton's record to date is played 17, won three, lost 13, drawn one, compared with a 100 per cent record of defeats at the end of July. Buck provides prospective touring teams with a fixture contact list for more than 100 local sides in Hampshire and Dorset. The bar, crammed with cricketing memorabilia, stays open as late as the guests wish. Only on one occasion have victory celebrations got out of hand, when a 2am water fight ruined several mattresses. Half of the teams which stayed at the Old Vicarage in 1994 have made firm bookings for 1995. Harrison says: 'The cricket enables us to plan ahead. We know we will have that cash flow in a year's time.' The couple believe that only two or three other hotels in Britain have their own cricket pitches. It is proving an attractive asset for corporate entertainment. Plessey, Lloyds Bank and Chase Manhattan Bank have all held staff cricket matches and barbecues at the Old Vicarage; another company plans to use the ground for an archery day. Buck and Harrison expect to make a small profit this year on a turnover of about Pounds 130,000. A bonus for Buck is that he gets to be captain of his own cricket team. He can afford to be more philosophical about losing than most skippers: 'I like to see our visitors go home happy. Anyway, when they've won, they spend more at the bar.'

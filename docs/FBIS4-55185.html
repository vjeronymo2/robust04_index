			<p>BFN     [Text] As part of the Croat-Bosniak negotiations on  implementing the Washington agreement, the two delegations have  resumed talks about border controls in central Bosnia and  Hercegovina. Bosnian Croat delegation head Kresimir Zubak said  that there are problems surrounding the issue of the borders and  that they could be resolved only as part of a package. The  Muslim side has proposed that Herzegovina be divided into two  cantons: one Croat and the other with power-sharing on a parity  basis. On the other hand, the Croatian side insists on a single  Herzegovina.    Muslim delegation head Haris Silajdzic said that he expects  nothing from today's negotiations in the U.S. Embassy in Vienna.</p>

			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / International Company News: Laidlaw surges 58% to Dollars 28.2m LAIDLAW, the Ontario waste services and school bus operator, boosted quarterly earnings by 58 per cent, thanks to an improved contribution from its interests in ADT, the Bermuda-based security and vehicle auction group, and Attwoods, the waste management company. Earnings from continuing operations rose to USDollars 28.2m, or 11 cents a share, in the three months to February 29, the second quarter of Laidlaw's fiscal year, from Dollars 17.8m, or 6 cents, a year earlier. Last year's figure excludes a Dollars 15.1m charge, reflecting Laidlaw's share of losses suffered by ADT. Revenues edged up to Dollars 462.5m from Dollars 454.9m. Equity earnings from ADT and Attwoods totalled Dollars 8.9m, compared with a Dollars 3.3m loss a year earlier. However, income from Laidlaw's own operations slipped to Dollars 53.4m, from Dollars 54.2m, reflecting mainly the impact of the recession in the waste-management business. Hazardous waste margins fell to 11.8 per cent from 13.6 per cent, and solid waste margins to 9.5 per cent from 10.5 per cent. The company said that lower fuel prices had contributed to an improvement in school bus operations.</p>

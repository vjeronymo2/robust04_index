			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: Solid advances at GM subsidiaries Revenues at EDS, the computer services subsidiary of General Motors, climbed 23 per cent in the latest quarter from a year ago, to Dollars 2.56bn. Mr Les Alberthal, chairman and chief executive, attributed the advance in sales to strong growth in Europe and Asia, adding that the value of new business won in the first nine months of this year, at Dollars 7.4bn, was already ahead of the figure for the whole of 1993. The growth in sales supported a 13 per cent increase in after-tax profits during the third quarter, to Dollars 216.4m. EDS's profits are used to calculate the earnings of General Motors Class E shares, which were up 5 cents at 45 cents. Meanwhile, General Motors Acceptance Corporation, the carmaker's financial services arm, reported after-tax profits of Dollars 245m, up from Dollars 205m a year ago. The company attributed the advance largely to lower funding costs, which resulted from both a better funding mix than a year ago and greater confidence among investors in the outlook for GMAC and its parent. The financing company also benefited from higher vehicle sales and the growing popularity of leasing. The number of vehicles leased worldwide more than doubled compared with a year ago, to 168,000, GMAC said. Last year, GMAC, EDS and GM Hughes Electronics contributed Dollars 2.6bn between them to GM's profits, while the group as a whole reported total net income of Dollars 2.5bn. GM reports third-quarter earnings today.</p>

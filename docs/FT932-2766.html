			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Carmakers hit the panic button: The European auto industry is struggling against overcapacity, high costs and a fall in demand Europe has become the battleground of the world motor industry in the 1990s. As demand nosedives across the continent, the failure of many European carmakers to put their houses in order during the recent fat years is becoming glaringly apparent. The race to regain global competitiveness is intense. By the end of the decade, the frontiers of the European car market will be thrown open fully to Japanese competition when all import restrictions end. The sickening downward lurch in new car sales in the first five months of this year has forced carmakers to hit the panic buttons from Wolfsburg to Turin and from Stuttgart to Gothenburg. Large parts of the industry have been forced on to short-time working; thousands of jobs have been axed; components suppliers are being squeezed ruthlessly to cut prices; and, as overcapacity grows, rationalisation and restructuring are the order of the day. Ford of Europe, once the Ford group's main profit-generating machine worldwide, has racked up losses of more than Dollars 2bn in the past two years, exposed early by the long-lived recession in the UK, its biggest market in Europe. Fiat, which now accounts for virtually the entire Italian car and truck industry, saw the profits of its car subsidiary, Fiat Auto, virtually wiped out last year with net income dropping to L16bn (Pounds 7m) from L361bn in 1991. The rot set in deeply during the final months of last year as orders in most European car markets suddenly began to shrink. After more than doubling its profits in the first nine months of last year, the Renault group of France fell into loss in the final quarter, pushed down by the turmoil in the European currency markets, its share of losses at its partner Volvo, and the red ink of its truck operations. The real horror story late last year emerged in Germany, however, where Volkswagen, the group that has led the west European market in terms of sales volumes for the past eight years, crashed deep into loss. After making a pre-tax profit of DM1.2bn in the first nine months of last year, it plunged into a pre-tax loss of DM563m in the final quarter and followed this with a DM1.2bn loss in the first three months of 1993. According to a report by UK financial analysts James Capel: 'The first quarter of 1993 has been the worst period for earnings (in the European auto industry) since the early 1980s and possibly for a period much longer than that.' It is not as if warnings had not been posted. The scale of the challenge to come from Japan became clear in the 1980s, and the industry has always been sensitive to changes in the volume of demand. Experience in the American market had shown how quickly carmakers' profits could melt away, as uncompetitive producers faced the twin challenges of recession and a deep incursion by Japanese rivals into their domestic market. Europe had always appeared to be next in line, but for a time the hour of reckoning was delayed by a car market that had seemed to defy gravity. New car demand in west Europe bounded from one record year to another during the second half of the 1980s, with sales jumping from 10.17m in 1984 to 13.47m in 1989. Until 1992 demand held steady at about the record level of 13.5m. Beneath the deceptively calm surface, however, all was not well as demand began to diverge wildly in key markets. With the onset of recession, sales in the UK slumped by a third over three years from their 1989 peak, and sales faltered too in France. These setbacks were more than compensated for by the unprecedented surge in new car sales in Germany, Europe's biggest market, in the wake of unification. Carmakers, most of all the Volkswagen group which controls about 28 per cent of the German market, were able to surf on the rising wave of demand in Germany, where the car market surged from 2.8m in 1989 to 4.2m in 1991 and 3.9m last year. Now the German party, which all carmakers shared in, is over. The hangover is proving unpleasant. With the UK as virtually the only exception, new car markets across west Europe have shrunk alarmingly in the first half of 1993. In the first five months alone, 1m fewer new cars were sold in west Europe than in the same period a year ago, with sales dropping by 17.3 per cent to about 5.2m. Sales were lower than a year ago in 15 of 17 markets across west Europe. In Germany, sales in the first five months fell year-on-year by 20 per cent, in Italy the decline was 21.1 per cent, in France 18.5 per cent and in Spain 31.2 per cent. The flickering of recovery in the UK - with sales up by 8.9 per cent this year - pales against declines of this magnitude elsewhere. Forecasts by leading carmakers suggest that sales could fall to only 11.4-11.5m in the full year. All carmakers in Europe are under fierce pressure - with only the UK's Rover group increasing its European sales this year - but the German industry is feeling the most intense heat. For too long, it has rested on its laurels. Now it is finding that its bloated cost-base has left it with a worrying lack of competitiveness not only against Japanese carmakers but also against its European rivals. 'Production costs in Germany are too high,' says Mrs Erika Emmerich, president of the German auto federation. 'The cause is labour costs as well as energy, transport and environmental costs. Working hours are shorter than in the auto industries of most other countries. And corporation tax is higher than in our most important competing countries.' Based on exchange rates last December, German auto makers had total wage costs of DM47 an hour, two-thirds higher than the average of DM28.3 in the rest of Europe, and 37 per cent higher than in both the US and Japan at DM34.4 an hour. German car workers clocked up only 1,483 hours in 1991 (the latest figures available), a third fewer than the 2,181 hours worked by a Japanese car worker, and 27 per cent fewer than their counterparts in the US at 2,022 hours. Mr Ferdinand Piech, who took over as the head of Volkswagen in January to lead the troubled group's drastic restructuring, has not sought to hide the problems behind the cloak of recession. 'The VW group's current difficulties can only be blamed in small part on the weakness of new car sales - and the same is true for other German manufacturers,' he says. 'The real cause is much more the structural problems of the entire sector. We have to accept that in the eight years of booming sales we did not do our homework. Because as soon as sales fall we are in the red.' Intent on expanding its sales and market share at the expense of cutting fat and keeping costs under control, Volkswagen, the European market leader, has become the continent's highest-cost producer. French carmakers have a 20 per cent cost advantage over the group, says Mr Piech, and the Japanese a lead of 25-30 per cent. The bare-knuckle legal fight between Volkswagen and General Motors over Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, whom Volkswagen recently poached from GM to lead their cost-cutting drive, shows just how frayed the nerve-ends have become. Cutting purchasing costs - Mr Lopez's forte - is one way forward for VW, but the key to global competitiveness is unlikely to be found in a German courtroom. The remedies prescribed by VW's management have a familiar ring: Jobs are one of the prime targets, with last year's 7,300 reduction at VW's six domestic German plants to be followed by a cut of at least another 12,500 in 1993-94. Worldwide the group, which includes Audi, Seat and Skoda, is cutting 30,000 jobs in 1993-94 to 243,000. Capital investments are being drastically pruned, with a halving of planned spending across the group and a virtual halt on investment at Audi and Seat for the rest of the year. Components suppliers are being put under severe pressure to cut prices. Some are reporting demands for cuts of up to 30 per cent over the next three years. At the same time the group is seeking to rationalise drastically its production and engineering processes with the urgent adoption of 'lean production' methods. It is also seeking to reduce the proliferation of similar components across the group's various model ranges, by moving to the use of more common components. Volkswagen is not alone in resorting to drastic remedies. In a stunning departure from corporate tradition, Mercedes-Benz, the world's most prestigious luxury carmaker, is trying to rethink the whole way it does business with 'a very extensive realignment of its strategic product policy', led by Mr Helmut Werner, who took over as chief executive last month. He admits that Mercedes-Benz's present luxury and executive cars are 'over-engineered', and says that the company would end up being 'priced-out' of world markets if it persisted with such a policy for developing new models. Mr Werner claims that the only way Mercedes-Benz can maintain its engineering and quality leadership is if it can also achieve cost leadership. Gone are the days when the charging of premium prices could disguise an uncompetitive cost-base. 'No one in the world is prepared to pay for German complacency on the cost front,' says Mr Werner. About 13,000 jobs were already eliminated by Mercedes-Benz last year in Germany (at its car and commercial vehicle operations), reducing the workforce from 225,000 to 212,000 by the end of 1992. Another 14,500 jobs are scheduled to be cut in the coming two years. While the present crisis is at its most acute in Germany, the pain is being felt elsewhere in the European industry. After two years of record losses, Ford of Europe has been in the process of cutting 10,000 jobs since late last year. Fiat, under heavy attack by its rivals in its domestic fastness of Italy, cut 9,000 jobs in its car operations in the two years to the end of 1992. Under the pressure of falling sales it resorted to halting production lines to eliminate the output of 230,000 cars last year and 180,000 in the first half of 1993. Even while production in existing plants is being pruned, new plant capacity is coming on stream. European producers are commissioning plants with a capacity for about 1.5m vehicles a year between mid-1992 and the end of 1994, although VW is delaying part of its expansion in eastern Germany. In addition, Japanese vehicle makers are expected to have built a capacity in Europe for some 1.2m vehicles a year by the end of the decade. 'The whole industry, but European manufacturers in particular, have to face one particularly severe international challenge. This is worldwide overcapacity,' says Mr Bruno Adelt, executive vice-president of the Volkswagen brand division. 'For the remainder of the 1990s we estimate this at more than 10m vehicles . . . Excess capacities in Europe will greatly increase, competition will be tougher and above all pressure to sell at lower prices will increase dramatically.' Faced with the accelerating contraction of the market, established European producers are clamouring for intervention by the European Commission to renegotiate Japanese import levels. 'The agreements between the European Community and Japan are not enough,' says Mr John Hardiman, chief executive of Ford of Germany. 'We are deeply dissatisfied . . . We are demanding that Brussels sets Japanese export quotas exactly in line with the actual development of the market . . . You do not have to be a prophet to foresee that the goal of orderly adjustment and a far-reaching restructuring of the European auto industry cannot be reached by 1999.' The real challenge is not so much the Japanese imports, however, as local Japanese production in Europe, where Nissan, Toyota and Honda are already showing that they can reach Japanese levels of quality and efficiency with European (British) workforces, albeit in new plants and with new labour agreements. In the middle of these challenges European auto industry share prices have performed with remarkable resilience. Some brave investors believe they can see the start of the recovery, but most carmakers still cannot imagine when the present decline will stop.</p>

In a letter to the editor of the WALL STREET JOURNAL printed  in its Monday issue, he noted that the South Korean Government  is tearing down virtually all trade barriers against foreign  firms making inroads into the country, particularly those  against foreign direct and equity investment.    Refuting a story published by the influential economic  newspaper on Feb. 25 that South Korea is the least attractive  market for foreign investors in East Asia, Han said South Korea  offers a number of attractions for American investors.    Among them are the 15th largest gross national product in  the  world, the 12th largest trading partner of the United States, a  population of 43 million, a solid foundation for manufacturing,  an educated and skilled labor force, the country's geographical  location as a relay point for trade with China, Russia and  Japan, and political stability for sustained economic growth, he  enumerated.    Because of foreign invasions in the past, Koreans once  opposed foreign investment: This xenophobia has now changed to  an understanding that the Korean economy is mutually dependent  on other countries' economies for sustained growth and that  foreign investment and technology imports are necessary for  further development.    Han said Koreans are well aware that foreign loans, which  helped to develop the country's economy, are no longer  instrumental in importing the technology the economy needs in  its present stage of growth.</p>

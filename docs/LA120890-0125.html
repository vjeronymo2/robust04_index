			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> TUSTIN BEATS CAPISTRANO VALLEY ON LATE JUMP SHOT  </P> <P> It was billed as an early showdown in the second week of the basketball season  when second-ranked Tustin High School met fifth-ranked Capistrano Valley Friday  night in the semifinals of the Trabuco Hills Tournament.  </P> <P> Although it's early in the season, the big game lived up to its billing when  Tustin reserve guard Robert Laubach hit a baseline jump shot with 1:04  remaining to give the Tillers a 61-60 victory.  </P> <P> Tustin (3-0) survived three Capistrano Valley shots in the final minute,  including a three-point attempt by Cougar guard Tom Airey with two seconds  left, to move into the championship game at 8 tonight against Marina.  </P> <P> Marina (3-1) advanced with a 60-57 victory over J.W. North of Riverside behind  the play of All-American center Cherokee Parks. Parks had 14 points, 16  rebounds and three blocked shots.  </P> <P> Laubach had replaced the Tillers' top player, David Beilstein, with three  minutes remaining when Beilstein fouled out after scoring 18 points. Laubach's  shot erased Capistrano Valley's 60-59 lead taken when Airey hit a three-point  shot with 1:35 remaining.  </P> <P> But the game was decided early in the fourth quarter when Capistrano Valley  assistant Steve Scoggins was called for a technical foul after protesting a  charging foul against Cougar center Brett McCorkle.  </P> <P> McCorkle apparently had scored on the play, but the basket was disallowed and  the subsequent technical resulted in a seven-point turnaround when Beilstein  made two free throws and then hit a three-point shot to give Tustin a 52-45  lead.  </P> <P> Tustin center Brian Reider led all scorers with 21 points and had seven  rebounds.  </P> <P> Capistrano Valley (3-1) made only 20 of 59 shots and its two big men -- forward  Steve Ransom and McCorkle -- had mediocre games. Ransom made only 2 of 10  shots; McCorkle was five of 13 from the field.  </P> <P> "They're a good team, and they beat us," Capistrano Valley Coach Mark Thornton  said. "Still, we had our chances."  </P> <P> In other Trabuco Hills tournament games:  </P> <P> Marina 60, J.W. North 57 -- Cherokee Parks' supporting cast, guards Sean  Haselrig, Mike Carreon and Christen McLemore, were the difference in the game.  Carreon scored 12 points, including three free throws and a basket in the final  two minutes of play. McLemore added eight points.  </P> <P> Mater Dei 82, Rancho Buena Vista 69 -- Forward J.J. Ballesteros had 18 points  and teammate Reggie Geary added 17 points as Mater Dei (2-1) rebounded from its  first loss in nearly a year. TOM HAMILTON  </P></p>

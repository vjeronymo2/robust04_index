			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / NUM seeks talks over strike ballot YORKSHIRE miners' leaders decided yesterday to seek talks with British Coal before deciding how to act on a ballot which backed strikes against the contracting out of work. The National Union of Mineworkers' Yorkshire area council voted unanimously to reconvene on Tuesday May 5 'to give British Coal a period of grace in which to talk to the union'. The union called a ballot of Yorkshire's 13,000 miners after British Coal decided to employ private contractors for tunnelling work at Markham Main Colliery, Armthorpe. Of the 10,000 miners who voted, 50.7 per cent were in favour of selective strikes.</p>

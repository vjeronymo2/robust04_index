			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CAMARILLO;  </P> <P> ANNEXATION URGED FOR 90-ACRE SITE  </P> <P> The Camarillo Planning Commission has recommended that the city annex about 90  acres of an unincorporated area of Ventura County near Las Posas Road.  </P> <P> The development company, Presley of Southern California, plans to build 259  single-family houses on 88 acres west of Lantana Street.  </P> <P> The commission voted Tuesday against the annexation of another 37 acres east of  Lantana after a public outcry. A petition with the signatures of 74 residents  living in the 119 houses in the Casa de Cavalier tract was submitted to the  commission.  </P> <P> The residents want to remain under county control rather than become  incorporated into the city. Even though property taxes would have remained the  same after the annexation, some residents say they feel their quality of life  would be jeopardized under city jurisdiction.  </P> <P> In a separate action, the commission tentatively approved a subdivision to be  built by Pardee Construction east of Mission Oaks Boulevard and south of Colony  Drive. The subdivision is to consist of 159 single-family houses on 36.7 acres.  </P> <P> Residents in the Laurelwood tract, south of the proposed Pardee development,  said at the meeting that they oppose the project because, among other things,  it would increase traffic.  </P> <P> The City Council has final authority over both annexation and the developments.

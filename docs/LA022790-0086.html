			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST ON THE SCENE IN STUART MURDER CASE;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: 'RESCUE 911' CAMERA CREW'S EXCLUSIVE FOOTAGE OF THE BOSTON SHOOTING  WILL AIR ON THE SHOW TONIGHT.  </P> <P> The camera crew had spent two nights riding around with the supervisor of the  Boston Emergency Medical Service, looking for a traumatic injury that they  could follow from the scene of an accident through surgery to make a compelling  story for CBS' "Rescue 911." Nothing much had turned up. "We were shooting  blanks," cameraman Mike Parker recalled.  </P> <P> On the third night, about 8 p.m. last Oct. 23, they were headed toward a  reported fire-bombed house when they heard a call over the medical frequency  radio about a shooting in a car. "We took off on a 10-minute ride at top speed,  with sirens going, not knowing the exact location," Parker said.  </P> <P> They found it, and their compelling story. But they wouldn't know for several  months just how compelling it was.  </P> <P> Using his car phone, Charles Stuart had called the police to report that he and  his pregnant wife, Carol, had been shot by a black man. Stuart was rushed to  the hospital, the "Rescue 911" camera team in tow. His wife and child  (delivered by emergency Caesarean) subsequently died, and an arrest was made.  But in January, Stuart learned that he had become a suspect and leaped to his  death from a bridge over the Mystic River, police said.  </P> <P> The footage that Parker shot that night will be shown on "Rescue 911" at 8  tonight in a 21-minute segment. Although a portion of it has been seen  previously on news reports about the Stuart case, most of it is being broadcast  for the first time.  </P> <P> Executive producer Arnold Shapiro said that "Rescue 911" hasn't shown its  exclusive material until now because the producers initially were waiting for  Stuart to recover for a follow-up interview. After he killed himself, they had  to go back to Boston to gather additional material, Shapiro said.  </P> <P> Parker, 42, a veteran photo-journalist who has worked for stations in Miami,  Atlanta, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, recalls the events of that night vividly.  A free-lance cameraman working out of Los Angeles and Kansas City, Mo., he was  teamed with sound man Tom Wolford and director Robin Groth. They arrived at the  scene along with several police cars.  </P> <P> "We connected our umbilical cable (which attaches the sound equipment to the  camera) and started shooting," he said in an interview. "I could see that Carol  Stuart was seriously injured. She had blood all over her and was unconscious,  slumped in the car. She looked close to death. I started shooting her but the  cops tried to push us out of the way. The director wanted us to shoot Chuck  Stuart and the cops kept telling us to move."  </P> <P> "The cops have a less-than-fairy-tale relationship with the media in Boston and  I tried to explain we were with 'Rescue 911.' They didn't really want to hear  it. I was (angry). And that created a certain irony, because later they wanted  our tape and said they wish I had gotten closer," Parker said.  </P> <P> The local television stations had arrived by that time, which added to the  clamor, Parker said. But he had a "hot" wireless microphone on the supervisor  who was attending Stuart in the ambulance. "We actually got to the hospital  ahead of the ambulance," he said. He photographed Stuart being taken into the  trauma room and later in the operating room.  </P> <P> "He was conscious in the trauma room, which was amazing because he had a .38  pistol wound in his abdomen," Parker said. "He was coherent and I remember him  inquiring about his wife and wanting to know her condition. Little did I  understand the full implications of that at the time."  </P> <P> Boston police were doing some digging of their own throughout Stuart's surgery.  And about four hours into the operation, they wanted to talk to Parker. They  wanted to look at his tapes.  </P> <P> "The Boston cops dragged us out and took us to the station to look at the tapes  which they had tried so hard to obstruct us from shooting," Parker said. "We  are not a news show, we're entertainment; therefore we don't have the same  protection of the First Amendment as a news show. At the same time, it appeared  to be such a heinous crime -- the abduction and shooting -- that we wanted to  do everything we could to help the police find the perpetrator," Parker said.  They left the police with a dub of the tapes.  </P> <P> "The last time I saw Chuck Stuart, he was under general anesthesia with a group  of doctors fighting for his life," Parker said.  </P> <P> Aware that some people wonder if there wasn't a clue somewhere initially that  Stuart had actually done the shooting as part of his scheme to collect  insurance money on his wife, the cameraman asked, "Why would you have been  suspicious of a man having a supposedly perfect marriage, going to Lamaze  classes with his wife?"  </P> <P> "That he took her to a deserted section and blew her brains out, killing her,  killing their unborn child and shooting himself in the gut and almost dying  from that, was not something anybody was thinking of," Parker said.  </P> <P> The case also provoked charges of racial bias on the part of the media for the  way they played up the story of a white couple supposedly being shot by a black  man. "The story received the widespread publicity it did because it was a great  story. Had the situation been reversed -- a young, upscale black couple in a  white Boston suburb shot and killed -- it would have gotten the same coverage,"  Parker maintained. "Remember Howard Beach, remember Tawana Brawley?"  </P> <P> Parker was returning to Kansas City from another story in January when he  learned of Stuart's role in the killings and his suicide. "I was absolutely  stunned, and I'm not someone who is easily stunned. I've been in TV news for 20  years. There are not too many things that surprise or shock me. But this flat  blew me away. We'd been had."  </P> <P> Producer Shapiro was equally shocked. "For the rest of my life, I will try to  figure out what makes sociopaths tick. The behavior defies my sense of logic  and morality." He is developing a TV movie about the case for CBS.  </P> <P> "In all these years of shooting local and network news," Parker said, "this is  the one story I'll never forget. If I was the least bit naive about anything  before, this ended it."  </P></p>

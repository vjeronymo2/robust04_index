			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Business Travel (12): How to lounge in luxury - A look at facilities available on the ground for those awaiting departure FOR THE ordinary airline passenger, the airport departure lounge is often a dismal torture. But the business traveller can get away from all that. Instead of noisy milling crowds and long queues, he or she can enjoy a dizzying array of services ranging from the exotic - relaxing massages to ease that tension - to the practical, such as access to high-tech office equipment for those who still have work in mind. Business passengers can now sit in the cloistered calm of their very own lounges. Some of them will have access to special queue-beating Fast Track systems designed to get them on their flights as quickly as possible. One of these systems for first-class and business passengers is now being used by more than 65,000 travellers a month at Gatwick Airport, London, with 60 per cent of them citing it as a significant factor in their choice of airport. At Gatwick it offers a dedicated security channel and passport control as well as priority desks at Thomas Cook and Travelex bureaux de change for picking up previously ordered foreign currency. There is even a special till at duty free. Similar Fast Track facilities are operated by a number of airlines - including Virgin Atlantic, Air Canada and Air Malta at Heathrow Airport, London. KLM, the Dutch airline has its own check-in systems in place, designed to speed up the process. Mr Barry Evans, KLM deputy marketing director, UK and Ireland, says: 'We hope to keep the queueing time and length down for the business traveller. The high frequency flyer, particularly in Europe, wants to make the time spent as short as possible with later check-in or gate check-in. 'It has been said that if you run a perfect operation the traveller can't remember who he flew with] The aim is to make air travel smooth, effortless and memorable.' At its home base at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, KLM has two business class lounges which between them cater for more than 300 passengers. Personal computers, printers, fax machines and access to car rental and rest and business areas are provided. Last autumn, KLM opened a Pounds 500,000 business class lounge at Heathrow which offers a business area, including fax and telephones and complimentary refreshments, and accommodates 95 passengers. 'Business users provide one third of our total revenue. This is important traffic which is vigorously competed for,' says Mr Evans. He adds that the business customer is looking for value for money and a difference between economy and business class. In Germany, the Frankfurt Airport Centre, directly connected to the terminal departures level, offers a variety of services for business travellers. Besides Airport Club Frankfurt, a business club for members and their guests and the Airport Business Centre, there is the Airport Conference Centre, which has equipment for live TV and radio broadcasts, a simultaneous interpretation system and facilities for worldwide conferences via satellite. At New York's Kennedy Airport, individual airlines operate their own business lounges which provide facilities enabling the passenger to get on with some work or to relax. Claiming to be the largest operators at Kennedy, Heathrow and Gatwick, Travelex foreign currency services offer airmiles on currency transactions to British Airways Executive Club and Latitude card holders. Travelex operates a system which almost amounts to having currency on spend or return. Customers exchanging Pounds 300 or more can change back up to 30 per cent at the same exchange rate, commission free, for a month after the original transaction. At Heathrow Airport, Virgin Atlantic has opened what could be described as the ultimate in lounges for the Upper Class (business class) traveller - the Pounds 1m Virgin Clubhouse at Terminal 3. The accent is on luxury and there is something for just about everyone. Facilities include a health spa and pre-flight grooming salon offering massage and aromatherapy, a library with over 5,000 books, a timber-panelled, acoustically isolated music room and a study featuring mini offices with state-of-the-art technology for those who feel the need to do some work. Mr Stephen Ridgway, Virgin Atlantic's marketing director, says that business travellers in revenue terms are very significant in what overall is a phenomenally competitive market. He adds: 'We are pushing the envelope all the time to provide a total travel experience  .. to influence and control the passenger situation from the time they book the ticket at home to the time they get back.' Over at Birmingham International Airport, the Pounds 60m terminal Eurohub has business facilities, including the opportunity to use secretarial services. Passengers with just hand baggage can also check in at either the concourse, ticket and information desks or the departure gate. Ms Sheila Lashford, Birmingham Airport's head of external relations, says: 'Eurohub is principally for business travellers and was designed with them in mind. The check-in time is around 35 minutes and the longest distance you have to walk is 250 metres. 'The business person wants everything to be smooth; he or she wants to develop tunnel vision, to take a path through the airport onto the flight. However, he or she still wants goods of a specific quality and amenities. A cup of coffee has to be good coffee, so we have to cater for all that.' At Heathrow a new Business Centre run by Thomas Cook has opened in the Queens Building between Terminals 1 and 2. It has a members' lounge and facilities include telex and workstations. There is even the opportunity to take a shower before you leave. British Airways has opened the doors of three new departure lounges for premium passengers at Heathrow's Terminal 4. Mr Michael Batt, British Airways director of marketing, says of the new 'lounge pavilion': 'Business travellers are looking for speed, space and support to do business. They have to deliver and we have to be in the position where we help them deliver.'</p>

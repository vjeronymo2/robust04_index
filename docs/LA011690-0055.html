			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SECURITY PACIFIC CRITICIZED FOR OPENING ON KING HOLIDAY  </P> <P> Martin Luther King Jr. Day was a public relations fiasco for Security Pacific  National Bank.  </P> <P> Angry civil rights leaders protested the Los Angeles bank's decision to keep  branches open on the day honoring the slain civil rights leader and vowed to  take further action. They credited their protests, which included early morning  picketing outside of the bank's Los Angeles headquarters, with forcing the bank  to close some branches early in minority communities such as South-Central Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> Security Pacific was the only major bank in California to open its branches  Monday. But some 20 of the bank's 557 branches statewide either did not open or  closed early in areas where, as a Security Pacific spokeswoman said, "it became  obvious that those communities would not support our decision to stay open."  She did not identify the location of the branches, but did say two were on the  route of a parade honoring King and would have been impractical to open anyway.  </P> <P> The decision to stay open on the King holiday stems from the larger retail war  among California banks that escalated last year. Banks, feeling pressure to  differentiate their service from the competition, are opening branches on  Saturdays, Sundays, at night and on traditional bank holidays such as Columbus  Day, Veterans Day and Presidents Day.  </P> <P> This time it backfired. In addition to Security Pacific's troubles, an  embarrassed Wells Fargo Bank last Friday decided to close its branches on  Monday under pressure after declaring earlier in the week that they would be  open. A bank spokeswoman said the decision came after the bank received  hundreds of telephone calls at its headquarters and branches.  </P> <P> The third Monday in January has been a national holiday honoring King since  1986, even though surveys have shown that fewer than one in five employers  nationwide give workers the day off.  </P> <P> Security Pacific defended its action to open branches, adding that 90% of its  employees observed the holiday by taking the day off and that the bank's  parent, Security Pacific Corp., was closed. The bank added that it opened  branches only as a convenience to customers and that other retail businesses,  such as departments stores, were opened as well.  </P> <P> The dispute over the holiday with Wells Fargo and Security Pacific shows how  sensitive banks are when it comes to their image with minorities.  </P> <P> Part of the reason stems from an increasing number of challenges to bank  mergers made by civil rights groups alleging that banks do not make enough  loans or extend adequate credit in low-income areas. Those groups have been  using the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act, which allows regulators to look at  such policies when reviewing merger plans, to pressure banks into doing more.  </P> <P> Last November, a group of civil rights leaders accused Wells Fargo of failing  to follow equal opportunity employment and lending practices, asking regulators  to block the San Francisco bank's proposed acquisition of American National  Bank. Wells Fargo denies the coalition's allegations.  </P> <P> To help fight that image, large California banks such as Security Pacific  recently formed a coalition to provide $100 million in loans to developers who  build affordable housing.  </P> <P> But what clearly irked civil rights leaders is that Security Pacific has  previously closed for the holiday. Mark Ridley-Thomas, executive director of  the Los Angeles branch of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which  King founded, notes that Security Pacific even specifies on the 1990 calendars  it gives to customers that banks are closed in honor of the holiday.  </P> <P> He said civil rights groups plan to seek a commitment from Security Pacific to  close in honor of the holiday in the future. He added that the dispute over the  holiday will trigger a probe by the groups into the bank's equal opportunity  policies toward lending and hiring.  </P> <P> Security Pacific's spokeswoman Deborah Lewis said the bank's plans will be  determined by what it believes will provide the best service for its customers.  </P> <P> RELATED STORY: B1  </P></p>

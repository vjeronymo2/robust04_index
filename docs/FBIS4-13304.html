			<p>BFN     [Text] The Foreign Ministry today issued a statement on the  progress of events in the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the  tyrannical Serbian conquest there.    The statement stressed that Sudan, proceeding from its  conviction to respect human rights and respect international  laws and resolutions, did not wish to see a deterioration in  terms of hostilities in that region. It also does not wish to  see the mounting suffering inflicted on the patient and  steadfast Bosnian people on a daily basis, or the obstinacy of  the Serbian forces, which exploit the UN Security Council's  resolutions as an umbrella under which to commit further  atrocities and massacres.    The statement once again called on the international  community to discharge its responsibilities towards a people  suffering the worst fate ever to befall any people throughout  the course of history. The Foreign Ministry statement called on  the international community and the governments of the Arab and  Islamic states and peace-loving governments, to adopt a more  determined stance towards the Serbian aggressors so as to rescue  what is left of the Serbian people under attack.</p>

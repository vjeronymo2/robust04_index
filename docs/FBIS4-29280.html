			<p>CSO     [Text] We are now witnessing a relationship between those  in power and the media, so difficult to understand, that common  sense would have one believe we have returned to the dark tunnel  of past authoritarian times. One example is the suit for the  incredible sum of 2 billion won against Hangyore  Sinmun. It was published in an article on the disclosure  made in a press interview by Chong Chae-chung---who alleged the  president's son, Kim Hyon-chol, said that he was involved in the  bribery scandal involving the lobbying money of an unlicensed  oriental-medicines company. This was at the time of the 14th  presidential election.    Citizens from all walks of life uniformly applaudeding the  courage of Hangyore Sinmum by giving statements,  calling, or visiting the newspaper company, and criticizing this  irrational attack on the press is also reminiscent of the  atmosphere of society during the past era of authoritarianism.  The "stubborn silence" of others in the media---who had been  raising their voices on various events, but had to take care  concerning this incident---also resembled the media of the past,  ever servile before the powerful.    Through an editorial about the lobbying-money scandal  involving the government and the center of power, Hangyore  Sinmun has already pointed out the excessive abuse of power  and immorality shown by this response. To reiterate, the first  thing the Blue House should do concerning this incident is to  reveal the truth sincerely and in detail, apologize for what it  should be sorry for, and punish those who deserve it. Yet, the  response of those in power, at least in the eyes of the public,  has been to make economic threats and force the one who made  the revelation to withdraw it. This is done by bringing criminal  charges against the one who divulged the scandal, by applying  "pressure" to the media not to report the information made  public through an interview, and, concerning Hangyore  Sinmun's report of this, by filing a suit for an outrageous  amount.    Given this situation, no matter what words the Blue House  mobilizes to explain itself, it will not be able to convince the  public. According to the public's understanding of this  incident, when Chong Chae-chung, just an ordinary man, stood  against the powerful, criticizing the president's son, who is  reported to have great political influence, he would not have  told groundless lies.    Holding an emergency joint meeting of the Seoul-Area Press  Labor Union Chairmen's Group [Ollonsa Nojowiwonjangdan] last  December, the National Alliance of Press Labor Unions [Chonguk  Ollon Nodong Chohap Yonmaeng] [NAPLU] characterized the suit by  Kim Hyon-chol as a "new media-control measure," and decided to  oppose this head-on. This was a natural decision made out of  deep concern for the arrogant posture of those in power and for  a [possible] return to the government-media relationship of the  past. The NAPLU announced that it would set out on a  reporter-petition drive, demanding a Blue House explanation of  the political-funding bribery incident and an end to the  oppression of the media. The question of to what extent the  labor union chairmen who made this decision and the reporters  responding to the petition drive will be able to return each to  their respective companies and realize the purpose of this  resolution through the printed page will become the standard for  measuring where we in the press now stand. The unified might of  the media is truly a powerful weapon for beating back the  oppression of the media by those in power and is the most  certain ally of the true democratization and genuine reform of  society.</p>

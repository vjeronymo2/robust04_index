			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / UK Company News: Psion veers sharply to losses of Pounds 2.2m PSION, the maker of hand-held computers, last year lost Pounds 2.2m before tax compared with a profit of Pounds 546,000 in 1990. Sales fell 32 per cent, from Pounds 31.4m to Pounds 21.3m. Analysts had been predicting losses of between Pounds 100,000 and Pounds 1m, but they believed the company was now through the worst and its shares were marked up 19p to 135p on the news. The company was hit by a combination of the recession, which depressed demand in corporate markets, and a turn of the product cycle so new products to replace its ageing Organiser electronic notebook did not come on stream until the end of the year. The figures took account of Pounds 770,000 exceptional provisions; Pounds 270,000 as the result of a product-for-media-space barter with Mediators of the US which has since moved into Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code, and Pounds 500,000 against slow moving inventory, chiefly Psion's unsuccessful laptop computer line. Net borrowings totalled Pounds 1.6m, giving gearing of 28 per cent. Losses per share were 8.13p (earnings of 1.19p). A recommended final dividend of 1.4p maintains the total at 2.4p. Mr David Potter, founder and chairman, said sales of new products had taken off since the beginning of the current year, and the company was now trading profitably and at record levels. Production and shipments of the Series 3 pocket computer had increased from 4,000 units in January this year to 14,000 in March. Mr Potter pointed out that the company adopted conservative accounting policies, writing off development costs as incurred which did not flatter the balance sheet. Over four years, some Pounds 5.2m has been invested in computer families. COMMENT Problems at the datacommunications subsidiary, an earlier source of profits decline, seem to have been solved. The company now has three product families, all based on the same technology - the original Organiser, still finding corporate uses as a data capture device, the Series 3 pocket computer, and the HC hand held computer. Later this year, a version of the HC featuring radio communications will be launched in the US and the UK. There seems to be powerful demand for portable computers of this kind which is encouraging the City to take a positive view of the company's recovery. Costs have been cut and new and advanced production facilities established. Analysts are looking for pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.5m this year, giving earnings per share of 10.6p and a prospective p/e of 12.3. Psion's strength remains the quality of its management and its products, and it should fulfil expectations.</p>

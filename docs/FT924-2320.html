			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Monitors warn on Kenyan election COMMONWEALTH observers warned yesterday that Kenya's first multi-party elections since 1966, scheduled for December 29, were in jeopardy unless 'irregularities' in last week's parliamentary nominations were resolved. The warning follows Saturday's unprecedented walk-out by five western ambassadors from a national day parade presided over by President Daniel arap Moi. They said it had become a political rally on behalf of the governing Kanu party. Allegations that opposition parties had been prevented from nominating candidates in as many as 45 parliamentary seats required urgent investigation, said the Commonwealth observer group in a statement. Its assessment of the poll is critical. If it decides the elections are not 'free and fair' most donors are likely to continue a freeze on aid imposed in November 1991. Unless 'irregularities' in last week's nomination process were rectified by a special committee of the electoral commission due to meet today, this part of the election procedure would be considered 'severely compromised', the statement said. Thirteen parliamentary candidates representing the Kenya African National Union (Kanu), including Mr Moi, were unopposed when nominations for the 188 seat assembly closed on Thursday. Kanu is being challenged by three main parties - Ford Kenya, Ford Asili, and the Democratic party - in a campaign marked by ethnic rivalries and occasional violence. The statement, approved in London by Chief Emeka Anyaoku, the Commonwealth secretary-general, also expressed 'deep concern' about allegations of 'violence, misconduct and intimidation, apart from general impropriety on the part of officials'. The elections 'may now be at risk', the statement said. Saturday saw five western ambassadors, including the US envoy, snub Mr Moi when they walked out of the stadium holding a parade marking Kenya's 29th anniversary of independence. Groups holding banners and placards extolling the virtues of Mr Moi and Kanu were paraded before spectators. A US spokesman said the occasion had been turned into 'a party rally'. Envoys from the US, Germany, Sweden, Denmark and Canada left shortly before President Moi addressed the rally. Sir Kieran Prendergast, the British high commissioner, stayed in his seat.</p>

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Italy (7): Privatisation encounters barriers - Haig Simonian reports on a subject high on the new prime minister's list of priorities PUT MORE than 100 leading Italian public sector bankers and industrialists on a royal yacht, sprinkle a few dozen UK corporate financiers and add a pinch of sunshine for a day's cruise, and you could have the perfect recipe to kick-start a privatisation programme. That, at least, was the thinking behind a marketing wheeze last month to sell Italians the merits of the UK's financial services industry, especially as far as privatisation was concerned. But, as everyone on board the Britannia already knew, privatisation in Italy involves more than just a chat and a cup of tea. Selling state enterprises can go a long way to cut the budget deficit, while increasing competition and improving services. Yet significant sales remain conspicuous by their absence. The role of the public sector in the economy is hard to miss. State-owned concerns account for almost half Italy's 50 biggest companies in terms of turnover. IRI, largest of the state holding companies, accounts for around 5 per cent of gross national product. ENI, the second largest, has a stranglehold on the energy market and is a major force in chemicals. Efim, smallest of the big three in terms of sales, leads by a furlong when it comes to losses. Together, they account for huge tracts of Italian business. IRI, organised in sub-holdings which in turn control hundreds of separate operating companies, dominates telecommunications through its Stet holding, engineering and aerospace via Finmeccanica, food through SME, and steel via Ilva. Its businesses embrace activities as diverse as air traffic control radar (Selenia) and ice-lollies (Italgel). The public sector is also present in less obvious guises, notably finance and insurance. Italy's biggest bank, Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, is a charitable foundation largely under public sector control. The main shareholder in Banca di Roma, the country's second biggest financial institution, is a foundation dominated by the city of Rome. Meanwhile, Milan-based Cariplo, is the biggest example of the hundreds of municipally-owned savings institutions that dot the country. Selling just a few could raise huge amounts of cash and help cover the roaring budget deficit. But even with the arrival as prime minister of Mr Giuliano Amato, who has put privatisation high on his priority list, backers of state sell-offs are still likely to encounter substantial political barriers. Opposition to sales is sometimes ideological, and based on complex - often jejune - arguments about the connotations of the word 'public' in Italian. Italy, owing to its late industrialisation and sharp north-south divide, is not like other west European countries, it is reasoned. Hence public ownership is not necessarily seen as a bad thing, while the state investment has been a vital social and economic tool in developing the economically-depressed south. Others focus on the structural barriers to privatisation. Italy's pint-sized stock market makes Thatcherite concepts of popular share ownership impractical. Encouraging private investors to take shares in state-owned companies could be counter-productive, as it may reduce their tendency to buy government bonds - a key part of funding the deficit. And, opponents argue, how would competition be served if state-owned assets end up in the hands of some of Italy's big private sector groups? Such warnings often strike a chord among electors. But the most common motive behind political hostility to state sell-offs remains the fear of losing patronage, and, possibly, funds. Italy's state-owned companies are rife with political placemen, rewarded for their services with plumb public sector jobs. Even the promise of a steady job in a state-owned company can be a potent political instrument to win votes and gain popular support. But political opposition to sell-offs has been under pressure as state finances have deteriorated. Even critics of privatisation have been forced to accept the principle of asset sales, albeit while fighting a rearguard action on the details. The result is that privatisation has been a piecemeal process. This year's budget target of L15,000bn in disposals has its foundation in two big transactions: the sale of Crediop, a Treasury controlled long-term lending bank, to San Paolo, which has raised around L2,100bn; and the planned transfer of an opening stake in Istituto Mobiliare Italiano (IMI) to Cariplo for a sum estimated to be almost as large, with more on the way should other savings banks also join in. The remainder of the budgeted income will come from a mixed bag of disposals, largely of surplus state property. However, other big potential transactions have been stalled by the failure of the political parties to agree on priorities or practicalities. Progress so far has been limited to the technical level of altering the legal status of some public sector entities to that of joint stock companies (SpAs). Even the debate on conversion has unleashed political dogfights. Though uncontroversial in principle, the change of status for bodies like Enel, the state electricity generating concern, or ENI, has been fought tooth and nail by politicians who see it as the thin end of the wedge. Accordingly, the number of agreed changes has so far been limited to ENI and the state railways. Of those which have made progress, some, like the railways, would be unsellable anyway. But while politicians have been arguing the finer legal points of transformations into joint stock companies, a 'privatisation' of sorts has been at work independently. IRI, in particular, has had to look for new sources of funds to meet its ambitious investment plans at a time of crumbling profitability. Its 1991 results showed a L315bn loss, compared with net profits of L1,108bn the previous year. But while earnings have tumbled, the financial appetites of its subsidiaries remain voracious. So, lacking clear political signals from the government and facing a growing squeeze owing to the shortage of state finance, IRI has had to accept that asset sales are virtually the only way to tackle its problems. So far, big disposals have been limited by political factors. IRI's biggest sell-off has been the L480bn sale in February of its 52 per cent stake in Cementir, a quoted subsidiary and the third biggest cement producer in Italy. However, it has been highly active in whittling down holdings in its huge stable of subsidiaries, which appears to be much less controversial politically. Last July, IRI raised around Dollars 275m by reducing its stake in Stet savings shares. In October, it sold around L200bn worth of savings shares and warrants in Credito Italiano, one of two big banks it owns. As a result, IRI's stake in Credito Italiano's savings shares has fallen to 17 per cent from 57 per cent before. This year, IRI's management has been bolder. Last month, it took the first step in a multi-stage transaction, raising up to L1,750bn by launching the secondary sale of shares in Stet. Meanwhile, in late summer, Finmeccanica should raise around L2,450bn through a partial flotation. IRI's subsidiaries have also been selling assets in their own right. In February, Stet started thinning down its holding of savings shares in Sip, Italy's main telephone operating utility, through a L400bn convertible Eurobond. Should all the linked warrants be exercised, Stet's stake in Sip's savings stock will drop to 33 per cent from nearly 53 per cent before. ENI also expects to raise money this year by reducing its shares in some of its subsidiaries. First off the mark could be its Immobiliare Metanopoli property arm, which is already quoted. And some analysts believe ENI could raise around L2,000bn this year from the flotation of stakes in Agip and Snam, its petroleum and gas transmission operations. None of the flotations or secondary placements so far has threatened the state's ultimate control, as no equity sales have gone beyond the 49 per cent barrier. And when that ceiling has been breached, only non-voting savings stock has been on offer. However, even IRI has a finite number of assets in its portfolio. In some cases, its share sales have already reduced its control within reach of the decisive 50 per cent mark. In the case of Stet, IRI's latest transaction will take its holding of ordinary shares down to just 53 per cent and to a mere 1 per cent of the savings stock. At such levels, speculative interest could flourish as the next step would have to be a 'true' privatisation. With little sign of an improvement in IRI's earnings this year, that may no longer be so far off. The group is clearly keen to offload minority stakes in subsidiaries wherever possible, and the main barrier so far appears to be choosiness in the market, rather than its own reluctance to sell. Bankers would be much more enthusiastic if IRI, or any of the state groups, were to offer more than 49 per cent of a company's stock. But that decision will require political, rather than management, will, based on a clear privatisation policy. Even with Mr Amato on board, there is no sign of it so far.</p>

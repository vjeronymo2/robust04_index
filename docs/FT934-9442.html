			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Austria (6): An attractive deal is needed - Foreign policy: many voters are undecided about EC membership THE END of the Cold War and moves towards greater integration in the European Community have created radical new challenges for Austria. How it faces up to them will shape its prospects for years to come. Within a relatively short time, the country will have to decide whether or not to join the Community. The main political parties favour membership, as does about a third of the electorate; but many voters are still undecided, so the government will need to secure a sufficiently attractive deal from Brussels to win Austrian hearts and minds. The outcome of a referendum, next year or in 1995, is expected to be favourable, but there are many uncertainties. 'We've been kept waiting for such a long time, feelings are no longer ardent,' says Mrs Maria Schaumayer, governor of the central bank. At the same time, policymakers are reappraising Austria's relations with its former communist neighbours, whose drive towards market economies presents opportunities and dangers. After initial enthusiasm - Austrian exports to the region grew spectacularly, helping to postpone the impact of the world recession - Austria soon found itself besieged by cheap central and east European imports and a flow of refugees. The government introduced protective measures against sensitive imports, and for the first time in decades halted the flow of immigrants. Chancellor Franz Vranitzky says it was necessary to put a temporary halt to immigration. 'It is conjunctural. We had 8-9 per cent of immigrants already, and that is not a low rate by international comparison. We have to provide immigrants with housing, jobs and education.' Politicians are also concerned about conflicts and instability in the region. The wars in former Yugoslavia, and the west's (especially the EC's) ineffective attempts to end the crisis caused dismay in Vienna. The rise of nationalist sentiment worries Austrians brought up to value consenus almost above anything else. The outlook is not all bleak. Mr Johann Farnleitner, deputy general secretary of the Federal Economic Chamber, which represents employers, is enthusiastic about prospects in what he describes as Austria's historical hinterland. 'Eastern Europe presents a unique challenge for us. I am comfortable as far as our immediate neighbours are concerned. Sooner or later they will do very well,' he says. Meanwhile, Austria is vulnerable to competition from low-cost producers. 'We're close to a number of producers, and they want to sell things here. It means some products are offered at tremendously low prices,' he says. A tonne of cement produced in Austria sells at Dollars 90-Dollars 100, compared with Dollars 30 if produced in Ukraine, and Dollars 55-Dollars 60 from the Czech Republic. Even efficient domestic producers cannot match such prices. These problems can be solved by quiet negotiations, encouraging regional producers to raise their prices by guaranteeing them a set volume of sales, Mr Farnleitner says. This is good for producers, as it increases the value of their exports, and it helps to reduce the impact on domestic manufacturers. In the long run, it is also good for industry as a whole, because companies have access to cheaper inputs. Austria's economy is becoming more deeply integrated with that of its neighbours. It has more than 8,000 joint ventures in the area, including 4,000 in Hungary. It is an important investor in Slovakia, Slovenia and the Czech Republic. Co-operation with these countries raises Austria's competitiveness in world markets - the cost of 25 workers in a workshop in Austria can pay for 200 workers in a factory in Slovakia. Mr Farnleitner believes Austria's trade with the region could rapidly build up to 15-20 per cent of its total trade. 'We have to live with these countries, and the sooner they get rich, the richer we will get, too. There are 8m Austrians, and 50m neighbours who expect something from us. This is a far greater challenge than joining the European Community,' he says. Relations with the Community, however, will become increasingly important. Austria already has faced an argument with the Community over industrial subsidies, and it is entangled in a dispute over duties on Austrian exports to the EC of products partly made or finished in eastern Europe. The duties add 10 per cent costs for Austrian exporters, Mr Farnleitner says, but the row is unlikely to be resolved until Austria joins the EC. Negotiations on membership terms have begun in earnest, and Austria hopes they will be completed in time to join on January 1, 1995, though that may be over-optimistic. 'Negotiations were slow to start, but we are well on our way now,' says Ambassador Wolfgang Wolte, who heads the foreign affairs ministry's department for European integration. About half of the main issues have been resolved or are close to resolution, but the hardest part will be over agriculture, transit, and establishment of residences. Agriculture: Austria wants some form of protection/support for its Alpine farmers who, it says, face much more difficult conditions than farmers in the rest of the Community. Some will be worse off as a result of joining the EC, Mr Wolte says. 'We'll have to find some common ground. We need to convince the EC that it is more than an economic and agricultural question. It is part of our social fabric. We have to preserve these alpine regions.' Transit: This is a very sensitive issue for environment-conscious Austrians. Ideally, the government would like to keep an existing transit agreement, signed concurrently with the treaty establishing the European Economic Area in 1992. Traffic is expected to rise dramatically with Austria's former communist neighbours, and the government hopes it can win support for developing regional infrastructures. Failure to reach an agreement that safeguards Austrian sensibilities about the environment could jeopardise support in the referendum. Residences: Austria wants to limit the right of EC citizens to buy residences in Austria to those who have lived in the country for a minimum of five years. Some provinces want a more restrictive limit based on residence in the province for the previous five years. The fear is that parts of the country that are popular with tourists (the Tyrol, Salzburg, Vorarlberg and Carinthia) could be overwhelmed by the establishment of secondary residences that would destroy the character of the area and push property prices beyond the reach of Austrians. None of these issues will be easy to resolve, though Austrian officials believe negotiations could be completed by March, allowing a referendum by the summer, before a general election in October. If the negotiations drag on, the referendum will have to wait until after the elections. 'We're not giving up the date of January 1, 1995 (for membership) . We'll do everything we can to stick to that target. . . But in the end, it's not so much the date that matters, but the results (of the negotiations,' says Mr Wolte.</p>

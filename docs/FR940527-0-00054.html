			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With respect to Jefferson County, separate rulemaking is being conducted with respect to the plan for the other part of the Steubenville area, in Brooke County, West Virginia. A notice of proposed rulemaking was published on January 7, 1994, at 59 FR 988. As a comment on the January rulemaking on West Virginia's SIP, Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel submitted a revised modeling analysis. This material does not warrant revising the proposed evaluation of Ohio's submittal for several reasons. First, this material was submitted as a comment on a separate rulemaking, was not submitted with respect to this rulemaking or within the comment period for this rulemaking, and thus is not directly relevant to this rulemaking. Second, as discussed in more detail in a supplemental USEPA technical support document, a review of this material indicates that unjustified nonreference modeling and other inappropriate modeling techniques were used. Third, these materials do not dispute USEPA's judgment of Ohio's submittal, but instead seek to show that an alternate analysis would demonstrate the adequacy of the State's plan to assure attainment. Section 189(a)(1)(B) requires that the State submit a demonstration that its plan assures attainment (or that attainment is infeasible). For these reasons, Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel's comments do not alter USEPA's view that the State has not demonstrated that its plan for the Steubenville area assures attainment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Today's Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the review underlying the proposed action and a review of comments on that proposal, USEPA is today granting limited approval/limited disapproval of Ohio's particulate matter submittal. Specifically, USEPA is today making final the action proposed on August 3, 1993 (58 FR 41218). Thus, USEPA is approving all regulations in Chapter 3745&hyph;17 and Chapter 3745&hyph;75 except for Rule 3745&hyph;17&hyph;05 (which was not submitted) and except for Rule 3745&hyph;17&hyph;12(P)(6)(a) and Rule 3745&hyph;17&hyph;03(B)(10)(c) (pertaining to quench water quality). USEPA is disapproving Rule 3745&hyph;17&hyph;12(P)(6)(a) and Rule 3745&hyph;17&hyph;03(B)(10)(c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the other hand, USEPA is today issuing final limited disapproval of Ohio's plans for Cuyahoga and Jefferson Counties for failure to satisfy certain requirements of Part D. The bases for the disapproval of the Cuyahoga County plan are the failure to satisfy the requirement for RACM given in sections 189(a)(1)(C) and 172(c)(1) and the failure to assure attainment as required in section 189(a)(1)(B) and to satisfy the related requirements in sections 172(c)(2), 172(c)(3), and 172(c)(6). Although the notice of proposed rulemaking did not explicitly propose to find failure to assure attainment, the proposal made clear that assurance of attainment was contingent on remedying deficiencies in the State's quench water test method. Since this method was not revised, USEPA now finds that the State has not demonstrated that the plan assures attainment. The basis for the disapproval of the Jefferson County plan is the failure to satisfy the requirement to assure attainment given in sections 189(a)(1)(B) and the related requirements in sections 172(c)(2), 172(c)(3), and 172(c)(6), due to the use of inappropriate emissions estimates for Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel's basic oxygen furnace, coke ovens, and other emission sources, and various modeling issues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The notice of proposed rulemaking discusses alternatives by which the Cuyahoga County plan could satisfy the requirement for RACM. The State has committed in essence to implementing one of these alternatives, namely to advance Ford's compliance deadlines, such that all measures reflected in the submitted attainment demonstration are required by December 1993. The notice of proposed rulemaking also specifies remedies for the deficiency in the coke quenching test method. Thus, if the State submits rules that have been revised accordingly, USEPA can proceed directly to final approval of these revisions without further proposal, provided these revisions do not raise new issues. Such revisions would address all identified bases for disapproving the Cuyahoga County plan, and so such USEPA rulemaking could reverse today's limited disapproval of the Cuyahoga County plan and find all particulate matter SIP requirements addressed in today's rulemaking for this area satisfied. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Note that revisions to the Steubenville area plan would likely raise new issues and thus would likely require further proposed rulemaking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Other requirements, notably including the new source review program required in section 189(a)(1)(A) and 173 and the contingency plan required in section 172(c)(9), are not addressed in today's rulemaking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, USEPA is today making a final determination on particulate matter precursors consistent with its proposed determination. Specifically, USEPA is today determining that precursors do not contribute significantly to violations of the particulate matter standards in Ohio. As a result, the otherwise applicable provision of Section 189(e) that particulate matter precursor sources must meet the same control requirements as primary sources of particulate matter does not apply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This disapproval constitutes a disapproval under section 179(a)(2) of the Act (see generally 57 FR 13566&hyph;67). As provided under section 179(a) of the Act, one of two sanctions in Section 179(b) is to take effect 18 months from the publication of this final rule unless the relevant deficiencies are corrected in the meantime. The second sanction in Section 179(b) is to take effect 24 months from the publication of this final rule, again unless the relevant deficiencies are corrected in the meantime. These two sanctions are (1) A requirement for two-to-one new source review offsets for sources in or near the Cuyahoga and Jefferson County nonattainment areas and, (2) a sanction against highway funding in these two areas. Separate rulemaking is being conducted to determine which of these sanctions would apply first and to address related questions concerning the effectuation of such sanctions. (See the notice of proposed rulemaking dated October 1, 1993 (58 FR 51270).) Any sanction USEPA imposes must remain in place until USEPA determines that the deficiency has been corrected. This disapproval also triggers the requirement for USEPA to impose a federal implementation plan under section 110(c)(1) of the Act if the deficiencies are not corrected within 2 years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.) Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Act forbids USEPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Union Electric Co.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> USEPA,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action has been classified as a Table Two action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), based on revised SIP processing review tables approved by the Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation on October 4, 1993 (Michael Shapiro's memorandum to Regional Administrators). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget waived Tables Two and Three SIP revisions (54 FR 222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of 2 years. USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continued in effect under Executive Order 12866, which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

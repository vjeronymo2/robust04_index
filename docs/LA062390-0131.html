			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA;  </P> <P> TRASH-RATE INCREASE TO PAY FOR RECYCLING  </P> <P> Trash rates will be going up almost $2 a month starting July 1 to pay for a new  recycling program.  </P> <P> Monthly trash rates will increase from $7.23 to $9.18 one month before the  recycling program starts Aug. 1.  </P> <P> The program will initially require residents to separate garbage into  containers provided by the city.  </P> <P> Orange-colored bins will be used for glass and plastic containers, and  newspapers are to be placed on top of these bins, said City Manager Lee Risner.  Non-recyclables will be placed in another container.  </P> <P> Trash collection is handled by Western Waste Industries, which will sell the  recyclable materials and give the proceeds to the city.  </P> <P> The city will soon begin separating its clippings of greenery and grass from  regular trash. The materials will be compacted, but composting may be attempted  in the future, Risner said.  </P> <P> The city is required by state law to complete a study of local waste by the end  of the year.  </P> <P> Risner expects revenues from the sale of recycled materials to cover the cost  of the required study.

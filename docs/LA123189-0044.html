			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHANGES, CUTBACKS ALLOW SAN PEDRO HOSPITAL TO CUT ITS DEFICIT;  </P> <P> MEDICINE: 'TURNAROUND HAS COME,' PRESIDENT ASSERTS. CRITICS SAY THE WORST OF  THE FISCAL CRISIS MAY BE OVER.  </P> <P> The financially ailing San Pedro Peninsula Hospital appears to be well on the  way to healing itself.  </P> <P> The community hospital was saddled with accumulated losses of $9 million  earlier in the year, but is expected to end 1989 having cut that deficit to no  more than $1.5 million. The year's budget was $95 million.  </P> <P> The change in the financial picture has come about through a number of efforts:  Employees were laid off. Some costly or money-losing programs -- such as  inpatient psychiatry and the residence training of family-practice physicians  -- were cut. Services that are likely to bring in more business -- such as a  cardiovascular surgery center and a state-of-the-art obstetrics unit -- are  being created or expanded.  </P> <P> Although the precise end-of-year deficit won't be known until an official audit  is done in March, "the turnaround has come," hospital President John Wilson  said.  </P> <P> Dr. Larry Orosz, board chairman and hospital emergency room chief, agreed.  "We've come a long way in the last seven or eight months," he said. He said he  is unhappy that the hospital is ending the year still in the red, "but you  can't do things overnight."  </P> <P> Two staff physicians once critical of the hospital's management, Dr. Philip  Geller and Dr. Phillip Schoenwetter, said they believe -- if somewhat guardedly  -- that the hospital is putting its past behind it.  </P> <P> "We're a long way from being out of the woods, but we're doing better," Geller  said.  </P> <P> "They're doing the best they can," Schoenwetter observed.  </P> <P> Pointing to changes that include placing staff physicians on board committees  and improving communications with the public, hospital leaders say a feeling of  teamwork and openness has come to the facility, which earlier this year was  alive with discontent.  </P> <P> After recording the first financial losses in its history, the 64-year-old  hospital in January replaced its president with Wilson and brought in the  national accounting firm of Ernst &amp; Whinney (now Ernst &amp; Young) to  develop a plan to get the hospital out of the red.  </P> <P> Some staff physicians and other employees faulted the board for not recognizing  and solving the financial and operational problems as they developed,  questioning whether the board was capable of running the hospital.  </P> <P> "We were concerned that if the board could not see the facts of life, what else  were they missing," Schoenwetter said.  </P> <P> The hospital's well-publicized troubles became San Pedro's equivalent of a TV  soap opera during the first few months of the year. Critics charged that a few  entrenched physicians with lucrative service contracts controlled the hospital,  asserting that it could be facing bankruptcy or a takeover by a for-profit  chain.  </P> <P> Although the hospital leadership contended it already was acting to solve the  financial problems, dissident members of the community corporation that owns  the hospital and elects the board succeeded in forcing a special corporate  meeting in March.  </P> <P> Although the dissidents failed to replace the 15-member hospital board, Geller  and Schoenwetter believe they were a catalyst the hospital needed. Geller said  putting a public spotlight on the board made it "move faster than it might have  ordinarily."  </P> <P> So far, the financial turnaround has come largely through personnel and service  cuts recommended by Ernst &amp; Whinney, which concluded that the hospital was  mismanaged, overstaffed and lacked strong services that would attract patients  and allow it to fend off competition from other hospitals. Several departments  were consolidated, 129 people were laid off and a flexible staffing system was  established to allow the hospital to maintain a daily staff level based on  patient volume.  </P> <P> With public and private insurers tightening up on reimbursements and demanding  less hospitalization and more outpatient care, "a smaller, mobile force is the  way you have to do it," Schoenwetter said.  </P> <P> In addition to calling for cuts, Ernst &amp; Whinney also said that San Pedro  had to strengthen itself as a community hospital by upgrading key services and  moving toward specialties such as cardiac surgery.  </P> <P> Dr. Bruce Goldreyer, who is chief of staff, said the way to get more physicians  to use a hospital is to "provide them with the facilities that they need."  </P> <P> The hospital will spend $2.5 million to upgrade maternity care with what Wilson  called a "state-of-the-art" obstetrics center. It will be financed through the  sale of excess hospital property.  </P> <P> In a $1.5-million program, the hospital will open a cardiovascular surgery  center in October. Ernst &amp; Whinney concluded that this service could add $1  million a year to hospital profits, according to officials.  </P> <P> Responding to the trend toward outpatient care, San Pedro Hospital in January  will open a 15-bed ambulatory center for short-stay surgical procedures. The  hospital has been providing this outpatient service, but it will be able to  accommodate nearly twice as many patients in a more comfortable setting,  Goldreyer said.  </P> <P> A 24-hour industrial accident center has been opened next to the emergency  room. Orosz said it should appeal to employers "because they can be assured  care always will be available."  </P> <P> Newspaper advertising and direct mail -- concentrated on San Pedro, the Palos  Verdes Peninsula, Harbor City and Lomita -- are being used to attract more  patients.  </P> <P> In April, the hospital will present a one-year progress report to community  corporation members.  </P> <P> Although hospital leaders say they have parted the sea of red ink without  reducing quality, Geller and Schoenwetter contend that recovery has had a  price, including morale problems stemming from the loss of staff.  </P> <P> "It's a transition time," Schoenwetter said. "There are insecurities on the  part of the staff and physical disruptions as new facilities are being put in  and renovations are going on."  </P> <P> For his part, Wilson said he believes the success of this year's hospital  fund-raising drive amounts to a vote of confidence. More than $3 million,  including a single $1-million gift from an anonymous benefactor, was raised by  the hospital foundation. Last year, the total was $863,000. He said months of  adverse publicity might have been expected to dampen the drive. Instead, he  said, the hospital had "its biggest year ever."  </P></p>

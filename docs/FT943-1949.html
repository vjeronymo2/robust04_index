			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Central bank set to regulate Irish SE The Central Bank of Ireland is to take over regulation of the country's stock market after the splitting of the Irish stock exchange from the London stock exchange, scheduled for next April, the government announced yesterday. Under the Stock Exchange Act due to become law by the end of this year, the newly independent Irish stock exchange and its 10-member firms will have to apply to the Central Bank for permission to trade. However during the transition period they will be considered as approved while their applications are being dealt with. Under the new Act, which fulfils Ireland's EU obligation to regulate its own stock market, firms authorised in other EU states will be able to operate in Ireland and firms authorised in Ireland will have the right to operate in other EU states. In order to be approved the Irish stock exchange will have to become a limited company and its current council, made up of representatives of member firms will be replaced by a new board. The board will have to 'represent a balance between the interests of member firms and stock exchange users and public interests and must include enough independent members to promote the protection of investors and the maintenance of proper standards,' according to the Irish minister for finance, Mr Bertie Ahern, who launched the bill yesterday. The Central Bank will be able to block appointments to the new board, said Mr Ahern. The rules of the Irish stock exchange will have to be approved by the Central Bank and the bank will be able to investigate breaches of them. The Irish stock exchange has indicated that it intends to adhere to the rules of the London stock exchange following the split. Breaches of these rules are currently dealt with under the disciplinary procedures of the London stock exchange. The Central Bank will also be able to impose its own conditions and regulations on the exchange and investigate breaches of them. Fines of up to IR500,000 (Dollars 780,000) may be imposed for breaches of Central Bank conditions and regulations while fines of IR1m and prison sentences of up to 10 years may be imposed of breaches of the Stock Exchange Act itself. The bank will also have the power to object to the acquisition or disposal of significant shareholdings in the Stock Exchange or member firms.</p>

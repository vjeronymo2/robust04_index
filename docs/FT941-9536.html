			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Lloyd's Names reject Pounds 900m on offer Lossmaking Lloyd's Names decisively rejected the insurance market's Pounds 900m settlement offer yesterday, and so signalled their intentions to pursue compensation through court action. Mr David Rowland, chairman of Lloyd's, said: 'I regret the final result. Litigation is an untidy, lengthy and expensive route. It may yield benefit to some who have chosen it, but I fear that others will be disappointed in that course.' Mr Peter Middleton, Lloyd's chief executive, said: 'There are still people who believe we'll make a new offer, but it's dead and finished.' Only 38 per cent of the value of the offer was taken up by Names, the individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the market, leaving Lloyd's short of its minimum 70 per cent target. 'The offer has therefore lapsed and the forms of assent will be destroyed,' said Mr Rowland in a letter to Names. A consequence of the rejection was the decision by JIB Group to liquidate one of its Lloyd's agency subsidiaries as a result of its contingent liabilities stemming from Names' legal actions. Mr Middleton said he had been surprised by the number of individual acceptances, which had exceeded 50 per cent - 12,103 out of 23,488 Names. Lloyd's could not commit part of the central fund - which meets claims when Names are unable to fulfil their obligations - to any future deal. Of the Pounds 900m on offer until yesterday, Pounds 450m was from the fund. Errors and omissions insurers, which cover agents against legal awards for negligence, would have provided most of the balance. Although the offer was weighted in favour of Names who were members of syndicates specialising in 'spiral' reinsurance - in which syndicates and companies cover each others' high-level catastrophe losses - their decision was a decisive factor in the deal's failure. 'It was those syndicate action groups who, by not accepting the offer and so indicating their determination to continue the litigation, exerted most influence on the outcome,' said Mr Rowland. A case by some 3,000 Gooda Walker Names - the biggest of the legal actions under consideration - is to come before the courts in April. Mr Tom Benyon, a director of the Society of Names, which represents lossmakers, said: 'Names are moving from one vale of tears to another, from a flawed offer to expensive litigation.'

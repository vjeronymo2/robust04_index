			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / International Company News: JAL plans hiring freeze for flight attendants JAPAN Airlines, the country's largest carrier, plans to cancel its annual intake of Japanese flight attendants for next spring as a continuing downturn in passenger has led to an intensification of its cost-cutting drive. JAL has been hit by a fall of almost one-fifth in the number of business and first class passengers last year as Japanese companies have sought to cut costs. The recruiting freeze, the first since 1976, follows the delayed start of training for this year's intake of 386 flight attendants, who are likely to start in September. The airline is still under pressure to cut costs to reach its goal of breaking even this year as it has forecast a pre-tax loss of Y50bn (Dollars 438.6m) for the year to March, compared with a Y6bn loss in the previous year. JAL has suspended its dividend payment. Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries (IHI), a leading Japanese heavy machinery maker, is to cut about 500 jobs in its aircraft engine division by the fiscal year ending March 1997, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo. The company expects to reduce jobs by hiring fewer recruits, relocating employees and through attrition. IHI blamed Japan's cut in defence spending, the airline recession and the sharp appreciation of the yen.</p>

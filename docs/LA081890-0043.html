			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METAL GRANDMOTHER  </P> <P> About Chuck Philips' Aug. 7 article, " 'My Heart Aches,' Mothers in Judas  Priest Trial Tell of Their Five-Year Ordeal": How chilling that these women  blame music for their own failure to "do it" (go to therapy themselves).  </P> <P> I worked for five years with disturbed teen-agers.  </P> <P> Some of the Christians with whom I worked were so upset by this music that as  an open-minded, 60-year-old grandma, I got earphones to try to form my own  opinion. Some of the lyrics were quite philosophical and poetic. The music to  me offered a release -- a joyous celebration and outlet. I began to go to  concerts.  </P> <P> This music offers an outlet for kids filled with hypocritical dogma from  parents who are cruel, narrow and ignorant.  </P> <P> We had 70 kids where I worked. Their parents never tried to change themselves;  instead they blamed anything that they could to get off the hook themselves.  </P> <P> R. CRAFTS  </P> <P> Venice  </P></p>

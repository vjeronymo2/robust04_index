			<p>BFN     [Text] Knin, 26 Jun (TANJUG) -- Branko Vojnica, speaker of  the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK] assembly, has said that  "relations with Croatia have become very fragile and tense."    "Every day we listen to the threats of Croatian leaders that  they will take Krajina by force. We do not underestimate these  threats, although in most cases they are caused by internal  instability in the Republic of Croatia and by the fact that  President Tudjman himself is trying to mobilize Croats  politically and in general, hoping to remain in power in this  way," Vojnica told a TANJUG correspondent. He added: "The fact  that they are arming themselves with fighter planes and  helicopters is also not unknown to us."    "We have convened a session of the assembly for 1 July and  one of the items on the agenda -- apart from revisions of  certain laws relating to the system -- will be an initiative of  the assembly's defense committee; that is, our stand that the  RSK army must be given its place in a system which would  guarantee its citizens peace and stability and which would  guarantee that Croatia's threats will not be realized," the RSK  parliament speaker declared. He added: "The priority task of  the RSK assembly and government is the defense system and the  consolidation of ties with Serbia, Montenegro, and the Srpska  republic."    Commenting on RSK prime minister Borislav Mikelic's visit to  Italy, Vojnica said: "The aim of the visit is to examine  economic ties and exchange views on issues of mutual interest.  We do not intend to bypass the issue of the provisions of the  Ossimo Agreement. We support Italy's stands on the revision of  the Ossimo Agreement; this has now become a public issue in  Italy. We are against manipulation by anyone where Yugoslavia  is concerned and where the guarantees that existed earlier are  concerned. Everything has been disrupted, no one recognizes  Yugoslavia, and horrific sanctions have been imposed upon it."</p>

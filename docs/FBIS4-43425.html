			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, June 15 (AFP) -- French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe called Wednesday [15 June] for the West to take a  strong line with North Korea for its defiance over nuclear  inspections, warning that the region was a "powder-keg."    Arguing that attempts at negotiation with Pyongyang had  failed, he said: "We are insisting that the West unite behind a  strong position because the risks are considerable. If we  continue to let North Korea develop its nuclear arms potential,  it risks destabilizing the whole of the Korean peninsula and the  region," he said, after a meeting with the Foreign Affairs  Commission of the National Assembly.    "Seoul is 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the demarcation  line,  so there are all the elements of a powder-keg," he said. "We  need a rapid and clear display of the determination of the  international community," he said, adding that it could not "let  North Korea continue to violate its international commitments."    He spoke as the United States prepares to present a  resolution seeking UN sanctions against North Korea.</p>

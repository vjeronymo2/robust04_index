			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 7 KYODO -- A senior Foreign Ministry  official Thursday [7 April] denied suspicion by some countries  that Japan may arm with nuclear weapons now that it has launched  the new plutonium-fueled fast breeder reactor "Monju," which  produces more plutonium than it uses.    "Japan has properly accepted (international) nuclear  inspections," said the official on the condition of anonymity.  "Nuclear armament will not benefit Japan...I can understand some  countries think Japan will arm with nuclear weapons if North  Korea does so."    The official said Japan must clear the suspicion on such  occasions as summit meetings and foreign ministerial meetings  with every country.    Earlier the same day, North Korea accused Japan of promoting  a plan to become a nuclear power, according to the official  KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (KCNA).    "The commissioning of Monju fully reveals Japan's  undisguised  scheme to become a nuclear power by securing a large quantity of  plutonium for itself and manufacturing nuclear weapons any  moment," the KCNA said.    Monju reached criticality Tuesday morning in Tsuruga, Fukui  Prefecture, on the Sea of Japan coast. Criticality is the point  at which the reaction in the reactor's fissionable material is  sufficient to sustain a chain reaction.    Some environmentalists have criticized the operation of  Monju  partly because plutonium can be used to produce nuclear weapons.</p>

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa pact talks to start in April WORLD COCOA markets were unimpressed yesterday by the decision of the International Cocoa Organisation to go ahead with negotiations in Geneva in April for a new agreement, complete with economic clauses. The ICCO Council announced late on Friday that it would ask the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development to convene a meeting from April 21 to May 1. However, after a week of talks the ICCO was unable to agree on the exact form of economic measures a new agreement would employ to support the market, which has declined to historic lows in real terms since its buffer stock scheme was frozen in February 1988. Most of last week the producers were hanging on to the idea of using export quotas; consumers were adamant that only a withholding scheme should be considered. The compromise wording of the ICCO statement said that the new agreement 'should be built upon production policy and supply management.' A scheme for withholding 120,000 tonnes of cocoa was included in the 1986 cocoa agreement on which any new agreement will be based. However, several moves to implement the withholding scheme once the ICCO buffer stock reached the maximum permitted 250,000 tonnes came to naught. Potential stumbling blocks for a new agreement include the debt of Dollars 145m still owed to the buffer stock by producers, and the fact that the US, the biggest cocoa consumer, does not belong to the organisation. Yesterday London's May cocoa contract touched a six-month low of Pounds 684 a tonne in early trading before closing at Pounds 691, down Pounds 1 on the day.</p>

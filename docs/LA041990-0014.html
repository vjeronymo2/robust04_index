			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> CONDITIONS PUT ON DEVELOPMENT OF MARINELAND SITE  </P> <P> Rancho Palos Verdes council members Tuesday night voted 3 to 2 to require the  Monaghan Co. to set aside land for open space if any oceanfront homes are built  on the former Marineland site. Over the objections of the developer, the  council also limited the number of homes that could be built.  </P> <P> The council did not approve any development plans but agreed to allow the  company to seek a zoning change that would allow residential construction on  the 102-acre site, which is currently designated for commercial and  recreational use. A hotel and golf course are also planned for the property.  </P> <P> However, the council said no more than 45 homes on one-acre lots could be  constructed. And the Arizona-based developer must replace any open space lost  to the project with a comparable amount of open space elsewhere.  </P> <P> Although it is not specifically spelled out by the city on its list of  conditions, that land would presumably come from 312 acres Monaghan owns in an  area of the city known as the Filiorum. The area is named after a company that  once owned the land.  </P> <P> Monaghan had wanted to build 65 homes on the Marineland site and offered to  give the city 100 acres of unspecified land in the Filiorum area to preserve as  open space in return. The company has argued that a smaller number of homes  would make the entire project economically unattractive.  </P> <P> "The staff asked us to come in with our bottom line, and we did," company  spokeswoman Joan Hanley said Wednesday. "We are looking at our options."  </P> <P> Tuesday's council action was required under state law because the proposed  zoning change would alter the city's General Plan. Even if the City Council  eventually approves a zone change, Monaghan would also need state Coastal  Commission approval to build homes on the property.  </P> <P> Council members have previously opposed building any homes on the property  because of its present zoning. The city is also concerned that building homes  on the site would restrict public access to the coastline.  </P> <P> "I don't think it's the City Council's responsibility to enhance Mr. (James)  Monaghan's net worth at the expense of the community," Councilman Douglas  Hinchliffe said during the public hearing that preceded the council's vote.  </P> <P> Before the meeting, Councilman Robert E. Ryan said the open space requirements  represent a good compromise for both sides, even though he still opposes  building any homes on the land.  </P> <P> Monaghan "bought that land knowing the rules and now he is crying about it,"  Ryan said. "Well, if it is unacceptable to him, he can sell out or do something  with it."  </P> <P> Mayor Mel Hughes and Councilman John McTaggart voted against allowing Monaghan  to seek the zone change. Both said they felt the city's guidelines left too  many questions unanswered.  </P> <P> Monaghan purchased the property in May, 1987, 90 days after the landmark  aquatic park was closed. The company originally said it wanted to construct a  1,070-room hotel on the land, a proposal that met with resistance by some  residents, who feared such a large hotel would create traffic and other  problems.  </P> <P> However, last December the company informed city officials it was willing to  scale back the proposed hotel to 495 rooms if it were allowed to build homes.  </P> <P> Hanley said that in addition to the 100 acres, the company was also willing to  give up its rights to build any residences in the entire Filiorum area,  although it does want to build a private country club and golf course there.  </P> <P> All but about 25 of the 315 acres Monaghan owns in the area is situated in a  building moratorium zone because of past landslides in the general area. Under  the guidelines imposed on the company, any land it might give the city in  exchange for building oceanfront homes must be outside the moratorium area.  </P></p>

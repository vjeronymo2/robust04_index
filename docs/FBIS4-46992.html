			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Aivars Millers, President of the Limited </F> Liability Company Industrial Development Agency, by Vilis  Selecks: "Industry: Yesterday, Today. And Tomorrow? A. Millers:  I Think This Administration Is Leftist"]    [Text]    [Selecks] Let us begin, Mr. Millers, with a brief look at  the  past. Following the events of August, 1991, you became Minister  of Industry and Energy. How do you now rate your job as Minister?    [Millers] That was a time when, like so many others, I  performed my job with a great deal of enthusiasm, not thinking  about resources, the family, and not considering what would  happen when I no longer had authority and was no longer needed  by anyone. Of course, I do not regret the two years I spent as  Minister, because they opened up other horizons. I gained a much  wider circle of acquaintances. This keeps me alive and working  at present. I don't want to bring up my personal accomplishments  in the Ministry. We were working as a collective, and if  something valuable was accomplished, then it was by joint  effort. Our capabilities were predetermined by the conditions or  rules of the game.    First of all, I should mention the existing, or more often  non-existing legislation, which was dependent on the Supreme  Council's activities. Second, there was the matter of the  resources allotted to us to carry out the resolutions and  directives of the Supreme Council. I was uncomfortable with  these game rules. But we were unable to change them.    What were we being asked to do most often? Create favorable  conditions for business activities. That was our Ministry's main  objective. What to produce, in what volume, and how to  accomplish this -- these were not our concerns.    [Selecks] What do you feel are your main accomplishments?  What was done correctly?    [Millers] I think this was to replace the management staff  in  the industrial concerns. As you know, many plant managers were  against Latvian independence. I had no objections to them as  people, but they could not remain as managers of state property,  if at one time they had been opposed to this state.    It should be noted that the public's negative opinions about  industry were, to a great extent, related to the activities of  these plant managers.    This was a very difficult and unrewarding job, because it  was  necessary to go and say -- we no longer need your services. This  had to be told to managers who had worked in their positions for  many years. We made a effort to follow the rule -- while  changing the management, the plant's activities must not be  allowed to deteriorate. Overall, about 70 percent of the largest  concerns received new directors. At that time, there were many  political leaders -- quite a bit more than necessary. But there  was a lack of management specialists. Therefore, it was  difficult to find new plant directors. I would have been unable  to accomplish this if the Ministry had not operated as a unified  team. At present, we can see that the change in management has  been unsuccessful in only three or four cases.    [Selecks] At present, we are hearing claims that the  Ministry  of Industry has destroyed industry...    [Millers] The decline of industry was apparently an  independent process. We were unable to slow it down, although we  tried. Of course, to a large extent, it was influenced by the  Supreme Council. The Ministry proposed various reforms, but was  unable to realize them because the Supreme Council rejected  them. For example, we wanted to replace Moscow's centralized  board with a collective industrial board, and studied foreign  experience with such a measure. But the Supreme Council, by  adopting the law on the state enterprise board rejected our  proposal. Supposedly, bureaucrats would interfere with the  director performing his job. In this matter, the viewpoints of  Mr. Kehris and those of the pro-interfront plant directors  coincided. We were unsuccessful in fending them off. This is  because the viewpoints of the deputies were such as they were in  the particular situation. Changing them was impossible. The  concept could not be realized because it was not accepted by the  public nor supported by the deputies in parliament. All the  same, such a concept did not become realized.    [Selecks] But the sudden decline in industry was not only  induced by the mistakes of the Supreme Council.    [Millers] Once again, I stress that it was an independent  process, influenced by various factors. After the political  changes in Latvia, we were left without work, and our products  had no buying market. Engineers and managers were not prepared  to reorient themselves quickly. It was necessary to develop  contacts with the West, but our enterprises did not know how to  purchase assembly components, nor how to sell completed  products. For example, for many years, "Radiotehnika" produced  one grade of equipment for the Soviet Union. From the latter, we  received many components, which we assembled and sent back as a  completed product. Naturally, the entire production line fell  apart when this contact was lost. That was an unavoidable  process. If we want to save and develop radioelectronics in  Latvia, which, in my opinion, has potential, then we have to  reorient ourselves on the West -- buy components from them,  produce high-quality goods, which would be on the same level,  qualitatively, as the imports, which have flooded all of our  stores. There is one more request -- for the state to protect  enterprises that are producing goods for internal consumption.    [Selecks] In what manner?    [Millers] The same manner as in other countries. In this  respect, there are many measures available. Including taxes and  customs. The main thing is for people to have jobs. If there is  work, a person can get by, and he also pays taxes. Thus, there  are resources for social assistance, education. We will not  become rich only by selling. For this reason, every country  protects its market, thus protecting the jobs of its people.    [Selecks] Supposedly, Latvia's industry has very little  potential, and therefore, we must refocus on trade, financing.  What do you say about this?    [Millers] I do not agree. The state cannot exist without  manufacturing. In all developed countries, about 25 to 30  percent of the workforce is involved in manufacturing. That is  the main source of financial income. It should be the same in  Latvia. Also, agriculture is necessary. If only to promote a  uniform distribution of residents throughout the country. It  will be necessary to subsidize agriculture, and the resources  for these subsidies can only come from manufacturing. Therefore,  we must consider its development.    [Selecks] But the Swiss are given as an example of major  banking potential.    [Millers] We should obtain more objective and correct  information about Switzerland. Even there, 30 percent of the  workforce is employed in industry. This is a paradox for a  nation, which everyone only considers to be a banking and  financial paradise. Yet, even this small country cannot get  along without industry.    [Selecks] Thus, you feel that Latvia's industry could  develop, if the state creates a system for protecting the local  market.    [Millers] That is the first requirement. But it is not the  only one. Another important condition is a good taxation  policy. Right now, Latvia is moving in a ridiculous  direction. The theory predominates that -- the greater the  taxes, the larger the budget. I cannot agree with this. I wonder  why such thinking is predominant in economics. Unfortunately, it  was strong even under the Godmanis administration. Budgetary  problems are constantly being solved by measures to increase  taxes. There are a sufficient number of examples in the world,  which show the absurdity of this psychology. Even in such a  small country as Cypress. What is the sales tax there? Only 8  percent. In addition, there is a great deal of easement for  those enterprises that wish to start up activities, invest  capital, create new jobs. The so-called tax-exempt  days are extended even to 10 to 20 years, relative to the  invested capital and number of jobs created.    When starting a business in Latvia, all investments must be  made from the profits remaining after you have paid off earnings  and other taxes. Sales tax -- 18 percent, earnings tax -- 25  percent (incidentally, this is one of the highest tax rates in  all Europe), social taxes -- 37 percent, etc. Under such  conditions, no foreigner will start a business in Latvia. The  gains he receives from cheap labor do not balance out the losses  created by high taxes. Thus, there is no basis for the hope of  foreign investments. In addition, the taxation policy is  constantly changing, which creates supplemental difficulties.    [Selecks] How do you feel about the optimistic prediction  that a growth in manufacturing volume is expected this year?    [Millers] In my opinion, there is no basis for any  discussion  of a growth in manufacturing volume at present. The  administration, already last year, promised to create the State  Property Fund, Privatization Agency, and much more to promote  the development of manufacturing. Of course, we can see that  these promises have not been fulfilled. This means that the  conditions for an upswing have not been created, and therefore  there is no basis for a promising outlook on the future.  Industrial development will start when attitudes towards  manufacturing are changed. I have good contacts with many plant  directors, and I know that the current situation in industry has  not improved, because many places are only working three or four  days per week. Naturally, many enterprise managers have now  learned how to overcome the problems with selling their goods.  But they have done so by dismissing many workers. The number of  workers in manufacturing has declined by 30 or 40 percent. We  are working less and producing less.    Another situation, which reinforces pessimism, is that  privatization has been halted. In the past year, nothing has  moved ahead.    [Selecks] We have to conclude that there is no perceptible  movement towards a market economy, or capitalism. Therefore,  instead -- are we preserving socialism?    [Millers] I think this administration is leftist. I think  they are less competent than the preceding administration. Some  sort of reforms were started before the necessary prerequisites  were prepared. The Cabinet of Ministers does not comprehend the  true status of the situation. I feel that it was a huge mistake  to eliminate the Ministry of Industry. In two years, we had  collected a competent group of people. These people were not  stagnates, but rather specialists with practical work experience  in business. In connection with the new reforms, they were all  dismissed. I feel that in the administration's circle, there are  very few people who are orientated in economics, let alone  industry. How can you be a manager if you have never even  walked through a single business enterprise? Theory  is one matter, but -- practice is completely something else.  When I accepted becoming Minister, I realized that this was a  very sudden leap forward in my career. I was not ready for this  and only accepted the proposal because I could not recommend  anyone else in my place. I had to study long and hard to learn  the specifics of my duties. The same thing happened with many  other officials, who had suddenly jumped up the career ladder,  without actually being prepared to do so. At that time, such  actions could be understood and explained. Frankly speaking, it  was a revolutionary situation, and it was necessary to act  quickly and extraordinarily. But why does everything now have to  be started all over again? That I don't understand.    [Selecks] Apparently, this is in following with the party  loyalty principle. New forces have come to power, and they are  attempting to place their own people in all positions of  authority.    [Millers] Then, obviously, there is something wrong with the  activities of the party, because rational, management-oriented  people do not become party hacks. Politics, naturally, is  related to economics. Unfortunately, for us, politics generally  pertain to such questions as the citizenship law, national  relations. In normal countries, politics deal with methods  through which questions of economics are resolved, primarily the  question of taxes, because that is the basis of all other  questions. The attitude towards taxes shows how large a role you  are granting to the state, for the community pot, and  it determines how leftist or rightist you are. I hope that  Latvia will understand the same with its politics, as does the  whole world.    [Selecks] How would you explain that very few Latvians are  engaging in business activities?    [Millers] Not by saying that the Latvian is lazier or  dumber,  as is often heard said. Present day business is such that it  scares away Latvians. The first reason is taxes,  which we already discussed. They are so high that a business  which pays them honestly cannot survive. It becomes necessary to  hide profits, to balance on the edge of breaking the law. Such a  situation is not acceptable to many Latvians. A second factor,  which scares them, is the crime situation. There is no hiding  that. Financial authorities, various police and security forces  are associated with criminal circles in some way, growing  together. Working in such a situation, it is necessary to  maintain your bearings, to know how to maneuver, in order to  protect your earnings and your life. It is not easy to enter  this circle from the outside. There are no instructions or  lessons. And the third condition -- is corruption. I must admit  that we could not resolve this problem in the preceding  administration. But now, corruption has increased  dramatically. Growing dramatically! Furthermore, this is all  obvious to the naked eye. It is one of the factors that promotes  non-payment of taxes and other violations of law. It is not  permissible that laws are written for some, but -- not for  others. If an official takes bribes, that means I do not have  to pay taxes.    These three factors, in my opinion, are the main reason why  Latvians shy away from business. If the former were to  disappear, or at least decline, then Latvians could also start a  business and achieve success. The many Latvians living in the  West have demonstrated that, under civilized circumstances,  members of our nationality are also able to be successful and  prosperous businessmen. But business in Latvia is such that it  is incompatible with the Latvian mentality. Those who are  involved in it must feel some discomfort, because they have to  make certain compromises.</p>

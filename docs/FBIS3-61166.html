However the drop that made the cup run over was a firefight  in central Tallinn during the middle of the day.    Mrs. Parek's special force, K Command, which consists of  policemen who always appear in black masks, launched a  formidable attack last week. On Friday at 1400 hours they lay in  wait on Parnu Street, right next to a hospital. The aim was to  seize Major Asso Kommer, chief of the notorious disbanded  Estonian commando company. He came along the street accompanied  by his three bodyguards.    When the police in the black masks stormed across the street  they were met by shots from automatic weapons. Long salvos were  fired by both sides and passersby had to fling themselves  headlong to the ground, according to eyewitnesses. Two police  officers were badly wounded. At first Kommer and his gang  managed to escape. Later they were seized and mistreated during  the arrest. It was a miracle that no innocent bystanders were  killed or wounded, eyewitnesses say.    K Command's ambush was regarded as so foolhardy that Parek  was forced to resign. Prime Minister Mart Laar is now also  acting as interior minister until a new minister is appointed.    Parek was one of four candidates in last year's presidential  election. She was also one of the last political prisoners in  Estonia. In the past Parek urged Estonian citizens to obtain  licenses for firearms and arm themselves. It is now a big  problem in Estonia that many people are running around with  firearms in their pockets, most of them illegal.    After some 50 car bombings this year alone and a great many  corpses in the Mafia wars, citizens are now anxious and want the  government to take strong steps.</p>

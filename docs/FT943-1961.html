			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of International Equity Offerings (9): Not a year for breaking records - UK rights issues are unlikely to match the 1993 total A new wave of rights issues seems likely if the UK equity market regains its strength this autumn. Institutions and dealers were kept busy in the first half of this year as the market digested substantial cash calls from companies such as industrial conglomerate Williams Holdings; Lasmo, the oil exploration and production company which later fought off a bid by Enterprise Oil; GKN, the engineering and industrial services group which won control of Westland in a takeover that was partly funded by a rights issue; and Eurotunnel. The total for the first six months was just over Pounds 5bn. However, as was the case with a number of new issues, plans for several rights issues are believed to have been aborted as the London stock market slipped back. Despite some signs of subsequent market recovery, analysts say that total funds raised through rights issues this year are unlikely to match last year's record total of Pounds 11.5bn. Expectations for the end of this year hover around Pounds 9bn. Among the reasons given for the decline, the main one is the improved health of many companies as the UK economic recovery has started to take hold. In addition, better cash flow in the past two years has reduced pressure on companies to seek funds from investors to help 'straighten' the balance sheet. Mr Trevor Laugharne, UK strategist at Kleinwort Benson, says: 'The 10 to 20 per cent improvement in cash flows we have seen in recent months, especially in the smaller and medium companies, has certainly been a factor in reducing the need for a rights issue.' This has left the way clear for issues made to fund an acquisition. But even here, analysts say companies have been slower than usual in taking this path to expansion because many have instead chosen to reduce high debt levels incurred during the recession before considering future expansion plans. Another reason for the possible reduction of the flow of issues is 'indigestion' resulting from a glut which has used up the markets' capacity to underwrite further issues. There are fears in some quarters that with major flotations, such as the third and final payment for the sale of BT shares in the next month, companies that wish to make rights issues may meet a less than enthusiastic response. New issues that were pulled at the height of the downturn could also add to the costs for institutions. Mr Laugharne also highlights other demands on institutions which may prevent them from taking on rights issues from UK companies. These include the favourable yields now on offer from bonds and UK gilts returns that can outweigh those that would be received from equities. He also believes institutions continue to want to spread their risks by investing in other markets. Thus, 'emerging markets will also be a draw on investors' funds'. Other strategists point out that the queue of big privatisations in the pipeline in other markets such as that of Lufthansa in Germany or Renault and AGF in France may provide stiff competition for investors' funds. But Mr Philip Wolstencroft, UK strategist at Smith New Court, remains confident about the UK market. 'I think finance directors will take advantage of a strong market with a lot of value to urge their companies to go to the market for funds. But I don't think that of itself would put pressure on the equity market.' Another strategist simply explains: 'Those rights issues that could have been questionable anyway have already been done. The plain fact is that, if it is priced right, then the market will take it.' Researchers at Smith New Court point out that companies emerging from a recession may see another advantage in calling on the market for cash. Mr Wolstencroft says: 'Companies are still more likely to go for a rights issue because corporations do not want to be exposed to short-term debt. For many it is a sentimental thing after the interest rate rises of the late 1980s.' Liquidity in the market remains the key issue, says Mr Wolstencroft. 'Overseas funds were largely absent from the UK in the first half of this year thus and could not help in providing liquidity. Things should change as they return.' According to one analyst, who declined to be named: 'Those with a good reason for a rights issue should have no problem over the next month, but many will await the market's reaction to the next budget before assessing if there is an opportunity for a rights issue.'</p>

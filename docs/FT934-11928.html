			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Queens Moat wins approval from bankers on refinancing BANKERS to Queens Moat Houses, the hotels group which has been in crisis talks since its shares were suspended in March, yesterday gave their backing in principle to a long-awaited reconstruction plan which paves the way for a refinancing of the group's Pounds 1bn debt. The reconstruction plan is due to be announced today with details of Queens Moat's results, expected to show the second-largest loss in UK corporate history, with an estimated pre-tax deficit of just over Pounds 1bn for the year to December 31. It is believed Queens Moat will reveal a significant downward revision of the group's 1991 profits, as a result of new management adopting more conservative accounting policies. The banks are understood to have extended their standstill agreement, due to expire at the end of this month, until January 31 1994, by which time a refinancing will have to be concluded. It is understood this will involve a large debt for equity swap, significantly diluting existing shareholders. A statement yesterday from Barclays Bank, which with NatWest led the steering committee representing creditors, said Queens Moat had 'a viable future, despite the group's results for the year to December 31 and six months to July 2'. Queens Moat's losses for 1992 will be almost entirely due to a Pounds 1.2bn writedown on the group's hotels portfolio, taken through both the profit and loss account and the balance sheet. It is understood the value of its hotels has been cut to about Pounds 850m. The record for pre-tax losses by a UK company was set in February by British Aerospace, with a deficit of Pounds 1.2bn after Pounds 1bn in exceptional charges. Some of Queens Moat's recent difficulties appear to have stemmed from an incentive scheme for individual hotel managers, which related their remuneration to sales. It is thought about 40 per cent of the group's 191 hotels in the UK and continental Europe use the scheme. However, by the end of 1994 it is understood that incentives will have been eliminated. While the reconstruction plan sets out some disposals, it is understood to be more closely focused on management controls. It is believed to have provided for the 'creation' of a financial department. The figures for the half year to July, for example, are not expected to have any comparable results, partly due to the lack of working papers. Queens Moat has changed its auditors, financial advisers and property valuers. It is understood there have been several breaches of the Companies Act and the Department of Trade and Industry is thought to have been kept informed of developments. The company is understood to be considering legal action against previous management. A Queens Moat spokesman welcomed the banks' announcement as recognition that 'new management has control of this business . . . I believe that with the banks' support there is very definitely potential within Queens Moat'. As part of its restructuring strategy, Queens Moat has agreed to sell the share capital of Queens Moat Leisure for about Pounds 6.7m.</p>

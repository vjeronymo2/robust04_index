			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Beirut, 12 Apr (MENA)--Arab League Secretary  General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has criticized Israel's lack of  commitment to implementing the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration  of Principles and withdrawing from Gaza and Jericho on the date  set for doing so, that is, 13 April.    In an exclusive statement to MENA in Beirut, he said that  this Israeli reasoning is unacceptable and Israel has to respect  the agreement and withdraw on the dates set down in the  agreement.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid rejected the Israeli claims that these  dates are not sacred, adding: Otherwise, why would the  agreement mention them? No Arab negotiator can accept this. He  stressed that the dates are sacred and must be respected.    The Arab League secretary general said that Israel's  noncompliance with these agreements will affect the Washington  negotiations. He expressed fear that Israel would lose its  credibility in the agreements that it will conclude. He stressed  the need to continue the peace negotiations despite the  difficulties, adding that the continuation of the negotiations  is necessary to restore our legitimate rights. He also stressed  that peace is not a gift from Israel to the Arab countries and  that the peace being asked from the Arab countries is also asked  from Israel, which will benefit more from it; this imposes on it  commitments that it must implement and respect.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid called on the Security Council to be fair  in implementing its resolutions and not to have double standards  when it comes to implementing the resolutions that represent  international legitimacy and which include Resolution 425, which  demands an unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.    On the future of his own initiative to bring about Arab  reconciliation, the Arab League secretary general said: The Arab  countries must get together in solidarity to unite ranks and  positions. He noted that his initiative aimed at achieving Arab  solidarity based on a common basis despite the differences among  some Arab countries.    He added: I stressed in my initiative that we should be  frank  before we have reconciliation. This does not mean that we  should forget the past as if nothing had happened but whoever  did wrong must rectify his error so that we can turn over a new  leaf that will achieve unity in the Arab destiny.

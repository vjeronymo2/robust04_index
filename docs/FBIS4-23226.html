			<p>BFN     [Text] In a meeting in Maputo with cadres of his party,  Joaquim Chissano, chairman of the Mozambique Liberation Front  [Frelimo], has described as positive the fact that the  Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] is delivering lists of  areas under its control that must be integrated in the state  administration. Chissano said, however, that the process should  advance quickly so that those areas are open to all political  groups, and for businessmen to operate. He also said the lack of  freedom of movement in areas under Renamo control, the movement  of armed men of that organization, and the policy of violence  against citizens who do not abide by its rules are causing  concern.</p>

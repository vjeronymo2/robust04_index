			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Calling lenders to account - In spite of improvements, banks still fail small business customers / A look at the commercial relationship in which normal rules do not seem to apply Hire a car and the rental companies fall over themselves to win your business and make you feel a valued customer. Hire money from a bank and somehow the normal commercial relationship does not apply. The customer pays  -though he will not be invoiced in advance - but is often left with the feeling the bank is providing a favour and not a service. Clearly banks are different from car hire companies. The commercial relationship endures far longer; the product on offer is converted into other, sometimes negative, assets by the customer; and, on top of their duty to shareholders, banks have a responsibility to depositors. The uneasy relationship between the banks and a sizeable minority of their small business customers has provided fuel for an acrimonious debate which has rumbled on for the past five years. It was given fresh impetus by the publication last week of a new study* of the banks - the fifth in a series - by the Forum of Private Business. The forum, normally the most pugnacious of the small business lobby groups, took pains to stress the improvements which have occurred and to emphasise the need for a constructive debate. The study, carried out by a team from Nottingham University, found that there was no foundation to the oft-repeated claim that the banks had not passed on base rate cuts to customers. There was also a greater differentiation in the quality of service offered which the forum took as proof the banks did not operate a cartel. Barclays ranked most highly for the quality of service to small businesses while Lloyds lagged a poor fourth. But beneath this rather optimistic gloss the survey comes to some worrying conclusions about the banks' performance. There are still 'substantial weaknesses' in the banking relationship and indications that, in the event of economic recovery, banks would not be well placed to respond to an increase in demand for funds from businesses. Bank charges, interest rates and the banks' demand for collateral remain important constraints on small firms, said Martin Binks, head of the research team. The publication of business charters and tariff cards by the larger banks has helped businesses calculate their likely charges. But there remains 'genuine pessimism' about the overall impact of the charters on bank attitudes, the survey reported. For reasons which were not clear to the researchers, the Scottish Banks  - Royal Bank of Scotland, Bank of Scotland and Clydesdale - outshone their English counterparts in the quality of service provided. Possible reasons include the fact that the Scottish banks are smaller, easier to manage and can afford to be more selective in their choice of customer. Most worrying, given the efforts the banks say they have made to improve matters, was the view among small businesses that the quality of the banks' service had declined since 1990. The reason for this, according to Jane Bradshaw, head of small business services at National Westminster Bank, was that the recession had obscured the progress which had been made. NatWest has increased training programmes to familiarise managers with the problems facing small business, freed staff from administrative duties to concentrate on customer relations and improved the service provided in specialist areas such as franchising, Bradshaw points out. However much the banks improve their services they will always suffer from the fact that they have to refuse finance to some of the people who ask for it, she says. And, she notes, any survey of banking issues will inevitably highlight bank-related problems. There may be some truth in this last assertion but the banks' usual defence  -that the banking horror stories which have received publicity are anecdotes without statistical significance - is no longer tenable. The forum survey covered more than 6,000 businesses and provides a valid cross-section of the small business community. At the same time banks like NatWest claim that their own customer surveys indicate very high levels of satisfaction. A survey on behalf of all the main high street banks among start-up companies showed 92 per cent rated the banks' service as quite or very good. One of the most common complaints of recent months - that the banks have reduced loan facilities across the board - is not confirmed by NatWest's figures, says Bradshaw. In the 15 months to September 1992, NatWest increased the overdraft facilities available to 39 per cent of its customers and reduced them for only 22 per cent. This view appears to be supported by the latest NatWest/Small Business Research Trust survey which found that access to finance ranked only eighth among the problems facing small firms, well behind issues such as lack of turnover - the frontrunner cited by 44 per cent of small firms questioned - and cashflow difficulties (12 per cent). Further light on this aspect of the banks' behaviour will be shed by a Treasury review of the small business loan market to be published in the next few weeks. This finding is perhaps not surprising in a recession but many in the business community are concerned that the banks will not be able to meet demand for finance when the upturn comes. 'Managers are becoming more risk-averse,' says Alastair Winter of the Bank Relationship Consultancy**, one of a number of specialist consultancies which have sprung up to help businesses deal with their bank. The banks are poor at assessing risk and managers often seem unable to distinguish between a sound and an unsound business proposition, says Philip Doggett of Business Banking Review***. The banks, for their part, are quick to point out that a banking relationship is a two-way affair. The forum study found that 70 per cent of small businesses were aware of the need to provide the bank manager with timely and regular management information. How often this awareness is put into practice is another matter but it does indicate an increased sophistication on the part of businesses. However hard the banks work on improving their services, they are operating in a far more critical market place. They are large organisations and it will take a long time to change traditional cultures. They can expect the transition to be subjected to a painful, public scrutiny. *Small Businesses and their Banks. Report Pounds 800, summary Pounds 3.50.

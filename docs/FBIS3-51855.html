They are seeking to  begin a more interesting trade exchange with Paraguay. Nearly  30 Paraguayan businessmen are participating in the round of  talks that began yesterday and will conclude tomorrow.    The PRC delegation is visiting several South American  countries. They have been invited by the Paraguayan Stock  Exchange and Business Chamber.    Xie Jianqun, chief of this delegation and vice chairman of  the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, said  they wish to acquire greater knowledge and increase the  incipient existing trade exchange. During 1992, China purchased  $20 million worth of Paraguayan cotton.    The PRC has 1.170 billion inhabitants and is a potential  market for our products whose competitiveness will nonetheless  depend on comparative advantages, mainly in the field of  transportation.    Jianqun said his country has experienced rapid economic  growth in the past few years following the flexibilization of  its economic policy. The PRC has changed from a planned to a  free market economic policy.    The delegation chief said the PRC last year exported goods  worth $195.7 billion and is 11th among the most important world  economies. The PRC imports a broad range of products from the  world, especially food products.    He said the PRC's greatest South American trade partner is  Brazil, from where it imports fertilizers, agrochemicals, and  alloys. He said that they can buy anything that is offered to  them, as long as the price conditions and other factors are  reasonable.    Paraguay is the only country [as published] that has so far  not established diplomatic relations with the PRC, which must be  considered an important market for our products.</p>

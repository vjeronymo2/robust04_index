			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Halifax faces competition hurdle The proposed merger between the Halifax and Leeds building societies faces several regulatory hurdles before members can vote on it next March, the most immediate of which is over competition. The Office of Fair Trading has confirmed that it has launched a preliminary investigation to see whether it should be blocked on competition grounds. Although there is some question whether the combined society would have 25 per cent of the UK residential mortgage market, the merger qualifies for vetting as the society being taken over, the Leeds, has assets of Pounds 20bn. The OFT will hope to complete its inquiry within a month, after which it will make a recommendation to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. He will then decide whether to allow it to go through, unchallenged or with conditions, or whether to refer it to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. A full MMC inquiry would take three months. If the proposal clears the competition hurdle, the merger should be straightforward. The procedure involves 'a transfer of engagements' which amounts to a tra-nsfer from the Leeds to the Halifax of all the Leeds' assets, liabilities and members. A transfer statement explaining the detailed terms of the merger will be sent to members of both societies next spring, after which they must both obtain the approval of their investing and borrowing members. The conversion of the merged society to a bank is more onerous, but the societies have the successful Abbey National precedent to follow. The first step would be to form a successor company and get a clear indication from the Bank of England that it would be authorised as a bank under UK banking legislation. Special provisions attach to the new company. Its memorandum and articles must protect it from takeover for five years. The conversion must then be approved by the merged society's members and the Building Societies Commission. A special resolution requiring a 75 per cent vote in favour must be passed by investing members. In addition 20 per cent in number of those eligible to vote must pass the resolution. Borrowing members must approve by a simple majority. To induce members to vote, the societies plan to offer all members free shares in the new company as the Abbey did. By doing this rather than offering cash, they should avoid the problems into which the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester/Lloyds Bank deal ran.</p>

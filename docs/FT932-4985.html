			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Swiss military carry the day: Referendums back new aircraft and army training SWISS voters have given a strong vote of confidence to their militia army, rejecting proposals to block the purchase of new fighters and to limit the army's training space. More than 57 per cent of those voting in yesterday's referendums rejected the proposal to put off buying fighters until the year 2000. Some 55 per cent threw out the proposal to limit the number of army training grounds to the current 40 and to prevent their expansion. In the more important figher vote, there were majorities in both French- and German-speaking Switzerland, showing that the army is still one of the few things that unites most Swiss. Italian-speaking Ticino voted in favour of both propositions. The results seem to reflect a renewed concern among Swiss about their security, caused apparently by the war in Bosnia (about 500,000 ex-Yugoslavs live in Switzerland) and worrying signs of instability in neighbouring countries. The votes mean that the government can proceed with its planned purchase of 34 McDonnell Douglas F/A18 fighter jets at an estimated cost of SFr3.5bn (Pounds 1.6bn). The US aircraft maker welcomed the decision, which will also be a boon for Swiss aircraft and component manufacturers. At least SFr2.5bn of the total cost will flow back into the country, creating 20,000 jobs. The purchase was approved by parliament a year ago but was put on hold when the pacifist Group for a Switzerland without an Army (GSoA) gathered nearly 500,000 signatures for its fighter moratorium petition. The government was bound to take the GSoA's initiative seriously. In November, 1989, 35.6 per cent of voters supported its proposal to abolish the military altogether. The GSoA admitted that yesterday's result was a setback. The practical consequence will be that the government will no longer feel obliged to give priority to other GSoA petitions aimed at cutting the military's strength. The F/A18s are to replace the army's 36 ageing Mirage III-S fighters in the front line. The army said the radar and other avionics features of the Mirage had been surpassed by more modern fighters used by other air forces, and Switzerland had to match them. The first aircraft are to be operational in 1996. The petition to limit training grounds was mounted three years ago by a group of citizens in northeastern Switzerland opposed to a decision to build a huge new ground in their vicinity. Their opposition struck a chord throughout the country in communities that have to put up with frequent noisy and sometimes dangerous military exercises. But the army argued that it could not be constrained if it was to provide a credible defence.</p>

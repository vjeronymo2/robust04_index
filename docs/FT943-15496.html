			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil ahead as Cardoso gains in opinion poll Sao Paulo closed 4.04 per cent higher in local currency terms in strong volume after a poll showed that Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the former economy minister, had narrowed the lead of Mr Luiz Inacio 'Lula' da Silva, the left-wing frontrunner, in the presidential election race. The Bovespa index was ahead 1,515 at 39,050, after an early peak of 39,214. Volume reached RDollars 260.8m (Dollars 286.6m). Some brokers said that they had seen foreign clients selling in the market, but they added that most foreigners seemed to be staying away. Most blue chips closed higher, with Telebras preferred showing an advance of 2.51 per cent at RDollars 40.9, Petrobras preferred up 3.6 per cent at RDollars 115.0 and Eletrobras preferred 6.02 per cent stronger at RDollars 229.0. Mexico Equities finished higher, helped by Telefonos de Mexico's advance on Wall Street and the absence of an interest rate increase from the US Federal Reserve. The IPC index closed 24.40, or 1.06 per cent, firmer at 2,334.39. At the end of 1993 the IPC stood at 2,602.63.</p>

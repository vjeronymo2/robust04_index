			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Maxwell's Pounds 1/2 m surprise: Son of corrupt tycoon averts bankruptcy with payment to liquidators MR IAN MAXWELL yesterday avoided the immediate threat of bankruptcy when he made a last-minute payment of Pounds 500,000 to the liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment Management, the former manager of the Mirror Group Newspapers pension funds. Mr Maxwell had been ordered to pay the money in December after a High Court judge ruled that he had breached his duty as a BIM director by agreeing to the transfer of shares worth about Pounds 580,000 to Credit Suisse without obtaining an assurance that the BIM board had approved the transfer. The bankruptcy proceedings were set in motion after Mr Maxwell's lawyers indicated that he could not afford the interim payment. However, five minutes before yesterday's bankruptcy hearing was due to start, Mr Maxwell handed over a banker's draft for Pounds 500,000 to Miss Margaret Cole of Stephenson Harwood, the solicitors acting for BIM. He also agreed to pay the substantial legal costs of bringing the bankruptcy proceedings against him. He then left without waiting for formal dismissal of the bankruptcy petition. His payment of the money prompted speculation about the origin of the funds and the apparent change in his financial circumstances. Mr Frank Field, chairman of the House of Commons social security committee which is investigating the Maxwell affair, said the 'magic' production of the money came as no surprise. 'Whenever the Maxwells have been in difficulty money has arrived,' he said. Mr John Clitheroe of Kingsley Napley, Mr Maxwell's solicitor, refused to comment on the source of the money but said: 'Ill-informed speculation on these matters is a pity.' Miss Cole said the money would go into the fund for the benefit of Mirror Group pensioners. But Mr Kenneth Trench, chairman of the Maxwell Pensioners' Action Group, said the payment was 'really disappointing' and would yield only a minute sum for each pensioner. The liquidators would continue their claim against Mr Maxwell for the outstanding balance of Pounds 80,000, plus interest since September 1991, she said. They would also consider the position regarding their outstanding claim against Mr Maxwell for more than Pounds 400m.</p>

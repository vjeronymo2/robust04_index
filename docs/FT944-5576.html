			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Investment grade rating restored to India India has regained an investment grade rating on bonds it sells to international investors, which could widen the pool of potential buyers and help cut borrowing costs. Moody's Investors Service, the US rating agency, yesterday raised the debt rating of India's foreign currency debt to Baa3, the lowest investment grade, from Ba2. India's bond ratings were downgraded in 1991 as a result of financial difficulties. Standard &amp; Poor's, another leading US credit rating agency, continues to rate the country's long-term debt at BB plus, just below investment grade status. Announcing the increase, Moody's said the move was justified by the success of the government's structural adjustment programme. 'Basically, the reform process has been developing steadily for a long time,' explained Mr David Levey, managing director of sovereign risk at Moody's. 'We are seeing significant benefits for economic growth and efficiency. 'Reserves have increased and there has been substantial inflows of equity and direct investment,' he added. 'There has been a turning point in the psychology of the country.' The increased rating directly affects eurobonds issued by the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, which are fully guaranteed by the republic. In addition it could indirectly help local companies raise capital on the international debt markets and could increase the number of institutional investors prepared to buy Indian company shares.</p>

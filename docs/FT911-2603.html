			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Group of Seven: US wants to use framework for political discussions THE US is seeking to develop the Group of Seven framework of regular economic discussions into a mechanism for more frequent political co-ordination among the leading industrial countries, Peter Riddell writes. The idea has been floated by Mr Robert Kimmitt, US Under-secretary of State for political affairs, as a means of involving Japan and Germany, as well as the European Community, more closely in international political discussions. None is a permanent member of the UN Security Council, whose role was enhanced by the Gulf crisis. At present, the heads of government of the G7 - the US, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy, with the EC attending - meet annually and issue a political statement to accompany their economic communique. These political discussions are held only once a year but the G7 finance ministers meet on at least four other occasions to review economic policy co-ordination, as they did yesterday. The US wants this regular framework of economic consultation to be matched on the political side. Mr Kimmitt is expected to raise the idea at a meeting in Hong Kong this week of G7 political directors (senior foreign ministry officials) in preparation for the annual summit - this year in London in mid-July. Mr Kimmitt argues that the success of the Gulf coalition has underlined the importance of collective political action: 'But now the true test is to see if we can prepare for and avert crises. The G7 is the one agency that, we believe, can be useful to meet more frequently and more regularly to anticipate and avert political crises.' The US has been pondering for some time how to involve Japan and Germany more closely in political discussions; the problem was underlined by the Gulf crisis. Not only were these countries outside the UN Security Council, they were also being asked to contribute financially to US efforts without having had a say in decisions. An expansion of the political role of the G7 is seen by senior State Department officials as a way to broaden and make more politically acceptable calls for sharing burdens or responsibilities.</p>

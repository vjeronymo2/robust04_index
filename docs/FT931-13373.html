			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions THE sharp increase in boardroom activity this week has been dominated by directors' sales. With the FT-SE 100 Index pausing for breath, directors have taken advantage of share prices often standing at record levels. Faber Prest's mixture of specialist services has proved an effective defensive combination. The share price, refecting the improving profit figures, has risen from 130p in May 1991 to the current level of 380p. Chairman Richard Prest has sold 155,000 shares at 377p. He remains the largest shareholder on the board. Dalepak Foods had a mixed year so far as share price performance is concerned. Interim profits were marginally lower than last year and the chairman's statement suggested thefinal year outcome would be broadly similar. The interim announcement was accompanied by details of sales by four directors, including Christopher Ivory, chief executive. In total, they sold 100,000 shares at 315p, but each of the directors is left with a residual holding greater than 100,000 shares. Property shares have enjoyed a good run since Black Wednesday but Peter Levy, chairman of Shaftesbury, has not been deterred; he bought 105,000 shares at 47p. At the same time Neil Benson, a non-executive director bought 20,000 shares, also at 47p.

It also granted a 10-day extension to the political  parties to present nominations to the Vote Receiving Councils.    Last week, the legislative plenary was asked to extend the  deadline for the implementation of this law, known as the  "Antipiracy Law" six months. Several sources, who do not know  the parliamentary procedures for such actions, had said the  extension had already been granted. It was not until Wednesday  night, however, when the legislative commission presented a  report favoring a four- month extension that Congress issued a  decree stating the law would take effect on 15 June 1994.  Originally, it was to take effect on 16 February.    Board members of the Savings and Loan Cooperative  Association, Video Supply and Marketing of El Salvador,  Association of Cassette Distributors and Reproducers of Eastern  Salvador, and the Committee of Cassette Venders and Reproducers  requested the deadline be extended.    The law to develop and protect intellectual copyrights,  which  was approved on 15 July, regulates all issues related to  intellectual copyright and, at the same time, promotes and  protects the literary, artistic, scientific, and industrial  copyrights of Salvadoran nationals. This law stipulates that  firms that distribute and sell music cassettes or rent video  cassettes must pay royalties to the creator. With this  extension, Congress is giving those firms four more months to  adjust to the situation.    The deadline for political parties to present their lists of  nominations to the Vote Receiving Councils ended yesterday.  Since most parties had not prepared their lists, however,  Congress extended the deadline 10 days.    Political organizations must present a list of council  nominations to the Supreme Electoral Tribunal. Among other  things, the Vote Receiving Councils count the votes after the  voting period ends and record the result on the corresponding  electoral certificate.</p>

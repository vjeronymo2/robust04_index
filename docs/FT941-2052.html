			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / N Korea miscalculates in row with South: The US and Seoul are now more determined to stand together Two years ago, there was optimism that North and South Korea were on the path to reconciliation and eventual peaceful unification. Events have gone horribly wrong since then. Relations have deteriorated to the point where the threat of a military confrontation on the Korean peninsula has become a frightening possibility. That did not appear so at the end of 1991, when the US, North Korea and South Korea began to implement a three-way deal to defuse nuclear tensions. The US agreed to pull out its tactical nuclear weapons from South Korea. This persuaded North Korea to sign a non-nuclear pact and a non-aggression treaty with South Korea. The US responded by holding a high-level meeting with North Korea and cancelling its Team Spirit military exercise in South Korea for 1992. In return, North Korea agreed to start allowing the International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect its nuclear facilities at Yongbyon. Things became unstuck in the summer of 1992 as the two Koreas negotiated implementing their non-nuclear pact. Seoul demanded North Korea accept challenge- or spot-inspections of suspected nuclear facilities in compliance with the treaty. Pyongyang refused, blocking progress in the inter-Korean talks. One problem was that the treaty language governing spot-inspections was ambiguous. 'The wording in the treaty was poorly drafted,' admits one senior South Korean foreign ministry official. Seoul first offered aid to help rescue North Korea's struggling economy if Pyongyang accepted spot-inspections. When that offer proved fruitless, it put on pressure in the late autumn of 1992 by asking the US to resume the Team Spirit exercise in 1993. Pyongyang had routinely condemned previous Team Spirit exercises as a rehearsal for a possible attack against North Korea. It also viewed the resumption of Team Spirit in 1993 as the US reneging on its promise to halt the exercise if North Korea accepted IAEA inspections. Pyongyang proved increasingly intransigent, and it is likely the incident reinforced its distrust of the intentions of the US and South Korea. 'The holding of Team Spirit '93 was a terrible mistake,' said Mr William Taylor, a prominent North Korea analyst and vice-chairman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. 'It has taken us another year to repair the damage and try to get things back on course.' Another factor adding to Pyongyang's anxiety was that the staging of Team Spirit in March 1993 occurred shortly before the expiry of a deadline set by the IAEA for it to be allowed to inspect two unreported facilities believed to contain nuclear waste. Examination of the waste material might confirm IAEA suspicions that North Korea had produced more bomb-grade plutonium than it had declared after shutting down its small 5MW reactor in 1989. The US Central Intelligence Agency estimated the North could have extracted enough plutonium to make one or two crude nuclear devices. On March 12, 1993, Pyongyang announced it was withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the first country to do so. It explained it was taking the action in response to Team Spirit and the IAEA special inspection demand, which it described as a 'seditious political machination aimed at forcing us to open military objects and bases, therely leaving us disarmed militarily.' If it agreed to the IAEA demand, North Korea said this would create a precedent for accepting similar spot inspections by South Korea. Many observers concluded North Korea wanted to drop out of the NPT because it feared the IAEA was close to discovering Pyongyang was indeed developing nuclear weapons despite its denials. North Korea is committed to producing a nuclear weapon because Pyongyang views it as the ultimate guarantee against the country's absorption by the South, according to these analysts. But the prevalent theory in Seoul has been that North Korea was using its threat of NPT withdrawal and the blocking of international inspections in a desperate attempt to win concessions. These would include gaining diplomatic recognition and economic aid from the US and Japan, reversing the diplomatic defeat North Korea suffered when China and Russia, its two oldest allies, established relations with South Korea in the early 1990s. The North has also been seeking the right to inspect US military bases in South Korea, a promise by the US not to attack North Korea, and the permanent suspension of Team Spirit. The view that the North was playing the nuclear card for diplomatic purposes gained support last summer when it agreed to suspend its NPT withdrawal in return for the promise of improved ties with the US in the future. Since then, negotiations on the nuclear dispute have focused on a package deal in which the US would again suspend Team Spirit and hold a new round of talks with North Korea on possible diplomatic recognition, if Pyongyang agreed to allow unrestricted regular inspections by the IAEA and pursue its talks with South Korea on mutual nuclear inspections. This would have paved the way for a second stage of negotiations in which the US might have finally offered to normalise relations with Pyongyang if it accepted spot inspections by the IAEA. But the North has remained stubborn on two points in concluding the initial package deal. Apparently fearing that the US would not fulfil its end of the bargain, it has insisted Washington make simultaneous concessions in any trade-off with Pyongyang. The US and South Korea, equally distrustful of North Korea, have demanded Pyongyang make the first steps in the fulfilment of any agreement. The North apparently made a concession in this regard recently when it agreed to allow an IAEA inspection team into Yongbyon on condition that the US would suspend Team Spirit if the results proved satisfactory. But the North's subsequent refusal to allow the IAEA to carry out crucial tests after completing at least 80 per cent of its inspections might have been an attempt to retain 'leverage' in its dealings with the US on Team Spirit, South Korean officials say. The North has also proved reluctant in dealing with the South in the negotiations over mutual nuclear inspections. 'North Korea obviously wants to pursue its policy of improving relations with the US while delaying inter-Korean dialogue, with the eventual aim of eliminating Seoul's links with the US,' Mr Chung Jong-uk, national security adviser to South Korea's President Kim Young-sam, said. The North might have been hoping to play off Seoul against Washington in an attempt to improve its bargaining position and win new concessions. But if the North believed it could exploit such differences, it has badly miscalculated after it broke off talks with the South last weekend. It has angered the South and the US and strengthened their co-operation and determination in confronting the North.</p>

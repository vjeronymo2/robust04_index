			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow boosted as Fed eases monetary policy Wall Street US STOCK markets rebounded from two days of heavy losses, aided by good news on inflation and an easing in monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 43.61 up at 3,224.96, although off its high for the day when the index had been ahead more than 50 points. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 forged ahead 6.14 to 400.64, while the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks soared 13.07 to 586.75. Turnover on the New York SE was again heavy at 231m shares and rises outpaced falls by 1,271 to 494. Share prices opened firmer, but did not take off until 11.30am, when the Fed eased, by signalling to the credit markets that it wanted the Fed Funds rate brought down from 4 per cent to 3 3/4 per cent. The Fed's action was interpreted primarily as an attempt to boost the economy. Room was made for a monetary easing by the morning's inflation figures, which showed that producer prices rose just 0.2 per cent in March, indicating that inflationary pressures remained dormant. There were some big gains among leading stocks which bore the brunt of Tuesday and Wednesday's selling. Merck gained Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 150 1/8 , General Electric rose Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 74 3/4 , Philip Morris firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 75 7/8 and Procter &amp; Gamble advanced Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 98 3/4 . Banking issues, which have suffered from concern about a Japanese financial crisis, recovered strongly. JP Morgan rose Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 55 7/8 , aided by an upgrade from a 'hold' to a 'buy' recommendation from Brown Brothers Harriman. Bankers Trust firmed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 53 1/8 , Citicorp gained Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 16 1/8 and Chemical put on Dollars 1 to Dollars 30 1/2 . One of the rare losers was Digital Equipment, which dropped Dollars 5 1/4 to Dollars 48 1/4 after reporting a fiscal third-quarter loss of Dollars 294m, compared with a profit at the same stage last year of Dollars 117m. News of higher March sales lifted retailers JC Penney Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 65, Sears Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 45 1/2 , Dayton Hudson Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 62 5/8 and K Mart Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 52. Fannie Mae moved ahead Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 65 1/8 on news of a 13 per cent rise in first-quarter profits to a record Dollars 381.6m. Canada TORONTO stocks quickly picked up from a flat opening after the US Federal Reserve cut its funds rate target, sending the market sharply higher. The upturn reversed two straight days of losses in the market totalling 68 points on the 300-share composite index. The index closed 30.9 up at 3,349.0, while advances led declines by 310 to 237 after volume of 27.7m shares. Canadian banks quickly followed the US Fed's move with cuts to their prime rates to 8 per cent from 8.25.</p>

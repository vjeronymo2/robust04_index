			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Survey of Gloucestershire (4): '10,000 jobs lost' says report / Examining the effect of defence cuts on industry The name Gloster evokes quite different associations from the other spelling of the name. While most people's image of Gloucestershire has to do with peaceful settings - Cotswolds, vales, forests, and spas - it is deeply involved in the military sector. Gloster was the aircraft company that made the Gladiator biplane and the Meteor and Javelin jets. It was set up in the first world war as the Gloucestershire Aircraft Companyon the premises of a Cheltenham firm. One of its employees, George Dowty, branched out to found the parts company that became Gloucestershire's biggest industrial concern. Unlike Dowty, however, which survives as part of the TI group, Gloster Aircraft Company has disappeared, its name swallowed up in the series of mergers that led to the creation of British Aerospace. And then there are the Glosters - the Gloucestershire Regiment, also known as 'The Slashers', distinguished by the small 'back-badge' on the back of their head-dress, commemorating the 1801 battle of Alexandria when they fought simultaneously to their front and rear. The regiment will just be able to celebrate its 300th anniversary next year before it, too, is swallowed up in a merger, making way for an amalgamated Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment. Defence cuts have hit the area hard. In the industrial sector, where, besides Dowty and Smiths Industries, there is a range of contractors producing everything from bearings and steering equipment to decoys and electronic components, the cuts have coincided with recession in other markets, making the transition away from dependence on defence much harder. A report produced this month for Gloucestershire county council suggests that total defence-related employment, now around 26,500, has shrunk by almost a third in the last three years. More than 10,000 jobs are reckoned to have been lost in the defence equipment sector, including sub-contractors, as well as some 2,000 civil service posts. The report forecasts more than 4,500 more job losses by the end of the decade, with direct defence-company employment reduced to just half the 1990 level. Gloucestershire has joined forces with neighbouring Avon and Wiltshire in applying for a share of the European Union's Konver fund for vulnerable defence-dependent regions. The application, to support a Pounds 4.5bn investment programme aimed at business development, innovation, training and rehabilitation of military sites, was submitted last month. The three counties suffer in different ways. Wiltshire's defence dependency lies mainly in its concentration of military bases, Avon's in its large aerospace and defence equipment sector. 'Gloucesterhire's got the lot,' says Mr Tony Burley, of the council's Economic Development Unit. Besides scattered army and RAF bases and maintenance units, Gloucestershire is famously home to the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the electronic monitoring agency which is the largest arm of Britain's intelligence services. Closely linked to its US counterpart, cloaked in secrecy, and undisturbed by trade union activity, which has been banned since 1984, it has two main sites at Cheltenham, now reckoned to employ 6,500-7,000 civilians. But even this is secret. The local economy tied to military bases has also suffered, particularly from the rundown of US Air Force operations in Europe. The US base at Fairford, from where B-52 bombers flew 7,500-mile missions against Iraq in the Gulf war, is mothballed. The USAF and RAF have both abandoned Kemble, a former maintenance depot now used to store army vehicles. A US hospital at Little Rissington has also closed. Industrially, defence remains prominent among otherwise disparate activities, ranging from Birds Eye Walls' ice-cream factory, which employs about 1,000 at Gloucester, to Rank Xerox's copier plant at Mitcheldean , whose workforce of 1,800 is one of the largest in the county. Some of the main non-defence industries have also been facing particularly depressed markets. Du Pont, which took over ICI's nylon fibre plant at Brockworth, is reducing employment by a quarter to 750. The Lister-Petter diesel engine plant, at Dursley, now part of the BTR group, is the sole survivor of five main sites. It shed 180 jobs early last year, leaving 900. It has staved off further cuts by diversifying into defence - a US military contract for generator engines, which has boosted the business by 10-15 per cent. Most defence manufacturers are, meanwhile, seeking ways of diversifying in the other direction. But this is proving especially hard for smaller companies. An exception is Lydney Products, a plywood and veneer producer in the Forest of Dean which used to rely heavily on supplies for navy wardrooms and the like. In the last six years, it has built up civilian outlets for its products, although this has not stopped the number of employees falling from a peak of about 200 to 90. Defence now accounts for only 15 per cent of the business, says Mr Nigel Haig, commercial director, adding: 'It can't help being a declining thing.'</p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / EC entry fought in Norway Norway's main opposition Centre party yesterday tabled a motion in parliament calling for withdrawal of the country's application for membership of the European Community, writes Karen Fossli from Oslo. The proposal, made at the start of a two-day debate on the King's speech, initiated a stormy parliamentary session, with the Centre party promising to flex its muscles at every opportunity to demonstrate new-found political strength after overtaking the pro-EC Conservative party in the election. Few political analysts believe the proposal will win majority backing of the Storting when it is put to a vote tonight. Recent opinion polls on EC membership show opposition running at an unprecedented 56-60 per cent against the move. The governing Labour party is split on the issue but says the electorate must be given the opportunity to vote on membership in a referendum, probably by 1996, if the country is to have a strong negotiating position with Brussels.</p>

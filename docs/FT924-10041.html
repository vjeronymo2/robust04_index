			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Iata warns of mounting airline losses in Montreal THE international airline industry is heading for another loss next year, bringing total losses during the last four years to nearly Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.1bn). Mr Gunter Eser, director-general of the International Air Transport Association (Iata), also warned yesterday that the continuing losses of the industry would hit new commercial aircraft orders during the rest of this decade. Addressing the organisation's annual meeting in Montreal, Mr Eser described the state of the industry as 'apocalyptic'. 'The four horsemen of the aviation apocalypse are traffic and yields which are too low, capacity and unit costs which are too high,' he said. Mr Eser said there was a fifth horseman, interest charges and airline debt which have become unsustainable. The dire financial state of the industry will accelerate the profound changes now taking place in the airline business. Last year alone, the industry shed 51,000 jobs or 3.4 per cent of its total workforce. After it had lost Dollars 2.7bn in 1990 and Dollars 4bn last year, Mr Eser said he expected the industry loss this year to total Dollars 2.6bn. Although there has been a slow recovery in traffic, Iata is expecting another industry loss of around Dollars 600m next year. This would bring total losses for 1990-93 to Dollars 9.9bn. However, Mr Eser said Iata was still optimistic about future growth, forecasting an average worldwide passenger growth rate of 7.4 per cent a year between 1991 and 1996 and a 6.9 per cent annual growth rate for freight traffic during this period. But this growth will be clipped unless about Dollars 350bn is spent to improve and expand airports and air traffic infrastructure between now and 2010. Mr Eser warned that Iata's 212 member airlines were unlikely to be able to finance new aircraft purchases beyond those already on order even if they quickly return to break-even. He urged airlines to be much more cautious in ordering new aircraft than they were during the boom years of the 1980s.</p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Civil war overhang threatens Angola poll: Julian Ozanne reports on the country's chances of a peaceful transition to democracy ANGOLA'S year-long transition to peace and democracy is being marred in the final days of campaigning before the country's first multi-party elections next Tuesday as underlying violence, built up during 16 years of civil war, boils over. Several incidents in the past week have revealed the potential for violence in a transition programme whose remarkable success so far has astounded most observers. Minutes before President Jose Eduardo dos Santos arrived to campaign in Huambo on Tuesday, government soldiers, egged on by a flag-waving mob, opened fire on two supporters of Unita, the former rebel movement which is challenging the ruling MPLA. The incident happened the day after Unita troops had seized 11 anti-riot policemen, burnt three cars and took control of the airport in Cuito after alleging that the MPLA was trying to assassinate Mr Jonas Savimbi, the Unita leader. At least a dozen people have been killed in other clashes between the two sides in the past seven days across the country. 'It is true that sometimes Unita has over-reacted,' Mr Salupeto Pena, a senior Unita official, said yesterday. 'But there are many more incidents of successful co-operation between Unita and the MPLA and the process is holding together well despite the tensions.' 'Nobody thought we would get this far without major bloodshed,' said a western diplomat. 'It's an amazing achievement.' The peaceful unfolding of the electoral process has been helped considerably by the belief by each side that it is going to win the elections. Much of the credit for the success of the transition also goes to the United Nations, which is observing the process, and to the MPLA, which has consistently refrained from responding to Unita provocation. In Huambo President dos Santos has specifically ruled out taking violent action to return Cuito airport to government control and called on his supporters to remain calm. President dos Santos's western-style campaign stresses stability and the goal of unifying Angola's fractured tribal society. A former Marxist who broke with communism in 1990, he has successfully exploited the fears of many Angolans, especially in the towns, that Mr Savimbi is a power-hungry human rights violator and a racist whose victory next week would throw Angola into a period of witch-hunting and instability. With the help of several million dollars of government funds and a slick Brazilian public relations company, Mr dos Santos has cultivated the image of a soft-spoken, well educated family man gently leading his country to a new but certain future. In contrast, Mr Savimbi looks aggressive, arrogant and threatening. He has failed to make the leap from authoritarian guerrilla leader to peacetime politician capable of rising to the challenge of national reconciliation. His inflammatory rhetoric and veiled threats against white and mixed race Angolans, 'enemies and foreigners' have alienated many educated Angolans. Mr Savimbi has, however, struck a chord in his attacks on the abysmal record of the corruption-ridden MPLA in the economy, education and health of a country which could be one of Africa's richest. Whether the campaigns of the two men will make much impact inroads on a society expected to vote along tribal lines is dubious. The real worry is whether the violent tensions will explode once the results are announced and one of the parties is defeated. Church leaders and the United Nations yesterday appealed for calm ahead of Angola's first multi-party election next week, Reuter reports from Luanda. 'We have to avoid further tragedies in this country. There have been too many tragedies,' UN special envoy Margaret Anstee told reporters. The leader of Angola's Catholic church, Cardinal Alexandre do Nascimento, urged President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Unita leader Jonas Savimbi to do everything possible to ensure their followers maintained the peace.</p>

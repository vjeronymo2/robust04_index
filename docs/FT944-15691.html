			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / World Bond Markets: Attitudes change on Latin America - Capital &amp; Credit The return last week of Argentina to the syndicated loan market marks a significant stage in Latin America's financial rehabilitation. Argentina secured a Dollars 500m 18-month credit with a spread of 150 basis points above Libor on Tuesday. The deal is one of the biggest by any Latin American government since the continent's debt crisis emerged in the early 1980s and reflects a marked change in the attitude of international bankers. 'There is a change in mind set,' explains one banker in New York, who says financiers have been impressed by the approach of finance ministers such as Mr Domingo Cavallo of Argentina. 'It would have been unthinkable three or four years ago,' explains Mr Peter West, economic adviser with West Merchant Bank in London. Credit Suisse and Chemical Bank led the loan, which follows an increase in project finance and short-term trade lending to Latin America and a sharp rise in international equity flows towards the continent, where governments are increasingly adopting the liberal economic policies, pioneered by Chile, Mexico and Argentina. So far this year some Dollars 5.25bn has been lent to Latin American borrowers in 35 separate deals, according to figures by International Financing Review, the specialist publication. Borrowers include public enterprises and companies - such as Pemex, Mexico's oil company - as well as banks and private companies. Latin American borrowers have steadily increased issuance of new bonds, with Dollars 12.6bn worth of new offerings in the nine months to the end of September. Nevertheless, they find syndicated loans more attractive because the deals are flexible. Although front-end expenses can sometimes be more expensive, the terms of the loans can be rescheduled. The Argentine transaction, which amounts to a vote of confidence for the three-year-old economic stabilisation plan introduced by the government of Mr Carlos Menem, was 'remarkably easy to syndicate', said one financier. 'We have observed some enthusiasm for Latin American credits. Banks have emerged from the Brady era and are now prepared to look at sovereign exposures,' he adds. As well as Chemical and Credit Suisse, other international banks participating were Banco Santander, Dresdner Bank, Bank of Boston, UBS and ING, alongside a number of local banks. Argentina borrowed money to cover revenue shortfalls prompted by delays in the privatisation of several gas distribution companies. Mr West believes that there will be no massive rush back into the syndicated loan market but he expects that other 'tailor-made' deals for Latin American borrowers could be in the offing. Nevertheless, there are fears in some quarters that in their enthusiasm for lending to the new emerging markets, bankers could be opening themselves up to a new debt crisis. In a recent note Mr Raphael Soifer, analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co, in New York, points to a steady increase of aggressive commercial lending to Latin America and other less developed countries. 'Don't look now but LDC debt is back,' he says, with the cross-border exposure of US banks to developing countries increasing by 33 per cent since 1990. 'As those of us who have followed the banking industry for a while can never forget, what began in the 1970s as ostensibly harmless, short-term 'balance of payments adjustment facilities' and interbank deposits, by the 1980s had developed into the full-blown LDC debt crisis,' warns Mr Soifer. Mr Michael Atkin, director for Latin America at the Institute of International Finance in Washington, concedes that Latin American indebtedness has increased, partly because the internal savings ratios of Latin American economies are still relatively low. 'It is certainly true that Latin American indebtedness is building up. They are importing a lot of capital,' he explains. The total debts of 16 Latin American economies monitored by the IIF amounted to Dollars 529bn in 1994, almost double the Dollars 274.5bn recorded shortly before the emergence of the debt crisis in 1981. Debt now accounts for an even higher percentage of the region's exports than it did 13 years ago, at 264 per cent compared with 225 per cent. Nevertheless, he insists that 'history is not repeating itself'. The continent's private sector is now bigger and more widely involved, economies are more open to international trade and competition and macroeconomic policies generally are more to the liking of lenders. Significantly, governments are not resorting to external debt to finance public spending, says Mr Atkin.</p>

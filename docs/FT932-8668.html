			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Arts: Today's Television Television really can damage health. I feel unwell after sampling the surrealistically bad chat show This Morning (ITV, 10.35am weekdays). Presented by an apparently live married couple, This Morning is television's equivalent of anthrax; insidious and incurable. Things improve later. One of today's oddest items is the last of the erratically absorbing series Without Walls (Channel 4, 9pm). Tonight's programme features amateur film-footage of a weekend in 1939, rare colour film of Adolf Hitler and his repellant cronies enjoying a Munich arts festival. 40 Minutes (BBC2, 9.50pm) is regularly strong. Tonight it deals with the horrendous subject of rape in a high-risk manner, by bringing face-to-face a victim and a convicted rapist. Probably compulsive viewing, but one wonders why. The evening's laurels go to the classic SF movie The Day The Earth Stood Still (Channel 4, 10pm). The alien Michael Rennie visits Washington DC with a message of peace. He discovers humanity is rather unpleasant. A cynical view induced, no doubt, by watching This Morning.</p>

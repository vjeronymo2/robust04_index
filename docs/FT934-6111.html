			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / PFO lays to rest theory of attack on Pearl Harbour The documents available at the Public Records Office today appear to lay to rest the notion that Winston Churchill knew in advance about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour, which brought the US into the second world war. The Public Records Office said: 'None of the intercepts obviously indicate the British sources were aware in advance of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour, although it was clear that Japan was about to enter the war.' A recently published book, Betrayal at Pearl Harbour, by James Rusbridger and Eric Nave, says British codebreakers intercepted Japanese signals alerting them to an imminent attack on the main US naval base in Hawaii. The authors intimate Churchill did not want to inform the US of this because he wanted to ensure it joined the war.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Sichuan To Sell Dozen State-Owned </F> Enterprises By End of This Month"]    [Text] Chengdu, 7 Jun (LIEN HO PAO) -- Sichuan Province  has decided to sell 10-15 state-owned enterprises to foreign  firms at the "International Seminar on Sichuan's Opening Up to  the Outside World Investment Forum," which will be held on 26  June. At present, 33 enterprises have been selected from  Chengdu, Chongqing, Deyang, Mianyang, Leshan, Zigong, and  Neijiang to make preparations.    Differing from sales of loss-making enterprises in other  localities, the enterprises for sale have good economic returns.  Profitable enterprises account for 84.8 percent of the total,  and the rest have great potential. These enterprises are  engaged in machinery, electronics, metallurgy, chemical  industry, construction materials, food, medicine, light  industry, and textiles, and they have broad market prospects.  This feature has been praised by foreign businessmen.    According to information, Sichuan wants to adopt five sales  methods: First, sell all of the property rights and land use  rights; second, according to the requirements of the buyer, sell  part of the property rights and land use rights; third, on  condition that the buyer makes arrangements for the workers,  sell all of the property rights and land use rights; fourth, on  condition that the buyer makes arrangements for some of the  workers, sell part of the property rights and land use rights;  and fifth, transfer state shares and corporate shares to  joint-stock companies.</p>

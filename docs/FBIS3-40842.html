Kaushik: "Congress' In-fighting in </F> the Southern States"; quotation marks as published]    [Text] A belligerent cat said to the other cat, "come  fight." Yes, if we do not enact such a scene, we will soon lose  the title of the victorious warrior. The Congress (I) in  Karnataka is trying to take over control. In the neighboring  Tamil Nadu, the cat called Jayalalitha is growling at Governor  Channa Reddy. Meanwhile, Rajshekhar Reddy's meow' in Karnataka  for Chief Minister Vijay Bhaskar could become dangerous once  again. Narasimha Rao have cats on both sides.    The prime minister was wrong if he thought that after the  vidhan sabha election in northern India and resolution of  Manmohan Singh's resignation affair, he would take a sigh of  relief. The dissatisfaction with the Congress (I) is increasing  with each passing day. If is Karnataka's turn today, Andhra  Pradesh' tomorrow, and Tamil Nadu's the day after. The  idealistic days of collaboration between idli and dosa [southern  dishes] are gone. Even rasam [southern dessert] is becoming  bitter now.    This is a double jeopardy for the Congress president. There  will be elections in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh during the  next nine months. If this dissatisfaction increased more, it  would be grievous for the party. The party leaders are worried  that the party could be hurt badly in these elections whether  they change the party leadership at state level or not.    Even more important is the fact the Congress (I) had more  control in southern states than in northern states during the  last general elections, and that had helped it bag the prime  minister's position. It was the first time since the  independence that a southerner was appointed prime minister.    It is true that there are still two more years for the next  general elections. Still, it seems that the upcoming vidhan  sabha elections will indicate what the Congress will have in  1996. In addition, there will be several vidhan sabha elections  in 1995, starting those in Orissa. No doubt, the Congress (I)  won the elections in Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh in  December 1993. Dissatisfaction is brewing within the Congress  (I) here also, and the Congress (I) cannot lulled into  complacency.    Many party leaders are distressed because the central  leadership has not been consistent in it dealing with Karnataka  Congress (I). The Congress (I) came to power in 1990. There have  been three chief ministers here since then. Virendra Patil was  the first chief minister and Bangarappa showed up and raised the  flag of dissatisfaction. When Bangarappa became the chief  minister, Moily blew the bugle of rebellion. Now Moily is the  chief minister and S.M. Krishna is leading the dissidents.    It is ironic that despite its having the majority with 183  members out of the total of 224 members in the vidhan sabha, the  Congress (I) has failed to establish a stable government. This  has not happened because of an aggressive opposition, but  because of factionalism within the party. The Congress (I)  members accused the cabinet members of their own government more  than the opposition members did. They did not worry even about  the fact that they will have to face the voters during the next  election. The detractors recently staged a dharna [sit-in] for  three days and the vidhan sabha chairperson had to adjourn the  session.    Moily and Krishna came to blows right in front of Jagannath  Misra, the high command supervisor. Commented he on this  incident, "Until now I thought that Bihar's Congress members  were undisciplined and there is anarchy there because of the  state's culture. No one will ever believe that peace-loving  Kannada people can present such a scene that could put even the  Biharis to shame."    Not only this, the problem that the party is facing in the  vidhan sabha itself is attributed to the Congress (I) high  command. It did not interfere in time when Bangarappa was  starting the tirade against Virendra Patil or when Moily was  spewing fire against Bangarappa or now when Krishna has risen  against Moily. These leaders have followed this technique, and  the central leadership had given them a long rope hoping that  they would straighten out the situation themselves as time  passes. This did not happen and they replaced one with the other.    Last week, Mr. Narasimha Rao had said in Hyderabad, "There  can be 15 Congressites who are qualified to become the chief  minister, however, all 15 of them cannot be appointed to the one  position." He strongly criticized internal conspiracies, but  also felt that the main reason for dissatisfaction within the  party was the overflowing egos of the leaders.    If this is true, then it is surprising that he decided to  keep himself out and let the fire of dissatisfaction rage. It is  also strange that Moily has the prime minister's trust, but he  still does not find himself in the same boat as did Bangarappa.    It is true that Krishna is the leader of the dissidents. He  was an associate of Moily in the cabinet and is making his life  miserable since last May. They have drifted far apart from each  other now. Not only this, Moily is not able to focus on his  government tasks now. He has not been able to get even one  important bill passed during this time. Some directives and  legislative orders were issued but those have lapsed now. He  could neither run even one day of the vidhan sabha session since  September nor could he hold a meeting of the Pradesh Congress  Committee.    The high command did not accept resignations of the  dissident  cabinet members. It resulted in loyal members adopting the same  attitude. This encouraged the weary Moily, however, the  situation is still serious.    The Karnataka Congress (I) has still been given the  opportunity to deal with its inner strife on its own. This will  not last long, however. It looks like Karnataka has a  non-Congress government. The governor should also have submitted  a report on constitutional crisis. He could have recommended to  the president to establish presidential rule in the state.    Whatever happens, one thing is certain: These incident will  tarnish Congress' image. There were many incidents of fraud  during Bangarappa's government, and nothing has been achieve  during Moily's government.    Former Chief Minister Bangarappa was expelled from the  Congress (I) for six years, and he has formed a regional party.  It is assumed that he may join Bahujan Samaj Party's Kanshi Ram.  These two will try to make Karnataka another Uttar Pradesh. The  Janata Dal can also join them. The Janata Dal can also try to  stage a comeback on its own strength. Another power has been  formed by the union of Ramakrishna Hegde and Devgauda. In this  situation, the competition will be among the three groups in  this state--the newly emerging power, the Congress, and the BJP  [Bharatiya Janata Party]. The BJP received more than 30 percent  votes in the last vidhan sabha election, and it has established  its roots here.    In Andhra Pradesh, T.N. Ramarao would like to avenge himself  of the insulting defeat he suffered in 1989. The inner bickering  within the Congress (I) is going on there also. The party  discipline committee has served a show cause' notice to  Rajshekhar Reddy, the legislator from Kudappa. The head of this  committee is chief minister Vijay Bhaskar Reddy. The  dissatisfaction there is not as severe as is in Karnataka.  Rajshekhar is more tolerant than is Bangarappa. It is expected  from Narasimha Rao that he establishes peace and cooperation in  both states.    No one is angry at Narasimha Rao in Tamil Nadu, however, the  Congress (I) president will have to deal with another dissidence  in the party there, and also take care of Chief Minister  Jayalalitha who is active against the governor. There are 61  Congress (I) members in the vidhan sabha and they are divided  into six factions. They also ignored the state Congress (I)  president's directive to boycott the vidhan sabha session.    As the prime minister, Narasimha Rao will have to recognize  the chief minister's working style. The central government has  to ignore the opposition government if it disagrees with the  governor. It is clear that some disagreements between the chief  minister and the governor have surfaced during recently.  Jayalalitha has accused the governor of several things--he is  keeping the files hanging, is building cases against some of her  cabinet members, and is threatening to impose president's rule.    It really is ridiculing history when the governor is removed  from chancellorship. It was Channa Reddy who had straightened  out N.T. Ramarao when he had appointed himself the chancellor of  the Telagu University.    It is possible that the central leadership may not interfere  even after the state Congress has requested it. Some people  think that since Jayalalitha had presented a silk shawl to  Narasimha Rao during his recent visit to the state, the tension  between the two has evaporated. Still, if the hold is loosened,  there might be some danger.    Now the question is: Will the Congress (I) high command be  able to hold the key to keeping its control in southern India in  its own hand or not? At present, the Congress (I) has become its  own worst enemy. It was apparent during the recent vidhan sabha  election in Rajasthan that the Congress members were cutting  each other's neck. This all could be reenacted during the  Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh vidhan sabha elections. The  Congress (I) must have thought before the election, "the wave  will rise in the North if not in the South." The party still  believes now that if the party wave does not rise in the South  in 1994, then it will rise in the North in 1996. However, it is  also possible that the Congress (I) drowns sandwiched between  the North and South.</p>

			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BIG NIGHT IS NOTHING SPECIAL FOR VISTA'S ENGER  </P> <P> It was just a typical game for Chris Enger, the Vista High School girls'  basketball player.  </P> <P> The 6-foot 4-inch center had 38 points, 19 rebounds and 14 blocked shots in  less than three quarters as Vista defeated Fallbrook, 65-31, in Palomar League  play at Vista.  </P> <P> "They just couldn't stop her tonight," Vista Coach Joe DeMaria said.  "Defensively, she dominated and offensively, they couldn't keep her from  getting the ball."  </P> <P> When Vista can get the ball inside to Enger, it will. It did so so much  Thursday that its next high scorers (Kelli Schott and Renee Richardson) had six  points each.  </P> <P> "We played probably our best game of the season tonight," DeMaria said. "They  didn't match up well against Chris. Fallbrook's center, Carol Reed, is only  5-9, and it's pretty tough for her to stop somebody who is 6-4."  </P> <P> Jennifer Tippett and Trisha Trujillo each scored seven points for Fallbrook  (1-1, 10-3).  </P> <P> Palomar League  </P> <P> Torrey Pines 59, Orange Glen 33 -- Tiffany Booth scored 16 points and Karyn  Armstrong had 15 as Torrey Pines opened league play at Orange Glen. Shannon  French led Orange Glen (0-2, 5-9) with 11 points.  </P> <P> Avocado League  </P> <P> Oceanside 60, Carlsbad 40 -- Kecha Fowlkes scored 21 points, and Mildred  Constan had 16 to lead host Oceanside. Oceanside is 9-5, 2-0 in league.  Carlsbad is 0-2 in league.  </P> <P> Ramona 35, Escondido 22 -- Kendra Brunje led Ramona (2-0, 8-1) with 9 points  and 16 rebounds. Ramona's top 2 scoreres, Kris Miller and Meleea Van Patten  were held to 6 and 4 points. Ramona had a 39-16 rebound advantage. Escondido is  0-2 in league play.  </P> <P> Nonleague  </P> <P> Point Loma 74, USDHS 33 -- Monica Filer had 22 points and 15 assists for Point  Loma (15-1), which also got 16 points from Tyeast Brown and 14 from Chris  Drumm. Point Loma also had 24 steals. USDHS is 5-4.  </P></p>

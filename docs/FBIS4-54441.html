			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, April 28 (CTK) -- If Hungary's  relations with Slovakia are to improve, Hungary has to allay  Slovak concern by guaranteeing inviolability of the border with  Slovakia, Slovak Premier Jozef Moravcik told journalists today.  "We insist on the border's permanency since in Slovakia the  fear that the border might be altered is a real political  factor," Moravcik said, adding he believed an agreement on the  issue might be concluded this year.    Moravcik said the meeting of the two countries' premiers  planned for last Monday [25 April] did not take place due to  Hungary's unwillingness to issue a joint statement on border  inviolability. He also said that owing to his crowded schedule  he would not attend the coming international meeting of Liberals  at Visegrad in Hungary, where he was supposed to unofficially  meet Hungarian Premier Peter Boross. But he added that he did  not rule out the possibility of still meeting Boross before the  elections.    Observers in Bratislava are skeptical about the meeting  materializing in view of the Hungarian election campaign.  Moravcik also warned that Slovak-Hungarian relations would not  be helped by taking mutual problems to the "Balladur plan"  meeting due to take place on May 26-27 in Paris.    French President [as received] Edouard Balladur has proposed  that a conference should be held at which the twelve countries  of the European Union, Central and East European countries, the  United States and Canada should come together to try to resolve  territorial and ethnic minority questions concerning the former  Communist countries. The plan has been approved by the EU.</p>

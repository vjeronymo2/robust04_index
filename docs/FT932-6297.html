			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (2): Budget a brake on mobility - A look at the effects of the chancellor's tax changes THE BATTLE lines are being firmly drawn between relocation consultants and the Inland Revenue over tax changes in the Finance Bill which could fundamentally change the costs and patterns of employee moves in the UK. Political consultants have been hired, clients contacted, position papers circulated and influential MPs identified. Earnest lobbying to ameliorate the effects of the chancellor's budget has begun. Mr Steve Abbley, managing director of PHH Homequity, a relocation company, says: 'Our main message is the cost of relocation is going to be increased by at least 20-25 per cent. It will put a brake on mobility.' His views are shared by three of his main competitors, Black Horse, Pricoa and Hambro Countrywide Relocation. The four companies have come together in a coalition to fight the tax changes. They are echoed by other similar businesses such as Nationwide Relocation. 'I think the government has been amazed at the furore this has caused,' says Mr Abbley. 'It's certainly stirred up a hornet's nest. I certainly don't think they thought it through properly.' Under the rules, employees could gain exemption from tax on expenses for relocation reimbursed by their employers. Their employers, in turn, could offset these costs against profits. Most reasonable costs could be offset, including elements such as the loss on sale of a house in an area where prices were stagnant or falling, moving costs, bridging loans and legal and administrative fees. But the position was enshrined only through two extra-statutory concessions: A67 on compensation for higher housing costs at a new location, and A5 on costs associated with moving to a new location. These run the risk of being subject to discretion by tax officials and applied differently around the country. While upper ceilings on allowances were vague, in practice Mr Michael Lansley, managing director of Hambro Country Relocation, says: 'It was all pretty straightforward. You just bunged (the expenses) in and they were allowable.' That will all change if the Finance Bill in its current form becomes law later this year. For the first time, the chancellor has proposed a ceiling on moving expenses against which tax can be allowed. It stands at Pounds 8,000. The concession on higher housing costs is withdrawn completely. In exchange, the bill permits tax relief against the value of any bridging loan up to the Pounds 8,000 limit where this has not already been exceeded by the costs of removals. The Inland Revenue says ministers will table an amendment so the reliefs will apply to UK residents moving abroad or foreign nationals seconded to the UK. It also stresses employees will not have to sell their home to gain tax relief against moving expenses, as long as their old home is not within 'reasonable daily travelling distance' of the new place of work. The changes offer cold comfort to the relocation campaigners and argue they will have at least two detrimental effects. First, costs of moving to employers and employees will increase substantially. The consultants estimate the average move costs about Pounds 25,000 - a figure also mentioned by the chancellor in his budget. Anything above the Pounds 8,000 limit will be counted as a taxable employee benefit. That means either the employee or the employer will pick up extra costs. Figures calculated by the relocation coalition suggest these estimates may be wrong. That is a particular concern, with those considering moving concerned about negative equity in their existing houses. Mr Lansley says: 'We've had a great deal of reaction from clients. They are faced with grossing up (relocation expenses) which will mean a considerable extra budget that they or their employees will have to pay.' As a result, the second impact of the budget change, according to the coalition, is that the number of moves may well fall. 'An awful lot of people who were planning group moves may think again,' says Mr Abbley. He warns this, in turn, could have a wider economic effect on towns such as the Development Corporations which have actively courted corporate relocations. 'It goes very much against the government's stated intention to increase jobs,' says Mr Lansley. 'What they are doing here is not encouraging economic recovery at all.' Mr Michael Kaltz, a partner with Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, who has been retained by the relocation lobby, raises a further problem. He says there will be greater confusion and more risk for error and hence penalties on tax returns by employees complying with the new rules. He argues that the change to the treatment of relocation expenses is essentially the introduction of a new form of tax. He says the Finance Bill's concessions - notably the statement that employees will not have to sell their old home - have only brought about a position which most people would have expected to be in place under the existing rules. Mr Kaltz also argues that the proposed Pounds 8,000 limit to tax relief was carefully thought through by the Inland Revenue, based on an estimate of the number of moves each year and projections of the cost. The aim, he says, was to raise Pounds 200m and the tax-free ceiling was adjusted accordingly. He questions the reliability of these estimates - although others would argue that the relocation lobby's figures of an average of Pounds 25,000 may, conversely, be over-generous. The relocation consultants are calling for reconsideration of three principal areas. First, to raise the tax-free limit on relocation expenses from Pounds 8,000, perhaps up to the preferred level Pounds 25,000. Second, to consider extending transitional relief further into the future beyond this tax year, since the changes would otherwise add to costs of moves which are already under way. Third, to revisit the issue of which categories of help given by employers to employees should qualify for statutory tax relief. The Inland Revenue says that any amendments to the Finance Bill are a matter for the politicians to decide. 'No doubt ministers will take note of the representations,' a spokesman said. But it stresses the chancellor's argument that the existing position unfairly discriminates in favour of individuals whose employees pay for their moving expenses. Those who move without such benefits must take the full cost themselves, while those with employers who agree to pay are being subsidised at taxpayers' expense.</p>

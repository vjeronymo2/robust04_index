			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Computer to 'speak' Europe's language A 'SPEAKING' computer that can read the most difficult European words and pronounce them to the satisfaction of the most punctilious local should emerge within the next two years. The European pronunciation dictionary, which will decide how to say the most commonly used surnames, street names and town and city names in eight European countries, is being funded by the European Commission to the tune of Pounds 2m. The two-year Onomastica project is intended to do more than alleviate the frustration of people with names such as Mainwaring or St John in places such as Cholmondeley, all of which are not pronounced according to English phonetic rules. Its aim is to produce pronunciation dictionaries for the UK, Denmark, the Netherlands, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, giving the 1m most commonly used names for each. 'We're filling in the gap in the dictionary,' says Professor Mervyn Jack of the Centre for Speech Technology Research at Edinburgh University, which is co-ordinating the project. Researchers believe the completed electronic dictionary could be used in conjunction with existing text-to-speech technology to enable recorded announcements to be read from computer screen or paper. Eventually it could be combined with speech recognition technology to automate entirely telephone directory inquiry services. Converting the names into spoken form has two stages: the written text is divided into individual sound elements, which are then converted into an audible synthetic voice. Although the text-to-speech conversion uses the latest technology, gathering the data is laborious. The institutions involved will each begin with a list of the 1m most commonly used names. In the UK, individuals, including primary school children, will be asked to pronounce their names into a tape recorder. A telephone line is also being set up for those with unusual names to phone up and enunciate them. This should take 18 months, after which each country will exchange information on the most commonly used of the 8m words.</p>

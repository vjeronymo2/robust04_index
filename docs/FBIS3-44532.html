			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Peter Seidlitz on interview with State Councillor </F> Song Jian, chairman of the Science and Technology Commission, in  Beijing on 4 January: "Beijing Set To Outperform Japan and  South Korea in the Sphere of Research Before Long"]    [Text] The technology transfer to the PRC is taking place  more rapidly than it did in the past to Japan, South Korea, or  the other "tiger" nations. "No other country received so much  high-tech in such a short period of time, and no other country  is spending so much on the modernization of its industry and its  agricultural sector as China," State Councillor Song Jian,  chairman of the Commission for Science and Technology, has said  in an interview with HANDELSBLATT.    The result of this development is that the PRC will assume  an  internationally leading position within a few years in important  spheres such as biochemistry, the microchip, electronics, and  computer industry, but also in the agricultural sector, and that  it might become a challenger to Europe, Japan, and even the  United States. Song pointed out that China was spending more  than $100 billion per year on buying technology. In addition,  in 1993 the country was promised almost the same amount in  investments from other countries. The process of modernization  is speeded up through the reform of the entire sphere of the  economy and technology. Song: "The walls in the universities  are being brought down just like the Berlin Wall."    Chinese institutes and universities have now been advised to  operate on commercial principles and to broadly take care of  their own funding. "Almost all research institutes in China are  now guided by market economy principles. Subsidies have been  cut by 70 percent. We are encouraging the institutes and  scientists to set up companies of their own. The  commercialization and the practical use of research results are  fully under way," Song said. This restructuring process should  be concluded no later than 1995. The university district in the  Beijing suburb of Zhongguan Cun has already become a huge  shopping center for electronics. The new entrepreneurs and  shop-owners come straight from the universities. The research  commission and Beijing University founded numerous risk capital  funds to lend financial support to professors and students who  "have put out into the sea of the market economy."    By the end of the century China will be able to compete with  Taiwan and South Korea at international markets with its micro-  electronics products. China has made offers to Japan for  cooperation in the sector of microchips and electronics but  Japanese companies have reacted with "careful modesty."  Nevertheless, China does not have any difficulties regarding  the transfer of technology. "We can now shop everywhere in the  world; there are practically no longer any Cocom [Coordinating  Committee for Multilateral Export Controls] controls," Song  said. Still, the United States rejected China's long shopping  list and is hesitating to cooperate particularly in the sphere  of space and satellites. "Thus the Americans are harming  themselves, because we have turned to the Germans, who would  like to do business with us," Song said. This refers in  particular to satellite technology. Here, cooperation has been  initiated with the Messerschmidt-Boelkow-Blohm company. For its  space program, China needs large solar collectors, altitude  control systems, and high-tension transistors. China will buy  these systems in Germany.    Regarding the state of development of China's rocket  technology, Song said that, apart from defensive aspects, China  was pursuing two objectives with its rocket program. On the one  hand, it wants to take into space "several dozens" of  communication and data link satellites with Chinese carrier  systems. Systems should be launched from other --  geographically more convenient -- places in the world, too. One  was seeking cooperation with Brazil in this connection. China is  able to carry satellites more cheaply than the Americans and  Europeans. The costs for one launching operation are only $50-  60 million. On the other hand, there is also the wish to pursue  independent space research and send manned rockets into space.  This is why larger rockets were being built with a higher  payload. China was not trying to compete with the Americans and  Russians but was pursuing this program out of "its own interest."    "In the sphere of science we already have a leading  international position in the area of biochemistry, even though  we are not always able to put our research results to practical  use. As far as product marketing is concerned, we are still  ineffective," Song said. He predicted that, in no later than  three to five years, China will take the lead in the area of  biotechnology. Tens of thousands of young scientists are  working in this sector without the restrictions western  scientists have to struggle with in the sphere of gene  technology. In the area of computers and software China also  aspired to a leading international role. The state councillor  pointed out that a subsidiary of Beijing University had already  achieved 1 billion renminbi (DM280 million) [German marks] in  sales and took a leading position for the development of the  software for China's publishing branch. Publishing houses in  Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan were using the software  developed in Beijing, and countries such as Singapore were  enticing away Chinese professors and researchers.    The state councillor, who used to teach at Harvard, pointed  to the large number (more than 100,000) of Chinese students in  the United States, Europe, and Japan. "Our students now enjoy  full freedom of movement: Those who return can shop at the free  labor market and leave the country again any time and without  any restrictions, Song said.  <H5>  Legal System Still Inadequate </H5>   Apart from the positive balance in the sphere of research  and  science, Song did not hesitate to say what some of the problems  were. China's legal system was still inadequate. He complained  that "we have so many new laws but they are not applied."  Moreover, the sector of state industry was like a millstone  around the neck of the country's reforms and slowing them down.  For the first time, Song outlined details about the planned  management reform in the state concerns. Song announced that  one was planning to introduce the German system of boards of  managers and supervisors in major state enterprises. These  bodies should be able to decide independently of the state and  carry out mutual controls. "We have studied the German system  and want to introduce it here."    The state councillor spoke about progress in the  agricultural  sector. The introduction of new technologies, such as in the  sphere of poultry farming and cattle breeding, but also in the  area of fishery have produced spectacular success. "In 1993 the  weather was not good for Chinese agriculture. Nevertheless,  production went up and we introduced a number of new products."  In the next century, China's population would soon rise to 1.5  billion. "We will have no problem in feeding these masses,"  Song said. China would even become an "important competitor" at  international markets for horticultural products, fruits, rice,  sugar, fishery products, and even certain kinds of grains.</p>

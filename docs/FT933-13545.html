			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Higher pay 'may prompt big rise in inflation' A BIG rise in inflation is likely over the next year as the current period of wage restraint comes to a halt, the Institute of Directors said in a survey published yesterday. It also found that nearly all the companies surveyed were not being hindered by the level of interest rates. With only 52 per cent of companies saying they have given employees a pay increase in the past 12 months, many businesses believe they will be forced to bow to demands for higher pay as the economy recovers. There is also scepticism about whether the government will stick to its policy of restricting pay rises among its own employees. More than a third of the 337 businesses polled in the survey think the year-on-year increase in the retail prices index will rise above 4 per cent by next June. In the year to last month it was 1.2 per cent, the lowest for nearly 30 years. The finding implies that the Treasury may have problems keeping its measure of underlying inflation - the RPI excluding mortgage payments - under its 4 per cent target. In contrast to the usual trend of complaints, 86 per cent of companies in the survey said present interest rates, held at 6 per cent since January, were 'not hindering' their businesses. Underlining general economic uncertainties, 45 per cent of businesses expected that the next move in interest rates would be up, while 49 per cent said they would come down. The survey, conducted last month, comes after subdued price pressures in recent months and comments from some economists that inflation is dead. The survey says: 'There is very little evidence that directors believe that inflation is being brought under control once and for all.' Only 7 per cent of those interviewed expected retail price inflation to be less than 2 per cent by next June. While many businesses are relaxed about the prospects of high import costs forcing up inflation, the survey focuses on anxieties that prices throughout the economy will move up during the next pay round. This is partly due to the repercussions of the long period in which private-sector pay settlements have been kept low, while a 1.5 per cent ceiling has been enforced on pay rises for government employees. Over the next six months, 38 per cent of companies expect to give a pay rise, with a further 16 per cent anticipating one in January. Stronger business confidence and a growth in the service industry in the second quarter of the year has boosted hopes of economic recovery in London, a survey for the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry found. Nearly half of service companies said business had improved in recent months, while only 15 per cent said sales had gone down. However, relatively few companies expected to take on more employees in the coming months.</p>

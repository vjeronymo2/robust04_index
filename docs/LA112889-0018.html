			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINESE STUDENTS IN U.S. COLLEGES  </P> <P> In my opinion, your editorial "An Affront to Tradition" (Nov. 17) has voiced  the general sentiment among Chinese students in this country concerning the  Bush Administration's conduct of Sino-American relations.  </P> <P> While we are generally appreciative and supportive of the Administration's  initial actions in response to the June 4th massacre in Beijing, we have become  increasingly wary of the Administration's current approach to its relations to  Beijing as exemplified in its intervention of the congressional proposal  providing political protection to Chinese students in America. What is even  more alarming is the State Department argument that the passage of the proposal  would threaten the Sino-American educational exchange programs. When we  consider this argument in conjunction with the recent withdrawal by the Chinese  government from the Fulbright scholarship program and its explicit threat to  suspend the intercollegiate exchange programs between the two countries, we  cannot help asking two questions:  </P> <P> First, what are the principles whereupon the Administration formulates and  conducts its China policy? On geopolitical expediency and interests? Or on the  historic American tradition of freedom and democracy?  </P> <P> Second, is the current Chinese government sincere in resolving the differences  between China and the U.S.? So far, all we hear is rhetoric. Even the rhetoric  does not invoke any optimism. We hear Deng Xiaoping lecturing former President  Nixon, the good friend of China, on the fine points of how "too deeply America  has involved and interfered in China's internal affairs" and, therefore, the  U.S., not China, should take initiatives toward resolving the differences.  </P> <P> In addition, your editorial has also helped clarify a long held myth about the  "government sponsorship" of the Chinese students in America. Not only a large  percent of the total 40,000 or more students are solely supported by either  their families or relatives in the West, but the rest of the so-called  government-sponsored students or scholars normally only receive government  financial support for one or two years. Of these government financial supports,  a large portion consists of World Bank or other international fund scholarships  and other foreign institutional scholarships.  </P> <P> Most of the Chinese students and scholars have depended solely on their own  merits, and on the good will and generosity of American universities to get  through.  </P> <P> XUN LIU  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

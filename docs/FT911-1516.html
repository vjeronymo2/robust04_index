			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: An advisers' exam YOUR FINANCIAL adviser may soon be sitting an exam. A new organisation, the Society of Financial Advisers (SOFA), has been established to promote professional standards in the financial adviser community. Only advisers who pass examinations set by the Chartered Insurance Institute (CII) - and who agree to abide by a strict code of conduct - will be eligible for membership of SOFA. The new organisation will attempting to remedy perceived deficiencies in the financial advisory sector, identified by Dr Oonagh McDonald in her report for the Securities and Investments Board, entitled 'Training and Competence within the Financial Services Industry.' The CII has already introduced the Financial Planning Certificate (FPC) and this will be improved. Candidates will be required to pass papers in three subjects: marketing, salesmanship and investor protection; life assurance and other investments; and pensions. There will be optional papers in mortgages and personal general insurance. Those who pass the FPC will be entitled to take the Advanced Financial Planning Certificate (AFPC) entitling them to membership of SOFA. The AFPC will require candidates to sit three papers, with taxation and trusts one compulsory paper. The other two papers will be chosen from personal investment planning, corporate investment planning, business management and marketing. Once an applicant has passed the exam, he will be entitled to have the status 'Member of the Society of Financial Advisers' on his business cards and stationery. Annual membership costs Pounds 50. The hope is that by the end of this year, several thousand advisers will have passed. Clients can thus start to look out for advisers, with SOFA membership, in 1992. A professional qualification is no guarantee of excellent advice but clients will at least have a guide to which advisers have proved their competence. The new society should be welcomed by clients and advisers alike.</p>

			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper bounces to fresh highs - Week in the Markets The London Metal Exchange copper market recovered from a mid-week shake-out to climb yesterday to a fresh four-year peak. The three months price closed at Dollars 2,937.50 a tonne, Dollars 22.50 below the day's high but Dollars 80.50 above Wednesday's low. The upturn started in earnest on Thursday as traders looked forward to the announcement yesterday morning a sizeable reduction in LME warehouse stocks of the metal. They were not disappointed - the stocks total was down 4.4 per cent tonnes at 304,275 tonnes - and renewed speculative buying was encouraged. The heavy stocks drawdown was thought to reflect physical shipments to China, and more is expected to be heading in that direction over the next few weeks. The other main bullish factor affecting copper was continuing tightness of nearby availability, which resulted in the cash/three months premium widening to Dollars 60 from Dollars 41 at the end of last week. Aluminium stocks were down a little more than copper's but the fall was relatively modest by recent standards. In any case, continuing erosion of the LME stockpile is taken for granted as internationally-agreed production cuts work through to the market. An early attempt yesterday to push the three months LME price back through the Dollars 1,900-a-tonne mark ran into overhead resistance and the price subsided to Dollars 1,877.50 at the close, down Dollars 67.50 on the week but Dollars 17.50 off Wednesday's low. The nickel market held on to most of last week's spectacular advance as uncertainty about the situation at Russia's troubled Norilsk complex, the world's biggest producer of the metal, discouraged sellers. The three month's price touched a fresh 3 1/4 -year high of Dollars 9,600 a tonne on Monday but ended the week at Dollars 8,865, down Dollars 87.50 on balance. Silver continued to lead the retreat in the precious metals markets. Support above Dollars 4.90 a troy ounce was broken by renewed investment fund selling on Monday and the London cash price closed yesterday at Dollars 46.90, adding 23.50 cents to last week's 25-cent fall. Gold fared little better, falling Dollars 1.60 overall to Dollars 377.60 an ounce. But dealers were looking for a rally. 'The market is oversold,' one told the Reuters news agency, 'and the reluctance of people to go long now may give any technical bounce more impetus when it eventually happens.' At the London Commodity Exchange March delivery robusta coffee futures briefly pushed above Dollars 2,900 a tonne in mid-week. But buyers backed off after the publication of a Brazilian stock audit, which was broadly in line with recent market estimates. The price closed yesterday at Dollars 2,805 a tonne, up Dollars 23 on the week. The mild northern winter continued to weigh on the oil market, pushing prices at London's International Petroleum Exchange below Dollars 16 a barrel on Monday. Buyers were attracted at that level, however, and in late trading yesterday the February position was showing a modest rise on the week. A buoyant shiping market lifted the LCE's Baltic Freight Index above 2,000 points for the first time in its history on Thursday. The index, which forms the basis for Biffex freight futures, reached 2,027 yesterday, up 77 on the week. Three months ago it was at 1,435. 'These are volatile times for the market driven by a significant build-up in international trade for grain an minerals, said Philippe van den Abeele, chairman of the LCE Biffex market committee.  --------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  --------------------------------------------- Aluminium        -12,275  to  1,799,300 Aluminium alloy     +120  to  29,360 Copper           -14,125  to  304,275 Lead                +875  to  356,925 Nickel              -720  to  149,688 Zinc              -3,300  to  1,198,700 Tin                 -190  to  28,845  ---------------------------------------------</p>

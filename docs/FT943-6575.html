			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Bonn gives pledge on defence spending: Armed forces budget will be raised to DM47.9bn plus inflation for 4 years Chancellor Helmut Kohl has assured anxious army commanders that years of defence cuts, which have dented morale and held up modernisation, have ended and that the armed forces budget will be increased slightly and will remain untouched over the next four years. In an unusual secret meeting last Thursday with around 30 senior commanders of the Bundeswehr, the German armed forces, the chancellor promised that the military would receive DM47.9bn (Pounds 19.7bn) plus inflation over the next four years. This year's defence budget stood at DM47.5bn. Further savings will also be available for new investments following a decision in July to shorten the length of military service from 12 months to 10 months and a planned reduction of the Bundeswehr to 340,000 men and women by the beginning of 1996. The savings mean that 30 per cent of the defence budget will be given over to new investments, up from the present 22 per cent, a spokesman said. The government initially released no details of the meeting with the army commanders so as to avoid the impression of a campaign stunt ahead of the October general elections, according to the Welt am Sonntag newspaper. The armed forces' morale has been battered in recent years, with cuts in defence spending coming just as the Bundeswehr integrated with the 170,000-strong Nationale Volksarmee, the armed forces of the former East German state. A report by the armed forces ombudsman in March said officers and soldiers were bewildered by the political confusion surrounding the future of the Bundeswehr and were having to shout 'bang bang' on military exercises because there was no money for the blank ammunition which is usually used. The mood in the Bundeswehr was not improved by numerous reports of confusion in the upper echelons of the defence ministry and criticism by many senior commanders of Mr Volker Ruhe, the defence minister, over the management of the spending cuts. A defence budget of DM47.9bn was first mooted during talks in July when the decision was made to shorten national service. In 1990, the last year before extraordinary savings were needed to fund German reunification, the defence budget stood at DM52.6bn. Mr Kohl's decision gives the defence ministry a sum with which it can continue its strategic planning for the next four years, a defence ministry spokesman said yesterday.</p>

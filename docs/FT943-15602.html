			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Acost calls for R&amp;D tax changes The UK government should undertake a wide-ranging study of the relationship between the tax system and industrial innovation, the Advisory Council on Science and Technology says in its final report this week, Clive Cookson writes. (Acost has been replaced by the Council for Science and Technology.) Acost's report is the latest in a series by influential bodies calling for government action to stimulate research and development by more favourable tax treatment for R&amp;D. The Commons Committee on Science and Technology made a similar recommendation earlier this year. Office of Science and Technology: UK, 071 271 2105</p>

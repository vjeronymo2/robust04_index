			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / UN envoy fails to win Afghan ceasefire A United Nations envoy left the Afghan capital, Kabul, yesterday saying he had failed to win a commitment for a ceasefire from President Burhanuddin Rabbani and his rival, Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, Reuter reports from Kabul. 'I have not got a firm commitment from the conflicting sides for a lasting ceasefire,' Mr Mahmud Mestiri, special envoy of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, said at the end of a five-day visit. He planned to meet leaders of Afghanistan's provinces over the next two weeks to try to find a way of ending the fighting before returning to Kabul for final talks with the rival leaders. Mr Mestiri had two rounds of talks with Mr Rabbani and met Mr Hekmatyar at the prime minister's headquarters south of Kabul to try to mediate an end to two years of factional warfare. 'We prefer a permanent ceasefire to a temporary one, not only in Kabul but in all of Afghanistan,' Mr Rabbani declared after his talks with Mr Mestiri. The two sides had agreed to a ceasefire during the envoy's visit, although clashes erupted in the Tagab Valley, about 40 miles north-east of Kabul. 'I asked the leaders, especially the fighting sides, to extend the ceasefire which has been holding during this visit,' Mr Mestiri said. 'We think that Kabul must not return to the inhuman conditions of the past three months of war.' The International Committee of the Red Cross says 2,500 people have been killed, 17,000 wounded and 300,000 made homeless since the latest round of the war for supremacy in Kabul erupted on New Year's Day. More than 11,000 people have been killed and a third of Kabul's 1.5m residents have fled the fighting since Mujahideen groups took power from the former communist government and formed an Islamic coalition in April 1992. Mr Rabbani said he had asked the UN to continue its involvement in Afghanistan. 'I hope with the co-operation of the United Nations that a decision-making body could be established soon, made up of people's delegates from all over Afghanistan,' he added. Mr Hekmatyar has demanded Mr Rabbani's resignation as a prerequisite for peace. Mr Rabbani refuses, saying his departure would open a dangerous power vacuum.</p>

			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOEING WORK FORCE IN PALMDALE  </P> <P> I would like to clarify several issues raised by your Sept. 11 story on  Boeing's B-2 work force in Palmdale.  </P> <P> Your story focused on approximately 450 Boeing workers from Seattle on  temporary assignment in Palmdale, questioning the strength of Boeing's efforts  to hire locally -- as well as the extra expense that such a practice might add  to the B-2 program as a whole.  </P> <P> To expand on the facts outlined in your story, Boeing currently has 866  employees working in Palmdale in support of Northrop's B-2 final assembly. Of  these, 415 were hired locally or permanently transferred to the area.  </P> <P> We agree that we should hire a local work force to meet our needs to the  maximum extent possible. In the last year and a half, 11 recruiting sessions  for hourly and salaried workers for the B-2 program have been held in Palmdale  and the greater Los Angeles area (Boeing also recruits extensively in Southern  California for openings throughout the company).  </P> <P> Advertisements for B-2 Palmdale have appeared in the Antelope Valley, Los  Angeles, Orange County and San Bernardino newspapers. Despite these aggressive  efforts, we could not hire all the people we needed with the specific skills  required. We also increased our wage scale.  </P> <P> As to the cost factor in using temporary workers, there is no advantage to  Boeing; in fact, to the contrary, added cost reduces any profit we may earn.  </P> <P> Boeing -- despite the fact that we are headquartered in Seattle -- has a very  positive impact on the Southern California economy. Last year, Boeing purchased  about $2 billion in products and services from companies in Los Angeles and  Orange counties. About half of our 120 key B-2 suppliers are located in your  area, and Boeing contracts with more than 900 suppliers in the Los Angeles  Basin. To give just one example, Northrop's local work for Boeing on the 747  fuselage is directly responsible for 2,700 jobs in your local economy.  </P> <P> C.G.

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Chicago futures volume surges as US stocks slide The stock market slide on Wall Street on Tuesday prompted money managers to shift assets into higher-yielding securities, a shift reflected in rising volume in the interest rate pits of Chicago's futures exchanges. Globex, the after-hours computer trading system owned by Reuters and operated by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Paris's Matif, logged record business starting at 2.30pm local time on Tuesday, shortly after the CME's eurodollar futures pit closed. By the time the electronic trading session ended early on Wednesday morning, turnover had hit 24,365 contracts, by far Globex's best night. 'People moved in to buy eurodollars as the stock market fell,' said the CME. Of Globex's total turnover overnight, 20,681 contracts were eurodollar futures. The Chicago Board of Trade's electronic after-market trading system, Project A, logged a record 11,000 contracts, mostly 30-year US Treasury bond futures, during the two hours it was open on Tuesday. Tuesday night's volume surge also boosted the daytime volumes in Chicago futures trading. Trading that day pushed the CBoT's cumulative volume for the year above 200.6m contracts, a record for any exchange.</p>

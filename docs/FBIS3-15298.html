The Ukrainian president  was met by U.S. officials, Ukrainian Ambassador to the United  States Oleh Bilorus, and representatives of the Ukrainian  Diaspora. Later, special helicopters transported the Ukrainian  delegation to a square near the White House, from where they  went on to Blair House. [passage omitted]    In accordance with the program for the first day of the  visit, the Ukrainian president met with Senators Paul Simon and  Harris (Owford). During a conversation with representatives of  the legislative branch, Leonid Kravchuk put particular emphasis  on the complex issues that Ukraine is facing currently and  outlined ways for further development of cooperation between our  countries. In the evening, an official reception was held at  the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington, on the occasion of the  official visit to the United States by President Leonid Kravchuk.    On 4 March, a meeting between Leonid Kravchuk and Bill  Clinton is planned. It is expected that a package of important  documents will be signed, which will introduce a new path in  strengthening economic and political relations between Ukraine  and the United States. The political willingness of the leaders  of both countries' to extend our experience from cooperation in  the military-political sphere to economic, trade, and  scientific-technical cooperation, is a positive sign of the  current status of U.S.-Ukrainian relations. The legal basis for  this cooperation is to be established by appropriate interstate  agreements.</p>

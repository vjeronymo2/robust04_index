			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Spread of Aids 'threatens' Asia A 'potentially severe and long-lasting' impact of the HIV/Aids epidemic on Asian economies poses a serious threat to the region's robust growth, according to studies by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Jose Galang writes from Manila.  Mr Peter Sullivan, vice-president for operations at the Manila-based ADB, said yesterday the HIV epidemic was the enemy of the 'Asian promise'. He addressed the opening of an ADB-sponsored meeting on the economic implications of the disease. The World Health Organisation, it was noted, has forecast that by the year 2000 some 30 per cent of cases worldwide may be in Asia. Mr Myo Thant, an ADB economist, noted that since the first reports of Aids cases in the region in the mid-1980s, the number of HIV infections had soared to 1m by 1991. He attributed the spread of the epidemic to 'a large commercial sex industry and intravenous drug use' in the region. 'Rapid population growth, increasing mass migration of labour within the region, and a growing international and intra-Asian tourist industry, all facilitate the spread of the virus to those countries that are relatively less affected at present,' he said.</p>

			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: NITROUS OXIDE CANISTERS GIVE A 'HIGH' FEELING BUT CAN KILL  </P> <P> Question: I work in a store that sells a device for whipping cream. We also  sell the chargers, which contain nitrous oxide (laughing gas).  </P> <P> Our problem is customers who buy the chargers for recreational purposes. It's  not unusual for a group of teen-agers to request 10 boxes on a Friday or a  Saturday night. (A box contains 10 chargers.)  </P> <P> We are upset about this because we are aware that abuse can be dangerous and  that people have died of overdoses. Please tell us how this gas affects the  brain and why people die from inhaling it.  </P> <P> Answer: Nitrous oxide has been used as an anesthetic for more than 100 years  and is still used during surgery under carefully controlled conditions because  it is an analgesic. Unfortunately, "laughing gas" has also been abused because  it produces a "high" feeling.  </P> <P> The problem with inhaling nitrous oxide is that it can cause unconsciousness  due to lack of oxygen. A person who overdoses may stop breathing.  </P> <P> You have a legitimate concern about the abuse of the nitrous oxide canisters  used for whipping cream. Perhaps the store could consider limiting the number  of chargers it sells to minors.  </P> <P> Q: What can I do for itching of the anus? I have had it for some time, and it  is driving me crazy. This biting and itching feeling is embarrassing, and most  of the time the drugstore hemorrhoid remedies don't stop it.  </P> <P> A: Dermatologists tell us that pruritus ani, also known as itchy bottom, can be  caused by many factors. Coffee, citrus fruit and beans may aggravate this  condition, as can tight clothing. Perfumed toilet paper and clothes washed in  fabric softener also may contribute. People who are overweight are more likely  to suffer.  </P> <P> The usual remedies are greasy ointments or cortisone creams. These are likely  to make the problem worse because they increase moisture in the area. Although  it is difficult, try to avoid scratching, as it can set up a vicious cycle that  leads to more intense itching.  </P> <P> A dermatologist may be able to determine the underlying cause. In the meantime,  keep the area dry by patting it clean with cotton balls soaked in witch hazel  or special wipes such as Tucks, Mediconet or Preparation H Cleansing Pads.  </P></p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Money Markets: London rates firmer NEWS OF a sharp rise in March UK retail sales pushed interest rates higher on the London money market yesterday. Dealers expected a very small increase of about 0.1 per cent, and were concerned that March sales rose 3.7 per cent after falling marginally in February. The authorities said retail demand was boosted by buying ahead of VAT increases, announced in the Budget on March 19, but not effective until April 1. Nevertheless the market is concerned that the figure may delay further cuts in UK bank base rates. Three-month sterling interbank rose to 11 7/8 -11 3/4 from 11 25/32 -11 21/32 per cent and 12-month money firmed to 11 7/16 -11 5/16 from 11 3/8 -11 1/4 per cent. On Liffe short sterling futures weakened following the retail sales news. June delivery opened at 88.69 and fell to a low of 88.63 before closing at 88.64 compared with 88.71 previously. Day-to-day credit was in short supply on the cash market. The Bank of England initially forecast a shortage of Pounds 900m, but revised this to Pounds 1,100m at noon and to Pounds 1,050m in the afternoon. Total assistance of Pounds 875m was provided. An early round of help was offered and at that time the authorities bought Pounds 161m bills outright, by way of Pounds 23m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and Pounds 138m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent. Before lunch another Pounds 153m bills were purchased, via Pounds 45m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and Pounds 108m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent. In the afternoon Pounds 561m bills were bought, through Pounds 81m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent, Pounds 42m Treasury bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent and Pounds 438m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent. Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up of Treasury bills drained Pounds 949m, with exchequer transactions absorbing Pounds 250m and bank balances below target Pounds 270m. These outweighed a fall in the note circulation adding Pounds 570m to liquidity. In Frankfurt call money rose to 8.85 from 8.80 per cent in response to Friday's warnings by top Bundesbank officials that German monetary policy will stay tight. Dealers said they expect call money to remain just below the 9 per cent Lombard rate, but are waiting for further guidance from the terms of this week's securities repurchase agreement tender.</p>

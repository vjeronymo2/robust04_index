			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Former Punch cartoonist bids for magazine A BID for Punch, once the UK's best-known humorous magazine, has been made by Mr Bill Tidy, one of its former cartoonists, and Mr John Cocker, a Canadian physician. Mr Tidy said yesterday that he and Mr Cocker had lodged a bid for Punch with Mr Graham Wilson, managing director of United Newspapers, which owns the title. Punch folded in April after losses of up to Pounds 1m annually, following 150 years of political, commercial and editorial volatility. Mr Cocker has a range of publishing involvements, including the Punch Digest for Canadian Doctors, a bi-monthly subscription-only spin-off of Punch. Licensed by United Newspapers, the magazine publishes extracts from Punch and other humour and lifestyle pieces. Mr Tidy declined to say how much his bid was, but it is thought to be substantially less than the Pounds 6m United Newspapers was said to be looking for following the closure of Punch. Mr Tidy said yesterday: 'The only thing we have in our favour is an assurance from United Newspapers that they would only sell to someone who would carry on Punch's tradition of first-rate humour. They have refused offers from quite large institutions. 'It's a funny world, is business; sometimes money talks, sometimes pride and prejudice talks. I can't fight the giants but we can't let them buy everything, can we?' Punch hit its circulation peak in the 1940s, reaching about 175,000 readers weekly. By last year that had collapsed to no more than 33,000, hit by rival publications and changing tastes in humour. United Newspapers has a number of assets that are associated with the magazine. The title is still a good brand name. The Punch library and archive is still supplying cartoons and pictures to a wide range of customers, as well as publishing a variety of cartoon anthologies from the magazine's archives. Mr Tidy's connection with Punch started in 1958, although he departed a short time before it folded, in a disagreement over senior editorial appointments. Mr Tidy said that United Newspapers had promised 'to let us know as soon as possible'.</p>

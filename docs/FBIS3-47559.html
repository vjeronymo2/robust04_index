Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice minister for international affairs  at  the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, said at a  press conference, "there remains a gap and both sides have to  make efforts to bridge the gap."    Subcabinet-level trade officials of the two countries began  talks Wednesday on auto trade, a priority sector in the  bilateral framework trade negotiations agreed to last July.    Okamatsu said he will continue talks with his U.S.  counterpart Jeffrey Garten until Saturday and will then have  another meeting with him late next week in Washington.    The vice trade ministers of the two countries will also  discuss the issue again on January 24 and 25 in Washington and  on February 3 to 5 in Tokyo, Okamatsu said.    It is necessary to have a balanced package accord when Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton meet  in Washington on February 11, he said.    Okamatsu said the U.S. side is sticking to its call for some  sort of numerical target for Japan's purchases of U.S.-made  automobiles and auto parts, though it has changed its  terminology to "indicators" to measure progress and results.    Japan rejected the U.S. demand for future benchmarks and  instead offered criteria to assess the implementation of  measures and policies already taken, as provided in the  framework agreement, trade ministry officials said.    "Regrettably, we need wisdom to recover a trustworthy  bilateral relationship," Okamatsu said.</p>

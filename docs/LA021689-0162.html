			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> FLAMES WIN RECORD 8TH STRAIGHT  </P> <P> The Calgary Flames make themselves at home wherever they are these days.  </P> <P> Theoren Fleury and Joe Mullen scored 14 seconds apart in a four-goal  second-period rally at Winnipeg to lead the Flames to a 6-1 win for a  club-record eighth consecutive victory.  </P> <P> The Flames, on their way to the best overall record for the second consecutive  season, have won the last four on a trip that began after the All-Star game.  They are unbeaten in the last 12 games, one of them a tie.  </P> <P> Their 40th victory gave the Flames 90 points, a lead of eight over Montreal,  the leader in the Adams Division.  </P> <P> As it has throughout the trip, the Flames' defense was overpowering. They  limited the Jets to 18 shots. Goaltender Rick Wamsley lost his shutout when  Dale Hawerchuk scored his 29th late in the second period after Calgary had  scored four goals.  </P> <P> Although he had suffered a broken nose and seven stitches in his face after  being hit in the face by a stick in the first period, Calgary captain Lannie  McDonald acknowledged the club is roaring into the stretch.  </P> <P> "This trip, the boys have stuck to the game plan," he said. "We played four and  won four. It's nice to go home with that kind of record.  </P> <P> "It's been fun to be a part of this team. I've missed 25 games because of  injuries, but when I've had a chance to play I feel I've given this club the  kind of leadership that wins championships."  </P> <P> Detroit 4, Minnesota 2 -- Coach Jacques Demers has been after playmaker Adam  Oates to shoot more often. Oates took his advice in this game at Detroit and  had a goal and two assists.  </P> <P> The victory enabled the Red Wings to build their lead in the Norris Division to  nine points.  </P> <P> "Jacques has been on my case about not shooting," said Oates, who has 15 goals.  "But I still have to play my own game. If I think about it too much I'll miss  the passes."  </P> <P> Gerard Gallant scored his 33rd goal to give the Red Wings a 3-0 lead and enable  the line of Gallant, Steve Yzerman and Paul MacLean to reach a club-record 115  goals. The old record for a line was 114 set by Frank Mahovlich, Alex  Delvecchio and Gordie Howe in 1968-69.  </P> <P> Buffalo 5, New Jersey 3 -- Sean Burke, the Devils' young goaltender, had been  playing extremely well and the Devils were moving up the ladder.  </P> <P> But Burke found out early in this game at Buffalo that this wasn't his night.  Just 2:39 into the game, he knocked the puck into his own net for a Sabres'  goal.  </P> <P> Then, the Sabres, winning for only the second time in seven games, turned  power-play goals by Mike Hartman, Mike Foligno and Christian Ruuttu into  victory.  </P> <P> Hartford 4, Toronto 2 -- Paul MacDermid had a goal and two assists at Toronto  to lead the Whalers to their third consecutive victory.  </P> <P> The Whalers outshot the Maple Leafs, 38-28.  </P> <P> Chicago 7, Washington 4 -- Dirk Graham's second goal of the game 40 seconds  into the last period broke a 3-3 tie and the Blackhawks went on to end the  Capitals' eight-game road winning streak.

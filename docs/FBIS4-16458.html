			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Andrey Afanasyevich Kokoshin, first deputy </F> defense minister, by Christian Schmidt-Haeuer; date, place not  given: "`We Have Come Very Close To Strikes'"]    [Text] [Schmidt-Haeuer] Russia's Armed Forces and its arms  industry are threatened with being dried out financially. You  have recently warned that, as a result of the budget cuts, the  army might get out of control. Is Russia -- in a time of peace  -- threatened by a military and arms technological collapse?    [Kokoshin] There is in practice never a hopeless situation,  because a way out can always be found. In this case the way out  is to restructure the budget. This applies mainly to the  revenue side. My main criticism was directed against the fact  that the spending was planned without a sufficient guarantee of  revenue. This is why we are being affected by this budget,  although not only the Defense Ministry but also in the spheres  of culture, science, and social affairs.    [Schmidt-Haeuer] Still, in this situation the army is a very  special budget item.    [Kokoshin] About 70 percent of our concrete military  spending now goes on personnel costs and social benefits. This  is why we are in the same boat as science and culture, with  doctors and teachers. We do not stand on the other side of the  riverbank. Another thing is, of course, that here we are  talking of money to be spent on providing guarantees for people  in uniform and with guns in their hand; and also for those who  produce the arms.    [Schmidt-Haeuer] Through military reform, President Yeltsin  wants to facilitate the restructuring of the defense budget to  the benefit of social support. Can one really combine the  modernization of the army and social emergency supply?    [Kokoshin] There are a number of concrete decisions, one of  which is the president's decree on the stabilization of the  situation in the arms industry. The president determines that  at least 10 percent of defense spending has to be used for  research and development. This is intended to guarantee the  preservation of the scientific-technological potential.    However, at the same time we are facing enormous social  problems. Let us take housing construction, for example. It is  now eating up more than 90 percent of the funds for our military  construction program -- after all, we have to accommodate those  members of the military who go into the reserves as a result of  troop reductions. Here the situation has deteriorated even from  last year. In the first three months of 1994 the financing of  housing construction unfortunately reached less than 20 percent  of the planned quota. The situation also looks very bad as far  as paying for arms is concerned -- although state orders had  been cut to the minimum even before.    [Schmidt-Haeuer] What effects does this have in concrete  terms?    [Kokoshin] Now as then, many enterprises and entire cities  are dependent on arms orders. Even though the share of arms and  military technology has been reduced there in favor of civilian  goods, the management continues to burden the total costs for  the entire social infrastructure, that is to say kindergartens,  polyclinics, schools, and frequently even technical colleges,  only on the prices for arms products. And the city and communal  administrative bodies hesitate to take over the social  facilities because their revenue is still insufficient despite  the new tax law. So far, they have only picked those complexes  that they were able to lease out immediately for a profit. This  is how part of defense spending is financing hidden  unemployment....    [Schmidt-Haeuer] And to what extent has this spending been  cut overall?    [Kokoshin] Unfortunately, our orders for the arms industry  were cut by 67 percent in 1992 alone. This is unparalleled in  any other country. In 1992 we bought a total of 20 tanks from  our industry -- in 1988 the number was still 2,800. And the  considerably extended amount of civilian products did not find  enough buyers either -- neither state nor private ones.    [Schmidt-Haeuer] This means that the conversion of  enterprises is not worthwhile?    [Kokoshin] Many enterprises have considerably increased the  range of their civilian products. The tank construction plant  at Nishniy Tagil, for example, has been converted to the  production of railroad tankers and loading machines  [Lademaschinen] amid great fuss. Yet, now these tankers are  crowding the storage yards. The Railroads Ministry does not  have the money to buy them. Radio satellites cannot be bought  by the Ministry for Telecommunications, nor can it afford to buy  the rockets to launch them.    [Schmidt-Haeuer] In order to pay the state's orders to the  arms industry, the state would have to spend five times as much  as planned in the 1994 draft budget.    [Kokoshin] The figures presented by the Finance Ministry are  unrealistic. However, now there is the proposal that government  and the State Duma together draw up the 1994 budget again.  After the extremely tough confrontations last year, there is  thus the opportunity to work out a new budget in the spirit of  national accord -- thus, in the spirit of the policy that  President Yeltsin has now proclaimed and that is supported by  the chairmen of both parliamentary chambers.    [Schmidt-Haeuer] But former Vice President Aleksandr Rutskoy  has just come out very harshly against Yeltsin's offer of  reconciliation. And Rutskoy is also a military officer....    [Kokoshin] He is no longer a military officer. And such an  attitude seems completely wrong to me. Now we really have an  opportunity for national reconciliation. And we need it  urgently. I am convinced that the overwhelming majority of our  people also want it.    [Schmidt-Haeuer] A high-ranking representative of the  interests of the arms industry has warned against a wave of  strikes. He says that the miners just have a piece of coal in  their hands, but the arms companies have poison or  intermediate-range missiles, which almost any unqualified worker  could launch from the factory's yard. How serious is the mood  in reality?    [Kokoshin] Unfortunately, we have come very close to  strikes, even though the most disciplined people are working in  the arms sectors. And they are also aware that they are in a  situation that is a bit different from that of the miners, that  other laws apply to them. However, in the factories there is  indeed a mood that indicates strikes. Last autumn I had to  settle several such conflicts. In September the staff of a  large arms company went on strike. The women took the protest  to the streets. We had to take a lot of money out of many other  companies to pay them their wages and to pay support to them for  another two months. Such situations are escalating again now,  so I do not want to underestimate the danger of strikes.    [Schmidt-Haeuer] How many arms companies have closed down  because of bankruptcy, and for how many is this danger imminent?    [Kokoshin] From the legal point of view, I do not think that  a single one has been closed down, because the local  administrations are doing everything to avert this danger.  Since we lack social security and an unemployment benefit  system and people are not mentally prepared for life without  work, closing down companies and lay-offs feel like the  apocalypse for the local authorities.    However, I do not believe that the situation is hopeless.  Even if they get only small financial infusions, many companies  would certainly be able not only to start working again but to  continue the policy of modernization and production conversion.  If certain incentives are given by the government, we can  expect that private businessmen and banks will also invest in  the industry. However, without a strong incentive by the  government to develop the infrastructure, that is,  transportation, communications, and the energy sector, it will  be very difficult to get out of the crisis. The invisible hand  of the market still works very badly.    [Schmidt-Haeuer] And the visible hand of the state does not  work any better, either, at least for the time being....    [Kokoshin] The state is not fulfilling its obligations. We  used to be the scapegoat for the people. Now they realize that  it is not our Ministry's fault.    [Schmidt-Haeuer] But that does not provide food. Anyone who  can tries to earn his keep elsewhere. The fear of Russian  scientists emigrating, and of the illegal export of uranium and  highly developed weapons and technologies continues.    [Kokoshin] Such dangers certainly exist. The hunt for  experts continues. And there are people who cannot do anything  other than build weapons. For their minds any kind of  conversion is too late. Therefore, it is so important to  preserve and finance an appropriate level of arms production to  keep these experts in Russia -- in a Russia that continues along  the path of democracy and market economy.    [Schmidt-Haeuer] But you yourself, in an interview, have  attributed yet another state assignment to the arms industry,  namely to be the most important resource of competitiveness.    [Kokoshin] However, I put the emphasis on something else on  principle. There I made the establishment of a  science-intensive high-tech civilian production a priority --  but on the basis of the resources of the defense complex. This  is our main potential to assume a worthy place among the great  powers, among the developed industrialized nations. For me this  seems to be a more important aspect for the state's security in  the broadest sense -- beyond military power and military  technology.</p>

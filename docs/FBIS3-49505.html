Madeleine Albright told Klaus today.    During a meeting between Albright, head of U.S. Armed Forces  John Shalikashvili, and Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus, the three  participants held similar views on the "Partnership for Peace"  project.    To the countries of the Central European region, it presents  an open opportunity for establishing close military and  political ties with NATO, according to the statement issued by  the Premier's Office. The project is also a tool, according to  Klaus, for strengthening the internal stability of the Central  European region.    U.S. presence in Europe is important for democratic  development and stability of the whole of Europe, Klaus said at  the meeting, adding that the Czech Republic is interested in its  neighbors' success and prosperity. The Czech Republic prefers  concrete accords like the Central European Free Trade Agreement  to summits and joint declarations, Klaus said.</p>

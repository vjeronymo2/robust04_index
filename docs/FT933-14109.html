			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: BAT in demand International trading group BAT Industries bucked the market trend after Morgan Stanley issued a strong 'buy' recommendation. The shares finished 2 ahead at 418p following hectic trading of 9.4m. A note from Mr Youssef Ziai, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, calls BAT a 'cheap insurance stock'. He said: 'At the current share price, BAT's insurance operations alone account for nearly all of the stock's market capitalisation. The tobacco activities, with pre-tax earnings of over Pounds 1bn per annum, are in for less than one year's profits.' Strong rumours were heard that Rank Organisation would accompany this morning's results with the announcement of a large hotel disposal. The shares rebounded following a weak session on Monday to close 8 up at 767p. Market talk mooted that a Pounds 60m disposal had been agreed, suggesting that Rank may have finally sold one of its prestigious London hotels, such as the Royal Lancaster. Food retailers endured another poor session, with UBS said to have lowered its profits forecasts for the leading stocks, the broker blaming low food price inflation and continuing margin pressure. Argyll Group lost 3 to 307p, Iceland 9 to 216p, Kwik Save 8 to 684p, Morrison Supermarkets 6 to 134p, J. Sainsbury 5 to 431p and Tesco 5 1/2 to 201 1/2 p. Strength in Great Universal Stores continued ahead of today's results, with hopes still high that it will announce plans to restructure its shares. The ordinary stock rose 138 to 3338p and the 'A' 12 to 1765p. Profit-taking in the Recs and bearish noises in the generators made for a weak electricity utility sector. One broker was said to have issued 'take profits' advice on National Power, down 9 at 349p, and PowerGen, 10 off at 371p. Among the Recs, Norweb declined 7 to 516p and East Midlands 9 to 465p. Negative comment on Welsh Water ahead of results due today sent the shares tumbling 7 to 553p. Tabloid wars continued with further falls in share prices, but analysts generally forecast that they will prove to be just skirmishes and will not have a lasting effect on earnings. Centre of attention was United Newspapers, caught in the middle of a rights issue and facing increasing speculation that The Sun's cut in price is not so much an attack on the relatively buoyant Daily Mirror but an attempt to knock the Daily Star out of business. It moved down 5 to 516p. Mirror Group Newspapers eased 3 to 148p, Daily Mail &amp; General Trust 'A' fell Pounds 2 1/2 to Pounds 96 1/2 and Telegraph dipped 5 to 388p. A mixture of profit-taking, some concern over BSkyB's expansion plans and resurgence of VAT fears were blamed for the tumble of 18 in Pearson shares to 442p. Volume was strong at 1.9m. Banking issues remained firm ahead of the interim reporting season. Barclays put on 4 at 485p, while Lloyds firmed 7 to 575p on suggestions that it would soon sell its stake in Standard Chartered. A Pounds 200m Eurosterling issue was well received by the market and Royal Bank of Scotland firmed 3 to 290p. Rumours that Hoare Govett had downgraded Reed International, denied by the broker, left the stock 12 down at 653p. Container transport group Tiphook tumbled 27 to 259p after stating that accounting changes had led to a loss of Pounds 21.8m, against profits of Pounds 74.6m last year. But the company lifted the dividend to 19.3p from 17.3p. The fall in copper prices saw international mining group RTZ slip 10 to 670p. A shortage of stock in Laird Group sent the shares 15 higher to 314p. SG Warburg and Kleinwort Benson were reported to be positive on British Steel, which rose 3 1/2 to 100p in volume of 10m. Profit-taking after its recent run brought British Aerospace down 7 to 420p. Good results from HP Bulmer showed profits of Pounds 19.6m, above analysts' expectations of Pounds 18.5m, and the stock rose 13 to 419p. The company said its profits growth was driven by rising sales in cider markets in the UK, Australia and Belgium. The UK cider market continued to expand, it added, with sales volume climbing 12.4 per cent last year.</p>

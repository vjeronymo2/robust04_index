			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pretoria March 22 SAPA -- Law and Order Minister  Hernus Kriel said on Tuesday [22 March] he took the strongest  possible exception to police public relations head Maj-Gen Leon  Mellet's remarks on the Goldstone Commission's third force  investigation.    Commenting on the report, Gen Mellet said State President  F.W. de Klerk had lost a lot of white support and was doing  something dramatic to gain black support. Gen Mellet said the  matter was unsettling, because it was being done unfairly. "I  am upset about the way it was made public."    Mr Kriel said on Tuesday Gen Mellet did not possess relevant  information on the matters he commented on. "The comments  attributed to him are completely inappropriate for a serving SAP  [South African Police] general and do not reflect my views or  those of the SA Police as an institution."</p>

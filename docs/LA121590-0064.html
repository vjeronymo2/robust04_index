			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH STUDIES RULING AGAINST RACIAL-BASED SCHOLARSHIPS;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: BLACK OFFICIAL HAD DECIDED THAT RESERVING FUNDS FOR MINORITIES  VIOLATES THE LAW. THE ISSUE IS CALLED 'AN OPEN SORE' FOR WHITE HOUSE.  </P> <P> A mid-level Education Department bureaucrat's ruling against college  scholarship funds reserved for minorities has plunged the Bush Administration  once more into confusion over the politically charged issue of race, splitting  the White House over how to respond.  </P> <P> "We're looking at it right now," President Bush said as he left Friday for a  weekend at his Camp David retreat. Indeed, the topic has been the subject of  intensive meetings at the White House since Wednesday's announcement that the  Education Department now believes that scholarship funds reserved for minority  students violate federal law.  </P> <P> "People in here regard it as a major problem," said one senior White House  aide. The issue has become "an open sore," the official said. "We've got to  deal with it."  </P> <P> More-conservative aides, however, have been urging Bush to go slow, suggesting  that the department's ruling, which officials unanimously insist caught Bush  and his top aides by surprise, merely follows the Administration's policy of  opposing preferences based on race.  </P> <P> White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray and other officials are expected to review  the issue over the weekend, and Administration aides said they expect Bush will  decide next week whether to get directly involved in the controversy.  </P> <P> At the same time, Bush will be trying to select a new head of the Education  Department to replace Lauro F. Cavazos, whom Bush forced out of office earlier  this week.  </P> <P> With students and schools across the country uncertain over how the new ruling  will affect them, the case underlines the volatility of racial issues at a time  when many Republican strategists are advising Bush to use opposition to  affirmative action as a leading issue in the 1992 campaign.  </P> <P> The scholarship controversy also illustrates another problem -- how easily an  Administration, even one as tightly centralized as Bush's, can be drawn into  political difficulty by any one of hundreds of otherwise anonymous officials  with authority over small parts of the far-spread federal establishment.  </P> <P> In his remarks Friday, Bush indicated that only earlier in the day had he  learned the background of the decision-maker in this case, Michael L. Williams,  the Education Department's assistant secretary for civil rights. And he  expressed apparent relief at his discovery that the 37-year-old conservative  University of Southern California law school graduate is black. "I don't think,  in this case, anybody could accuse" Williams of acting "on a racist basis.  That's one thing I'm very pleased about," Bush said.  </P> <P> That is about all anyone at the White House was pleased about in the situation,  however.  </P> <P> Williams apparently has been considering this issue for months, since the  Washington Legal Foundation, a conservative legal group here, filed a complaint  urging him to investigate racially exclusive scholarships. But, White House  aides insist, neither Williams nor anyone else informed Bush, Chief of Staff  John H. Sununu or other top White House staffers about the question. "Sununu  read about it in the news summary," one aide said.  </P> <P> Bush's aides are particularly sensitive about the question because they spent  much of the fall in a bitter fight over civil rights leading up to Bush's veto  of a bill to strengthen civil rights laws. And both Bush and his wife, Barbara,  have devoted considerable energy to raising scholarship funds for minority  students in the past, lending a personal immediacy to the controversy that  other domestic policy issues often lack for the President.  </P> <P> Education groups, for their part, are upset that the new policy was simply  announced in a press conference Wednesday with no written regulations or other  official policy that would help school officials know what they are now  supposed to do.  </P> <P> "What are we dealing with?" asked Sheldon Steinbach of the American Council on  Education, which has taken the lead in organizing a response from educational  institutions. "This is government by press release."  </P> <P> In fact, although the ruling has caused widespread concern on campuses  nationwide, Williams' announcement has no binding legal effect. To give his  opinion the force of law, the department would either have to propose  regulations or find a school with a race-based scholarship program and bring a  legal challenge against it. In either case, the process -- which presumably  would include the threat of withholding federal funds -- would take months.  </P> <P> In the meantime, Washington-based education organizations are advising their  members to sit tight and leave their current programs in place.  </P> <P> Additional confusion has been caused by the fact that no one either in the  government or among the education groups appears to know how many scholarships  might actually be affected by Williams' position.  </P> <P> "I don't have the foggiest idea," Steinbach said. Most scholarship funds across  the nation have no racial restrictions, he noted, but "almost every major  institution in the country has some" funds that were donated specifically to  benefit minorities. In addition, some institutions have funds specifically for  women, or men or people from a specific religious or ethnic group, all of which  might now be subject to challenge.  </P> <P> Until this week, Education Department officials routinely had approved such  scholarships. If a college had, for example, a dozen scholarships reserved for  minority-group members out of an overall sum that provided scholarships to 100  or more students, "that's not been a problem," said Washington attorney David  Tatel, the Education Department's civil rights chief during the Jimmy Carter  Administration. Under that sort of situation, "there's no discrimination.  Minorities and non-minorities can both get scholarships," Tatel said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] According to estimates by specialists, 52.2 percent  of the population will not be affected by the kilowatt-hour cost  increase, and the measure will also help to promote energy  conservation. A family unit that uses 150 kilowatts will pay 19  pesos more, since the first 100 kilowatts cost nine cents a  kilowatt, and the other 50 cost 50 cents a kilowatt. This new  fee will be implemented according to the meter's readout in  September, which will be payable in October. The Electric Union  has announced that this measure will yield revenues of over 405  million pesos annually or a monthly revenue average of 34  million pesos.    Today's GRANMA features an article by Oria de la Cruz on  page  two, which offers extensive information on this issue.</p>

			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSITION 13  </P> <P> In November, 1984, Ronald Reagan achieved a landslide electoral victory,  winning 49 of 50 states. He received 59.2% of the popular vote, to Walter  Mondale's 40.8%. This margin of victory was considered to provide a "mandate"  for a continuation and expansion of Reagan's policies.  </P> <P> In June, 1989, 62.3% of the voters of South Pasadena supported Proposition A, a  measure to impose a modest parcel tax for the support of the local schools.  However, this mandate was rejected because of an especially stringent clause of  Proposition 13 requiring a two-thirds majority for passage of any new tax. But,  the realities are, if Ronald Reagan couldn't get 60% of the vote in 1984, a  requirement for 66.7% is unrealistic.  </P> <P> Interestingly, Proposition 13 did not need a two-thirds majority for its  passage. One could debate the merits of many aspects of Proposition 13, but  certainly the two-thirds requirement is excessive, and must be replaced.  </P> <P> DENNIS A. DOUGHERTY  </P> <P> South Pasadena  </P></p>

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Redundancy appeal dismissed THE COURT of Appeal yesterday upheld a High Court ruling that North Tyneside Council was not entitled in 1990 to offer workers enhanced voluntary redundancy terms. The decision has implications for other local authorities which may have been considering generous packages as a way of avoiding compulsory redundancies and confrontation with unions. About 350 employees received sums which were, on average, three-and-a-half times higher than the sum the council was legally obliged to pay out. Leave to appeal to the House of Lords was refused.</p>

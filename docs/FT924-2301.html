			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Legalistic acrobatics rescue Denmark - Maastricht THE smile on Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen's face could easily have spanned the Firth of Forth. 'Denmark is satisfied,' the Danish foreign minister declared. After five months of hard bargaining, Mr Ellemann-Jensen was visibly relieved that EC leaders had agreed to meet Danish demands for legally binding opt-outs on the Maastricht treaty. The deal reached at the Edinburgh summit paves the way for the minority government in Denmark to submit a new text to voters in a second referendum on Maastricht in late April or early May - to be followed by ratification by the Community straggler, Britain. On Saturday, Mr Ellemann-Jensen predicted a 60 per cent vote in favour - a forecast which drew polite gasps in the light of his government's failure to predict the treaty's rejection in last June's referendum. His figure was backed up, however, by a Gallup opinion poll, on a sample of 700 people, showing 54 per cent in favour, compared with 23 per cent against and 23 per cent undecided. The survey was conducted yesterday before seven of the eight parties in the Folketing backed the Edinburgh deal. The final agreement is an exercise in legal and constitutional acrobatics which comes down to one crude political goal: how to keep Denmark inside the EC without watering down the Maastricht treaty to the point where its provisions are meaningless. The new text walks a fine line in its effort to meet Denmark's requests for legally binding exemptions without re-opening the treaty or producing a text requiring re-ratification by member states. Denmark strengthens its previously won right to avoid signing up to the third stage of European monetary union and a single currency, the core goal of the Maastricht treaty. The leaders note that nothing in Maastricht commits Denmark to become a member of the West European Union. 'Accordingly, Denmark does not participate in the elaboration and the implementation of the Union which have defence implications.' Denmark has won legally binding exemptions from measures on EC citizenship and EC co-operation on justice and home affairs matters. The drafting involves a 'decision' by heads of government which has the force of international law with a unilateral Danish political 'declaration' which restates its opposition to join in citizenship of the 'European Union' envisaged under Maastricht. In return, Denmark has agreed not to exploit its opt-outs to prevent the other EC members from pressing ahead with the objectives of Maastricht. Similarly, in an effort to limit the political damage, member states have declared that the opt-outs are only in response to the failure of the treaty in the first referendum. These exemptions are 'fully compatible' with the treaty. Few EC leaders in Edinburgh were prepared to argue the legal niceties of the Danish deal, though Mr Major admitted on Saturday that it could not be tested in the European Court of Justice. The agreement was welcomed by business leaders in Denmark and greeted by newspaper headlines in Copenhagen such as 'Triumph for Denmark' and 'Europe Gave Way'.</p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Hospital delays are attacked THE GOVERNMENT came under fierce attack in the Commons yesterday for failing to live up to its past commitments regarding hospital waiting lists. Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour's deputy leader, seized on provisional figures showing a 25 per cent April increase in those waiting more than two years for treatment to accuse the government of failing to keep a promise made 'purely for electoral purposes'. Figures released by the health department showed that the number of people waiting for hospital operations rose from 1,600 in March to 1,999 at the end of April. The patients' charter guaranteed that after April 1 nobody would wait longer than two years, Mr Hattersley said. 'Did the government ever really mean it, or was that just pre-election propaganda?' He asked: 'What do you say to those citizens who . . now find they have had to wait for more than two years because the government failed to keep its promise that it made purely for electoral purposes?' Mr Newton pointed to the 'huge improvement' that had been delivered in the months leading up to April. 'To regard a reduction in the number of patients waiting over two years from over 50,000 to less than 2,000 in a year is hardly a failure of ambition.' The former social security secretary admitted, however, that the 'small increase' in queues registered during April was 'obviously a disappointment' and promised the situation was being addressed.</p>

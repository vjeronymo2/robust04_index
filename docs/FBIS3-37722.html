Communications personnel, who are owed 80 billion rubles  [R] by television for last year, cut off transmission in many  regions of the country. For a whole day fans of Santa Barbara  [soap opera] scoured the news agency reports with bated breath  for news of the development of the conflict.    In the evening many breathed a sigh of relief: It was  reported that Premier Chernomyrdin had ordered that television's  debts to the Ministry of Communications be paid. True, this is  to be in stages. It is not difficult to guess that with each  stage, given today's inflation, the sum will "diminish," which,  understandably, will not induce enthusiasm among the  communications workers.    Nor should it be forgotten that this year's debts will  quickly augment last year's. At a press conference on Monday  the leaders of the television companies reported that for 1994  they had been allocated only 18 percent of the sum required. It  is not difficult to guess that six weeks from now, at the end of  the first quarter, the communications personnel will again have  grounds for raising the question of switching off our television  sets.    It is perfectly clear therefore that the problem needs a  fundamental solution. Today it would seem the heavyweights of  this world have grasped this simple truth. The premier spoke of  the need to abandon a number of state television channels on the  very evening of the day when the crisis in relations between  television and the Ministry of Communications was resolved. But  quite a few difficulties are concealed behind the outward  simplicity.    Sometimes naive people regard denationalization as a magic  wand which will immediately enable all questions to be removed.  In this latest conflict, for example, the myth has arisen  thanks to someone that the communications workers are owed money  only by state companies, the private ones having emerged with  spotless year-end results. Indeed they don't have any debts.  But why? The point is that TV-6 enjoys a special satellite  communications link, while NTV only started operating quite  recently and so has not had time to get into debt.    The Ministry of Communications' complaints about poverty,  which is prompting the strikes, is yet another myth. It is, of  course, a thankless task to count the money in someone else's  pocket, but, according to certain sources, the monopolists'  earnings in this sphere are considerably above the average for  other sectors of the economy.    Finally, there is a third myth, to wit, the opinion that  television and "Ostankino," in particular, is, through  advertising, raking in millions in foreign currency and billions  in rubles, and that it shares it with no one. Indeed, a lot has  been written recently about abuses perpetrated by certain smart  operators in television. However, something else must also be  said: "Ostankino" not only pays taxes to the state but also  "releases" quite a considerable amount of the large sum of money  it has to the Television Center, which owns all the television  company's property and equipment .    In the opinion of A. Pimanov, deputy director of  "Ostankino's" "Publitsist" Studio, neither share-flotation nor  even the introduction of subscription payments for the use of  televison receivers is capable of rescuing Europe's largest  television company from financial failure. A whole set of  different measures is required here. It is essential to have a  separate bank and to put to work the money obtained from the  state. The progress of every ruble should be tracked and the  maximum return on it secured. Channels through which money is  lost to television production must be plugged.    But that is not enough, according to Pimanov. It is time to  stop shifting money from one pocket to another with considerable  losses en route. The practice which formerly prevailed at  "Ostankino" and which is the rule throughout the world should be  restored. After all nowhere, and that includes in the second  largest Russian television company, is the creative side  separated from the technical. The long-drawn-out question of  the autonomousness of the Television Center, which has been  artificially isolated from the single television organism, must  finally be resolved. Incidentally, the Television Center  recently, without any warning whatsoever, announced a  retroactive increase, effective as of last December, in all  prices for the services offered to "Ostankino." And these were  up to fourfold increases!    It is clear here that the television company will never be  able to extricate itself from the trammels of unpaid debts. It  will not be saved by crumbs from the government budget table,  shareholders' investments, or even a subscription payment by  millions of ordinary viewers.</p>

			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Michael Prowse on America: The David Owen of US politics In a cheeky editorial, The Economist recently drew a parallel between Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, and Mr Neil Kinnock, the former opposition leader in the UK. Mr Kinnock led a new-look Labour party to resounding defeat in the British general election despite having enjoyed a consistent lead in the opinion polls. The Economist suggested the same fate might await Mr Clinton and his exuberant Democratic supporters. Scepticism about Mr Clinton's chances is advisable, despite his warm welcome in America's farm belt last week. President George Bush, a gritty fighter, is beginning to make combative speeches and will be lifted next week by the Republican party convention in Houston. The analogy between the US Democrats and Labour, however, seems rather far-fetched. A better way to understand the choice facing Americans would be to imagine that the Conservatives had not dumped Margaret Thatcher and that the opposition parties had united under an articulate, personable leader such as Lord (formerly Dr David) Owen. Britain, as in the US today, would then have faced a choice between an old, tired leader who could not escape responsibility for economic and social ills and a younger, more caring opponent whose commitment to market principles was not in doubt. If you think Dr Owen, at the helm of a merged Labour and Liberal Democratic party, could have won that contest, you should take Mr Clinton seriously. The Republicans will try to discredit Mr Clinton by depicting him as an old-fashioned 'liberal' (that is, left-wing) Democrat. Yet everybody knows he has been badgering his party to adopt more conservative policies for years. Broadly speaking, he favours the Germanic 'social market' policies that Dr Owen and friends espoused in Britain in the early 1980s. (Mr Clinton even cites Germany in speeches on topics such as education and training.) His remarkable climb in the highly unreliable opinion polls is fuelled by pessimism about the economy. The marginal decline in unemployment last month will do little or nothing to restore faith in Mr Bush's economic stewardship, which some regard as the worst since Herbert Hoover's disastrous pre-war presidency. Mr Clinton also profits from Mr Bush's legendary difficulties with the English language. A master of rhetoric such as Gladstone was able to make a virtue out of social inaction; when Mr Bush tries to explain his urban or welfare policies, his contorted syntax merely prompts speculation that he suffers from aphasia. At the Democratic convention in New York, Mr Clinton appeared to achieve a breakthrough on several levels. Like former president Ronald Reagan, he successfully projected himself as a product of small- town America. By talking not of his education at Yale and Oxford but rather of his grandfather's shop in Hope, Arkansas, his widowed mother and his upbringing in a home without an indoor toilet, he has made plausible his claim to understand the hopes and aspirations of the 'forgotten' mass of middle and working class families. By contrast, Mr Bush, a product of New England prep schools, remains aloof and out of touch. Equally important, Mr Clinton's has begun the task of articulating an economic and social philosophy that seems both broader and more relevant to America's modern needs than Mr Bush's. Mr Clinton has no quarrel with free enterprise, market forces or low taxes. Along with European social democrats, he merely believes these good things should be part of a more ambitious compact between government and the people. The first item in his proposed 'New Covenant' is improved incentives for enterprise. But he then moves on to tackle problems largely unaddressed in the past 12 years. Why, he asks, is America the only advanced nation without universally guaranteed health care? Why does the US provide virtually no skills training for non-college bound youngsters? Why has it allowed urban problems to fester to the point where cities such as Los Angeles explode in anger? In his stump speeches, Mr Clinton outlines his solutions and ends with a simple plea: give us a chance to show we can do better than the Republicans. Mr Bush's challenge is to convince Americans not to give Mr Clinton that chance. In the unlikely event that Mr Bush sticks to his promise to fight the election on policy rather than character issues, he faces a tricky task. His own record is poor while Mr Clinton's social market philosophy has an innate appeal. At root Mr Clinton's argument is that other countries are gaining ground on the US because they are investing more effectively in their people. His emphasis on long-term structural reforms to raise the quality of America's workforce - its 'human capital' - represents a new and exciting departure for the US where economic debate has usually had a shorter-term focus. The right message for the times, sadly, is no guarantee of victory - as British social democrats can confirm. A united Democratic party led by Mr Clinton ought to have a better chance of unseating Mr Bush than Britain's disunited opposition had of toppling Mr John Major. However, with Mr Bush's offensive yet to begin, the Clinton lead could still evaporate like morning mist.</p>

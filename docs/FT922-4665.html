			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / German currency boosted by disarray in markets FINANCIAL MARKETS across Europe were thrown into disarray yesterday after Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty. The D-Mark was virtually the only beneficiary of the turmoil as the German currency reasserted its role as the anchor of the European Monetary System. European government bond markets suffered especially big losses as investors reasoned that prospects for convergence for inflation and interest rates across Europe had been diminished. As dealers sold other European currencies for the D-Mark, the German currency rose sharply benefiting from the Bundesbank's reputation for keeping down inflation. Sterling, the French franc and the Italian lira suffered the worst losses. In government bond markets, high-yielding securities such as stock issued by the Italian and Spanish governments were among the hardest hit. Ecu bonds fell by 1.5 points, while UK gilt-edged securities finished 1 point lower. Sterling lost two pfennings in London to close at DM2.9150. It moved below the lira to finish second from the bottom of the European Monetary System grid, above the Danish krone. The Bank of Portugal was forced to intervene in the markets after it appeared that the Danish currency, the weakest currency in the EMS, might fall below its permitted lower limit. The bank sold escudos, the strongest currency in the system, for D-Marks in a technical manoeuvre to ease strains within the grid. This was the first such intervention by an EMS central bank in four months. The Danish authorities raised money market rates by 0.65 points to slow the krone's descent. Denmark's currency closed at around DKr3.8650 against the D-Mark, after trading at around DKr3.840 on Tuesday. In New York, trading on currency markets was subdued as traders and investors struggled with the implications of the Danish vote. The D-Mark remained the currency of choice. Consequently, the dollar fell slightly to DM1.6035 but appreciated against the other European currencies. European stock markets fell after France announced it was to call its own referendum on the treaty. The Paris bourse was hit hard, with shares falling 1.6 per cent on the day. In London, the FT-SE 100 index dropped 25.0 to close at 2,680.9. Lex, Page 26 Bonds, Page 35 Currencies, Page 41 World stocks, Page 47 London stocks, Page 50</p>

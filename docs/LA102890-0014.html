			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHALLENGES TO PORTRAYALS AND CASTING  </P> <P> In his film "Avalon," director Barry Levinson casts four non-Jews in the major  roles.  </P> <P> And although there is a subliminal Jewish star at a cemetery, the word Jew is  not used once in the movie.  </P> <P> Where were the Jewish actors? Martin Scorsese unabashedly casts Italians as  Italians in "GoodFellas." He loves his paisani so well he casts them in all the  roles. He's not worried what others might think.  </P> <P> I don't know why Levinson chose this path. It awakens in me all those ancient  fears that if the Gentiles know who the Jews really are they will drive us out  of this country.  </P> <P> LEV MAILER, Studio City  </P></p>

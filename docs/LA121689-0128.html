			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN, UNITED WIN LAWSUIT OVER RESERVATION SYSTEMS  </P> <P> A U.S. District Court jury in Los Angeles ruled Friday that American Airlines  and United Airlines had not unfairly exercised monopoly power in the use of  their computerized reservation systems.  </P> <P> After 10 days of deliberations and a lengthy trial, the jury voted 10-2 not to  hold the two giant carriers liable.  </P> <P> About 85% of all airline bookings in the United States are made by computerized  reservations systems, and several airlines asserted in a suit filed in 1984  that American and United gained dominant positions in the market after the  computerized systems became technologically feasible in 1976.  </P> <P> The plaintiff airlines alleged that American and United, whose systems account  for about 75% of the nation's computerized ticketing revenue, illegally abused  their domination of the market by charging exorbitant fees and by imposing  restrictions on travel agents who use their booking systems, making it  difficult or impossible for agents to switch to rival systems.  </P> <P> Of the original plaintiffs, USAir and Republic settled out of court, but four  other airlines -- Northwest, Muse (which has since been merged into Southwest  Airlines), Alaska and Midway, went to trial, seeking $149 million in damages.  </P> <P> American and United contended that their fees and contract requirements were  fair compensation for the millions of dollars they have invested in the  intricate nationwide databases that search through thousands of airline flights  and print out an airline ticket instantly in any travel agent's office.  American officials have said they have more than $400 million invested in their  Sabre system.  </P> <P> The jury's verdict "is a victory for the free enterprise system," said Robert  E. Cooper, of the Los Angeles law firm Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, who  represented American. "Our clients developed something that others didn't. We  were first, and we were successful. What we had here was a case of sour  grapes."  </P> <P> American Chairman Robert L. Crandall said, "After five years of this litigation  ordeal, including depositions of almost 300 individuals and production of  hundreds of thousands of documents, American obviously feels vindicated and  gratified by the jury's decision."  </P> <P> Edward Hoenicke, United's general counsel, said his company also felt that its  position on the pricing and fairness of its Apollo reservation system had been  vindicated.  </P> <P> The chief lawyer for the plaintiffs said he was disturbed by the verdict and  indicated that his clients would appeal. "We're predictably disappointed,  particularly after the jury was out 10 days," said Maxwell M. Blecher, of Los  Angeles' Blecher &amp; Collins, who represented the plaintiffs.  </P> <P> Blecher said it was "likely" that his clients would appeal the jury verdict.  </P></p>

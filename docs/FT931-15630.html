			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Business and the Law: Revolution sweeps fees - The recession has given the client the whip hand in terms of designing flexible charges In September last year Mr Philip Lacovara, general counsel of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co in the US, sent this message to 85 law firms regularly used by his company: 'We no longer want to assume that the typical matter will be handled and billed on a time-based arrangement. Instead, the basis for legal billing on new matters will be shifted from hours-based fees to more flexible and varied 'value-based' engagements. 'Therefore outside counsel (law firms) will be expected to consider agreeing to use various alternative billing methods such as fixed fees, fixed fees plus a contingency, reduced hourly rates plus a contingency, blended hourly rates, volume discounts and multi-stage billing.' Morgan Stanley is not alone. Several American businesses are now sending engagement letters or instructions to their lawyers, setting out what they are and are not prepared to pay for. Citicorp recently sent a 15-page letter to more than 100 firms which the firms must sign if they expect work. The Aetna Casualty and Surety Co of Hartford, Connecticut, now provides all its outside counsel with a guide to alternative billing methods and requires them to propose discounted hourly rates or alternative charging when pitching for a piece of work. British companies worried that they may be paying too much for legal services should take heart. The recession has changed the market place. Companies can now exert a greater influence on the legal services which they purchase and on what those services cost. The shift from a supply and asset driven environment to a demand-led one means that the value of legal services is increasingly determined by the client and not, as formerly, by a law firm's hourly charging rates multiplied by time spent. Most law firms accept the need to be flexible. Mr John Grieves, senior partner of City of London solicitors Freshfields, concedes that the market place has changed and that fees and methods of charging have become a significant topic of discussion with clients during the last 18 months. In the 1980s, the priority for clients and law firms alike was to complete the transaction as quickly as possible. Human resources were at a premium: get the people in and get the job done was the message; the cost was secondary. Now, he says, costs are a priority: 'Clients want value for money. We have to tailor our services to clients' needs.' The new approach to fees sometimes called 'value billing' equates the amount a law firm can charge for its services to the value placed on a particular piece of work by the client. High volume, low value work which any number of firms can do will be very price sensitive. The client is able to drive a hard bargain. At the other end of the scale, work which is unique and of the highest value to the client will be price insensitive as only a handful of lawyers may be capable. Here the law firm has the upper hand and may charge premium rates. Value billing as a concept has been around for years, but a by-product of the search for better value for money, and of the recession, has been the development during the last two years of alternative methods of determining fees. Law firms recognise that, to give value, they have to respond to requests by clients to determine a method of charging which is not so heavily reliant on the hourly rates charged by individual lawyers working on a job and the number of hours they spend on it. Clients expect law firms to take some of the risk of ensuring services are provided most efficiently. Alternative billing, or charging, is all about who bears this risk. The alternatives are in theory infinitely variable, limited only by the willingness of the law firm to experiment. There are, however, several commonly used alternative methods of billing which businesses may wish to explore. Fixed fees. A fixed fee for a job negotiated in advance. If the law firm can staff a job more efficiently and reduce the time spent on the work to a minimum, it will make a profit on the job. If it cannot, it will lose money. The cost of inefficiency falls on the law firm, not on the client. Fee caps. Setting the maximum a client will pay for a job, expressed as a maximum fixed fee or as a maximum number of hours that the client is prepared to pay for. Result-based bonuses or success fees. These are related to whether the firm achieves the outcome sought by the client or brings the job in below a budgeted maximum. A firm agrees to a reduced fixed fee for the work or to reduced hourly rates with an uplift or bonus for a successful outcome. The lawyer and the client must determine what constitutes a successful outcome. Bonuses can take several forms: a percentage of the fees or damages saved, or of the profits from a successful transaction. These types of result-based fee arrangements are sometimes called contingent fees. They vary from the 'no win, no pay' contingent fee arrangements used in litigation, in that the law firm always receives some form of basic payment for the work whatever the outcome. Such contingent fee arrangements for non-contentious work are not outlawed in the UK. Budgeted fees or multi-stage fees. An overall budget is set for the job or different budgets are set for stages of a job. Multi-stage fee arrangements are generally related to transactional matters. Clients may agree that the first stage of the transaction will be paid at a reduced hourly rate, which will rise by an agreed percentage every time a trigger point or a different stage of the transaction is reached. Several alternative billing methods are still tied to the amount of time spent on a job by the law firm and are really variations on the standard practice of hourly billing. The most common form of alternative rate billing is the blended rate: a uniform hourly rate for all the lawyers working on the job, irrespective of their level of seniority or experience. The blended rate will be agreed between the law firm and the client before work starts and is generally lower than the average hourly rate charged by partners and above the rate charged by trainees or newly qualified lawyers. For the top City law firms, an average blended rate might be somewhere in the region of Pounds 150-Pounds 160 an hour. Discount billing calculates legal fees using reduced hourly rates for lawyers working on a project. Firms may also agree to charge standard hourly rates but offer a percentage discount on the final bill. Some firms may also offer volume discounts where they will agree to work at reduced hourly rates or to reduce the overall bill in return for a guaranteed volume of work. Premium billing is closely associated with bonuses and success fees. If the project is successful, the firm will charge fees higher than its standard hourly rates. If the transaction falls through, the firm charges reduced rates. Premium rates are often calculated as a percentage of standard rates. Companies are likely to find that their lawyers are prepared to discuss most forms of alternative charging arrangements. If they are not, the client has the option of taking his custom elsewhere. The recession has given businesses the whip hand in the fees debate.</p>

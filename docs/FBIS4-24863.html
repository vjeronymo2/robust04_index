			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 2 (XINHUA) -- South Korean President  Kim Yong-sam said here on Thursday [2 June] that South Korea and  Russia could be "trusted partners."    Addressing the Federation Council (the upper house of the  Russian parliament), the South Korean leader also stressed that  "It will be impossible to preserve peace in northeast Asia  without Russian cooperation."    Kim Yong-sam arrived in Moscow on Wednesday afternoon for a  four-day official visit to Russia. On Thursday morning, he  signed a joint Russian-South Korean declaration together with  his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin during their summit talks.    He told Russian lawmakers that through an "extensive  dialogue" with Yeltsin this morning he was convinced that South  Korea and Russia could be "trusted partners in quest of greater  shared prosperity well into the 21th century."    The South Korean leader said both the two states should  cooperate to ensure the success of the reform policies now being  pursued in both lands.    He expressed the hope that his current visit will boost  Russian-South Korean cooperation that "will make us even better  neighbors."    The countries' two-way trade jumped from only 900 million  U.S. dollars in 1990 to 1.6 billion last year, Kim Yong-sam  said, adding that South Korean businesses have invested 24  million U.S. dollars in 25 development projects in Russia, and  as of March 1994, 29 major South Korean companies had  established branch offices in the country.    Kim Yong-sam appealed to the Russian lawmakers to actively  cooperate in seeking an early solution to the nuclear problem on  the Korean peninsula.</p>

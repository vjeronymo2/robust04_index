			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC SPECIAL;  </P> <P> WAS TELLS IT LIKE IT IS -- IN THE STUDIO  </P> <P> Don Was isn't the most sought-after producer in the business because he gives  artists that patented Was (Not Was) sound. In fact, each of the records he's  worked on sounds distinct.  </P> <P> "It seems kind of disrespectful when you start getting to artists like Bonnie  Raitt or Bob Dylan or Elton John -- it's a lot of nerve to say 'Lemme stamp my  fingerprint on your forehead.' If I have instincts as an artist, I have an  outlet for it, and it's not to dump it all over Bob Dylan's record."  </P> <P> Between sessions in a Hollywood studio with the re-formed Knack, which is led  by his old Detroit buddy Doug Feiger, Was discussed some of his production  experiences past and present.  </P> <P> Bonnie Raitt (Was produced her "Nick of Time" album and is set to do her next  one):  </P> <P> "Bonnie's record is the kind that every musician admires, because she  represents the course a lot of them wish they had taken. She's really stuck to  her guns, and when she made a very strong statement with probably her rootsiest  album in a long time, she achieved her biggest success. And I think every  artist's dream is to be successful with what's closest to their hearts."  </P> <P> The B-52's (he produced half of their comeback "Cosmic Thing" album, including  the single "Love Shack"):  </P> <P> " 'Love Shack' wasn't even supposed to be one of the songs. The recording (of  the other tracks) went so quickly that they said, 'Well, we have this thing  that's not really done but it's a pretty cool groove.' When I first heard it,  it was an 11-minute shopping list of lyrics, basically -- nothing repeated, no  chorus, just an anthology of wild lines. It was like a puzzle. So we rearranged  it in an afternoon, gave it structure and cut it. No one thought anything would  come of it."  </P> <P> Iggy Pop (the new "Brick by Brick" album):  </P> <P> "He was a very intelligent, very funny guy. But most of the stories you've  heard about him are true. He's pushed the rock 'n' roll lifestyle as far as you  can go and not only lived -- which most people don't do -- but he's writing  about it in a really articulate fashion."  </P> <P> Elton John (four new tracks for a forthcoming retrospective):  </P> <P> "I knew he was good -- anyone listening to those records can tell that they're  well-crafted -- but until I really sat in a room with him and heard him sing  and play the piano alone, (I didn't know) the guy's a genius. I mean, people  really don't know, maybe because the glitzier aspects of his persona overshadow  his musical talent. But he's one of the most talented people I ever met in my  life. He's a very nice person, a very humble, unaffected man, and a soulful  musician. I hope that doesn't get lost in what he does. People should take him  very, very seriously."  </P> <P> Bob Dylan (the current "Under a Red Sky," whose production with partner David  Was has stirred debate over its level of looseness):  </P> <P> "It was clear that there wasn't gonna be a lot of pre-production on this  record, which is OK. I doubt Howlin' Wolf did a lot of pre-production either,  and he made some pretty cool records. With Dylan, the feeling and vibe of the  overall thing are as important as anything. . . .  </P> <P> "I don't even know if he was aware of this, but the fact of the matter is that  I learned about music from Bob Dylan. I didn't know who Robert Johnson or  Howlin' Wolf were, I didn't know Woody Guthrie, I didn't know rockabilly stuff.  . . . Dylan was the guy who brought all these disparate kinds of music together  for people in the '60s.  </P> <P> "These guys are like tractor-trailers, pulling this heavy wagon of legend. But  really we attach it in our minds to these people. And when I saw Bob Dylan, the  spokesman for a generation didn't walk into the room, just a really talented  artist.  </P> <P> "I respected him, but it didn't incapacitate me. It's what you work a whole  lifetime for, to be able to be in the presence of these people and collaborate  with them. That's the real reward, getting to mix with the best. Sometimes I  feel like (Woody Allen's) Zelig. It's fantastic. It's all I ever wanted out of  life."  </P> <P> Paula Abdul (Was begins work on the dance diva's second album soon):  </P> <P> "She wants to expand what she's doing, which is a really intriguing prospect.  When I first met with her about working on her next album, I said, 'I can't do  this stuff any better than you're already doing it. I would be imitating your  records.' She said, 'I don't want to go back and make that record again. Let's  do something else.' Actually, she gave me the same answer Bob Dylan did." CHRIS  WILLMAN  </P></p>

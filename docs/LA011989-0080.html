			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: TEMPLE CITY;  </P> <P> COUNCIL OKS IMPACT REPORT  </P> <P> A final environmental impact report on commercial development at Las Tunas  Drive and Rosemead Boulevard was unanimously approved for certification last  week by the City Council acting as the Community Redevelopment Agency.  </P> <P> Critics of the proposal to build a shopping center at the northwest corner of  the intersection have said the document is incomplete because it lacks  specifics, such as the types of businesses that will occupy the proposed  center.  </P> <P> If fully implemented, the complex will include 125,000 square feet of retail  space, and yield an estimated $230,000 in sales tax annually, according to  Parrington.  </P> <P> "The tax increment is a significant economic factor that warrants the  certification of the EIR," said City Manager Karl Koski. He said the added  sales tax would make up 5% of city funds.  </P> <P> The redevelopment project area was designated in 1972 to increase sales taxes  in the city, which collects no property tax, he said.  </P> <P> Sherry Passmore told the agency that a financial study should be prepared to  determine how soon the city would get out of debt after implementing the  project.  </P> <P> The city is still making bond payments for the 1974 redevelopment of the K-mart  shopping center on the southwest corner of the same intersection. The community  development director, Robert Dawson, said those payments would end in 1999.  </P> <P> The city has been discussing the new proposal with Long Beach-based Champion  Development since May. The development agreement detailing financing and  describing the major tenants of the shopping complex will be discussed at a  regular City Council meeting Feb. 7.  </P></p>

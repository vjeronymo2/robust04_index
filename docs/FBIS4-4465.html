"I say that  the Indonesian Government will not resort to shock therapy, nor  will we adopt a TMP (/tight money policy/) again," Saleh Afiff,  coordinating minister for economy, finance, and development  supervision, said after receiving World Bank President Lewis  Preston at his office on Monday (21 March).    According to Afiff, such measures would not be conducive to  macroeconomic development and would tend to ignore the  principles of caution. Thus, the government prefers safer  measures to maintain strong economic stability.    He admitted the current economic situation is difficult.  "Our economy has been facing many challenges since early this  year," Minister Saleh Afiff said.    According to Afiff, unpredictably fluctuating oil prices and  their downward trend are one of the challenges. Prices are  expected to drop even further to $13 per barrel. The benchmark  prices are set at $16 per barrel.    Inflation in the first two months of 1994 was quite high at  3.01 percent. This means the government must keep inflation  below 7 percent in the remaining 10 months.    In addition, non-oil and non-gas exports -- especially  textiles and textile products -- have experienced slower growth.  The export of textiles and textile products grew by 2.8 percent  between January and November 1993, representing 21.89 percent of  total non-oil and non-gas exports. The figures were in fact  higher than the previous year, but it is feared that this  position may affect state revenues.    Afiff further said that the growing appreciation of the yen  against the dollar is the most serious situation. "The  appreciation may increase our /debt stock/," Afiff said.    He said that Indonesia's debt stock may increase by $3  billion if there is a 15 percent appreciation. Thus,  Indonesia's current debt stock of $87 billion would swell to $90  billion if there is an appreciation of that proportion. This  will, of course, be an extremely heavy burden because 40 percent  of Indonesia's total foreign debts are in yen.    This situation reminds us of the importance of maintaining  self- reliance in development. We must reduce the role of  foreign loans as much as possible, although the government has  been able to manage the foreign loans.    Loans received by the government -- 60 percent of total  foreign loans -- are divided into three categories. 1) Soft  loans repayable in 25 years with annual interest of 3 percent.  These loans are arranged through the CGI [Consultative Group  for Indonesia]. 2) Loans in the form of export credits  repayable in 20 years with annual interest of 7 percent. 3)  Commercial loans repayable in at least five years at market  interest.    "The government has been able to manage the three kinds of  loans. It is rather difficult, however, to manage foreign loans  obtained by the private sector," Afiff said.    The private sector is currently expected to play a major  role  in development. As such, the government does not prohibit the  private sector from seeking foreign funds. The government  merely asks that they refrain from seeking excessive loans.    Regardless of the current situation, the World Bank has  praised Indonesia's economic policy, especially the one taken in  1993. World Bank President Lewis Preston praised strategic  measures such as the various deregulation packages, which he  said had relaxed the TMP and overcome other obstacles. In  addition, inflation has been kept below 10 percent.</p>

			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPUBLIC OF YEMEN  </P> <P> THE LAND -- Yemen spans 203,645 square miles on the southwestern edge of the  Arabian Peninsula and has borders with Saudi Arabia and Oman. The country  controls the Bab al Mandab strait, strategic gateway to the Red Sea.  </P> <P> THE PEOPLE -- Yemen has 11 million people. They are mainly tribal, and the main  religion is Sunni Islam.  </P> <P> THE ECONOMY -- Yemen is among the poorest nations in the world, but newly  discovered oil reserves could change that. Unofficial estimates say the  reserves could amount to as much as 2 billion barrels.  </P> <P> Money from millions of Yemenis working outside their country, mainly in the  oil-rich Persian Gulf, and from foreign aid helped prop up the economy of the  pro-Western north for years. Farming is the main activity and crops include  wheat, sorghum, coffee, tobacco and cotton.  </P> <P> HISTORY -- By merging, the north and south regained their former status as part  of ancient Arabia and the kingdom of Sheba that lasted for 800 years until the  2nd Century BC.  </P> <P> For the next 800 years it was ruled by the Himyarites, one of the earliest Arab  tribes, then by Ethiopians and Persians until Islam arrived in the 7th Century.  </P> <P> In 1517 South Yemen became part of the Ottoman Empire. Britain seized Aden in  1839, and the surrounding territory later became a British protectorate.  </P> <P> Aden won independence in 1967 after a terrorist campaign, and South Yemen  became the Arab world's only Marxist state.  </P> <P> The northern country was established in 1962 after an Egyptian-backed  revolution ousted the Saudi Arabian-backed imam.  </P></p>

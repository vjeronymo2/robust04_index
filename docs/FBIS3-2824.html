			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Li Nanling (2621 0589 3781) and Zhang Yijun </F> (1728 4135 0193)]    [Text] Beijing, 13 Mar (XINHUA) -- Speaking at a plenary  session of the Guangdong delegation today, Zhou Nan, director of  XINHUA Hong Kong Branch, said: Having all along abided by all  the international agreements it has signed, the Chinese  Government will resolutely and earnestly enforce the Hong Kong  Special Administrative Region [HKSAR] Basic Law; pursue the  principles of "one country, two systems" and "Hong Kong people  ruling Hong Kong"; and safeguard Hong Kong's long-term  prosperity and stability.    Zhou Nan pointed out in his speech: The current dispute over  issues on Hong Kong's consitutional system [zheng zhi 2398 0455]  is not one on whether or not we want democracy, but on whether  or not we should act in good faith. In a more profound sense,  it boils down to a dispute over Hong Kong's sovereignty. In the  final analysis, the British side's scheme is that, by using its  administrative powers over Hong Kong in the remaining few years  and the pretext of so-called "accelerating the democratic  process," it will attempt to impose the leading group it forms  onto the SAR government in an effort to continually manipulate  Hong Kong's political affairs after 1997. The British side has  even vainly attempted to transform Hong Kong into an independent  or semi- independent political entity. However, it has  forgotten the Chinese people will never give in to any foreign  pressure on a matter of important principle concerning national  sovereignty.    Zhou Nan noted: The Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] of the  HKSAR Preparatory Committee has been performing substantive  work. In the future, PWC membership will be further expanded.  We have appointed two batches of advisers on Hong Kong affairs  and one batch of advisers on regional affairs. We will appoint  more representatives from the Hong Kong region to be advisers on  Hong Kong and regional affairs to hear more views and  suggestions from the broad masses of Hong Kong compatriots; and  to lay a broad and firm foundation for realizing the principles  of "one country, two systems," and "Hong Kong people ruling Hong  Kong."    Zhou Nan also said: The broad masses of Hong Kong government  functionaries have made important contributions to Hong Kong's  prosperity and stability for many years. We welcome them to  continue to be devoted to their duties after 1997 and to make  fresh contributions to Hong Kong's future development. We also  pay very close attention to issues concerning Hong Kong people's  livelihood, and will try our utmost to prevent the British side  from passing heavy financial burdens on to the future SAR  government and broad masses of Hong Kong residents.    Zhou Nan also briefed participants about the "mutually  benefitting and common prosperity-enhancing" relations between  Hong Kong and the mainland in the fields of trade, investments,  and finance in the past year. According to statistics, the  value of bilateral entrepot trade between Hong Kong and the  mainland accounted for nearly 90 percent of Hong Kong's total  entrepot trade value. The mainland has become the largest  market for Hong Kong's export products. In 1993, Hong Kong  businessmen actually made use of $13 billion of their direct  investments in the mainland, topping any other outside investors  in China. As of the end of 1993, the number of red-chip stocks  of Chinese companies [zhong zi hong chou gu 0022 6327 4767 4693  5140] listed on the Hong Kong stock market was 37, previously  the number was zero. Their market value accounted for about 10  percent of Hong Kong's total stock market value.    Zhou Nan said: These facts fully show that the economies of  Hong Kong and the mainland have integrated into a single entity,  and the "China factor" is gradually having a greater and greater  impact on Hong Kong's economic development. Strengthening  cooperation with the mainland in various fields is an important  condition for sustaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.  Most Hong Kong people have reached a common understanding that  Hong Kong wants to closely cooperate with the mainland and  opposes the initiation of confrontation.</p>

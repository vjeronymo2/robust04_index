			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 24-HOUR NAUTILUS HEALTH SPA CLOSES; D.A. INVESTIGATES PATRONS' COMPLAINTS  </P> <P> The 24-Hour Nautilus health spa has closed permanently because of financial  problems, according to its owner.  </P> <P> John Robert Prell, 34, first closed the facility March 12. He was arrested two  days later after Downey police received several complaints from patrons who  said they were concerned that Prell was allegedly accepting memberships without  notifying the buyers that the business would soon close. Prell, a Downey  resident, was released the same day on $25,000 bail. He later reopened the spa  in the Stonewood Shopping Center before closing it last Friday.  </P> <P> The district attorney's office is continuing its investigation. A bail hearing  has been set for May 3, according to a Downey Municipal Court clerk.  </P> <P> Officials of the Imperial Health Spa in Downey and the Sporting Club in Anaheim  said they will accept the contracts of 24-Hour Nautilus members. Michael  Avellino, Sporting Club manager, said his facility will honor transfers until  April 15.  </P> <P> Prell said that members who joined the 24-Hour Nautilus after Feb. 14 could  apply for a refund.  </P></p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / VW cuts dividend to DM2 and shakes up management VOLKSWAGEN, Germany's stricken motor industry group, yesterday slashed its dividend and shook out its management board in the wake of an 86 per cent profits collapse last year. The key new appointment was that of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, snatched from arch-rival General Motors in an unseemly tug-of-war over the weekend. Net group earnings tumbled to DM147m (Pounds 62m) from DM1.1bn in 1991, and the payout was cut to DM2 on both ordinary and preference shares, compared with DM11 and DM12 respectively, the company said yesterday. Turnover on the delivery of a record 3.52m vehicles last year rose to DM85.4bn from DM76bn, adding weight to the popular view that the more cars VW sells, the less profit it makes. Mr Lopez was named as director in charge of production and purchasing with immediate effect. His was the only outside face to appear in the new management team picked by Mr Ferdinand Piech, who has been group chairman since January 1. Mr Lopez replaces Mr Gunter Hartwich, who is to leave the company and will function as an adviser, the company said. As expected, Mr Dieter Ullsperger, finance director, has lost his job. His place will be filled immediately by Mr Werner Schmidt, a hitherto low-profile director formerly in charge of overseas operations and distribution strategy. Mr Ulrich Seiffert, the research and development chief, lost his place on the parent board, but he retains his place as R&amp;D director at the Volkswagen brand subsidiary. His research responsibilities will be taken on by Mr Gunnar Larsson, promoted last month from the group's Audi subsidiary. More detailed information on the group's performance and prospects will be given at Mr Piech's first annual press conference on March 31. Mr Piech, an Austrian promoted from the leadership of Audi, warned recently that the German car industry faced its worst crisis since 1945. The company has already announced plans to shed 36,000 workers to regain competitiveness. This job-cutting programme is likely to be stepped up and run in parallel with a squeeze on suppliers masterminded by Mr Lopez.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Y. C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 6 (CNA) -- Taiwan has mobilized its  resources to fight a war against narcotics, which has already  paid off handsomely, Justice Minister Ma Ying-jeou said  Wednesday [6 April].    In 1993 alone, Ma pointed out, more than 6,400 kilograms of  drugs were seized here. The amount far exceeds seizures  recorded in previous years, he noted.    In addition, the Ministry of Justice's Investigation Bureau  has foiled a number of drug trafficking efforts with the help of  international cooperation and information exchanges, he stressed.    As an international business operations center, Taiwan has  been used by drug traffickers as a transshipment point, he added.    The minister pledged that the government would spare no  effort in combating the drug problem.    Moreover, he said, Taiwan's anti-drug efforts have won  recognition from the United States.    The 1993 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report  issued by the U.S. State Department Monday said that authorities  in Taiwan are increasingly involved in combating the rapidly  growing drug abuse problem, and that Taiwan's drug laws are  being strengthened.    "In 1993 there were no reports of corruption in connection  with narcotics law enforcement in Taiwan," the report said.    Ma made these remarks while fielding questions at the  Legislative Yuan.    Meanwhile, Director Wu tung-ming of the Investigation Bureau  said that a report made by a U.S. House of Representatives  delegation last year also praised Tawian's efforts in dealing  with drug issues. The delegation visited Taiwan last August for  an anti-drug meeting.    Taiwan has done a good job in customs inspection, Wu  asserted, saying 14 percent of containers entering and leaving  Taiwan are inspected, compared to the United States' 12 percent.    The war against narcotics calls for increased information  exchanges and increased international cooperation, he stressed.</p>

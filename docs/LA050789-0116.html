			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: LIBBY THE ALASKAN DIARIES &amp; LETTERS OF LIBBY BEAMAN,  1879-1880 EDITED BY BETTY JOHN (HOUGHTON MIFFLIN: $8.95)  </P> <P> At Libby Beaman's request for a favor from "Father's old friend," President  Rutherford B. Hayes, her husband, John, was appointed assistant agent  overseeing the seal-fur trade in the Alaskan Pribilof Islands. Libby would be  the first white woman to sail to these distant islands, much against the will  of her husband's superior, identified only as the "Senior Agent, SA." More  difficult than being "icebound, rockbound, weather-bound" during that first  year was the fact that Libby and John would live in a single cabin with the  senior agent.  </P> <P> The senior agent's presence in the cabin caused constant friction: John was  extremely jealous and it was clear that the senior agent found Libby  attractive. In her journals, Libby admits that she reciprocated his interest,  though their passion was never acted upon.  </P> <P> Betty John, Libby's granddaughter, collected the journals and letters into this  fascinating volume, in whose epilogue she reveals the identity of the  mysterious senior agent: Harrison Gray Otis, who returned to California and in  1882 founded the Los Angeles Daily Times, which later became the Los Angeles  Times.  </P></p>

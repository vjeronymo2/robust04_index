			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / International Company News: China signs accord on HK listings OFFICIALS from China and Hong Kong signed a milestone agreement in Beijing at the weekend, designed to facilitate cross-border regulatory co-operation on securities. The memorandum prepares the way for the listing of mainland companies on the Hong Kong stock exchange. Mr Liu Hongru, vice-chairman of the Securities Committee of China's State Council, or cabinet, said on Saturday that at least two and possibly three Chinese companies would be listed in Hong Kong before the end of June. The process marks China's first big foray into international securities markets and is being viewed as a serious test of the credibility of mainland reporting and accounting standards. Mr Charles Lee Yeh-kwong, chairman of the Hong Kong stock exchange, said in Beijing after the signing that the agreement was aimed at providing 'investors with better protection'. It was also designed to 'ensure the fair and efficient operation of the securities markets'. The provisions include those laying down guidelines for the sharing of information about listed companies and reporting. The agreement helps to create a legal framework for listings in Hong Kong. State Council last year approved the listing of nine leading mainland companies on the Hong Kong stock exchange. These include Tsingtao Brewery and Shanghai Petrochemical which are expected to be among the first two Chinese companies to list. Among signatories to the memorandum signed in Beijing at the weekend were China's Securities Regulatory Commission and the country's two fledgling stock markets - the Shanghai Securities Exchange and the Shenzen Securities Exchange. Signatories from the Hong Kong side were the Securities and Futures Commission and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Mr Liu made clear the planned listing of nine mainland companies in Hong Kong was part of a trial process, and there would now be a lull while the move was assessed.</p>

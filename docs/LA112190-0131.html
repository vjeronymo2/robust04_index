			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> COSTNER BRINGS A CLEAR EYE TO EPIC 'WOLVES'  </P> <P> Kevin Costner opens his stirringly fine "Dances With Wolves" (throughout San  Diego County) by pitching us without prologue or apology into the thick of  character and action.  </P> <P> Costner's Lt. John Dunbar, a wounded Union officer, is next in line to have his  foot sawed off at a Tennessee field hospital; preferring to die intact rather  than mutilated, he steals back to his men. Nearly hallucinating, he chooses  death by galloping between the stalemated Union and Confederate troops, drawing  rebel fire and ending his pain.  </P> <P> During his final, full-tilt charge, muttering, "Father, forgive me," Dunbar  drops his reins and throws his arms up and out, looking like a circus rider or  a Christ figure, or both. It's a marvelous moment of cinema, but a dangerously  risky one when the star is also the director, and a first-time director at  that. It practically invites the professionally cool in the audience to drawl,  "Well, who does he think he is?"  </P> <P> Yet played off against Dunbar's incredulous entry in his journal, "In trying to  produce my own death, I became a living hero," the moment carries exactly the  aura of half-mad heroism it's supposed to. Quite clearly, Costner knows exactly  who he is, what he is doing, and how to do it.  </P> <P> He may have studied the way Akira Kurosawa splits his screen with a horizon  line or sets a character a little off-center in the vastness of a plain; there  are movements of cottonwoods and buffalo grass that may recall "Dersu Uzala,"  and figures against a flaming sunset that bring back "Kagemusha," but there are  far worse directors to study if one is starting out.  </P> <P> "Dances With Wolves" is a clear-eyed vision. Authentic as an Edward Curtis  photograph, lyrical as a George Catlin oil or a Karl Bodmer landscape, this is  a film with a pure ring to it. It's impossible to call it anything but epic,  not with scenes like the ground-shaking buffalo hunt, photographed with the  camera moving at the same breakneck speed as the buffalo, while Dunbar and the  young Sioux maneuver among them. The work of the buffalo-hunt camera crew is  extraordinary, supplementing Dean Semler's painterly cinematography overall.  </P> <P> Yet somehow, because the film's screenplay, by Michael Blake, concerns itself  with character, not spectacle, its epic quality is engaging, frequently  punctuated with gutsy humor, never self-congratulatory. Considering the scope  and the ambitiousness of the material, the success of Costner and every one of  his team seems monumental. (The film is rated PG-13 for its violence and brief,  discreet nudity.)  </P> <P> With his act of suicide seen as reckless bravery, Dunbar, not dead and not  footless, is rewarded with any post he wishes. He asks simply for the frontier  and is dumped at South Dakota's Ft. Sedgewick with a wagonload of supplies. The  eerily deserted fort is two crumbling sod huts and a broken-down corral on a  treeless plain. There's nothing around for miles, nothing but duty to keep  Dunbar there and only his smart horse, Cisco, and a canny wolf for company. And  though he doesn't know it, two deaths have obliterated any official knowledge  of his existence out there.  </P> <P> It's clear from Dunbar's first night that man and country suit each other. The  screenplay may not spell out precisely why, but Costner is good at suggesting a  deep, settling-in quality to the reckless Dunbar, jumpy but unafraid out here  under an orange Dakota moon.  </P> <P> A poker-faced stickler for regulations, Dunbar assigns himself clean-up duty,  carries on dry conversations with Cisco, names and tames his wolf, Two Socks,  records his impressions in his journal. And slowly, we come to the essence of  this thoughtful, complex man, his character leavened by just enough goofiness  to balance his undeniably heroic streak. After seeing these facets in earlier  Costner films, solidity without dullness, uninsistent manliness, a measured  watchfulness, one might suspect that the Dunbar/Costner fit, as tailored to him  by his friend and screenwriter Blake, is pretty close. If so, Costner's moments  undercutting his own image are especially charming.  </P> <P> Then, in a hilarious cross-cultural encounter, the solitary lieutenant is  discovered by his Sioux neighbors. After this confrontation, the filmmakers  have made absolute magic; curiosity replaces unease, each side tests the other  gravely and is not disillusioned. Dunbar, fascinated, begins to learn something  about the character of the Sioux people, tactfully teaching us at the same  time.  </P> <P> As the Sioux come alive, a handful stand out: Kicking Bird (Graham Greene), the  tribe's holy man, his hair like a falcon's top-knot; the hotly combative Wind  in His Hair (Rodney A. Grant); tribal leader Ten Bears (singer Floyd Red Crow  Westerman), masterly at imposing his knowledge without appearing to, and young  Smiles a Lot (Nathan Lee Chasing His Horse), witness to the best and worst in  the white strangers. They are a collection of exceptional talents.  </P> <P> In a bow to Western movie tradition, there's also the luminous-eyed Stands With  a Fist (Mary McDonnell), the white-child-raised-by-the-tribe, who moves from  mourning widow to reluctant translator to the woman Dunbar loves. Since these  people so clearly possess the values and qualities Dunbar has instinctively  been drawn to -- only heightened and refined -- the dawning knowledge of where  he truly belongs emerges.  </P> <P> One might remark on the even disposition of every soul in this huge encampment.  The natural dangers of their lives aside, these people really have a good day,  every day. It's the Pawnee who are the movie's "bad Indians." In the same  crabby vein, one might question why there's no other Army man who shares  Dunbar's humanity, or even curiosity. But as a student of the period remarked,  the West wasn't settled by humanitarians.  </P> <P> Dunbar is given his name Dances With Wolves after a singularly unbuttoned  moment, not unlike the one in "Lawrence of Arabia" as Lawrence runs preeningly  in his floating white robes, only to find to his mortification that he's being  watched by an Arab stranger. More important is Dunbar's ecstatic private dance  at his own campfire -- done with the sort of rapture Lawrence would understand  -- marking just how far this authentic hero has moved from the stoic Western  tradition. It is exactly in the path Kicking Bird has described: the trail of a  true human being.  </P> <P> 'DANCES WITH WOLVES'  </P> <P> An Orion Pictures release of a TIG Productions presentation.

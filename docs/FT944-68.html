			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / On The Front Line: Paisley power The Rev Dr Ian Richard Kyle Paisley, MP for the Northern Ireland seat of North Antrim, head of the Democratic Unionist Party, founder of the free Presbyterian Church in Ulster, member of the European parliament for the province, has for 25 years personified protestant resistance to any change in the constitutional link between Britain and the six provinces of Ulster. In stentorian tones and fiery oratory he has boomed out 'no surrender' so often to every proposal for change that as, John Hume, his nationalist Catholic counterpart, once remarked, tongue-in-cheek, if the word 'no' was struck from the English language Ian Paisley would have nothing to say. The current talks involved in the so-called peace process portend the best prospect in a quarter of a century for changes in the constitutional arrangements for the British Islands. Yet, for once, Ian Paisley, has been strangely muted. His implacable hostility to change stems not so much from a love of British governments. It derives more from a deep-seated opposition to the Roman Catholicism of the Republic of Ireland. In his dread of all things Roman or papist, as he refers to the Republic, Paisley seems to be fighting the battles of long ago. Presbyterianism has long been the province's largest protestant denomination. And it is to these that Paisley has played. The protestants today amount to 1m of the province's 1.6m population and the Catholics form the considerable minority. Whether it was a rural farmer frightened of being deprived of his land, or a skilled Belfast industrial worker afraid of losing his job, they were united in the belief that they were superior to their Catholic neighbours. Their presbyterianism heavily influenced as it was with Calvinism gave then a moral edge, as they see it. Ian Paisley was born on 2 April 1926 in Armargh, the son of a baptist minister. In 1951 he started in a Free Presbyterian Church in Belfast. In 1963 he began his career of protest, well before the Troubles broke out again in 1968. In that year he organised a march to protest against the lowering of the Union Flag at Belfast City Hall to mark the death of Pope John XXIII. Other protests followed. But to see him as just a bombastic, slightly unhinged bible basher is to do him less than justice. By the early l960s he had become interested in politics. and political organisation, and has proved a very canny politician indeed. He won the parliamentary seat for North Antrim in a by-election in 1970, and in 1971 launched the Democratic Unionist Party. In l979 he won one of the three European Parliament seats in the province and has continued to hold it with huge majorities. His position as a high profile, constitutional politician has given him a certain legitimacy in presenting as spokesman for loyalism. The apotheosis of his role came in 1974. The protestants demonstrated their great ability to cohere under pressure. A coalition of paramilitaries, trade unionists and extremist politicians like such as Paisley, united to form the Ulster Workers Council. It made the province ungovernable for a week, largely through shutting down the power stations. The government of Harold Wilson lost its nerve, failed to break up the strikes, and the new executive, the first attempt at power-sharing, collapsed. What the strikes demonstrated was Paisley's rare ability to march the Ulster Protestants up to the brink and then back again without suffering any loss of face. He has always publicly eschewed violence and distanced himself from the paramilitaries. The point about Paisley is that while he personally seems to personify unionism, his party is a minority one. Critically, the Loyalist paramilitary organisations have now said they want their own political representatives to enter discussions with the British government. This is a serious blow to his claim of having the mandate to speak for all the unionists Paisley is 68 years old and visibly not the man he was. Is the 'big man' he about to shout his last hurrah?</p>

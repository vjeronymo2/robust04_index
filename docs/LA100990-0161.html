			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOUTER SWORN IN, PLEDGES TO DO 'EQUAL RIGHT'  </P> <P> David H. Souter, a previously little-known judge from New Hampshire, became  history's 105th Supreme Court justice today after pledging to "do equal right  to the poor and to the rich."  </P> <P> In a brief ceremony in the crowded courtroom, Souter, 51, was administered the  judicial oath of office by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and almost  immediately got to work hearing high court arguments with his eight new  colleagues.  </P> <P> In taking the oath, Souter said, "I do solemnly swear to administer justice  without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich."  </P> <P> Afterward, Souter and Rehnquist posed for photographers outside the building on  Capitol Hill before heading back inside for a reception attended by members of  the Senate Judiciary Committee, other Washington dignitaries and Souter's  friends and well-wishers.  </P> <P> Souter, facing a group of photographers and television cameras outside, said:  "I got to work on time this morning. I'm starting off on the right foot."  </P> <P> As cameras clicked and whirred, Souter said: "Hurry and load up. I've got to go  to work."  </P> <P> He also disclosed that he has found a place to live in the Washington area, but  declined to give any details.  </P> <P> A short time later, Souter took his seat at the end of the bench assigned to  the newest justice for the start of the court's regularly scheduled  proceedings.  </P> <P> Souter pledged to uphold the Constitution in a separate oath-taking ceremony  Monday at the White House.  </P></p>

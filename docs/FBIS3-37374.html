			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Stas Stremidlovskiy: "Falcons of the Airwaves </F> Will Bend Everyone's Ears"]    [Text] First of all a quotation, excuse me for being  immodest, from our own newspaper, KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA on 15  December 1993: "In Yelena Bonner's opinion, journalists who  were too harsh in their criticism of the reforms are chiefly to  blame for Zhirinovskiy's victory." This was said after the  results of December's elections, which shocked us all. Let me  remind readers that at the time journalists were also blamed for  paying excessive attention to Vladimir Volfovich himself.    Until today, I personally have tried not to write about Mr.  Zhirinovskiy, because any mention of his name in the press is an  indirect advertisement for him. But having looked through some  documents I received from an acquaintance in the Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], I realized that the time has  now come to refer to the leader of this party in print.    Well then. The first document is "A Blueprint for Broadcasts  by the `Radio Zhirinovskiy' Radio Station." First of all we  have the preamble: "The existence of his own radio  station will make Vladimir Zhirinovskiy even more popular and  boost the number of his potential voters." I invite you to  memorize this statement carefully; we will have reason to recall  it.    Now for the details. The authors of the blueprint give a  detailed description of the planned items that will be broadcast  on "Radio Zhirinovskiy." There will be Zhirinovskiy Hour -- an  hour of listeners' questions answered live by the LDPR leader.  Then there is music from Zhirinovskiy's childhood -- a program  specially for older listeners. Zhirinovskiy request time will  consist of several hours a week of the great man's musical  requests dedicated to "Travkin, Burbulis, Yeltsin, Lukyanov,  Saddam Husayn, and Clinton." Zhirinovskiy's favorite tunes will  acquaint listeners with the leader's preferred melodies.  Finally, It's Your Line to Zhirinovskiy means that anyone who  wants to talk on air with Mr. Zhirinovskiy can send a postcard  to the radio station indicating his telephone number.    Here is another quotation: "For people weighed down by  constant problems who find themselves continually depressed  owing to their unbearably difficult way of life, we propose the  `Russian Dream' propaganda program. Analogous to the American  version, the Russian dream means faith in one's future, a strong  country, prosperity for one's children, peaceful twilight years,  stability, and security. Studio guests will include people who  have made something of themselves and overcome a host of  problems." Most of the station's broadcasting time,  according to the authors' plan, will be made up of patriotic  music from all eras.    This is no joke. As far as I can tell, negotiations are  already under way with two radio stations -- "Avto-radio" and  "Vozrozhdeniye." It is planned to broadcast between 1900 hours  and 0400 hours, presumably starting this March or April.    And so to the second document. "The `Zhirinovskiy Nighttime'  Youth Club." Its founders believe that "the club's name  will give rise to plenty of jokes regarding its activities, but  the parties we intend to hold will always differ from those in  other night clubs by their marked accessibility, immediacy, and  quality program." So what are Zhirinovskiy's clowns  planning? "While primarily intended for a youthful  audience, the club will also enable us to hold parties for  disabled people and pensioners, organize programs devoted to a  particular event, or simply invite deputies from a particular  faction to celebrate their leader's birthday."    The night club also plans free lunches for pensioners,  performances by artistes for the residents of children's homes,  and meetings with the press.    One can of course make fun of the unwieldiness of the plans  put forward by Zhirinovskiy's supporters. It is possible to do  so. Only we should remember the background against which all  this is taking place.    Meanwhile in over 30 Russian cities television programming  has been cut back exclusively to news broadcasts, since both  Russian Television and "Ostankino" owe the Ministry of  Communications approximately 80 billion rubles. Moreover, the  Ministry of Finance has halved Russian Television's budget, and  now Russian Television has been forced to halve its programming.    At the same time, in accordance with an instruction by  government apparatus leader Vladimir Kvasov, even news agency  and television correspondents are not being admitted to  government sessions for the first time in two years. The  explanation looks like a joke that has fallen flat -- we are  being told that the sessions are a "working process, and  therefore only mass media accredited to the Council of Ministers  may attend the sessions, namely ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA and the  government newspapers."    In my opinion we are already witnessing a trend whereby the  numerous press services, which were originally designed to  impart as much information as possible about their department's  work to the press and hence to society, are turning into a press  whose purpose is to squeeze journalists out of the corridors of  state structures. I am not even going to mention the country's  top leaders. An acquaintance of mine shudders whenever he  catches a speech by the president on television. Well, here is  Yeltsin telling us about his edict which will stir up the entire  country, he comments.    Of all Russia's politicians, Vladimir Volfovich is virtually  the only one who converses with the people. He travels around  the country, around our country, moreover, not America or  Switzerland. He directs his appeals to specific groups of  voters. He knows what he wants. I have no doubt that  Zhirinovskiy will be our next president.    So what will you do then, Messrs. Democrats? Absolutely  nothing. You seem to be implying that life will be awful if  Comrade Zyukin comes to power.    Comrade Zyukin has already arrived. But he does not wear a  sober suit from the "Bolshevik" factory, nor does he go around  with a long face. Comrade Zyukin wears denims and listens to  rap music. While you preserve a haughty silence, he is running  a disco.    I can only hope that our people are more intelligent en  masse  than any one politician or minister. They may be able to see  exactly what Comrade Zyukin represents. But you democrats, if  you have learned nothing since 12 December, will never learn  anything at all.</p>

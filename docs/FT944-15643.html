			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Job cuts spark strike at Skoda Ten thousand workers at Skoda Automobilova, the Czech carmaker that is part of the Volkswagen group, staged a half-hour warning strike yesterday over plans to make 800 employees redundant by the end of the year. More stoppages are threatened. The dispute risks disrupting the launch next month of Skoda's Felicia model, its first new product since 1988. It could also rebound on VW's delicate talks with the government on increasing its stake. Skoda says the job losses, announced last month, are necessary to increase competitiveness and it has hinted at more next year. The company employs 17,000 people. Union representatives insist, however, that wages are lower and productivity higher at Skoda's Mlada Boleslav plant north of Prague than in European Union countries. Volkswagen's 31 per cent of Skoda is due to rise to 70 per cent under a 1991 agreement with the government, at a total cost of DM1.4bn. VW also agreed to invest DM8bn, but it announced last year that it would cut this to DM3.75bn after running up huge losses at its Seat subsidiary in Spain. The original investment envisaged production levels of 400,000 cars yearly at Skoda by 1997, but this is expected to be changed to about 300,000 by the end of the decade. Production has fallen steeply this year as the company's old Favorit model has been phased out and new assembly plants installed to produce the Felicia. Overall production is expected to dip to 180,000 this year from 220,000 last year, but Skoda says it should rise to 1993 levels again next year. Skoda lost Kcs4.26bn (Dollars 154m) last year on revenues of Kcs35bn, and further losses are expected again this year. Volkswagen and the government are discussing an addendum to the 1991 agreement under which the carmaker would commit itself to production, employment and investment targets. The talks are due to be completed by the end of this month. Even at its reduced level Volkswagen's investment is the biggest in the Czech Republic to date. Hostility to foreign investment is growing, however, as the Skoda investment and other high-profile deals, such as that of Air France in Czechoslovak Airlines, begin to run into problems.

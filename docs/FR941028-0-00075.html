			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Nevertheless, OSM must reject the view that, because ownership or control issues are invoked, OSM must be initially involved in every permit application decision made by a State regulatory authority. The primary responsibility and authority for making a decision whether to issue or deny a permit is with the regulatory authority before which an application is pending. The primary responsibility and authority under a State regulatory program for issuing a violation is with that State's regulatory authority. The primary responsibility for the ongoing supervision of a permit is with the State regulatory authority which issued the permit. Accordingly, while OSM has changed some of the terminology in the final rule for reasons which are discussed below, OSM has not changed the basic conceptual framework contained in paragraph (b)(3) of proposed section 773.26. That framework is that the regulatory authority which is considering an application, which has issued a permit, or which has issued a violation has initial authority for making decisions with respect to the ownership or control relationships respectively invoked by the application, the permit, and the violation. OSM has program oversight authority of such decisions under 30 CFR parts 733, 842, and 843. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This commenter further indicated that the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of the proposed section allocated the authority to review State decisions with respect to permit applications to OSM, but that OSM could exercise such authority only after a permit had been issued, in accordance with proposed &sect;843.24, and that this would cause friction between OSM and the States. The commenter proposed that, if OSM believed that an ownership or control link had not been made or had been severed improperly by a State regulatory authority considering a permit application, the permit should not be issued until OSM and the State regulatory authority resolved their dispute. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM appreciates the commenter's concern. In any system involving Federal oversight of the States, there is the potential for disagreements between the States and the Federal government. SMCRA is no exception. For instance, the invocation of the improvidently issued permit process by OSM, pursuant to 30 CFR 843.21, subjects the State's permit application review process to close scrutiny with respect to the permit in question. This is one of the remedies provided in proposed &sect;843.24 which paragraph (b)(3) of proposed &sect;773.26 would make applicable. There is potential for stress in this process. To help avoid to improvident issuance of permits, however, OSM, through its AVS Office, has attempted to be accessible to the States and to work with the States have the benefit of OSM's most current opinions with respect to particular ownership or control situations. Whether a State regulatory authority chooses to avail itself of this service is a matter within the discretion of the State regulatory authority which has the primary authority to decide whether to issue a permit. Principles of State primacy make it inappropriate, however, to mandate such consultations with respect to every permit application. Accordingly, OSM declines to modify the rule to mandate that OSM intervene in the State permit application process to require that the State not issue a permit if OSM disagrees with the State's resolution of an ownership or control issue. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Industry commenters criticized the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of proposed &sect;773.26. They questioned the requirement contained in the proposed regulation that a regulatory authority make a prima facie determination whether an ownership or control link exists to a violation and that such violation remains ``outstanding.'' They asserted that the provisions of section 510(c) of the Act require the denial of permits for ``unabated'' violations only, not ``outstanding'' violations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM disagrees with the commenters' analysis. The provisions of section 510(c) of the Act require that a regulatory authority not issue a permit if information available to it indicates that ``any surface coal mining operation owned or controlled by the applicant  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> is currently in violation  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> of the Act'' or other laws specified. (Emphasis added.) Paragraph (c)(1) of proposed &sect;773.26 requires a prima facie determination whether the violation covered by a violation notice ``remains outstanding.'' A violation which ``remains outstanding'' is one which is ``current.'' The plain meaning of these phrases is the same. Further, by the use of the words ``remains outstanding'' in the proposed regulation, OSM did not intend to change the standard established by section 510(c) of the Act. Instead, OSM merely sought, as the Federal agency charged with implementing SMCRA, to provide a workable phrase defining a current violation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Industry commenters further objected to paragraph (c)(1) of proposed &sect;773.26 insofar as such proposal required an applicant to demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the applicant did not own or control the violator within the meaning of the regulations. The commenters asserted that the imposition of such a burden of proof upon the applicant was inconsistent with section 510(c) of the Act and that the use of such an evidentiary burden was only appropriate for formal proceedings before tribunals, rather than informal proceedings before State regulatory authorities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM disagrees with commenters' objections. The imposition of such a burden of proof is entirely consistent with the provisions of section 510(c) of the Act which require that, when available information indicates that a surface coal mining operation ``owned or controlled by the applicant'' is in current violation of the Act or other laws listed, the permit not be issued ``until the applicant submits proof that such violation has been corrected or is in the process of being corrected.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

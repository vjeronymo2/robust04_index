			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Weak close to another erratic trading session - Market Report Those hoping for a significant recovery in the UK market from its pre-Easter setback were disappointed as the equity trading account closed yesterday. Unsettled towards the close by a renewed setback in British government bonds, the FT-SE Index, having abandoned an early gain of 9 points, ended with a loss of 8.2 at 3,120.8. There was little immediate response, however, to the pending political developments in Japan. An increase of around 23 per cent in Seaq volume, although swollen by a large deal in a single stock, was another negative indicator. Trading volume rose sharply at the beginning of this week as end of UK tax-year deals were unwound. But now that the new tax year has opened and investment activity has returned to normal, higher volume has signalled a weaker market, underlining investment nervousness. The Footsie has lost around 8 points over the two-week account in the equity market which closed last night. But this masks a sharper fall in the week preceding Easter when the Footsie lost more than one per cent as investors shied away on nervousness that economic data from the US might reinforce fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy, perhaps even by raising the discount rate. Losses of as much as  3/4 point in long-dated UK government bonds, together with falls of around  5/32 in the short dates, underlined the continuing worries over both long-term inflation and the near-term prospects for domestic interest rates. The losses contrasted with firmness in sterling. London appeared unimpressed by Wall Street's overnight gains, which were carried through in early trading in the early part of the New York session. Market strategists seemed to be recovering their collective nerve after trimming near term Footsie predictions to around 2,800 in the wake of Mr Nicholas Knight, the Nomura Research guru who upset the markets over Easter. At Strauss Turnbull, Mr Ian Harnett stuck by predictions that the Footsie will end the year around 3,250-3,500, commenting that long-term funds could be buyers at this level. SG Warburg is now also looking for a year-end Footsie figure of 3,500, but says that this depends on two significant factors; that inflation remains benign and that equity dividends are 'left alone' in the November Budget. Dividends, boosted recently by good news from a number of leading companies, are now 10 per cent higher in aggregate on the year, according to Hoare Govett, the UK broking house. Once again, market indices were helped by strength in the oil sector, where the blue chip stocks continued to attract good support. But consumer sectors remained out of favour as uncertainty over the outlook for a consumer-led recovery in the UK kept investors on the sidelines. With pharmaceuticals, banks, food manufacturers and many other sectors lacking support, the Footsie index had no lack of negative features. Market strategists sounded cautious regarding the near term outlook for the stock market. Hopes for a significant cut in German interest rates must await next week's meeting of the Bundesbank policy council. In the meantime, investors will remain nervous of any sudden action by the US Federal Reserve, despite the general acceptance of the Fed's policy of tightening credit policies.</p>

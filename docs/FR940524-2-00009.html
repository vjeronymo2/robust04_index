Products Company (Oil Refinery); Philadelphia, PA <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) by the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority, grantee of FTZ 35, requesting special-purpose subzone status for the oil refinery complex of Chevron U.S.A. Products Company (Chevron), a wholly owned subsidiary of Chevron Corporation, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The application was submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a&hyph;81u), and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR part 400). It was formally filed on May 11, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The refinery complex (707 acres, 1,195 employees) consists of four sites and connecting pipelines, located near the junction of the Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers in southwestern Philadelphia, Pennsylvania:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Site 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (372 acres)_175,000 BPD refinery, Lanier Avenue, east side of the Schuylkill River;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Site 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (203 acres)_Schuylkill River Tank Farm, west side of the Schuylkill River across from the refinery;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Site 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (116 acres)_Darby Creek Tank Farm, Falcon Hook Rd., 3 miles northwest of the refinery; and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Site 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (16 acres)_Hog Island Wharf, 3 miles southwest of the refinery, on the Delaware River, adjacent to the Philadelphia International Airport. The wharf, storage facilities and pipelines operate as an integral part of the refinery. The refinery is used to produce fuel and chemical products. Fuels produced include gasoline, jet fuel, heavy fuel oil, diesel fuel, and light naphtha. Chemical products produced include liquified petroleum gas and butane; petrochemical feedstocks, such as cumene; and refinery byproducts, such as sulfur. All of the crude oil (95 percent of inputs) and certain blendstocks are sourced from abroad.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The application requests authority to use zone procedures primarily for export activity at this time and indicates that Chevron will accept approval subject to the standard oil refinery restrictions (privileged foreign status on incoming foreign merchandise and full duties on fuel consumed). At the outset, one of the main uses of zone procedures would involve the refining of foreign crude oil for jet fuel that is sold for international flights, displacing foreign-sourced jet fuel that is imported duty- and tax-free under Customs' bonded fuel program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Zone procedures would exempt Chevron from Customs duty payments on the foreign products used in its exports, including jet fuel sold for international flights. The company would be able to defer Customs duties on finished products shipped to U.S. markets. (The duty on crude oil ranges from 5.25 to 10.5 cents/barrel.) Jet fuel sold for international flights also would be exempt from state sales and excise taxes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl ether) is one of the blendstocks sourced from abroad. The company would be able to defer Customs duties on MTBE blended into motor gasoline and shipped to U.S. markets. (The duty on MTBE is 5.6%  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ad valorem <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). The application indicates that the savings from zone procedures would help improve the refinery's international competitiveness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the Board's regulations, a member of the FTZ Staff has been designated examiner to investigate the application and report to the Board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public comment is invited from interested parties. Submissions (original and 3 copies) shall be addressed to the Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is July 25, 1994. Rebuttal comments in response to material submitted during the foregoing period may be submitted during the subsequent 15-day period August 8, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A copy of the application and accompanying exhibits will be available for public inspection at each of the following locations: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> U.S. Department of Commerce District Office, suite 201, 660 American Avenue, King of Prussia, PA 19406. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Office of the Executive Secretary, Foreign-Trade Zones Board, room 3716, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th &amp; Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: May 13, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> John J.

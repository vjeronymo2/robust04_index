			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Recs on dividend alert Last Friday's rumours of a one-off special dividend of 85p from East Midlands Electricity were confirmed at the outset of trading yesterday and produced a flurry of heavy buying across the sector as analysts told their institutional clients to expect more of the same from other regional electricity companies, or Recs. And East Midlands is also expected to offer another special dividend to shareholders in the event of a successful sell-off of the National Grid, in which the Recs hold substantial stakes. Dealers said the market focused its attention on those Recs that have authority to buy in their own shares but have not not yet done so. The favourite to launch a similar move to that undertaken by East Midlands was Southern, closely followed by Yorkshire and Eastern. East Midlands shares were adjusted at the outset and quoted ex the special payment, eventually closing at 666p. Yorkshire gave the best performance in the sector, closing 29 higher at 715p followed by Southern, 25 higher at 751p and Eastern, up 19 at 756p. Norweb put on 18 at 780p and South West 15 at 743p. Specialists said the the odds were that the Treasury would move in next month's budget to close what is viewed as a loophole regarding share buy backs.</p>

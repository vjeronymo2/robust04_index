			<p>BFN     [Text] Luxembourg, April 19 (AFP) -- The European Union  [EU] is hoping for a quick breakthrough in stalled negotiations  for a partnership and cooperation agreement with Russia, EU  officials said here Tuesday [19 April].    Speaking at a meeting of the EU's Ministerial Foreign  Affairs  Council, EU Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan said the two sides  had narrowed their differences over trade in nuclear fuel, one  of the issues holding up an accord.    Brittan also urged a rapid aid programme for Ukraine  involving agricultural and energy support in order to brake an  economic slide in the former Soviet republic.    And the EU foreign ministers formally acknowledged the  receipt of applications from Hungary and Poland to join the  union. The applications were given to the European Commission  for evaluation.    An EU spokesman said: "We believe the time is ripe for a  push  to complete the negotiations with Russia."    The accord would support economic reform in Russia by giving  it better access to European markets leading eventually to a  free trade agreement.    It was supposed to be signed last June but has been held up  mainly by disputes over sales of nuclear fuels such as plutonium  and restrictions on the operations of foreign banks in Russia.    France in particular has been trying in the face of Russian  opposition to have the trade in nuclear fuels excluded from the  partnership agreement, so that curbs can more easily be applied  on Russian exports.    The officials said France, the principal producer in Europe,  was worried that export surges of Russian nuclear fuels could  lead to a price collapse damaging to its own nuclear fuel  producers.    But German Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Ursula  Seiler-Albring said Russia had promised to restrain its sales of  nuclear fuels if the trade could be included in the agreement.    The officials said no progress had been made in another  dispute involving restrictions on foreign banks operating in  Russia, which bar them from accepting Russian deposits.    Russian envoy Alexandr Shotkin is expected in Brussels later  this month to continue negotiations.    The European Commission also presented the outlines of an  aid  programme for Ukraine to be presented to the ministers for  approval next month.    Brittan said it involved sending seed and fertiliser to help  support the country's crumbling agricultural system, plus aid to  finance the purchase of EU agricultural produce.    The European Commission is also proposing aid to help  Ukraine  build new nuclear power stations, on condition that Kiev closes  down dangerously outdated plants such as the Chernobyl station  which was damaged in a 1986 accident.</p>

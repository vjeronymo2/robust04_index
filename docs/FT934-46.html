			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / UK Company News: BG Technology poised for cable TV move City dealmakers Luke Johnson and Stephen Hargrave are about to invade the world of cable television with a Pounds 15m deal expected to be announced in the next two weeks. Shares in Baillie Gifford Technology, the investment trust, were suspended yesterday at 31p, pending announcement of the deal. The shares have risen sharply from 15p in recent weeks, after Mr Johnson and Mr Hargrave were appointed to the board in November to seek an acquisition. BG Technology is understood to be in advanced talks with a provider of services and supplies to the cable television industry about a reverse takeover. The target company is thought to be an installation and contracting firm based in the south-east. The deal is likely to involve a substantial rights issue and an institutional placing at a significant discount to last night's share price to raise more than Pounds 8m. The group, which will change its name as part of the deal, will be capitalised at about Pounds 15m. Mr Johnson, a former analyst with Kleinwort Benson, is known in the City for two achievements: writing the book, How to Get a Highly Paid Job in the City, just two weeks before the 1987 stock market crash; and orchestrating several reverse takeovers since he went solo in 1987. While some enterprises have been less successful than others, Mr Johnson appears to have had a run of good luck in 1993. Most recently, he and Mr Hargrave, a former financial journalist, helped to bring Crabtree, a printing machine maker, to the market through a Pounds 20.4m reverse takeover of the quoted shell Somerset Trust. The shares, which were 178p at the time of the deal, closed yesterday at 271p. Mr Johnson was also behind the acquisition of Pizza Express by Star Computers, currently trading at 113p against a price of 43p at the time of the deal. Mr Johnson and Mr Hargrave will be investing between Pounds 375,000 and Pounds 500,000 for a 41 per cent stake in BG Technology upon completion of the deal. However, the stake is likely to be substantially reduced through the rights issue and placing. Management of the new company will retain roughly one third of the equity. Mr Johnson is likely to remain on the board as an executive director. The shares are expected to resume trading in February after an extraordinary meeting to approve the deal. BG Technology has been seeking to wind itself up for some three years after a mixed track record in investing in high-technology private companies. Some 85p has been returned to shareholders through a steady liquidation of assets. The group retains three shareholdings and has a net asset per share value of 7.3p.</p>

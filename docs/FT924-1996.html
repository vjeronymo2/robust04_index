			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Government Bonds: Post-summit firm tone gives way to ERM tensions THE SUCCESSFUL conclusion of the European Community summit in Edinburgh at the weekend encouraged some European government bond markets to start on a firm note yesterday. However, prices drifted lower on thin volumes throughout the day as dealers doubted whether tensions within the European exchange rate mechanism have been laid to rest. Even though the Danish government was pleased with the exemptions for some of the provisions in the Maastricht treaty agreed at the weekend, dealers warn that it is unclear how the amendments will be treated in the forthcoming Danish referendum. GERMAN government bond prices closed lower with the Liffe bund future contract falling from a high of 91.63 to end at around 91.51. Dealers noted some selling out of the Far East. According to a Reuters report, the Bonn finance ministry is considering the issue of a regular federal government bond at the end of the year. THE DUTCH government sold Fl 800m of its new 30-year tap stock at par yesterday, the first day of trading in the new issue. The Dutch government bond market drifted lower in thin trading, but dealers noted interest from domestic buyers in the new issue, the 7 1/2 per cent bond due 2023. The 30-year stock, which is the first such Dutch bond to be launched since 1964, was quoted at below par during the trading session. The tap sales are expected to continue throughout the week, dealers said. The money raised from the tap issue will be used to meet the state's financing requirement for 1993. The state said it aimed to raise a total of Fl 10bn with the 7 1/2 per cent bond, which will be sold in six tranches. The state has forecast a total financing requirement of Fl 47.2 bn in 1993, against Fl 47.9bn in 1992. FRENCH government bonds closed lower, with dealers pointing to disappointment over the weekend EC summit in Edinburgh. The December futures contract quoted on the Matif exchange fell from 110.46 to 110.08. SPANISH government bonds gained on the release of favourable economic data yesterday showing a 0.1 per cent rise in November inflation. Mr Carlos Solchaga, the economy minister, was quoted yesterday saying he did not expect an economic recovery before 1994 and revised downwards inflation projections for this year and next. He said Spain had entered a period of disinflation and inflation was expected to be a little below 5.5 per cent this year and less than 4.5 per cent in 1993. The 10-year 11.30 per cent bond yielded 12.63 per cent, against 12.75 per cent at Friday's close. UK government bonds edged higher in thin trade, but dealers said the Bank of England's latest tap issues - which amount to Pounds 700m - are likely to keep a cap on price movements over the next few days. Traders pointed out that calls on two existing stocks may also put a dampener on the gilts market. The tap stocks include Pounds 100m of the 8 per cent Treasury stock due 2002/2006, Pounds 250m of the 9 per cent Treasury due 2008, and Pounds 350m of the 9 per cent Treasury stock due 2012. The Liffe gilt future inched up from 99.27 to 99.29 by late afternoon in thin volume, while in the cash market the 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002 rose from 108 31/32 to 109 1/32 . JAPANESE government bond prices fell back as hopes of a cut in the official discount rate receded yesterday. Although the Tankan report, the Bank of Japan's quarterly survey of business confidence released on Friday, painted a gloomy picture of the Japanese economy, dealers said the bad news had already been priced into the market and was largely as expected. Bonds in the four to seven-year area led the fall in prices across the curve, with the benchmark No 145 JGB moving from a yield of 4.605 per cent to end at 4.65 per cent. The March futures contract opened at 107.71 and dropped to 107.44, closing at the low of the day. US Treasuries eased slightly across the maturity ranges yesterday in subdued trading. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  7/32 at 102, yielding 7.451 per cent. Prices at the short end of the market were also slightly weaker, with the two-year note down  3/32 at 99 21/32 to carry a yield of 4.793 per cent. Traders reported that activity was extremely light during the morning session, although the lack of business was not blamed on the recent storm which caused havoc in New York's business district last Friday and over the weekend. Instead, it was the absence of fresh economic statistics yesterday, and a reluctance among investors and dealers to trade before the housing starts, industrial production and jobless claims data due out later in the week, that was behind the lacklustre showing.</p>

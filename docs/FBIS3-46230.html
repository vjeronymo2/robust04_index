			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yinchuan, January 22 (XINHUA) -- Overseas investors  are shifting more of their attention to Northwest China, a  region long neglected by foreign businessmen but boastful of  great potential.    Northwest China, including Shaanxi, Gansu and Qinghai  Provinces and Ningxia Hui and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regions,  covers one third of the country's territory and is well endowed  with natural resources.    But overseas investors were discouraged by its remoteness,  tough climate and inconvenient communications.    As a result, the region has lagged far behind the rest of  China in the drive for opening up and in economic development.    The 1990s, however, saw a turning point for the region,  which is badly in need of overseas investments for an economic  take-off.    Latest statistics show that overseas-funded ventures  numbered  more than 3,000 by the end of 1993, over ten times that at the  beginning of the year. The figure has raised the region's  percentage of the national total from 0.6 to 1.6 percent.    Contracted foreign investment has amounted to more than five  billion U.S. dollars, the statistics indicated.    In Qinghai, one of the most impoverished provinces of China,  overseas-funded firms rose from three in 1991 to over 60 by  1993, involving a combined foreign investment of more than 96  million U.S. dollars.    Foreign investments have expanded from service industries to  sectors of energy, the exploration of raw materials, processing  and high-tech industries. And cooperative parties have  increased to more than 20 countries and regions. Moreover, the  province has also improved cooperation with the World Bank and  foreign governments in loans, technology and labour service.    Officials said that it is the abundance of natural resources  and promising development prospects that have brought investors  to Northwest China.    According to Liu Guanghe, vice-governor of Qinghai, more  than  60 of the 160 proven minerals have been found in the region,  adding the reserves of some 20 of them rank first in the country.    The official cited the Tarim Basin, which has a prospective  reserve of more than 20 billion tons of oil. He also said  Northwest China is home to two of the three large gas fields  already confirmed in China.    "The development of the vast Northwest China has a  significant impact on the overall progress of the country, which  is short of energy," the vice-governor said.    In Shaanxi, overseas-funded ventures topped 1,000 by the end  of last year, compared to 200 two years ago.    "Foreign investors are assured by China's reform and  opening-up policies as well as by the country's political  stability," said Xu Shanlin, vice-governor of the province.    Officials said the improvement in investment climate in the  region has also enhanced its competitiveness in attracting  foreign funds.    Automatic switchboards have been installed in the five  provincial or regional capital cities, and direct international  dialing can reach more than 100 countries and regions worldwide.  The expansion and upgrading of three airports in the region  have completed, and direct air routes have been opened between  the region and some major cities in the world.    The longest railway in China, known as Euro-Asia Continental  Bridge, and open border cities have helped connect the region  with the rest of the world, officials said.    To support economic advancement in the region, the central  government has approved the five capitals and over a dozen of  border cities to open to the outside world, and preferential  policies have been granted to them. In addition, three  state-level high-tech development zones have been established in  Northwest China.    The provinces and regions, meanwhile, have promulgated  preferential treatment policies to encourage foreign investments  and the establishment of joint ventures. They also have set up  organizations to coordinate overseas investments.</p>

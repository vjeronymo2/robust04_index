			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Russia moves towards compensation for Stalin's victims Millions of victims of Stalinist repression could be compensated for their confiscated property as Russia continues to exorcise the trauma of its Soviet past, writes John Thornhill. According to the Itar-Tass newsagency, the Russian government has passed a resolution promising to reimburse innocent victims of repression either by returning their original property or paying the cash equivalent. Details remain sketchy and the complications of implementing such a plan are vast. It is also likely that approval would first be needed from President Boris Yeltsin. The scheme would certainly open up a Pandora's box of highly-emotional claims. During Stalin's 30-year rule, many millions were persecuted, including whole ethnic groups.</p>

			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / International Company News: Japanese life groups downgraded THE financial strength ratings of three Japanese life companies were downgraded yesterday to Aa2 from Aaa by Moody's Investors Service, the US rating agency, which said the industry was experiencing 'considerable stresses'. Moody's said the earning capacity of the three companies - Sumitomo Life, Dai-ichi Mutual and Meiji Mutual - had been weakened by the turbulence in financial markets, while the medium-term deregulation of the industry would put the companies under increasing competitive pressure. 'Increasingly, a profit-driven and more competitive environment will produce a secular decline in asset quality,' the agency said. The collapse of stock prices has undermined the unrealised gains on the life industry's stock portfolios, while the industry also complains that dividend payments by Japanese companies must be increased in order to improve their returns on investments. For the first half to the end of September, the eight largest life companies reported an 11.5 per cent decline in investment returns, while their latent profits on stocks were down by 28.4 per cent. If the stock market fails to improve, they will be forced to record large appraisal losses on stocks at the end of the fiscal year. As a result, the companies are reviewing employee levels and generally attempting to reduce expenses. Moody's said that the downgrading meant that the three companies were now in the middle range of the 'excellent' category instead of the 'exceptional' category.</p>

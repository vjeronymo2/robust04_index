			<p>BFN     [Text] Tatar nationalist organizations said in a joint  statement that the Russian president's tour of Tatarstan was  undesirable. The statement was signed by the All-Union Tatar  Social Center, the Sovereignty committee, the Marjani society,  the Azatlyk youth movement, the Working Kazan movement and the  Republican Party of Tatarstan.    They believed that Yeltsin had failed to honor his pledge on  the Tatar people's sovereignty that he had made during his  previous tour of the republic. They argued that the elections  of the Russian president had not been held in Tatarstan, the new  Russian Constitution was not passed there and the Moscow-Kazan  treaty ran counter to the people's desires expressed in the  referendum.    According to unconfirmed reports, two members of the Tatar  independence party Ittifak and Azatlyk went on hunger strike in  protest against Yeltsin's visit to Tatarstan.</p>

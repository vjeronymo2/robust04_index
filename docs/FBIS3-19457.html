			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Gradual Recovery of Economy"] </F>   [Text] According to the recent medium-term forecast of the  Economic Research Institute, the Wifo, the Austrian economy has  emerged from the recession and stands at the beginning of a  period of -- initially restrained -- recovery.    In the 1993-1998 period, the gross domestic product will  increase by an average 2.3 percent per year, the same rate as in  the mid-eighties and thereafter, the Wifo noted. Thus, the  Austrian economy would grow faster than the German (average 1.9  percent) and about as fast as that of the European members of  the OECD (2.2 percent).    On the labor market the forced increase in labor  productivity  compared to previous years will hold down employment growth to  0.6 percent per year. Since the work force is expected to grow  by some 0.7 percent, the Wifo expects an increase in the  unemployment rate to 7.4 percent in the next few years from the  current 5.8 percent.    In the Wifo's view, restructuring and streamlining by  business will be successful. The increase in exports will  initially only be moderate as a result of the weak German  economy and speed up only in the course of the years. Exports  should benefit from the quick growth in East Europe. The Wifo  expects an average export growth of 5.75 percent in the 1993-98  period compared to 3.5 percent for 1988-93. Foreign exchange  revenues in real terms from the tourist trade will barely grow  half as quickly as in the past five years.    The Wifo does not anticipate any inflationary impulses for  the period up to 1998. The inflation rate is expected to  decrease to 2.5 percent until 1995, while after that it could  slightly increase to 3 percent. The increase in real pay of  wage or salary earners is expected to remain an average 0.5  percent below the increase in productivity.    According to the Wifo, equipment investment will not  increase  significantly until the end of 1995. All in all, gross fixed  investments will increase by 3.5 percent in the 1993-98 period,  and thus as fast as in the five preceding years.</p>

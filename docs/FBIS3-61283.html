			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Valentin Mikhaylov, people's deputy of the </F> Republic of Tatarstan, and Mikhail Birin, ROSSIYA staff  correspondent: "Tatarstan. A Toast in Solitude"]    [Text] It would seem that the new year will be toasted in  solitude in Tatarstan this year, without Russia. There have been  neither elections to the Federal Assembly of the Russian  Federation nor a referendum on the Constitution. If elections  had been conducted successfully it would have meant the  destruction of the three years of work of the local leaders, the  essence of which amounts, strictly speaking, not so much to  separating Tatarstan from the Federation as to removing the  authorities of Tatarstan from the jurisdiction of the Russian  authorities.    All the power has actually been concentrated in the hands of  a single person--the local president, Mintimer Shaymiyev. He is  the one who appoints the chiefs of rayon and city  administrations; through the presidium he has taken charge of  the republic's Supreme Soviet; last year he pushed his draft of  the Constitution through, reinforcing his executive authority;  he gave his edicts as much force as legislative acts in the  sphere of "power management" (the Law of Tatarstan on Emergency  Measures in Fighting Crime), and so forth. Day and night the  entire propaganda machine has been working to make sure that  sovereignty is firmly associated in the everyday awareness with  low prices of products and stability of interethnic relations.    And right at that moment the mother country starts "poking  its nose" into Tatarstan with its constitutional reforms. Its  initiative evoked a statement from M. Shaymiyev to the effect  that he himself personally would not go to the elections and  that anyone who values republic sovereignty would probably  follow his example. Half the work was done: At least the rural  areas could boldly exclude voters from the lists. Two districts  were excluded from the voting ahead of time with the help of  games played by the apparatus. These included not informing the  citizens (eight out of 10 people in Kazan received neither  written nor verbal notification and many customary precincts  changed their locations), an information blockade of the press  and even the candidates concerning preparations for the 12  December elections, and "undercounting" on voter lists (they  were practically not verified and as a result entire buildings  "turned up missing," while minors and even deceased citizens  ended up on the voter lists).    The administration chiefs conducted special "training  sessions" with chairmen of electoral commissions, whose nature  need not be especially discussed in light of the position of the  authorities.    Even such "trifles" as flying state flags at the precincts  were not observed. For example, in Sovetskiy Rayon of Kazan  there was not a single flag of the Russian Federation; only  flags of Tatarstan were flown, as if actions of the "neighboring  state" had nothing to do with them....    And what is not trivial is the powerful one-sided  conditioning of the population by the local mass media. But what  else can one expect when 90 percent of them are under government  jurisdiction?    The "war" of the leaflets had a dual character. Only  "imported" posters, that is, brought in from Russia, were in  favor of the elections and referendums; against them were  leaflets of clearly local but unspecified origin, which were  signed, true, in an extremely attractive way--"Movement for  Justice," "Committee of Soldiers' Mothers," "Council of  Veterans" (veterans of what--was not specified), the "Free Rus"  (?) group, and so forth. It is noteworthy that the output of  these still unknown authors was 10 times greater than that of  the Russian opponents. Thus the newspaper of the National  Radical Committee, SUVERENITET, unexpectedly and completely free  of charge ended up in a half million mailboxes.    The nature of the local epistles seemed extremely diverse at  first glance--from Jesuitical: "through your failure to  participate in the elections you are peacefully resisting the  adventurers who are fleecing you and your children" and "through  the boycott we have confirmed our confidence in the public  policy of the leadership of Tatarstan" to slogans that are  clearly stretching acceptable limits: "participation in the  elections means betrayal of the state interests of your  homeland--Tatarstan!" But while establishing the differences one  cannot but note a direction that was common to all--all of them  called not simply for voting against the draft Constitution or a  specific candidate, but for generally ignoring the elections  themselves. This position played exclusively into the hands of  the republic leadership, who can now work with the thesis: "The  population of Tatarstan does not need a federal Constitution  and, consequently, it needs [as published] representation in  Russian elective organs." And this fits extremely well into the  context of their idea of building a Federation "from bottom to  top," whereby all that is left for the center to do is pick up  the crumbs of the authorities delegated by Tatarstan which it  charitably allots from its republic table.    The results of the voting in this area have come out right  four times. Will this happen a fifth time as well? But the  question is left hanging in the air because of the unexpected  success of Mr. Zhirinovskiy and his by no means liberal and not  at all democratic ideas. The absence of the majority of the  reasonable population at the ballot boxes created the vacuum  whereby the activity of proponents of a firm hand grew into a  critical mass. Sovereignization in the version of the local  authorities evoked rhetoric like "unified and indivisible" even  in the astonishing version of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party  of Russia].    As for the politically inert population of the republic,  they  got what they deserve--a double defeat in civil rights. First,  there are practically no deputies from Tatarstan in the federal  parliament. Second--and this is the main thing--the authorities  have now cast doubts on the legitimacy of the newly adopted  Constitution of Russia. Although in the local basic law dual  citizenship--of Russia and Tatarstan--is unequivocally  guaranteed. But with the system of relations between the state  and the individual that exists in Tatarstan today, the  guarantees for citizens of the Russian state seem more and more  questionable from these positions than they did before the  December date. As one of the local readers noted bitterly: "You  did not care? Do not complain now...."    [begin box, page 3]    When conditioning enterprise leaders they did not shrink  from  direct threats regarding the positions they held.    The victory of the LDPR was even very predictable because of  the position of that same Mr. Shaymiyev, who actually excluded  the entire republic from the political struggle.    [end box]</p>

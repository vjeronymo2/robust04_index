			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Avonside rises 20% to Pounds 2.64m Avonside Group reported a 20 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 2.64m and also announced plans for a phased withdrawal from housebuilding, writes Katrina Lowe. Mr Christopher Glynn, chairman, said the group intended to focus on building services and distribution. It had entered into an agreement with the management of Parry Homes, its larger housebuilding subsidiary, under which its land bank would be progressively developed and sold. In the first half, sales grew to Pounds 38.3m (Pounds 28.5m), including Pounds 28.1m (Pounds 20m) from building services. Operating profits from services increased to Pounds 2.03m (Pounds 1.39m) but housebuilding's input fell to Pounds 947,000 (Pounds 1.08m) due to pressure on margins. Avonside is raising its interim dividend to 2.1p (1.9p) on earnings per share of 3.9p (3.41p). The Parry agreement allows, subject to certain targets, for Parry to be sold to its management, led by Mr Robert Palin, the managing director.</p>

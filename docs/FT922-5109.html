			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of The Earth Summit (2): Rio is not just one event - but several - The Summit Agenda APART from the official negotiations involving more than 160 countries, there will be dozens of gatherings in and around Rio of non-governmental groups - the green organisations, business groups, and so on - all striving to influence the outcome. But the main focus will be on the newly-built Rio Centro conference centre located 20 miles outside Rio. Here, official delegations meet for 12 days to hammer out a series of treaties and agreements, culminating in a grand ceremony involving as many as 60 world leaders, the largest such gathering in history. The agenda on the Rio negotiating table is a lot less ambitious than first hoped, mainly because of the deep disagreements exposed during the preparations. For example, a proposed Earth Charter had to be dropped because it tried to do too much. Instead, there will be a watered down Rio Declaration - a kind of 'Ten Commandments on the Environment,' except that it will have 27. This will commit signatories to pursuing sustainable development, and eradicating poverty. It will also enshrine the principles of 'polluter pays,' free trade, and environmental protection, and uphold the rights of women, children and indigenous peoples. Another key principle is that countries have sovereign rights to exploit their resources, but an equal responsibility to ensure that their actions do not harm the environment for others. The Rio Declaration will be backed up by Agenda 21, an 800-page action programme which will flesh out the 27 principles. This enormous document will address all the major issues: land, air, water, living things, as well as related matters like education, poverty and managing toxic waste. Participants will also sign two international conventions, or treaties. The first of these, widely described as the keystone to Rio, will be a World Climate Convention to promote measures to reduce the greenhouse gases that threaten to change the world's climate. This does not contain the binding deadlines originally planned, though the developed countries will agree to come up with specific plans aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions to their 1990 levels by the year 2000. The second, a Bio-Diversity Convention, will aim to protect the richness of the world's plant and animal life, though again critics have claimed that it is not strong enough, and that the wealthier countries should commit more resources. There was to be a third treaty to save the tropical forests, but this proved too controversial because it implied blame on the part of the Third World countries in managing their resources. Instead, there will be a Statement of Principles on Forests which will recognise countries' rights to exploit their forest resources, but also stress the need for proper forest management. Both the conventions will contain pledges of money by the rich countries to help the poor deal with their environmental problems. But quite how much money is committed will be the subject of much hard bargaining at the Rio conference centre.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Manuel Alvarez Cedeno] </F>   [Text] President Guillermo Endara is not opposed to the  return of General Manuel Antonio Noriega's former civilian and  military collaborators who left the country in 1990, but he  added that they must settle pending court matters if they return.    Endara said: "As far as I am concerned, all Panamanians who  left -- from former Government and Justice Minister Rodolfo  "Popito" Chiari on down -- may return, but, if they have any  problems with the Judicial Branch or the Attorney General's  Office, I will not get involved in that."    Following Noriega's ouster, his main collaborators abandoned  the country, and since then, some have expressed a desire to  return, but they must face charges linked to freedom of speech  violations, embezzlement, and even murder.    The president argued: "They are not in exile because of me,"  which is very different from what the former military government  did when it exiled many of its opponents.    "I sympathize with all Panamanians in exile, because I was  once forced to leave the country. As far as I am concerned,  they can return, but if they have any cases pending with the  Judicial Branch, I will not get involved in that," he added.    Those in exile include Chiari, who is accused of freedom of  speech violations; banker Rafael Arosemena, accused of  embezzling $6.7 million from the National Bank of Panama; and  various military officers accused of murder and various crimes  against the state.    The Democratic Revolutionary Party has said most people  still  in exile are being persecuted by the Endara administration.    Endara denies this, however, by saying, "I have sent no one  into exile," as was done by the dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega,  who was sentenced to 40 years in the United States for drug  trafficking.</p>

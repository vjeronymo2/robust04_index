			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Peru seeks buyer for mining group THE PERUVIAN government officially announced yesterday that it was soliciting offers for up to 100 per cent of its holding in Centromin, the country's largest state-owned mining concern. Chase Manhattan is handling the promotion. An information memorandum is available to prospective purchasers on signature of a letter agreeing to respect confidentiality. Centromin owns and operates seven production units, all located in the high central Andes. The company was formed in 1974 after the expropriation by the then military government of the mines and La Oroya metallurgical complex previously owned by the Cerro de Pasco Corporation of the US. The La Oroya complex, one of the world's largest, produces five main refined metals - copper, zinc, lead, silver and gold - as well as 17 by-products such as arsenic, antimony and sulphuric acid. Last year's sales topped Dollars 400m and more than 70 per cent of output was exported. Centromin has been badly decapitalised over the years, although recent management changes have resulted in greater efficiency. But huge investment will be required from the new owner, not least in urgent environmental improvements at La Oroya. Although no official announcement has yet been made, the government is believed to favour selling the operation as a whole.</p>

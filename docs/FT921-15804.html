			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME turnover up 25% in 1991 THE LONDON Metal Exchange, the world's largest terminal market for physical metal, increased turnover by 25 per cent last year compared with 1990. Its financial strength enabled the exchange to return some contract levy money to members. Mr Martin Abbott, the LME's director of marketing, said yesterday the results showed 'growing metals industry confidence' in the LME and that its services were valued just as much in recessionary times as when prices were rising. The strength of the increase in metals markets turnover, from 12.62m to 15.84m lots, showed there was an underlying real increase in physical business as well as that which came in recessionary times from traders rolling over stock in LME warehouses, he pointed out. Mr Abbott said that booming LME business did not necessarily mean that its members were doing well. Their commission incomes were based on the gross value of contracts, so they suffered when metals prices were low - as they have been for the past year. The LME gave back to members 40 per cent of the money paid to the exchange in contract levies during the first nine months of 1991. Mr Abbott said the LME's cash reserves were high enough to meet statutory requirements 'and there is no particular reason that the market should declare a profit and pay taxes on it. It makes more sense to push the money back to the members so that they can pay the tax'. Of the six metals traded on the LME, only tin, the most recently-introduced contract, showed a fall in turnover last year. Turnover fell by 0.5 per cent from 361,196 lots (of five tonnes each) to 359,436 lots. Zinc showed the biggest gain, up 39 per cent from 1.42m lots (of 25 tonnes each) to 1.93m, followed by aluminium, up 34 per cent from 3.99m lots (of 25 tonnes each) to 5.34m. Turnover of the LME's 'flagship' contract, copper, was up 20 per cent, from 5.67m lots (of 25 tonnes) to 6.8m. Lead turnover improved by 15 per cent, from 610,351 lots (of 25 tonnes) to 703,944 while nickel was up by 25 per cent, from 572,970 lots (of six tonnes each) to 715,555. Trading volume on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange for Industry reached a record 14,949,199 lots last year, surpassing the previous high of 14,839,666 set in 1990, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The cumulative volume of platinum futures in 1991 reached 5,403,596 lots, up 65.3 per cent from 1990, and silver futures rose 109.7 per cent to 1,057,598. Volume of gold futures, meanwhile, totalled 4,567,630 lots, down 33.5 per cent. Trading of rubber futures totalled 2,167,293 lots, down 6.2 per cent, and wool futures reached 145,854, more than seven times higher than the previous year. 'The Tocom's precious metal complex showed wild volatility last year, in the face of market-moving news such as the Gulf War in January and the coup attempt in the former Soviet Union in August,' an exchange official said. 'Platinum futures, in particular, attracted panic selling from local investors in May, following the report that Nissan had developed a platinum-free auto catalyst. 'These motivated local investors and trade houses to trade actively.'  ----------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  ----------------------------- (As at Monday's close) tonnes Aluminium  +5,400 to 1,014,350 Copper     +2,700 to   335,025 Lead          +25 to   126,375 Nickel     +1,488 to    13,338 Zinc       +2,125 to   156,175 Tin           -15 to    13,655  -----------------------------</p>

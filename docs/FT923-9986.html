			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Arts: A ragbag of riches for the Beaubourg's birthday - Alice Rawsthorn tackles an ambitious, multi-layered exhibition to celebrate 15 years of the Pompidou Centre in Paris 'HEY, it's Zoo TV,' said the teenage tourist on spotting the arch of video screens piled on top of each other at the entrance to the top floor of the Manifeste exhibition at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris. He was both right and wrong. Wrong, because the video arch is not a relic from this summer's Zoo TV rock tour by U2, the Irish rock band, but a video installation made in 1985 by Nam June Paik, the South Korean artist. But he was right in that Paik was undoubtedly an important influence over the video artists working on the U2 tour, and Manifeste is all about tracing links between different strands in modern art. If Nam June Paik's ideas began in an art gallery and ended up on a rock stage - so be it. Manifeste commemorates the 15th birthday of Beaubourg, as the Pompidou centre is usually called. It is intended to be both a retrospective of the art collected by the centre since its opening and a statement of intent for the future from Dominique Bozo, who became Beaubourg's president last autumn. The show's logistics are exhausting. Manifeste, which runs throughout the summer, acts out Beaubourg's dual roles as France's national museum of modern art and its centre of industrial creation. The exhibition encompasses architecture, design, video and photography, painting and sculpture, in a show stretching over 7,000 square metres on six floors. One of Manifeste's main aims is to introduce Beaubourg's new architecture collection. The curators have sensibly steered clear of trying to present a thorough overview of contemporary architecture and have instead concentrated on specific subjects, such as the sculptural work of Frank Gehry and Aldo Rossi, and the new emphasis on modern materials pursued by the younger architects, Rem Koolhaus and Jean Nouvel. The results are erratic. The intricate models for Toyo Ito's Tower of Winds at Yokohama and his Silver Hut in Tokyo are stunning. The presentation of Jean Nouvel's new tower at the La Defense business district to the west of Paris really succeeds in conveying a sense of what the tower, which will be the tallest in the world, with an opaque black base and transparent top, will look like when it is built. Other exhibits, particularly the tatty cardboard mock-up of Frank Gehry's American cultural centre in Paris, are too slight to say anything significant about the architects, or their work. The curators have made an honourable attempt to explain why particular architects, or buildings, were selected. Sir Norman Foster's Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Bank headquarters is singled out for the complexity of its construction and Ito's municipal museum at Yatsushiro for what it says about his ideas on museology. But the exhibition fails to address the central issue of how to show buildings in a museum context. It adopts the conventional approach of displaying buildings in model form, sometimes backed up by sketches. The limitations of architectural models are all too apparent, notably in the model of Richard Rogers and Renzo Piano's design for Beaubourg itself, which makes the Pompidou centre look like a serene study in white plastic, not the bright, bustling building housing the show. The same criticism can be levelled against the design section. Design, like architecture, is notoriously difficult to exhibit. Manifeste rounds up the usual suspects for a whistlestop tour of modern product design, running from Joe Columbo and his fellow futurists in the 1960s, to the post-modernist puns of Philippe Starck in the 1980s. Their work is displayed on pristine white plinths, along the lines pioneered by the Museum of Modern Art's design department in New York and since faithfully imitated by most other design exhibitions. The problem with this approach is that it gives little or no idea of the context in which the design was developed, or of how it was used. In a crowded show like Manifeste, where there is only enough space for a limited selection of each designers' output, it leaves no room to consider how a particular piece relates to the rest of the designers' work, or its influence on other designers. Manifeste is most successful with design when it abandons the conventions and adopts a more playful approach. The design section is spread across two floors. Some exhibits on the lower floor are encased by walls and are only visible through overhead shafts on the upper floor and slim vertical slits running down the walls below. From the top the exhibits look bewilderingly abstract. A polyurethane library by Gaetano Pesce, the experimental Italian designer, resembles a volcanic overspill; a red plastic table designed by Annie Tribel for a Paris cafe looks like a minimalist sculpture. Then there is a delicious sense of the illicit when you see them at a normal angle through the slits. Design and architecture apart, Manifeste is chiefly concerned with painting, sculpture, video art and installations. Beaubourg's permanent collection of modern art until 1960 has been kept intact on the fourth floor, the core of the show is its selection of work from the last three decades. Dominique Bozo is adamant that Manifeste is not an attempt to present Beaubourg's definitive statement on art since 1960, but an idiosyncratic selection from its collection. The problem with this is that it makes it difficult for the show to seem like anything other than a motley assortment of important, and not so important, work from the 1960s to the present day. Manifeste works best when bodies of work are gathered together in logical groupings within which the work of one artist relates to that of the rest. The most successful section is that devoted to the Arte povera and Antiform movements on the mezzanine floor. The juxtaposition of naturalistic pieces, Richard Long's Cornish slate stone circle and Jannis Kounellis' raw wool on wooden poles, with Mario Merz's neon-encrusted 'igloo' of earth-filled sacks works wonderfully under the ducts and piping that criss-cross the industrial interior of the Pompidou centre. Similarly, the Fluxus is successful because the main installations - Plight, a series of rooms swathed in thick rolls of felt by Joseph Beuys, and Moon is the Oldest TV, another video sculpture by Nam June Paik - are so strong that they grab the visitors' attention. The rest of the show is so vast and so varied that it is difficult to do anything other than focus on the few really stunning pieces - a beautiful Baselitz oil on the top floor, a nearby wall sculpture of metal boxes by Christian Boltanksi, Marcel Broodthaers' room installation or the space allocated to the German painters, Sigmar Polke and Gerhard Richter - while zapping past the others. Manifeste is too crowded and confusing to achieve Dominique Bozo's aim of being a testimony to Beaubourg's past and a pointer to its future. It is really a ragbag of art - some good, some bad, much of it indifferent. But there are enough good pieces to make it worth while taking a deep breath and scouring the six floors of Centre Georges Pompidou to stride past the dross and seek out the very best of the Beaubourg collection. Manifeste is showing at the Centre Georges Pompidou, rue Rambuteau, 75003 Paris, until the autumn. Open weekdays 12pm to 10pm and weekends 10am to 10pm. Closed Tuesdays.</p>

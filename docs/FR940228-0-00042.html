			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Effective Dates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final rules become effective April 29, 1994. This will provide sufficient time for all government securities brokers and dealers to become acquainted with the new requirements and to implement operating procedures. Additionally, the lead time will enable the PSA to finalize and distribute buy-in procedures it is developing for the industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In its comment letter, the PSA requested that the Treasury's buy-in rules be enacted contemporaneously with the Commission's amendments to Rule 15c3&hyph;3(d)(2) and (m). Since Treasury's rules apply to all government securities brokers and dealers, and given the Department's understanding that the buy-in rules to be proposed by the Commission will conform to those adopted herein, the Department believes that there is no compelling reason to defer implementation until the Commission acts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Special Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department has determined that this action does not constitute a ``significant regulatory action'' for the purposes of Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Accordingly, it was not subject to review under the Executive Order by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the preamble to the proposed rules, the Department certified that these amendments would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared. In reviewing the final rules being adopted herein and after considering the comments received on the proposed rules, the Department has concluded that there is no reason to alter the previous certification that these rules will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since these final rules contain no new collections of information, the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) are inapplicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 17 CFR Part 403  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Banks, Banking, Brokers, Government securities.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set out in the Preamble, 17 CFR part 403 is amended to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 403_PROTECTION OF CUSTOMER SECURITIES AND BALANCES  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

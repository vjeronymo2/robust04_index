			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei dips ahead of holiday as Kuala Lumpur climbs Arbitrage selling and position adjustment by dealers ahead of the Golden Week holidays depressed share prices, and the Nikkei index gave up 1.3 per cent, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225 average fell 255.25 to 19,709.14 after a high of 19,921.48 and a low of 19,628.33. A fall in the futures market prompted selling by arbitrageurs, while foreign investors were also seen liquidating large capital stocks. The strengthening of the yen to the Y102 level also unnerved investors. The currency closed up Y0.72 to Y103.05 in spite of selling intervention by the Bank of Japan. 'Many people are afraid of the yen and another cold summer hampering the expected economic recovery,' said Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities. Some market participants said they would adjust positions ahead of the US GDP figures on Thursday. 'A rise in GDP could lead to a further rise in interest rates and a fall on the New York stock market,' said a dealer. Volume totalled 250m shares against 307m as most investors remained on the sidelines, and traders said that 20 per cent of the volume was linked to technical activity. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 1.37 to 1,604.43, and the Nikkei 300 fell 2.31 to 293.32. Losers outpaced winners by 702 to 310 with 171 unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.36 to 1,311.11. Financial stocks were lower on index-linked selling. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank fell Y40 to Y1,900 and Bank of Tokyo lost Y20 to Y1,570. Nomura Securities lost Y50 to Y2,260. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the benchmark stock for investor confidence, fell Y9,000 to Y888,000 and East Japan Railway declined Y2,000 to Y483,000. Profit taking depressed petroleum stocks. Showa Shell Sekiyu fell Y60 to Y1,370 and Tonen lost Y20 to Y1,540. Speculative favourites were higher on buying by individual investors, Sumitomo Coal Mining rising Y14 to Y965 and Ishihara Sangyo by Y9 to Y440. Retailers were bought on hopes of a consumption-led economic recovery. Takashimaya rose Y20 to Y1,360 and Marui gained Y40 to Y1,680. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 122.53 to 22,029.50 in volume of 16m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, fell Y120 to Y6,520 on profit-taking by overseas investors. Roundup Some strong performances were seen in the Pacific Rim while other markets were lacklustre. Australia, New Zealand and Colombo were closed for public holidays. KUALA LUMPUR picked up 2 per cent as investors, demonstrating increasing confidence, bought blue-chip stocks. The composite index added 20.65 to 1,059.52. SINGAPORE was higher, supported by institutional demand for several blue chips, but trading volume was still light. The Straits Times Industrials index closed 42.23 or 1.9 per cent higher at 2,307.82. TAIWAN rose 1.4 per cent in heavy trade led by steels, papers and plastics, but some heavy profit-taking was awaited as a prelude to any sustained advance. The weighted index rose 81.22 to 5,918.55 in heavy turnover of TDollars 73.22bn. MANILA overcame a hesitant start, heartened by the strong performance of the San Miguel and Manila Electric (Meralco) issues, and the composite index climbed 50.24 or 1.8 per cent to 2,838.40. Volume dipped to 1.51bn shares from Friday's 1.94bn. San Miguel A and Meralco B shares each rose around 4 per cent to 169 pesos and 515 pesos respectively. PLDT added 25 pesos to at 1,765 pesos. SEOUL saw profit-taking in blue chips wipe out early gains, and the composite index, 8 points higher at one stage, ended 0.03 lower at 892.70. HONG KONG closed easier but a late round of bargain hunting trimmed losses after a sluggish day's trade. The Hang Seng index lost 20.74 at 9,136.11 after a low of 9,068.26. Turnover was down to an indicated HKDollars 2.95bn against Friday's HKDollars 5.63bn. KARACHI was marked 1.8 per cent lower amid selling pressure from short-term investors on settlement day.

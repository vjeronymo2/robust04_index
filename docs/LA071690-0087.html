			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY: CONSUMER NEWS  </P> <P> K mart Recalls Reflectors: The big retailer said tests by it and the National  Highway Traffic Safety Administration show that several types of  "mini-self-adhesive reflectors" it sold do not meet federal performance  requirements for reflectiveness. So the chain is recalling reflectors with  model Nos. 82-12-91, 92, 98 and 99, and Nos. 82-21-44, 47, 49 and 48. K mart is  offering a full refund.  </P></p>

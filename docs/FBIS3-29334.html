SANKEI SHIMBUN has interviewed former DPRK Army  Captain Shin Chung-chol about Kim Pyong-il, who is a half  brother of [Workers Party of Korea] Secretary Kim Chong-il and  is rumored to be feuding with the latter. Mr. Shin Chung-chol  graduated from the same class of the Kim Il-song Military  Integrated College as did Kim Pyong-il, who is former DPRK  ambassador to Bulgaria. Mr. Shin Chung-chol, 46, is now serving  with the South Korean Army with the rank of colonel.    Mr. Shin defected to South Korea in 1983 across the  North-South demilitarized zone. He is said to have lived  together with Kim Pyong-il at the No. 6 Building of the Kim  Il-song Military Integrated College for about four years from  1978 to 1982. In the interview, Mr. Shin made disclosures about  Kim Pyong-il, who is shrouded in mystery.    According to Mr. Shin Chung-chol, Kim Pyong-il was born in  1952 and is four years younger than Shin. Kim Pyong-il is 10  years younger than his half brother, Secretary Kim Chong-il.  Kim Pyong-il served in the General Security Bureau as battalion  commander with the rank of major before be was enrolled in the  Kim Il-song Military Integrated College. At the college, Mr.  Shin studied at the Reconnaissance Studies Department, while Kim  Pyong-il studied at the Infantry Studies Department. They had  frequent contacts because they were members of the same  graduating class and lived in the same boardinghouse. Kim  Pyong-il was an avid table tennis player, and they played ping  pong from time to time.    Unlike Secretary Kim Chong-il, who is short and stocky, Kim  Pyong-il is a handsome man who is 180 cm tall and who weighs 80  kg. His colleagues knew that he was the second son of President  Kim Il-song. Kim Pyong-il was a man of forthright character.  He was humorous and very popular among his colleagues at the  college.    Kim Pyong-il, who studied in the Soviet Union and in East  European nations, is said to speak six foreign languages. He  did well at the college and excelled in the "duty inspection"  component, a war game exercise, which was a graduation  examination at the college. At the college, Kim Pyong-il once  revealed to Mr. Shin that President Kim Il-song said to him when  he was in junior high school, "I hope you will become a  distinguished senior military officer when you grow up."    According to Mr. Shin, Kim Pyong-il spoke highly of his  older  brother Secretary Kim Chong-il, saying, "He is a man of high  caliber and is dutiful to his father." In this way, Kim  Pyong-il neither spoke ill of his older brother Secretary Kim  Chong-il nor referred to any feud with his older brother.    Commenting on reports that Kim Pyong-il is feuding with  Secretary Kim Chong-il, Mr. Shin said: "In my opinion, the  reports are exaggerated. Kim Pyong-il will not succeed his  father as president unless an accident happens to Secretary Kim  Chong-il."    According to Mr. Shin, President Kim Il-song may envision  that Secretary Kim Chong-il will succeed him as president and  Kim Pyong-il will support Secretary Kim Chong-il as a senior  military officer.    There is information that Kim Pyong-il would be appointed as  North Korean ambassador to Finland, and Mr. Shin indicated that  Kim Pyong-il will return to the military after serving as a  diplomat for the time being.    It has become a practice for Secretary Kim Chong-il to  attend  the Kim Il-song Military Integrated College's commencement  ceremony and to hold discussions with students. In describing  his impression of Secretary Kim Chong-il at the time, Mr. Shin  said: His character was rash and capricious in view of his  behavior and talking. I thought that he was a little bit  frivolous as a leader of a nation. However, the contents of his  address and explanations to the students were perfect, and I  thought that he was very smart.    In the interview, Mr. Shin said that at the college, he  attended a lecture on the "offensive by the army corps with  nuclear attacks" in the tactics course of the college. Mr. Shin  added that the lecture was given in anticipation of North  Korea's nuclear attacks against enemies. In pointing out that  such a lecture was already being given at the DPRK's senior  military officer schools around 1980, Mr. Shin stated, "I  believe there is no doubt that North Korea has already developed  nuclear weapons."</p>

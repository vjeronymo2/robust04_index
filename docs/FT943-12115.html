			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Pupil-teacher ratio rises again The pupil-teacher ratio in English schools has risen for the fifth year in succession, John Willman writes. Provisional figures released yesterday by the Department for Education show that there were 18.1 pupils for each teacher in nursery, primary and secondary schools in January, up from 17.8 a year earlier. In primary schools, the pupil-teacher ratio rose from 22.4 to 22.7. The ratio increased from 16.2 to 16.4 in secondary schools (excluding sixth-form colleges). During the past year the number of school children has increased by 2 per cent. The full-time equivalent number of teachers in such schools has risen by just 0.3 per cent.</p>

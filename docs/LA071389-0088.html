			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> An Illinois woman pleaded innocent to murder charges in her 6-week-old  daughter's suffocation death nearly three years after her first baby girl died  under almost identical circumstances. Circuit Judge Edward Ferguson told Paula  Sims she could be sentenced to death if convicted of two first-degree murder  charges in the death of daughter Heather Lee, whose body was found in a trash  can May 3. Sims, 30, told authorities that masked gunmen abducted Heather and  13-day-old Loralei Marie, who died in 1986. Sims has already been accused of  hiding the babies' deaths and lying to investigators.  </P></p>

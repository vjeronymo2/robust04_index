			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: DSM's profits halved to Fl 224m DSM, the Dutch chemicals group, is to halve its 1992 dividend after suffering a 57 per cent fall in net profit last year. The company cautioned that results in the first half of 1993 would be lower than in the same period of last year. But it said it could make no prediction for the whole year. In 1992, net profit plummetted to Fl 224m (Dollars 121m), from Fl 516m a year earlier. Operating profit dropped by 55 per cent to Fl 282m. The dividend is to be cut to Fl 4 from Fl 8 - the first reduction since the company was floated by the Dutch state on the Amsterdam stock exchange in 1989. Turnover was down 5 per cent at Fl 8.9bn. Higher-volume sales and the positive effect of acquisitions were more than outweighed by an average 9 per cent decline in sale prices and by adverse currency movements. DSM's biggest business, hydrocarbons and polymers, reversed into a operating loss of Fl 53m last year, from a profit of Fl 68m in 1991. The company blamed the downturn on worldwide overcapacity as well as increasing competition in Europe from producers in the US and eastern Europe. DSM was hampered by the rise of the guilder after the devaluation of a number of European currencies. Cheaper east European imports undermined DSM's performance in base chemicals, especially in caprolactum, a feedstock for nylon and other fibres. Overall, the base and fine chemicals sector saw a 70 per cent decline in profit to Fl 80m. In resins and plastic products, sale prices were hit by reduced activity in the automotive and construction industries. Operating profit in the sector fell by more than one third to Fl 71m from Fl 111m. Mr Hans van Liemt, DSM's chairman, said that, although DSM had benefited from stable energy prices in 1992, all other factors, such as supply and demand for chemical products and currency movements, had worked against the company last year. The company would continue to work on its strategy of reducing its high sensitivity to the business cycle, partly by readjusting its product portfolio, he said. Mr Simon de Bree, a board member who is due to succeed Mr van Liemt on June 30, cited fine chemicals such as aspartame, the artificial sweetener, as a promising field with low cyclicality. 'In 1992, both margins and volumes for these activities were unaffected by the economic cycle,' he said.</p>

			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES  </P> <P> Hoskins flashback: "Pennies from Heaven," the critically admired 1977-78 BBC  miniseries in which he starred, will air on KCET in July. The series -- which  contrasts the bright and cheery songs and dances of the Depression era with the  grim life of a sheet music salesman -- will air July 23, 24 and 26. Two  episodes (running 75 minutes each) will air each night, from 9 to 11:30 p.m.  </P> <P> This is the program that inspired the 1981 Steve Martin feature film. Many  reviewers liked the movie (which bombed commercially), but were near-unanimous  in proclaiming the earlier Hoskins series superior. Pat H. Broeske  </P></p>

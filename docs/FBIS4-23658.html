			<p>BFN     [Text] In Djibouti, official sources report that the  government and the FRUD [Front for Restoration of Unity and  Democracy] have agreed to end the fighting. That being said,  negotiations for the FRUD were led by Ougoureh Kifle, whose  legitimacy as secretary general of the movement is strongly  disputed by many, and particularly by Ahmed Dini, the FRUD  leader.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Certain European countries condition Ukraine's  signing of the Treaty on Partnership and Cooperation with the  European Union with ratification of the Treaty on  Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons by the Ukrainian  parliament. This was said by Ukrainian Foreign Minister  Anatoliy Zlenko at a press conference in Kiev today.    Zlenko said he had heard this "disturbing note" during his  talks with Deputy Chairman of the EU [European Union]  Commission, the European Commissions Commissioner for Foreign  Economy Leon Britten which had finished in Kiev today.    "We do not yet know the names of these states, however such  an approach is unacceptable for us," Zlenko emphasized. He  stressed that Ukraine was carrying out the trilateral statement  on nuclear disarmament made by the U.S., Russian and Ukrainian  presidents. He added that the Ukrainian leadership was doing  everything possible in order to join the treaty on  non-proliferation.    Zlenko suggested that the conditioning of the treaty on  cooperation with that on non-proliferation could create a  "dangerous precedent." He said this could be in the interests  of forces trying to put Ukraine in a difficult situation from  the point of view of international public opinion.    Britten stated that the EU leaders had never sought to  establish an inter-dependence between the two documents and  urged the countries which had put forward such a condition to  disassociate themselves from it. However, Britten called on the  Ukrainian leadership to speed up ratification of the Treaty on  Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.    Britten said that the EU would consider possible assistance  to Ukraine with construction of two energy blocks on two nuclear  power stations, which would help Ukraine with energy supply and  put the Chernobyl nuclear power station out of utilization.    Britten told INTERFAX-Ukraine that the amount of aid had not  as yet been defined and would depend on what aid the world  community would be able to give to Ukraine. He added that the  issue on the Chernobyl nuclear power station would be discussed  at the G-7 meeting this summer.    Britten also announced that a Treaty on Partnership and  Cooperation between the EU and Russia had been worked out. It  would be submitted to the EU leading bodies in the near future.</p>

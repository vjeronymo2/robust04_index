			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, February 18 (TASS) -- Russian power plants  are living through hard times: They experience a severe  shortage of fuel. Power plant managers are unable to settle  accounts with suppliers due to a shortage of funds, high prices  for coal, gas and mazout as well as neck-breaking tariffs for  their transportation.    Especially hard hit are power plants in the Russian Far  East,  Sakhalin Island and the Kamchatka peninsula as well as in  Karelia and the Arkhangelsk region where fuel supplies were  drastically cut.    Electric power plants in the Far East daily received 46,000  tons of coal this month, instead of planned 66,000 tons. As a  result, fuel stocks at the plants dwindled down nearly by a  third.    A paradoxical situation has developed: While warehouses of  siberian suppliers are overstocked with fuel, power stations  experience shortages. But non-payment by electricity consumers  prevent stations from paying for fuel.    The Russian Joint Stock Society of Energy and Electification  alone owes over 1,200 billion roubles. Incidentally, the figure  is constantly growing. A chain reaction has emerged, as it  were: tower plants owe money to coal miners and oilmen. In  turn, they are in debt to railwaymen and machine-builders.    Several railways sharply cut coal deliveries due to  non-payments. Many specialists see the way out of the present  situation in switching to payment of transport tariffs by power  plants themselves through mutual settlements.    If the situation with fuel supplies to power stations does  not change in the near future, consumers, especially in the Far  East and north-west, will inevitably experience further cuts in  heat and electricity supplies.    To avoid such a situation, it is necessary to boost coal and  mazout supplies by the end of February and in March.</p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Gt Portland Estates declines 4% to Pounds 16m GREAT PORTLAND Estates, which in the summer raised Pounds 95m through a rights issue, reported a fall of just over 4 per cent in pre-tax profits for the six months to the end of September. The group, the sixth largest UK property company, made Pounds 16m, down from a previous Pounds 16.7m. The dilutive effect of the rights issue and a higher tax charge pushed earnings per share down to 4.3p compared with 5.6p. Acquisitions to the value of about Pounds 65m have been made since the rights issue, including shopping centres in Harlow and Torquay, a Reading office building, and retail property in Ilford and Sheffield. In a full year these would add Pounds 6m of income, the directors said, adding that most of the leases had at least 15 years to run. Mr Richard Peskin, chairman, said the purchases reflected the board's policy of expanding and diversifying the company's assets and ensuring 'an extended period of secure income'. Further acquisitions worth up to Pounds 20m were expected soon. He described the result as 'closely comparable' to last year's first half. The interim dividend has been cut from 3.3p to 2.7p and Mr Peskin expects the full-year divi-dend to be 8p (10p) as fore-cast in his statement last June. The group said that a recent revaluation of 20 per cent of its portfolio, including most of its core property in the City, had shown an increase of 7 per cent since March. However, the group warned that this was not necessarily a reflection of the whole portfolio. Net rental income edged ahead to Pounds 40.13m (Pounds 40m). Mr Peskin said that rents remained under pressure, particularly in London, but there had been encouraging signs of a revival in interest. About 5 per cent of the group's portfolio remains void in terms of both rent roll and total area, down from 6 per cent at the end of June.</p>

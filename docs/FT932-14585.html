			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Travel: Ho-ho, Ho Chi Minh - Nicholas Woodsworth travels out-of-season to the Vietnamese capital HANOI, for me, begins on the back of a motorcycle some 1,200 kms to the south, in the early-morning streets of Saigon. Sitting behind Mr Ha, I have my baggage slung across my back and my heart in my throat. Mr Ha runs the tiniest of businesses from a narrow ground-floor hallway in central Saigon; he owns half-a-dozen bicycles and rents them out to tourists. But he is such a kind man that when I asked him about taxi transport to Tan Son Nhut airport for a dawn flight to Hanoi, he insisted on taking me himself. No problem at all, he indicates with sign language and the few English words he knows; he has a motorcycle. Mr Ha's mime of revving a motorcycle engine is not the most convincing, for he has only one arm. But his offer is so kind I take it anyway. Does one ask for a sign-language explanation of such a misfortune in the middle of Saigon's anarchic traffic? One does not. One simply holds on and prays. But over coffee at the airport Mr Ha demonstrates how he lost his arm. Using his stump to hold down a piece of paper, he draws row after row of stippled lines with a pen, and makes deep rumbling noises in his throat. 'Me Hanoi VC. Viet Cong.' He giggles, apologetically, as if the whole thing were some mild and amusing embarrassment, a fault of his own. In 1971, a 20-year-old recruit with the army of North Vietnam, he was hit by shrapnel in one of the United States' countless B-52 carpet bombings of Hanoi. It is one of the sadder introductions I have had to a city. Not so sad are Massimo and Sandro, whom I meet aboard a Vietnamese Airlines Tupelov bound for the capital. They are Milanese freelance photo-journalists, collecting stories and pictures to sell to some of Italy's more lurid colour magazines. They have just claimed an Italian scoop for their coverage of the Miss Saigon beauty contest. They are on their way north to interview General Giap, military mastermind of colonial France's defeat in Indochina and second only to Ho Chi Minh himself in the pantheon of modern Vietnamese heroes. Today Giap is an old man and no longer a central committee member but, none the less, difficult to see. How was that arranged, I ask, full of admiration. I have found even simple administrative procedures here maddeningly complicated. It was nothing, they say with only the tiniest shrug of Latin bravado, simply a short call to the ministry of information. The countryside as we approach Hanoi reminds Massimo and Sandro of the north Italian plain in winter. In February the table-flat surface of the Red River delta is chilly, grey and wet. Fresh from the colour and sunlight, the sensual distractions of the south, the Italians are already finding Hanoi depressing. As we land they are once again discussing Miss Saigon's legs. We install ourselves in the Gold Hotel in the centre of Hanoi. Like the rash of new hotels that have sprung up in the last year or two, it tries to cater to the tastes of Hanoi's growing number of foreign visitors. Homesick, Massimo tries the spaghetti bolognaise. His eyeballs roll upwards with the first fork-full - Hanoi, he reports to the maitre d' who hovers anxiously behind him, still has some way to go in matters of western cuisine. The maitre d' apologises profusely: he is not familiar with Italian food. In fact, he is not professionally familiar with food at all. He is a plastic surgeon who has taken a second job to make ends meet. Things are difficult these days in Hanoi, he tells us. How much does he make at the hospital where he works, we ask. About Dollars 11 a month, he replies. We stop complaining about the food. In the afternoon we go for a walk. For anyone arriving from the bright tropical bustle of Saigon, Hanoi in February is a dismal place, drab, dour, dejected, dressed in funereal grey. This is the season marked by what French colonists called the crachin - spit  -and the Vietnamese in their own language more poetically refer to as 'rain dust.' When dry winter air sweeps southwards out of central Asia and meets humidity over the Gulf of Tonkin, a fine mist of suspended water particles descends upon the city for weeks at a time. It is cold, thin and cheerless. Outside, I can hardly believe that north and south Vietnam are two parts of the same country. Saigon's boulevards are lively and cheerful, a zingy blend of commercial hustle and outdoor social get-together. There is laughter, shouting, music from sidewalk speakers. For visitors there are inquiring glances, imprecations from cheeky children, ingenious sales pitches to buy watches or cauliflowers. There is contact on Saigon's streets, and foreigners get drawn into its life whether they want to or not. There is little contact on Hanoi's streets. Massimo, Sandro and I walk through the grey crachin beside the Hoan Kiem, a lake that lies in the city centre like a sheet of cold slate. Decades of hardship, sacrifice and autocratic rule seem to have left the people of Hanoi without much joy or ability to express it. There are no smiles, no hellos, no propositions commercial, salacious or otherwise. Hunched old men in glasses, dark raincoats and berets drift by us, the last of a colonial generation. Younger generations seem hardly more cheerful - in browns and greys and olive drabs, in khaki pith helmets and worn-out military surplus wear they go their sombre way. Hanoi's people seem no more high-spirited indoors than out. In a cafe so cold that its patrons wear their Russian-style hats with the ear-flaps down, we sit in doleful silence. Attempts at conversation bring the shortest of answers. Even the dogs here are uncommunicative; in the market of the city's old quarter we watch a women with a large cleaver dismember a cooked, lacquered dog and set out its head as an advertisement. Massimo, still homesick, says it has the same eyes as his dog back home. The days pass, the interview with General Giap, to which the Italians have invited me, comes no closer. I suspect it never will. Over Hanoi hangs not just a mist but the heavy hand of a Confucian-style, by-the-book bureaucracy designed not to facilitate but to inhibit. I take myself off to see Ho Chi Minh. Since 1975, Ho has resided in a grey marble and granite building not far from Hanoi's military Citadel. He seems to be as popular in death as he was in life. Every day fleets of buses make their way past magnificent colonial villas to deposit school-children, factory workers and village peasants at the mausoleum of the man who did away with French Indochina. No photography, no shorts, no hats on heads, no hands in pockets, no irreverence. These are the rules that govern a pilgrimage to the glass sarcophagus deep in the bowels of the mausoleum. Shuffling slowly forward in an awe-struck queue, I gaze at Ho's famous wispy beard, his bald, liver-spotted pate. He is waxy-looking. In the past, Ho's thin, embalmed body has spent two months a year in Moscow undergoing maintainance. With Russian aid and personality cults things of the past, what will happen now? Far livelier is the small group of elderly men I meet every morning in a shabby cafe not far from the hotel. They are retired academics from Hanoi's universities. Mathematicians, physicists, literary lecturers, they spent their youth studying in France. Today they are back on the left bank once again, reviewing de Chardin, debating the philosophes, arguing for or against Gide. Why, I ask them? On their tiny pensions, they laugh, it is the only pleasure they can afford - just the price of a cup of coffee. For Dollars 4 apiece, Massimo, Sandro and I go to the VIP Club, just about the hottest - indeed, just about the only - night spot in town. After four decades of isolation, Hanoi is opening up to the outside world. Down the road, the Credit Lyonnais has opened an office. The Bank of America has announced its intention of doing the same. The Pullman Hotel group has renovated the Metropole, now the most elegant hotel in town. Not even the infamous 'Hanoi Hilton', the prison in which downed US pilots were kept during the war, is to be spared; soon it, too, will be converted. For foreigners, diplomats and for the government officials wealthy enough to use it, the VIP Club is a taste of another world. There are disco hits and strobe lights. There are sophisticated bar girls who drink Johnny Walker Black Label. There is one machine that produces clouds of vapour, another that spills out bubbles. Sandro dances, surprising party cadres with innovative Mediterranean gusto. For a while, even Massimo cheers up. It is all short-lived, though. The next morning, after a final phone call, the Giap bubble pops. As they pack their bags, they consider the bright lights of Manila, the charms of Jakarta, the lures of Bangkok. They consider just about anywhere, in fact, that will get them on an aircraft out. I take a train to Haiphong and that much reputed north Vietnamese wonder, Halong Bay. The countryside around Hanoi is as poor as any I have seen in Asia. I am not even sure I am on the right continent; from the rail line you can see mud huts as miserable as any in Africa. South-east Asia's technological revolution seems to have by-passed the Red River delta. In the port of Haiphong, I find a Moscvich communal taxi to take me on to Halong. Despite the lace curtains in the back window, it is old and ailing. Halfway there, we grind to a halt in a stretch of greasy mud. The driver crawls under the engine and bangs away. When he is finished we have everything but battery power and an ability to change out of third gear. We four passengers gather behind the car and push as fast as we can. It coughs into life and we throw ourselves in through the open doors. Ninety minutes, several villages and many startled chickens later, we arrive at Halong without having slowed down once. 'You must stay in Room 208 at the Halong Hotel 1', a French tour guide had drooled at me in Hanoi. 'Catherine Deneuve slept there, you know, when she filmed Indochine.' With or without Catherine Deneuve's bed (I end up in Room 106 at the Halong Hotel 2), I find the bay superb. From the town of Bai Chay I board a tour boat in a heavy drizzle. Slowly, as we head out over calm water, the crachin lifts and delicate bobbing sampans appear. A few minutes later, Halong's 3,000 green and sheer-sided islands, each a miniature alp, emerge from the mist. I am elated. This is as cheering as a chat with General Giap. I only wish Massimo and Sandro could be here. Miss Deneuve's is one north Vietnamese address they would have enjoyed. Worth knowing: Hanoi's cold and foggy winter is followed by the blue skies of spring: the best time to travel in the north is between April and October. Independent travel is possible in Vietnam and Royal Thai Airlines, Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines all fly to Saigon and Hanoi from London for between Pounds 600 and Pounds 750 return airfare. In London, visas, air travel, accommodation and car and driver can be organised by Vietnam Tourism, tel: 081-961-0117. A two-week tour, exclusive of airfare, costs about Pounds 1,000.</p>

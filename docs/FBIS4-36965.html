			<p>BFN     [Text] Police Minister Moshe Shahal has announced that  Palestinian women, regardless of age, and youths up to 16 years  old can enter Israel freely again. The move eased an entry ban  imposed on Palestinians from the territories following the wave  of bombings in early April. Shahal said he hoped the move would  lead to a return of normal life but this would depend on the  Palestinian side.    A Qol Yisra'el reporter adds that despite the closure of the  territories, police have been arresting several hundred  Palestinians weekly for illegal entry into Israel.</p>

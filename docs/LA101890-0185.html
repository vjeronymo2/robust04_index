			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: TEMPLE CITY;  </P> <P> INCREASE IN HOME SIZES  </P> <P> Property owners may now build larger two-story houses, the City Council decided  Tuesday.  </P> <P> The living area permitted in a two-story house may now equal 50% of the lot  size, or 2,500 square feet, whichever is greater.  </P> <P> Previously, the ratio of living area to lot size was 35%, Community Development  Director Robert Dawson said.  </P> <P> In a related action Tuesday, the council moved to reduce the bulky appearance  of apartments and condominiums by approving three changes in the Zoning Code.  </P> <P> Under the new rules, second floors will be limited to 75% of the area of first  floors; each condo or apartment unit must have at least 500 square feet of  landscaped area, and all units facing streets must have a front rather than  side appearance.  </P></p>

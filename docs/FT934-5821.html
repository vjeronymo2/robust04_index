			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / How to Spend it: Treasures galore at the ultimate cash and carry / Preview of the International Antiques Fair at Newark, which draws thousands of dealers and collectors eager for a bargain Next Saturday night hundreds of vans and trucks will roll on to a disused airfield in rural England in preparation for one of the last big sales of the year - the International Antiques Fair. Dealers from across Europe will have been arriving since dawn and the cavalcade is expected to continue throughout the weekend as container-loads of antiques converge on Newark in Nottinghamshire. Trucks will be marshalled into position on a runway where 50 years ago Polish pilots from 301 Squadron landed their bombers. Like those airmen, the dealers handle their cargo with care - antiques, like bombs, rarely survive breakages. Unwilling to leave the valuables unguarded, many of the drivers will sleep in their vehicles until trading begins on Monday. They arrive early because pole position can make the difference between clearing their stock and not selling a thing. Although the fair does not open officially until mid-morning on Monday, most dealers start selling by torchlight around dawn. All manner of antiques from fine china to poor reproductions are disgorged on to the runway as the the vehicles - lined up 10 abreast and stretching for more than 1,500 metres - are opened up. This, however, is only the queue for admission to the main selling area  - the adjacent Newark and Nottinghamshire agricultural showground. The organisers do not like this unofficial runway trade, but they admit that it is a price worth paying because if the airfield was unavailable the congestion would stretch for 16 miles. Among those queueing will be dealers from as far afield as Valencia, Bavaria and Naples. The reason is simple - turnover. Trade sales at the Newark International Antiques Fair outstrip all others. This is cash and carry on a grand scale. More than 70,000 people attend the two-day fairs, which are held every two months. They are attracted by the prospect of finding bargains among the wares of thousands of dealers who prefer to do business here rather than in the aggressive London markets. Newark has also been able to rely on a geographical location close to the antique heartlands of East Anglia and midway between London and York on the Great North Road. At the last fair in October dealers off-loaded antiques ranging from the sublime to the ridiculous. In one of the sprawling sheds normally reserved for livestock, a stallholder selling 18th century gold and silver took Pounds 25,000 in six hours. No cheques or credit cards were accepted on his 12ft trestle table. At another stall, an 1850 ormolu table with inlaid boulle work went for Pounds 725. 'It had lain around for a month without any interest, but went very quickly at the fair,' according to the dealer. Outside on the runway, a church spire was sold before the fair opened; nearby a collector haggled over scrap from a famous battleship. Ben Whittaker smiles at the memory of the spectacle. The young managing director of International Antiques and Collectors Fairs (IACF) knows a good business when he sees one. For him, the antiques trade is far removed from musty shops or lofty auction rooms. He believes it is fuelled by the international dealers who flock to Newark. 'We've captured a niche in the market. Before 1985 there were no big fairs, just regional sales or expensive London shows. We've changed all that.' The success of Newark has spawned other fairs and IACF now operates more than 20 around the UK every year. Earlier this year it attracted the attention of DMG exhibitions, a subsidiary of the Daily Mail &amp; General Trust and the organisers of the Ideal Home exhibition. After months of negotiation, the Whittaker family sold their controlling shares in IACF but retained management control of each event. The undisclosed deal has been estimated at Pounds 7m. DMG has got a bargain, according to Richard Roseman, a Massachussetts-based collector and regular Newark visitor. 'This is the world's best,' he says. 'In the US dealers trade off one another, so if you see something you like it often changes hands and goes up in price before your eyes. That doesn't happen here.' Roseman, a collector of glass figurines, is an ideal customer. 'The more I spend, the happier I am. There is no budget limit.' If he sees something expensive which takes his fancy, he can arrange the cash from an on-site bureau de change. Other overseas buyers come ready prepared. 'The Italians are back into furniture,' says one dealer with relish. Drivers from Milan and Rome park their articulated trucks in an international compound on one side of the fairground. There, they exchange nods and glances with rival buyers from France, the Netherlands, Spain and even truckers working for a South Carolina consortium. However, the Italians are the undisputed masters when it comes to serious buying around the stalls. They work in four-man squads armed with walkie-talkies. The buyer sees what he wants, radios the deal to his controller and, if agreed, a colleague counts out the cash. The other members then pack it up while the buyer moves on. These squads are setting market trends far beyond Newark. Christie's, the auction house, admits it watches what they are up to. Paul Barthaud, managing director of Christie's auction house in south Kensington, says: 'We always go to Newark. It's a good way of monitoring the market. If the Italians are back into dark furniture we tell our people in Rome, and it sometimes prompts us to develop new areas for auction sales.' Next weekend the Italians will begin arriving again. They will start on the runway, weaving between the makeshift stalls on Vespa scooters which they bring for the purpose. They know what to look for. Motley collections of old pub signs and buckets of cutlery are ignored. They head straight for the heavily carved furniture, the jewellery and the silver. 'They are investing in quality,' says Ben Whittaker. 'They know there is a market for a bit of nostalgia, a bit of class.'</p>

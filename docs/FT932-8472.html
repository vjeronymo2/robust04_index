			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Failed debt trader's assets short by Pounds 6m ASSETS OF London and Provincial Factors, the debt trading company that failed in February, fall short of its liabilities by Pounds 6.76m, according to documents to be formally presented to creditors today. Unsecured creditors cannot expect a dividend. They include some small businesses to which LPF had advanced some money against the full value of their invoices. The outstanding balances now belong to LPF and some businesses have experienced difficulties as result. The value of the assets shown in the company's books is Pounds 9.11m but estimates made by the directors suggest that realisations will total Pounds 4.58m. Mr Scott Barnes, one of the receivers, said: 'The ultimate realisations of assets will only become clear over the course of the next few months.' Figures for LPF's trading performance for the eight months to February show that on income of Pounds 1.5m the company had to make a Pounds 6m provision for clients' bad debts after some failed, although the debt may have been increased by the receivership. LPF made its money by lending to clients against their invoices. The Inland Revenue is investigating the circumstances of the collapse of two of LPF's clients. The Fraud Squad is believed to be considering related information. The directors' statement of affairs said the shortfall included Pounds 2.77m owed to clients on February 26. Gota Bank of Sweden stands to lose Pounds 3.6m of its Pounds 5m loan secured by a floating charge against the assets of the company. Any payment can only be made after settlement of Pounds 3.16m in secured loans made to LPF by four other banks. Receivers at accountants Grant Thornton will tell creditors today that agreement has been reached with 18 clients who have bought back their invoices by returning monies lent. One of the unsecured creditors is Mr Steve Mills, managing director of Leo Colour Printers (formerly Leo Lithographics). He said: 'This mess has cost me two of my best customers. I feel strongly that independent factors ought to be more tightly regulated.'</p>

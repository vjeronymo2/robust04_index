(i) Where respiratory protection is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required, the employer shall institute a respirator program in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with 29 CFR 1910.134(b), (d), (e), and (f).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The employer shall permit each employee who uses a filter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respirator to change the filter elements whenever an increase in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> breathing resistance is detected and shall maintain an adequate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supply of filter elements for this purpose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Employees who wear respirators shall, be permitted to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leave the regulated area to wash their faces and respirator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facepieces whenever necessary to prevent skin irritation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with respirator use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) No employee shall be assigned to tasks requiring the use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of respirators if, based upon his or her most recent examination,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an examining physician determines that the employee will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unable to function normally wearing a respirator, or that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety or health of the employee or other employees will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impaired by the use of a respirator. Such employee shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assigned to another job or given the opportunity to transfer to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different position whose duties he or she is able to perform with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the same employer, in the same geographical area and with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same seniority, status, and rate of pay the employee had just  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior to such transfer, if such a different position is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Respirator fit testing. (i) The employer shall ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the respirator issued to the employee exhibits the least  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible facepiece leakage and that the respirator is fitted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> properly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) For each employee wearing negative pressure respirators,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employers shall perform either quantitative or qualitative face  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fit tests at the time of initial fitting and at least every six  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> months thereafter. The qualitative fit tests may be used only for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing the fit of half-mask respirators where they are permitted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be worn, and shall be conducted in accordance with Appendix C  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this section. The tests shall be used to select facepieces  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that provide the required protection as prescribed in Table 1, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Protective work clothing and equipment_(1) Provision and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use. If an employee is exposed to asbestos above the TWA and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excursion limit, or where the possibility of eye irritation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exists, the employer shall provide at no cost to the employee and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure that the employee uses appropriate protective work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clothing and equipment such as, but not limited to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Coveralls or similar full-body work clothing;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Gloves, head coverings, and foot coverings; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Face shields, vented goggles, or other appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protective equipment which complies with 1910.133 of this Part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Removal and storage.

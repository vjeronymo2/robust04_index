			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Economic Cooperation Minister Leslaw </F> Podkanski, by Urszula Kujawska; place and date not given: "Forum  of Cooperation"]    [Excerpts] From 5 to 7 May, the Third East-West  Conference will be held in Warsaw; it will be a meeting of the  ministers of foreign economic cooperation, trade, and industry  of the seven richest states and 10 countries implementing  reforms (so-called G-7 and E-10). It is customary that such a  conference is held in the country that at the moment chairs the  G-7; however, this time the conference will be held in Poland.  It will be the first conference of the economic ministers of  the "seven" and states implementing reforms in a postsocialist  country. [passage omitted]    [Kujawska] Last year's balance of foreign trade ended up in  a deficit. What is your evaluation of this phenomenon?    [Podkanski] I believe that, at this point, we should  separate two issues: foreign trade and the evaluation of its  results, and the broadly understood transformations and social  costs related to them. As far as Poland is concerned, 1993 was  very unfavorable to the balance of foreign trade, which amounted  to $2.3 billion. There were many reasons for this, both  internal and external. The latter are related to the recession  in the world.    Right now, our economy needs capital and supply investments.    There is also the problem of fiscal instruments that would  regulate the economy in 1993. Until August 1993, the  exchange-rate policy favored imports rather than exports because  the rate of devaluation of the zloty was clearly slower than the  devaluation rate of the U.S. dollar or the German mark, and even  than the scale of inflation in Poland. Apart from all this,  there were various external issues, linked to the difficult  situation of most medium-sized and small companies and difficult  access to commercial and operating credits. Adding to these  problems was the issue of the so-called infrastructure of  exports--guarantees, guarantees of insurances, promotion. I  believe it is necessary to create a uniform, coherent, and clear  system of promotion, which we strive to establish.    These are also experiences we want to share with our  partners  of G-7 and E-10.    [Kujawska] What are the relations between Poland and its  southern neighbors, who are participants in this conference?    [Podkanski] I would like to stress strongly that, even  though the signature of the agreement on free trade within the  Visegrad Group last year did not yield any spectacular results  in the form of an increase in the trade volume, we can still  state with satisfaction that this agreement curbed the rate of  decrease in cooperation, including a commercial exchange, which  has been observed since 1991. This goes for both the exchange  of commodities and the disappearance of so-called investment and  cooperation links, which was a natural reaction at the moment of  passing to free-market settlements. I believe that today all of  the states will agree to pass to the free-market system, and  that the rules of the game of the free market should go hand in  hand with the ability to take advantage of the technical,  technological, and production potentials that are possessed.  They should also go hand in hand with the presentation of a  commodity offer that would take into account the balance of the  possibilities and needs of the markets of our neighbors. The  commodity exchange with our neighbors is favorable--for example,  because of lower transportation costs. This supports the  argument that we should first seek contact with our neighbors,  and only then across the ocean.    There is no doubt, however, that there are areas and  industry  branches that may find partners across the ocean as well--in  South America, in Brazil, for instance. Recently, in talks with  a delegation of this state, we found many very interesting  undertakings that may be very important to both states in the  future; one of them is the proposal made by Brazilian investors  concerning Polish transshipment ports--for example, for  Brazilian iron ore, which might be shipped from Polish ports to  the Visegrad Group states. Thus, in this way, we are trying to  facilitate the implementation of goals that G-7 and E-10 are  also trying to achieve.    [Kujawska] The conference is to serve all its participants  who, in practice, are partners with each other. What would you,  as the Polish foreign economic cooperation minister, like to  achieve during this meeting?    [Podkanski] I would like to achieve three goals. The first  one concerns full and genuine knowledge about the desires and  capabilities of our foreign partners as far as investing in  Poland is concerned. On the other hand, we would like to present  Poland, taking into account its geographic location, as a state  in which it is advisable and in which it pays to invest money.  I would also like our potential investors to see their chance  to participate in ownership transformations that are going on in  our country. Also, I would like them to see their chance in  linking their interests to Polish investors--for example, in the  privatization process. I also believe that the conference in  Warsaw will help the other E-10 states attain the same goals.    I also want to make our partners realize that the aim of  Polish privatization is changing not the owner but the economic  situation, reconstruction, and the modernization of Polish  industry. This is important because of the fact that the road to  membership in the European Union will be long and winding.  However, these are all inevitable processes.    A separate issue is a thorough and solid evaluation of trade  development prospects in Europe and the world, as well as  Poland's participation in the international division of labor  and in the trade turnover of the E-10 states; the evaluation  should also take into account the rules of the game laid out in  the Final Act of the Uruguay Round and the recently established  World Trade Organization. It is a matter of shaping new  principles and new rules, as well as a new system of world  trade. Such a meeting right now supplies the answer to any  doubts and questions concerning Poland's activeness in this  process and our joining the international structures. I would  like to be certain after this meeting that there is a joint  desire, a desire to cooperate, as well as to know where the  common interests are concentrated; I would also like to know  what the possibilities of providing systematic solutions to the  various problems are, through appropriate legal, organizational,  and financial solutions. There is no doubt that there are great  differences in the scale of development that has been  accomplished in individual states.    [Kujawska] The Warsaw conference is the third one. At each  of them, certain decisions were made. Have they been  implemented, and how have the interested states benefited from  them?    [Podkanski] It will be the third meeting. However, it cannot  be compared to any of the other meetings because each of them  was very special; each of them had different values and  contents, and, mainly, the range of problems was different. The  present conference is the richest as far as its form and  contents are concerned.    At the request of the Polish party, a meeting of the  presidents of foreign investment agencies of the E-10 states was  organized; it was held during the deputy ministerial session in  March of this year.    There will also be an East-West business forum and a  traditional "roundtable" for the ministers and business  representatives of each state. The earlier meetings were some  kind of inspiration and a proposal; the list of members and  participants is still being extended. At the Tokyo meeting, it  was decided that small and medium-size business in the E-10  states must be supported. After the meeting, the Japanese  Government allocated some money for the model restructurization  of one of the Polish state-run enterprises of the  machine-building industry. This is supposed to help work out a  model of proceedings that can be used in other countries. As I  see it, this is most valuable because it serves to shape the  awareness of those who are in power. Also, a model of  cooperation between countries as well as principles of providing  aid should be worked out. The Japanese Government is already  prepared to consider the possibility of granting interesting  credits to Poland--this is the information I received when Sejm  Speaker Jozef Oleksy returned from Japan. This would be, then,  a result of the previous visit. [passage omitted]</p>

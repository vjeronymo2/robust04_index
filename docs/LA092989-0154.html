			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HE DOESN'T KNOW ALL, BUT BO KNOWS BO;  </P> <P> IT'S THE TIME OF YEAR FOR JACKSON, AFTER A REST, TO CHANGE SEASONS  </P> <P> "Yo, Bo, smile," said a young fan aiming a camera at Bo Jackson as the Kansas  City Royals' outfielder emerged from the dugout before a game at Anaheim  Stadium.  </P> <P> A crowd gathered as Jackson stepped into the batting cage.  </P> <P> "Bo knows batting practice," a fan shouted, mimicking the "Bo knows . . . "  commercial as Jackson belted a pitch into the center-field bleachers.  </P> <P> As Jackson, America's most celebrated two-sport star, ran into the outfield to  throw, a crowd gathered along the left-field line. When he teased the fans,  pretending that he was about to toss a ball into the stands, hundreds of arms  rose as one to catch it.  </P> <P> Bo knows, all right. He knows how to work a crowd. Although it was a  meaningless game between teams out of the running at the end of the season, the  fans had come to see him. There were banners saluting him, one of which read:  "Bo Knows Ballet."  </P> <P> Now, Bo may not know how to dance "Swan Lake," but Bo knows baseball . . . and  football.  </P> <P> In his life as a Royal this season, he has hit 32 homers, driven in 105 runs  and stolen 26 bases.  </P> <P> Is this Jackson's best baseball season?  </P> <P> "I don't know," Jackson said. "That's for you all to decide."  </P> <P> And his life as a Raider?  </P> <P> After baseball season ends this weekend, Jackson plans to take a week off  before reporting for the rest of the National Football League season.  </P> <P> "I'm going to take my usual time that I've taken off for the past 2 1/2 years,"  Jackson said. "I'm going to take a week and then I'll report."  </P> <P> Is it difficult to make the transition from baseball to football?  </P> <P> "Nope," Jackson said. "It's what I've been doing all of my life. So it's easy  for me. Next question."  </P> <P> Raider Coach Mike Shanahan said he hoped Jackson would stop by Raider  headquarters in El Segundo and pick up a playbook. So, did Jackson plan to  visit the Raiders this trip?  </P> <P> "Why should I?" Jackson said. "I'll deal with the Raiders when I get there."  </P> <P> Has Jackson been following the Raiders?  </P> <P> "I don't get up every morning and go get the paper to see what the Raiders have  done," he said.  </P> <P> Does he think he can help revive the slow-starting Raiders, who have lost two  of three games?  </P> <P> "One man don't make a team," Jackson said. "I'm just one of the guys on the  team. Whatever I can do to help my team win, that's what I do. I don't try to  go out and do more than I'm capable of."  </P> <P> Although his TV commercials are for cross-training athletic shoes, Jackson said  he doesn't train for football by lifting weights or doing extra running.  </P> <P> "I stay in football shape by running during baseball," Jackson said. "I don't  have time to work out, because I play every day.  </P> <P> "I don't get tired. There is nothing physical about sports, it's all mental. If  you can handle it upstairs, the rest is easy. There is nothing physical about  what we do. You put it in your mind and go out and do it.  </P> <P> "After the first day (of football practice) my neck will be sore from the  hitting. But after that it feels like I've been out there for the whole  season."  </P> <P> Jackson said it's no problem for him to play football without training camp.  </P> <P> "The other guys say they wish that they could miss that hot camp and come in  and play," Jackson said. "I wouldn't say camp is a waste of time. The younger  guys need it to see what the NFL is all about. But the older guys . . . don't."  </P> <P> What does Bo think of Deion Sanders, who left the New York Yankees to play for  the Atlanta Falcons?  </P> <P> "I don't (think of Sanders)," Jackson said. "I have better things to do."  </P> <P> Is Jackson a better baseball or football player now. "I never knew I was that  bad," he said. "You get wiser after playing because you learn more about the  games and you learn what the opponents are doing to try to stop you."  </P> <P> Jackson has been bothered by minor injuries this season. He has pulled muscles  in his left leg.  </P> <P> "He's had a tough summer," Royal trainer Mickey Cobb said. "He had some leg  problems in the early summer and it's carried over to late summer, but he's  getting along real good."  </P> <P> So does playing football and baseball put too much stress on Jackson's body?  </P> <P> "We only have one person to gauge it on and that's Bo," Cobb said. "He seems to  enjoy (playing both games). But he may have an advantage because he doesn't  have to go through training camp and his body has not received the wear and  tear that football offers it.  </P> <P> "I suppose a person would wonder if he were in shape enough to play football.  All summer long he does a lot of running, and I would think he's not in too bad  a shape."  </P> <P> There have been reports that Jackson is trying to save himself for football by  curtailing his base-stealing.  </P> <P> What say you, Bo?  </P> <P> "Somebody told you a lie," Jackson said.  </P></p>

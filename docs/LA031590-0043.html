			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 5 REPUBLICANS SEEK LA FOLLETTE'S ASSEMBLY SEAT  </P> <P> Lured by one of the biggest temptations in politics -- a vacant seat -- five  Republicans have declared themselves candidates to replace retiring GOP  Assemblywoman Marian La Follette of Northridge.  </P> <P> La Follette, a five-term veteran, surprised political observers with a Feb. 27  announcement that she will not seek reelection to her 38th Assembly District  seat, saying Assembly members should serve no more than 10 years.  </P> <P> Although two Democrats also are candidates, the winner of the June 5 GOP  primary will probably succeed La Follette because Republicans outnumber  Democrats 87,000 to 74,500 in the northern San Fernando Valley district.  </P> <P> The GOP candidates who filed papers by Wednesday's deadline are Robert Wilcox,  a La Follette aide; Paula Boland, a Granada Hills real estate broker; Robert L.  Scott, a business lawyer from Granada Hills; Hal J. Styles, a substitute  teacher from Woodland Hills, and Al Thomas, of Burbank.  </P> <P> However, political observers say the race for the GOP nomination is likely to  boil down to Wilcox and Boland.  </P> <P> Wilcox, 24, is closely identified with La Follette's long but unsuccessful  drive to carve the massive Los Angeles Unified School District into smaller  school systems. Wilcox has been endorsed by La Follette and state Sen. Ed Davis  (R-Valencia), a former employer.  </P> <P> Boland, 50, is well-known in grass-roots Republican circles and has been a  frequent volunteer in local GOP campaigns. She won political blessings from GOP  Assemblywoman Cathie Wright of Simi Valley and Los Angeles City Councilman Hal  Bernson.  </P> <P> "It'll probably come down to those two," said Republican political consultant  Allan Hoffenblum.  </P> <P> "I don't think either one is the favorite," he said. "I think they're starting  even. . . . To be a favorite, you'd have to convince me that one has  significant name identification over the other. I don't think that's the case."  </P> <P> Given the short time before the election, and recent campaign reforms that  reduce the ability of state officeholders to funnel money to local candidates,  the campaign for La Follette's seat will probably turn on who can raise the  most money quickly from small individual contributors, observers said.  </P> <P> "It boils down to who raises sufficient money to put on an effective mail  campaign," said GOP consultant Paul Clarke.  </P> <P> In announcing her retirement, La Follette, 63, pledged to serve out the  remainder of her term, which expires Dec. 31.  </P> <P> Two Democrats also have filed for La Follette's seat. They are Irene Allert, a  Kagel Canyon educator and businesswoman, and Gary Crandall, a Northridge  computer manual writer.  </P> <P> But the two Democrats -- both in their first bid for public office -- are  little known and party strategists hold scant hope for a Democratic upset in  November in the Republican-dominated district.  </P> <P> "Waiting for a Democrat to win in the 38th Assembly District is like leaving  the porch light on for Jimmy Hoffa," lamented one Democratic consultant.  </P> <P> Also in the race are two Peace and Freedom Party candidates, Charles  Najbergier, a registered nurse, and Leah Parker, a bookkeeper.  </P></p>

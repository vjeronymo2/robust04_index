			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Observer: Up the pole What's up with Lech Walesa? Although the Poles have grown used to indulging their president's strange whims, they've been cringing in embarrassment at his antics during his official visit to Germany, the first by a post-Communist Polish leader. The trouble arose while Walesa and a group of Bundestag deputies were discussing his ideas about relations between Poland and the EC and NATO. On being asked to explain in more detail, Walesa was his usual evasive self, responding with generalities and red herrings. Not impressed, some of the deputies began to drift out of the room. Whereupon Walesa lost his temper. 'I would get better treatment in hospital than here,' he reputedly exclaimed. 'At least they would give me a bedpan.' Amid much clearing of throats, the Bundestag committee chairman promptly wound up the meeting to allow Walesa to answer the call of nature. While it is not clear what is causing the latest bizarre behaviour, one theory is that Walesa is increasingly preoccupied with efforts by other politicians to form a grand coalition back in Warsaw. The idea that an effective government might be imminent is apparently too much for the president, who has been striving to keep the political scene fragmented while seeking to define a role for himself. The Germans, meanwhile, have been puzzling over Walesa's quirky humour. His latest joke involves urging Mercedes to invest in Poland so as to reduce thefts of their cars in Germany.</p>

It underlines that there was a  recently emerged tendency for internationalization of the  Karabakh conflict, meaning involvement of foreign advisors and  recruits and utilization of foreign weaponry by Azerbaijan.    The Armenian Foreign Ministry believes that the dangerous  deterioration of the situation in the region was due to the  Azerbaijani official strategic policy aimed at resolving the  conflict in Karabakh by force of weapons. The document says  that Baku rejected the peaceful proposals put forward by the  CSCE Minsk group welcomed by Armenia and Nagorno Karabakh, the  mediating activities of Russia and the appeal of the  International Olympic Committee's president to establish a  temporary cease-fire for the period of the winter Olympic Games  in Lillehammer.    The Armenian Foreign Ministry regretted that the  international community had not blamed Azerbaijan for this.</p>

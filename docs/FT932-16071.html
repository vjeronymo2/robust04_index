			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Government Bonds: Hopes of repo rate cut boost German government paper EUROPEAN bond markets rose strongly yesterday, spurred by weak economic data in Germany and hopes of a cut in the key German money market rate today. Ten-year German government bonds jumped by half a point as a rumour swept the market that the Bundesbank had indicated to several institutions that it would accept bids as low as 8.05 per cent in today's 14-day repo tender. This compares with the 8.17 per cent at the last repo. Several traders and analysts reported that institutions they had talked to and which were bidding in today's tender denied they had been approached, helping to dampen hopes of a large cut. But weak economic data left most analysts expecting a cut in the repo to 8.12 per cent or even 8.10 per cent today. Seasonably-adjusted unemployment rose by 56,000, while manufacturing orders showed an annual decline of 13.6 per cent. On top of weak industrial production figures last week, it was enough to reinforce market confidence. Also, the Bundesbank was expected to engineer a further cut in money market rates to leave room for the long-awaited cut in the French five to 10-day rate, which is expected tomorrow. While cash bunds rose half a point, the June bund futures contract on Liffe rose from 85.34 to close at around 95.82, close to its high of the day. THE yield on 10-year French bonds fell by around seven basis points, in line with their German counterparts, as the market continued to be buoyed by a strong franc and the prospect of an interest rate cut. At 56 basis points, the yield spread between bunds and OATs hovered at its lowest for many months, and sharply lower than before the French elections, when it stood some 25 to 30 basis points higher. But analysts warned that 10-year bond yields were unlikely to advance much further relative to Germany in the short-term. The franc remained firm yesterday, at FFr3.385 to the D-Mark, while call money stood at around 10.5 per cent, giving a firm background against which an interest rate cut could be announced. LONGER-dated UK government bonds regained some ground lost during the sell-off on Monday, prompted partly by a move by traders to close bear positions. Short-dated and index-linked gilts remained unmoved, leading to a slight flattening of the yield curve. The long gilt future on Liffe opened at 105 15/16 and rose early in the day, ending near its high at around 106 11/32 . WHILE other European markets were firm, Spanish government bonds dropped sharply on political uncertainty. The yield on 10-year bonds jumped by more than 20 basis points as the peseta fell on signs of deepening divisions in the ruling Socialist party. THE yield curve flattened yesterday in the US Treasury bond market as the short end was weighed down by a flood of new paper, and the long end bounced back from the sell-off of late last week. In late New York trading, the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue stood at 101 31/32 , up 3/4 , to yield 6.969 per cent, while the two-year note traded around 99 29/32 , up  1/16 to yield 3.908. The spread between the two narrowed to 306 basis points from 311 late on Monday in light trading. Analysts said the next economic hurdle would be the producer price index, due on Thursday. While the long end rally was helped by lower commodity prices, the short end had to cope with a flood of supply, following Congress's passage on Monday of an increase in the debt ceiling to Dollars 4,370bn from Dollars 4,145bn. The Treasury yesterday sold Dollars 14.25bn in 52-week bills, while the market had to cope with Dollars 17bn of 15-day cash management bills. The Treasury also announced the sale today of Dollars 22.4bn in 13 and 26-week bills, originally scheduled for April 5.</p>

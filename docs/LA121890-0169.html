			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> RUSHDIE CONTACTS MUSLIMS  </P> <P> Author Salman Rushdie, who recently emerged from nearly two years of hiding  over Iran's order that he be killed for blasphemy, said today that he hopes to  rebuild his bridges to the Muslim community and live a more normal life.  </P> <P> "What I'm trying to do is seize back bits of my life," Rushdie said in an  interview on ABC's "Good Morning America" program.  </P> <P> The Indian-born writer emerged from hiding Dec. 5, signing copies of his new  book at a north London bookshop. He went underground in February, 1989, when  Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini ordered him put to death for allegedly blaspheming  Islam with his book, "The Satanic Verses."  </P> <P> Iran's Islamic Culture and Guidance Minister Mohammed Khatami renewed the  sentence this month, and an Iranian charity said it would pay $1 million to  anyone who kills Rushdie.  </P> <P> Rushdie said he has been contacting Muslim leaders in Britain and elsewhere to  resolve what he called "this terrible misunderstanding" and was encouraged by  the conversations.  </P></p>

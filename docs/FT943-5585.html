			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (28): Breathing space for Fokker - The Netherlands / The company believes that demand will pick up in 1996 and that total sales in its segment of the market will reach 2,000 in the next 10 years Fokker, the Dutch aircraft manufacturer, recently secured some financial breathing space as it awaits the recovery on the international aviation market which it predicts will emerge in 1996. In July, Deutsche Aerospace (DASA), the company's German controlling shareholder, agreed to inject some Fl 600m (Dollars 345m) into Fokker to shore up its balance sheet. The Dutch government, which owns a minority stake in Fokker, did not participate directly in the refinancing, but it did approve a Fl 400m 'sale-and-lease-back' of the company's technology to Rabobank, the big Dutch co-operative bank. In all, the Fl 1bn will boost shareholders' equity from just 11 per cent of Fokker's balance sheet to 27 per cent, enabling the company to cope with the malaise that continues to affect the industry. Fokker believes that demand for new aircraft will pick up in 1996 and that total sales of aircraft in its segment of the market will reach 2,000 over the next 10 years. Meanwhile, Fokker, like other international aircraft makers, has been hit by sluggish demand, fierce price competition and the need to shed employees and reduce output while the market's weakness continues. In 1993, these problems sent Fokker into a record net loss of Fl 460m from a slim profit of Fl 20m the year before, and turnover dropped to Fl 3.7bn from Fl 4.1bn. Much of the red ink was caused by a provision of Fl 275m taken to cover the cost of selling aircraft at reduced prices to cut its stock. Since then, it has introduced a new policy of completing the assembly of only those aircraft that have been firmly ordered. The move is part of a wider project to enhance production efficiency and flexibility at the company's plant near Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. Fokker also took a charge of Fl 90m to finance a further round of job cuts in the first half of 1994. The company's workforce has fallen to below 10,000 from more than 13,000 at the beginning of the 1990s. The trend towards increased leasing, rather than outright sales, of aircraft has also strained Fokker's balance sheet. This partly reflects the lack of down payments that used to accompany a firm order for the purchase of an aircraft. To meet the challenge of leasing, Fokker hopes to set up a separate leasing company at arm's length from the company but with the participation of DASA and a couple of banks. The Dutch government, which is due to sell its remaining Fokker shares in less than three years' time, has already said that it will not be a shareholder of the leasing company. The July refinancing of Fokker, which must still be approved by DASA's parent, the Daimler-Benz group, is one of the most significant fruits so far of the April 1993 deal which brought the Dutch company under German control. The deal, though contro-versial at the time in the Netherlands, was the result of the Dutch government's repeated assertion that it could no longer afford to finance Fokker's future and that the company needed to find itself a strong industrial partner. Since then, another important change at the company has been the arrival of a new chairman, Ben van Schaik, a former executive in Mercedes-Benz's commercial vehicles business, to replace Erik-Jan Nederkoorn, the original architect of the German takeover who later became embroiled in a damaging boardroom row. At the same time, Fokker pressed ahead with the formal launch of its latest aircraft, the 79-seat Fokker 70, which joins its two existing aeroplanes, the Fokker 50 and the Fokker 100. Given the uncertain conditions prevailing on the aviation market, however, no decision has yet been taken on Fokker's long-standing wish to develop a 130-seater Fokker 130. The certification process for the new Fokker 70 is under way. In July, the first series-produced aircraft had its maiden flight and then joined the test programme that had already begun with the prototype aircraft. The first delivery of a Fokker 70 to launch customer, Sempati Air of Indonesia, is expected in early 1995. Other orders have also been received from airlines in the US and Europe. The Fokker 70 is based largely on the Fokker 100, and the two aircraft are being built on the same assembly line using tooling equipment and working areas that make such mixed production possible. This configuration is designed to increase flexibility. Indeed, in the second half of next year Fokker's customers ordering either the Fokker 70 or Fokker 100 can decide which of the two aeroplanes they want until 12 months before delivery.</p>

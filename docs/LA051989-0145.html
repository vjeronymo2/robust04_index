			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE NATURAL POET;  </P> <P> IRVINE ARTIST'S WORKS OFTEN REFLECT QUEST FOR HER PLACE IN AMERICAN CULTURE  </P> <P> Every day, Irvine poet Mitsuye Yamada rises before dawn to write. It's that  quiet time that poet Sylvia Plath called the "blue hour."  </P> <P> "Nobody calls me up at 4:30 in the morning," Yamada said. "I have a body of  time. I have a journal I keep with fragments of thought, and I try to put them  into a poem."  </P> <P> Many of her poems reflect her efforts to find her place in American culture.  Yamada, who was born in Japan and raised in the United States, sees herself as  part of a movement of Asian-American writers exploring their heritage.  </P> <P> Long active within the Orange County literary community, Yamada, 65, recently  published her second book, "Desert Run." She'll read from the book at the  Fullerton Museum Center on Saturday at 8 p.m., along with Janet Jue and Sarie  Sachie Hylkema, as part of a poets reading series.  </P> <P> "Desert Run," published in late 1988 by Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press of  Latham, N.Y., has won praise from critics such as Scarlet Cheng, who wrote in  the Arlington, Va.-based Belles Lettres magazine that "Yamada's poetry has a  terse blend of emotions and imagery: the twist of words that creates the twist  of vision that makes poetry alive for us."  </P> <P> Poet Eloise Klein Healy, coordinator of the Cal State Northridge women's  studies interdisciplinary program, says she's "impressed by the kind of dignity  that (Yamada) brings to everything. She has such an open vision of the world."  </P> <P> Yamada's progress as a writer in the years between her first book of poetry,  "Camp Notes and Other Poems" (1976, Shameless Hussy Press, Berkeley), and  "Desert Run" is considerable, Healy said. "The technical growth in these poems  is amazing."  </P> <P> In addition to her books, Yamada has published work in a number of literary  magazines and anthologies, including the 1989 Norton anthology of  cross-cultural writing, "New Worlds of Literature." In 1981 she was featured,  along with Bay Area writer Nellie Wong, in a film, "Mitsuye and Nellie: Two  American Poets," that aired nationally on PBS.  </P> <P> Yamada was one of the editors for a 1986 anthology of Orange County poets, "The  Webs We Weave," and in 1981 founded a group called the Multi-Cultural Women  Writers of Orange County.  </P> <P> Her poems are narratives written in free verse. "You have to make your own way  into finding your own form," she said. "I don't know if I've found mine."  </P> <P> A recently retired Cypress College professor of English, Yamada has lived in  Irvine for 17 years with her husband of 39 years, Yoshikazu Yamada, a retired  research chemist who recently became the proprietor of a Laguna Beach art  gallery. They have four children and three grandchildren.  </P> <P> Yamada said her teaching helped pay the family's bills while leaving her some  time to write, though the full-time job contributed to the long lapse between  her first and second book. It's very difficult -- if not impossible -- to earn  a living as a poet today, she noted.  </P> <P> "The books themselves don't seem to sell very well. We live in a society where  not very many people sit down and read poetry," she said.  </P> <P> Given the limited readership for poetry, she's not sure why she goes on writing  it, Yamada said. Yet, she added, "if we want to survive as human beings, be  aware of our place in the world, you might say that (writing and reading)  poetry is a matter of survival."  </P> <P> Yamada was born in Kyushu, Japan, and raised in Seattle. She began writing at  age 13, but became more serious about it much later, in the mid-1960s. "There  was a period when I was sick. I was in bed a lot," Yamada said. "That was when  I really started writing a lot. I wanted my children to know about my life."  </P> <P> She was misdiagnosed first as having terminal emphysema, then cystic fibrosis.  "I didn't sleep much at all, my lungs were in such bad shape. I did a lot of  writing and thinking about things." Later, the diagnosis was changed to asthma,  which medication brought under control. Yamada discarded much of what she'd  written while sick but went on putting her thoughts on paper.  </P> <P> "In the 1970s, when various feminist publications started coming out, I started  sending my things out," Yamada said. Poems were accepted. "That was exciting,  an affirmation."  </P> <P> Yamada's father, Jack Yasutake, was also a poet. When she was a girl, Yamada  remembers, every Sunday he met with a large group of poets in Seattle. "In  fact, that's what they were doing on Dec. 7," 1941, the day Pearl Harbor was  attacked by the Japanese, Yamada said. "That's where they were when my father  was arrested."  </P> <P> The writers had inscribed poems on a big piece of paper on a wall. FBI agents  removed the paper. "They thought it was some sort of code. They took it away to  see if some kind of subversive activity was going on that day," Yamada said.  Yasutake was incarcerated in prisoner-of-war camps near Albuquerque, N.M., and  Crystal City, Tex., for most of the war.  </P> <P> Like many other Japanese Americans, Yamada, her mother and brothers were  interned. Yamada was held from 1942 to 1943 at Minidoka, an Idaho camp. Once  released, she was at first eager to leave her camp memories behind, but later  these memories became the subject of much of her writing.  </P> <P> In her new book's title poem Yamada likens herself, and other interned  Japanese-Americans, to "the bull snakes brought/into this desert by the  soldiers/we were transported here/to drive away rattlers/in your nightmares. .  . ."  </P> <P> Elsewhere in the poem, still using the image of the bull snake as a metaphor  for herself, Yamada writes that "I cannot stay in the desert/where you will  have me nor/will I be brought back in a cage/to grace your need for exotica. .  . . If you must fit me to your needs/I will die/and so will you." The "you" to  whom she speaks in the poem is the culture that allowed the internment of  Japanese-Americans, she says.  </P> <P> "The American guilt about the camps is to keep it quiet. That's why it took 40  years for this redress issue to come out," she said. "Even in the Japanese  community, the fear is that there might be a backlash. But as (poet) Audre Lord  said, 'My silence did not protect me and your silence will not protect you.'  </P> <P> "I don't know how many thousands of people still don't know what this (redress)  is about," said Yamada, who was active with the National Council of  Japanese-American Redress, which brought an unsuccessful class-action lawsuit  on behalf of those interned during World War II. (Recent federal legislation  mandated that World War II Japanese-American internees be paid $20,000 each as  redress, but those payments have not yet begun.)  </P> <P> Although Yamada was born in Japan, she doesn't feel Japanese. In 1981 she paid  her first adult visit to her birthplace, and "I knew that this was not my  country," she said. Brought to the United States at age 4, Yamada had spent  another 18 months in Japan when she was 11, but she hadn't been back since.  </P> <P> "My heritage is really with the pioneers, no matter what race. I feel more  connected to the emigres from throughout the world who move from one culture to  another and spend the rest of their lives trying to wedge themselves into this  new culture," Yamada said.  </P> <P> U.S. laws discriminating against people of Asian origin prevented Yamada from  becoming an American citizen until 1953. "I was unnatural before, so I had to  become naturalized," she joked. "That term is so . . ." She left the sentence  unfinished, shaking her head. "But by then I was already more American than  Japanese."  </P> <P> Partly because of her personal encounters with injustice, Yamada feels a strong  kinship with political prisoners around the world. She's been a member of  Amnesty International, the human rights organization, for more than 20 years  and is up for reelection to its national board of directors.  </P> <P> Through her teaching, Yamada presented her students with alternative traditions  within American literature. In her American literature class, for instance, the  reading list was mostly books by ethnic American writers.  </P> <P> "The students would complain that there were too many ethnic novels. They'd  want to know why they weren't reading Hemingway, and I'd explain there were  many years when we read nothing but white male writers," Yamada said.  </P> <P> "Students are so conformist. . . . We didn't throw all the mainstream people  out. I kept some of the women" writers, she added, laughing.  </P> <P> Yamada continues to be an active member of Multi-Cultural Women Writers of  Orange County. "We started out as an Asian-American women writers group," she  said. However, the membership soon expanded to include several other "women  with a very strong ethnic consciousness." Nine women now meet every other week  to share their writing.  </P> <P> In 1988 the group won a 3-year grant of $2,000 a year from the California Arts  Council to present a few seminars and to publish a multilingual anthology of  members' writing, due out next year.  </P> <P> Yamada's current writing, which includes a book of political essays for  Firebrand Press, is going slowly. She said her life "feels very disordered  right now" because she's trying to do so many things.  </P> <P> One of her projects involves trying to find out why her father was considered a  dangerous spy during World War II. "The paper trail takes forever. . . . I  should have retired 10 years ago to work on some of these things," Yamada said.  </P> <P> She's happy to have more time to pursue interests close to her heart. "I think  I deserve it," she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Excerpts From 'Desert Run'  </P> <P> Following is an excerpt from Mitsuye Yamada's book, "Desert Run."  </P> <P> </P> <P> MY COUSIN  </P> <P>  The failed kamikaze pilot  </P> <P>  who lived to miss only three fingers  </P> <P>  on his right hand  </P> <P>  offers me a sip of California wine  </P> <P>  in his trim garden.  </P> <P>  He, pacific, a giant  </P> <P>  among dwarfed trees  </P> <P>  one hand resting  </P> <P>  on the arm of  </P> <P>  an imported chair  </P> <P>  a clear stemmed glass poised  </P> <P>  between his thumb and pinkie  </P> <P>  answers a question I could not  </P> <P>  ask for thirty years:  </P> <P>  Of course I don't  </P> <P>  I don't really believe  </P> <P>  "it is sweet and fitting  </P> <P>  to die for one's country."  </P> <P>  It is evening and the canary clears its throat.  </P> <P>  I leave among cricket sounds in the woods.  </P> <P> </P></p>

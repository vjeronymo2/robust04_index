			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: Oki Electric says loss will be less than forecast OKI Electric, the Japanese maker of communications equipment and semiconductors, said yesterday that losses for the year ending March 1994 would be less than initially expected. Oki said it now expects sales for the first half of the year to be 2 per cent higher than previously forecast, at Y255bn (USDollars 2.4bn), and that its pre-tax loss for the six months would be Y7bn, rather than the earlier estimate of Y14bn. Full-year sales are expected to be slightly lower at Y555bn instead of Y560bn. Pre-tax losses for the year are, however, expected to be more than halved at Y8bn, against the Y19bn incurred in 1992-93. The company, however, is passing its dividend. It is aiming to return to profit in 1994-95 and resume dividend payments the following year. In the second half of this year, Oki expects demand to remain weak with its main customers, banks and other corporations, keeping capital spending low. The main reasons for the improvement in Oki's forecast are strong demand for memory chips, particularly in the US, which has allowed Oki to maintain prices while increasing sales volume and reducing costs, and an increase in orders from NTT, the Japanese telecommunications company. An improvement in its financial balance, due to lower interest rates, will also help. Oki is stepping up its restructuring efforts to deal with the adverse business climate. It is to bring forward plans for a 2,000 reduction in its payroll and proposes spinning off its printed circuit board business as a separate company. Costs are also being cut in manufacturing and research and development, the company said. Asahi Breweries is to tie-up with Molson Breweries USA, part of the Canadian brewing group, in a move aimed at expanding sales, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Asahi, which exported 700,000 cases of beer to the US in 1992-1993, plans to increase the number to 1.5m within five years.</p>

			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: United Newspapers There appears to have been something of a whispering campaign against Lord Stevens' stewardship of United Newspapers. Given his past involvement with the Invesco MIM fund management group, he is not one of the City's favourite figures. But United's trading record over the past few years has been respectable. There is little reason to let personal considerations cloud United's Pounds 190m rights issue which closes tomorrow. The substantive worry concerns what United will do with the money. The company has not spelt out how it will use the proceeds, apart from reducing gearing. Shareholders are always suspicious of handing over their cash for unspecified purposes. United's Pounds 250m acquisition of the disappointing Extel shows its record is not spotless. News International's launch of a tabloid price war last week has also unsettled United's shares. The early indications are that the Daily Star has been caught up in The Sun's wash but that the Daily Express has been little affected. It seems unlikely that News International hopes for anything as crude as knocking the Daily Star out of business. Although the Daily Star incurs losses it accounts for about 20 per cent of the through-put of United's printing plants and helps defray overhead costs. Ironically, United's rights issue, which has been fully underwritten, may serve as a spoiling action of its own. Institutions flush with United paper may prove more resistant when Mirror Group Newspapers' administrators come knocking at the door.</p>

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Slovenia's voters reject Balkans diet of nationalism SLOVENIA has bucked the trend of nationalism in the Balkans as moderates yesterday emerged as the biggest winners in the first elections since the tiny republic won independence from Yugoslavia last year. Mr Milan Kucan, the incumbent, won re-election as president with 64 per cent of Sunday's ballot, according to officials results with more than half the vote counted. The centrist Liberal Democrats (LDS) led the vote for a new 130-seat bicameral parliament, with 23 per cent. The Christian Democrats, their closest rivals, received 14.9 per cent and the United Left, which includes the former communists, trailed behind with 13.26 per cent. Mr Janez Drnovsek, the current prime minister and head of the LDS, said negotiations would soon be under way to form a coalition government. Despite the strong turn-out in support of Slovenia's fledgling democracy, many Slovenes were worried about the showing of Mr Zmago Jelincic, the ultra-nationalist leader of the Slovene National Party, who came in fourth with 10 per cent of the vote. Mr Jelincic has called for the expulsion of Bosnian refugees and guestworkers from the former Yugoslav republics in order to make jobs for Slovenes. But President Kucan, a former communist who is widely respected for opposing Serb-dominated Yugoslavia, said the elections would represent a victory if Slovenia looked towards the future and not the past. He called on citizens to build economic prosperity. Despite freezing temperatures and flooding, some 75 per cent of the 1.5m registered voters turned out for the ballot.</p>

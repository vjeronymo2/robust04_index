			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Clinton wins comfortably in critical New York primary GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas won a critical victory in New York's Democratic primary early today, fending off a fierce challenge from Mr Jerry Brown, his rival for the party's presidential nomination. Early returns and exit polls showed Mr Clinton winning the New York primary by a comfortable margin - although with much less than an outright majority  -and also winning a sizeable victory in the much smaller Kansas primary. The Wisconsin primary appeared to be much closer, although preliminary estimates gave Mr Clinton the edge there too. In the Republican primaries, President George Bush faced no contest in New York, where Mr Patrick Buchanan, his right-wing challenger, was excluded from the ballot paper, and won comfortably in Kansas and Wisconsin. The campaign in New York had been brutally fought. Tabloid newspapers attacked Governor Clinton's character with a savagery compounded by New York's traditional prejudice against southerners, before turning their wrath on Mr Brown, former governor of California. After the Illinois and Michigan primaries on March 17, Governor Clinton had appeared assured of a smooth ride towards winning the Democratic nomination at the party convention in July. But Mr Paul Tsongas's decision to suspend his candidacy threw Mr Clinton into a duel with Mr Brown, whose slash-and-burn campaigning style was fuelled by a victory in Connecticut's primary two weeks ago. Despite suspending his campaign, Mr Tsongas attracted a sizeable vote in New York and last night was considering whether to revive his candidacy. The swirling fortunes of the campaign - and especially Governor Clinton's travails over whether and where he smoked marijuana, and whether he dodged the Vietnam war draft - have encouraged Washington pundits and Democratic party officials to discuss scenarios for introducing another candidate, such as Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas or Senator Al Gore of Tennessee. But these wishful scenarios are sketched by the same people who drew up the party rules that make a late candidacy all but impossible. Even before yesterday's primaries, Mr Clinton had won 1,082 of the 4,288 delegates who will attend the party nominating convention in New York, far ahead of Mr Brown's 166 delegates. The Arkansas governor seemed set to add substantially to his total after yesterday's voting, in which another 362 delegates were at stake. In Wisconsin, voters' favour had swung back and forth between the two candidates, but neither man found much time to campaign in the state. In Kansas, with 36 delegates at stake, Governor Clinton was the only candidate to campaign.</p>

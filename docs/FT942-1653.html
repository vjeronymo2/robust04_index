			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Arts: Cautionary tales of the cultural divide - Cinema THE INNOCENT (18) John Schlesinger SHOPPING (18) Paul Anderson BEVERLY HILLS COP 3 (15) John Landis ROBOCOP 3 (15) Fred Dekker The tug-of-war custody hearing over the British film industry continues this week, with important new testimony from both sides. The evidence produced on behalf of the first party, Mr America, is the movie Shopping. Paul Anderson's urban thriller - a loud, dark-toned, pacy British film made in the style of that currently popular retro-genre, 'film noir' - will be used to show that Hollywood has been powerfully influential in the forming of modern UK screen culture. But Miss Europe, who was of course Mr America's common-law partner until a recent quarrel involving a Gatt, will claim that John Schlesinger's The Innocent proves the opposite: that this version of Ian McEwan's Cold War novel set in moody murder-prone Berlin shows that the last best hope for British film is an alliance with our friends across the Channel. Look at the evidence. Exhibit A: British director and leading man (Anthony Hopkins). Exhibit B: Italian leading lady (Isabella Rossellini). Exhibit C: German locations and co-funding. Each side is then expected to attack the other mercilessly for its poor record of care and guardianship. Mr America will accuse Miss Europe of involving Britain in the deadly quagmire of the 'Euro-pudding' and will point out certain specific shortcomings in The Innocent. Its peculiar compote casting, for starters. Why is Sir Anthony Hopkins playing an American army officer - with an appalling sub-James Cagney accent - while America's Campbell Scott (better accented) plays the young British telephone engineer Leonard, brought to Berlin in 1955 to help with an anti-Soviet surveillance scheme? McEwan's novel was a bizarre blend of Le Carre spy stuff with sex, passion and murder. When Leonard falls for the German Maria (played in the film by the Italian Miss Rossellini), a nasty encounter with her husband ends in death and dismemberment. 'What will the lovers do with the body?' becomes the novel's big question, until finally the object is folded cunningly, ironically into the espionage plot. Schlesinger's film is best when most intimate. Scott excels as the fussy, virginal communications boffin marooned in a cut-off world - his dingy love nest - with the distraught, high-strung girl and the carnage she brings him. But whenever the film moves out into the 'real' world, all reality ceases. Schlesinger promises much with a virtuoso opening tracking shot through a crowded, babbling hotel lobby. But then the individual voices start. Hopkins's 'You dirdy rat' American; a number of German supporting actors dubbed into transatlantic; and finally Miss R herself, who is fine right up to the last scene when she too is tipped into the open air. Her scene of foggy-voiced tearful parting on a foggy airfield seems like a crazed reprise of her mother's finest hour in Casablanca. After Mr America has had his say about The Innocent, and the mish-mash of vagabond ingredients typical of Euro-puddings, Miss Europe will have her say about Shopping. She will attack the delinquent tendencies of an ex-colonial culture based on the worship of crime and violence. Shopping which stars Sadie Frost and Jude Law as two car-stealing 'ram-raiders,' who like to enter shops through the shop window, is, she will point out, like Bonnie And Clyde meets Absolute Beginners, possibly over the prone body of Blade Runner. Over-the-top visual atmospherics - mist and smoke, Stygian chiaroscuro, drizzle-haloed street lights - are wedded to daft script-lines. The exchange earning the largest giggle at the press show came when Mr Law ventures to plant a tentative kiss on Miss Frost's lips and she says 'Cut it, Joe, this is the 90s. Sex isn't safe anymore.' Nor, in the wrong hands, is portentous epochal dialogue. The film is a second-rate, second-hand thriller in debt, far beyond repayment, to its Hollywood paradigms. The judge presiding over the custody hearing will admit that he finds this case difficult to resolve. Each side, America and Europe, has powerful arguments concerning the decrepit artistic standards of the other. After long consideration, though, he has made his decision. He will award custody to neither party. He will instead urge and if necessary compel the British film industry to become self-reliant. For a short time it will be made a ward of court. Then it will be required to make its own way in the world with no more than a minimal reliance on any other nation. It will not be allowed to beg at Number Ten Downing Street, nor to spend its life creeping towards the EC or US for cultural resuscitation. Soon rather than late it must learn how to please and interest other cultures and societies, without compromising its own culture or treating its own society as a charity institute. After all (sums up the judge), if Four Weddings And A Funeral and The Crying Game and A Fish Called Wanda and My Beautiful Laundrette can do it, so can everyone else. Case dismissed. In the week of Beverly Hills Cop 3 and Robocop 3, what better time to distance ourselves from Hollywood? When sequel sagas hit stage three, three things happen. Script invention plummets. Plots reach for tortured novelties of location or motivation: in BHC3 a theme park, in R3 a whole lot of inner-city anarchy requiring emergency policing. And favourite actors drop out. So no Peter Weller as Robocop. His lips and jaw - nothing else being visible below the hydraulically whining visor - are replaced by those of Robert Burke. And over in Beverly Hills no John Ashton, who for two films played fat-solemn police sidekick (alongside tall-slim Judge Reinhold) to Eddie Murphy's grinning dementia praecox case from Detroit. Mr Murphy has now been seconded to California so often that we wonder why he does not keep a hotel room there. Beverly Hills Cop 3 is an exhausted replay of the old tics. Its desperation is most evident in the wheeling forth of Bronson Pinchot, who stole Cop 1 with his fluttery, shrieking art gallery owner and who is asked to do it again here - no, to overdo it - so that he becomes victim rather than saviour. Robocop 3 features another cop called Murphy (hero's name not performer's) and also begins in Detroit. But this film has the sense to stay there. Here is the much-loved Motown sound: not Diana Ross but the music of crashing cars, screaming extras and our hero's bullet-zapping bio-metallic arms. Here too, for 20 minutes of tolerable reacquaintance, is Hollywood's attempt to force the futurist vision of Lang's Metropolis into intimacy with the weaponry of the Star Wars era. Then, like the other film, it tailspins into diminishing circles. Should they not have combined the two trequels and given us Beverly Hills Robocop? That way familiarity could have been spiced with hybridisation. And we would have warmed to the idea of a knockabout black cop clamped in a head-to-toe metal casing from which only the best wisdoms and witticisms would be allowed to emerge.</p>

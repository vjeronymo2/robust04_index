			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Full trial ordered in case over loans to Iraq by BNL THE long-running scandal over Dollars 5bn of illegal Iraqi loans, made by the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), took an unexpected turn yesterday when a US judge halted court hearings against the branch's former head and said he would order a full-scale trial. Judge Marvin Shoob declared in open court that he did not believe the central premise of the US government's case against Mr Christopher Drogoul, former BNL Atlanta manager, who was due to have been sentenced to prison this week. The judge's order was in response to a request by US government prosecutors, who this week suffered a series of blows to their case that Mr Drogoul was the sole orchestrator of the Iraqi loans. More than Dollars 2bn of these helped finance President Saddam Hussein's nuclear, chemical and missile projects. The prosecutors yesterday said they wished to seek a full trial and cancel an earlier plea agreement by which Mr Drogoul had admitted guilt to 60 of 347 charges against him. Two weeks ago, Mr Bobby Lee Cook, Mr Drogoul's lawyer, was refused a full trial and a request that his client's plea be changed to innocent. Mr Cook, who quickly agreed to a new trial, has accused the Bush administration of covering up its role in a scheme to finance Iraq's weapons programmes via BNL loans. The government's case appeared weakened this week after Judge Shoob had revealed that three CIA documents proved 'definitely' that Mr Drogoul had acted with the full knowledge of BNL's head office in Rome.</p>

			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Delors angry at regional aid row MR Jacques Delors, European Commission president, last night rounded on ministers for backing away from an outline agreement on the Community's structural funds budget. Mr Delors was summoned to ministerial talks by the Belgian presidency of the EC, after deep divisions emerged over apportionment of Ecu141.5bn (Pounds 107bn) of structural funds among member states over the next six years. Eight countries, including Britain, objected to Commission proposals for sharing out what is the largest ever EC aid package to run-down regions. Mr Delors, still suffering from sciatica, arrived late last night and criticised greedy member states. 'There is an anti-European spirit today in the Community,' he said. In a tough address to ministers, he said: 'I am sticking to my promises, but you must not go back on your commitments.' Mr Delors intervened a fortnight ago to try to mollify Ireland, which has been holding out for IPounds 8bn (Pounds 7.5bn) over seven years. But his IPounds 7.5bn (Pounds 7.1bn) counter-offer is understood to have upset Mr Bruce Millan, commissioner responsible for the regional aid budget. This offer triggered an avalanche of counter-claims from other states. One EC official said member states' bids were 25 per cent above the total agreed at last December's summit in Edinburgh. The eight member states raising objections are Britain, the Netherlands, France, and Italy, as well as the four poorer EC countries, Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece. Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg and Belgium have indicated a willingness to go along. Mr Millan is understood to have offered Ireland IPounds 6.5bn, a sum Irish officials dismissed as unrealistic. Mr Albert Reynolds, Irish prime minister, claims to have received a guarantee of IPounds 8bn at Edinburgh. Earlier this month, EC foreign ministers met until 4am to reach a deal on rules for allocation of structural funds, but with an Irish reservation.</p>

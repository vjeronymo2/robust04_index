			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order 12866, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been determined that this action will be treated as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``significant regulatory action'' within the meaning of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Executive Order. As such, this action was submitted to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review. Changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documented in the docket pertaining to the off-site waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and recovery operations NESHAP rulemaking (Docket  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No. A&hyph;92&hyph;16).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .) requires Federal agencies to give  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> special consideration to the impacts of regulations on small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entities, which are small businesses, small organizations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and small governments. The major purpose of the Regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Flexibility Act is to keep paperwork and regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements from being out of proportion to the scale of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the entities being regulated, without compromising the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> objectives of, in this case, the Clean Air Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A small business with establishments in Standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Industrial Classification 4953, Refuse Systems, is defined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the Small Business Administration as one receiving less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than $6 million per year, averaged over the most recent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three fiscal years. A small organization is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not-for-profit enterprise that is independently owned and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operated and is not dominant in the waste disposal industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A small government is one that serves a population of less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 50,000 people. The EPA may use other definitions, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elects to use these. The EPA believes that small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organizations and small governments have at most a very  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minor involvement with the types of off-site waste and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery operations subject to this rulemaking, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore would not be significantly affected by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP. Hence, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has concentrated its attention on small businesses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Regulatory Flexibility Act specifies that Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies must prepare an initial regulatory flexibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis if a proposed regulatory action would have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant economic impact on a substantial number of small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entities. The data bases available to the EPA reflect the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state of the hazardous waste TSDF industry in 1986, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide limited basis for updating the economic factors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, the EPA does not have reliable projections of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construction of new facilities with off-site waste and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery operations that would be subject to the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule. The EPA therefore assumes the proposed rule may have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a significant impact on a substantial number of small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> businesses, and has conducted a regulatory flexibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis. This analysis is part of the economic impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis (titled Economic Impact Analysis of Proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Off-Site Waste and Recovery Operations) prepared for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking and available in the docket (Docket No. A&hyph;92&hyph;16).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Even though many off-site waste and recovery operations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities are expected to be area sources and would not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to the proposed NESHAP, the EPA assumed for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory flexibility analysis that all facilities listed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the data base are colocated at major sources. Also, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis did not exclude those off-site waste and recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations facilities that would not be subject to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NESHAP under the proposed applicability exemption for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities at which the total annual organic HAP mass  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> content of all wastes and recoverable materials subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the rule entering the facility is less than 1 Mg/yr. From  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its data base, the EPA has identified 110 small businesses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that own 112 affected facilities. About 90 of these small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> businesses would incur compliance costs associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using air emission control equipment. For about one-third  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the 90 businesses, the annual compliance costs would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceed 5 percent of normal production or waste treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs. For the median small business, the same costs come  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to less than 0.4 percent of sales `` compared with about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0.01 percent for the median large business. Excluding the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs of monitoring and recordkeeping costs, the capital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs would exceed the retained earnings breakpoints (the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum amount of new capital a business can raise without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issuing new stock and without changing its existing capital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> structure) of about 40 percent of the 90 small businesses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Only about 30 percent of large businesses would have capital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs of compliance exceeding their breakpoints.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the EPA evaluated the possibility that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule might cause a small business to close.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the rule may cause specific waste treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processes to be shut down at many off-site waste and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery operations facilities, only about 10 facilities are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projected to close outright. Of these, the EPA can single  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> out only three small businesses, each of which has only one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility. Limiting the analysis, to the extent possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the information available in the data base, to only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those facilities which are major sources and would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualify for the 1 Mg of HAP applicability exemption does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change this number of potential closures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Flexibility Act, the Administrator certifies that this rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may have a significant economic impact on a substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

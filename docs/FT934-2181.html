			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Observer: Matinee performance The picturesque Jack Valenti must be a disappointed man. President of the Motion Pictures Association of America, Valenti can but weep at the Gatt negotiation's apparent failure to achieve a US-European Union deal on audio-visual trade. Lyndon Johnson's former presidential speech writer, Valenti's efforts finally seemed to have been defeated by the stubborn French yesterday. But at least he was briefly able to bask in the glare of public attention once more, last experienced with such intensity when he and fellow Texans scuttled from the White House along with Vietnam-plagued Johnson. In his current battle Valenti showed he had lost none of his talent for high drama. In one of his keynote addresses on the subject - 'The Unique, Matchless Non-Clonable US Trade Prize: The American Movie' - Valenti likened the appearance of EU directives on the audio-visual landscape to 'vagrant weeds in a lovely garden'.</p>

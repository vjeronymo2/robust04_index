			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Survey of Dubai (3): Quality producers - Heavy industry DUBAI'S manufacturing industries have developed on the back of the finest sea and air communications in the Middle East. Dubai Aluminium (Dubal) and industries located in the Jebel Ali Free Zone depend on the ports. These are Dubai's lifeline. The tanker traffic and the commercial shipping in turn create the business for Dubai Drydocks. Manufacturing industries located in Dubai represent only about 25 per cent of the country's non-oil manufacturing base, but what is lacking in quantity is to a large extent made up in quality. Dubal; Dubai Cable Company, a 60-40 joint venture between the government and the BICC group of the UK which operates and manages the company; and Dubai Drydocks are all industry leaders. In little more than two decades Dubai has become one of the top 15 shipping centres in the world container port traffic league and the redistribution hub of the Middle East. In May 1991, the two ports of Mina Rashid and Jebel Ali, 35 kilometres south of Dubai city, were merged to create Dubai Ports Authority (DPA), headed by Mr Sultan Bin Sulayem who is also chairman of the Jebel Ali Free Zone Authority (Jafza). By the end of that year, container traffic had increased 37 per cent to top 1m TEUs (twenty foot equivalent units), for the first time. Last year, container traffic had increased by a further 48 per cent, and this year throughput is likely to reach 1.6m TEUs. Last year, DPA invested Dollars 100m to expand Jebel Ali's container terminal and buy six new container cranes, and a further two are on order for both Jebel Ali and Mina Rashid. The two ports together have 102 deepwater berths. The cargo village at Dubai's international airport completed its first full year of operations in July 1992 and, working in tandem with DPA, handled more than 12m kilos of sea-air cargo. DPA claims that a Japanese manufacturer using sea-air via DPA to reach Germany can save one third off all-sea transport and more than 40 per cent off all-air costs. Dubai Aluminium's production last year exceeded capacity for the first time since completion of the smelter development programme in January 1991. Hot metal production reached 244,605 tonnes, an increase of 5,575 tonnes on 1991 production. The aluminium industry as a whole suffered from the effects of the recession in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. Despite the tight market, Dubal sold more than 250,000 tonnes of finished metal to 21 countries, with Japan continuing to account for the largest percentage of sales. Dubal is now applying for accreditation to the International Standards Organisation under ISO 9002 for coverage of the entire smelter operation, in readiness for exporting to the EC. Last July, Dubai Cable Company became the first cable factory in the Middle East to be awarded the ISO 9002 standard, widely used throughout the US, Europe and Japan to ensure manufactured products meet specific high quality standards. The European Community is planning to ensure that all cable imports into Europe meet these standards. The company says it achieved record sales in 1992 with a 12 per cent increase over 1991. It successfully broke into the Asian market with a Pounds 10m contract from Singapore's Public Utilities Board and last August won another supply contract for low voltage cables from Hong Kong's China Light &amp; Power Company. Mr Neil Chesworth, general manager for sales and marketing, says products can be made in Dubai which are as good as anywhere. The ingredients for success in Ducab's case are a growing market such as the Middle East, a joint venture partner such as the Dubai government which leaves BICC to run the company, and BICC's know-how. The same 'hands-off' policy adopted by the government has also been a winning formula in the case of Dubai Drydocks, the Dollars 400m ship repair complex opened in 1979. It has three graving docks of 350,000dwt, 500,000dwt, and 1,000,000dwt, and for years was regarded as a white elephant because by the time it opened the tanker market involving very large vessels was undergoing one of its very depressed periods. In the 10 years it has been operating, however, it has made a profit every year, according to Mr Ernie Ware, chief executive. During the Iran-Iraq war, a lot of vessels with minor damage were repaired in Dubai, and once the war was over in August 1988, Dubai Drydocks began seriously the job of building up industries related to the drydocks themselves. It has attracted several contractors into the industrial estate adjacent to the shipyard. The number of vessels repaired between March 1992 and February 1993 was 103 with a tonnage of more than 20m. Since the beginning of March this year, 103 vessels have been in for repair with a total tonnage of nearly 16m. Jebel Ali Free Zone has witnessed the same kind of success. The concept and the scale of Dubai's ambition when the Free Zone Authority was established in February 1985 was greeted with the same kind of scepticism as Dubai Drydocks. But despite the Iran-Iraq war and the 1991 Gulf war - and fears for the region's stability which curbed investor interest - Jebel Ali Free Zone is now benefiting from the scale of the original concept. It offers a long list of very attractive inducements to potential investors, including a lack of red tape which is a businessman's dream compared with the red tape in most neighbouring countries, and it has been vigorous in promoting itself. By mid-October there were more then 560 companies with licences to operate in the Free Zone. They came from 58 countries and represented an investment of more than Dollars 1bn. Sultan Bin Sulayem, Jafza chairman, said 'mega-companies' had been showing considerable interest in applying for special offshore licences. He says European companies are beginning to see the wisdom of manufacturing products for sale in Europe, in Dubai rather than in Asia. There are still obstacles to attracting the kind of manufacturing companies the Free Zone wants. The first has been the conspicuous reluctance of neighbouring countries which are prime re-export targets, particularly Saudi Arabia, to accept that goods made in the free zone with a minimum 40 per cent value-added content by a company owned at least 51 per cent by a GCC national should pass as a locally-produced item, and therefore be liable to a similar low rate of import duty as that payable by any other GCC onshore industry. According to Mr Bin Sulayem, however, the problem is being resolved. But the bureaucratic hurdles have been formidable. First, the company concerned has to get a certificate of origin from the UAE Finance and Industry Ministry. Next, the paperwork has to pass through not only the Dubai chamber of commerce - a relatively very straightforward process - but also the GCC secretariat in Riyadh and then it must be approved by the Saudi customs. Meanwhile, because Dubai sticks to its belief in a free market and refuses to protect its industries, the manufacturer has to compete with manufactured goods from neighbouring countries, including Saudi Arabia, which benefit from high domestic tariffs, cost more to produce but still sell at a profit in their own domestic markets, which enable their owners to dump them in the UAE. The cost disadvantages, frustrations and delays have deterred many a would-be investor. The other cloud on the horizon is the nagging possibility that Dubai in general could not support a major industrial investment because it could not satisfy long-term power needs. Talks are reported to have taken place, however, with the neighbouring emirate of Sharjah, with Abu Dhabi, Qatar, and Iran.</p>

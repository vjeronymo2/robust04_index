			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> WEEKENDER: NORTHROP AND HAWTHORNE AIRPORT LOOK BACK TOWARD THEIR FLEDGLING DAYS  WITH 'GOLDEN AGE OF AVIATION.'  </P> <P> The Northrop Aircraft Co. press release was dated Sept. 1, 1939.  </P> <P> It reported that the fledgling company -- then consisting of aircraft design  visionary Jack Northrop and six engineers -- would build its $500,000 factory  on a tract of Hawthorne farmland near the intersection of El Segundo Boulevard  and Prairie Avenue.  </P> <P> As a part of the arrangement, the city intended to float a $47,000 bond issue  to grade a landing field adjacent to the plant and construct a 3,700-foot  runway.  </P> <P> Roy L. Wolford, who set up Northrop's first photo lab in 1940, recalls taking a  picture of the "first little building" when the airfield was still "just wheat  stubble."  </P> <P> Sawtooth structures -- called that because of the roof line -- soon took shape  along the south side of the airfield. They are still there after several  additions and remodelings.  </P> <P> "It was part of an adventure because we were doing something new," Wolford  said.  </P> <P> Added Jim Randall, who recently celebrated his 50th anniversary as the  company's longest-tenured employee: "(Jack) Northrop would say to us, 'You're  doing it, not me.' "  </P> <P> Like every other aircraft company, Northrop boomed during World War II. It did  subcontracting work, built fighting seaplanes for the Norwegian government, and  produced what Wolford called the "first big plane" of its own. That was the  P-61 Black Widow, which was the first aircraft built specifically as a night  fighter. The "flying wing" -- a Jack Northrop concept dating back to the 1920s  -- also took shape, but the experimental bombers were scrapped by the Air Force  in 1953.  </P> <P> Both the airfield and Northrop have grown over the years. Wolford had Badge 200  when he went to work in April, 1940. The company, now known as the Northrop  Corp., has 44,600 employees worldwide.  </P> <P> And Northrop Field, where the first landings a half-century ago were on an  unpaved runway, is now the Hawthorne Municipal Airport with 120,000 takeoffs  and landings a year.  </P> <P> The airport also plays host every year to the Hawthorne Air Faire, which is  billed as a weekend of family fun amid aircraft old and new, classic  automobiles, food and novelty booths and aerospace exhibitions. Attendance  usually runs 15,000 a day.  </P> <P> But this year's celebration of "The Golden Age of Aviation" on Saturday and  Sunday will be all about anniversaries: the 50th birthdays of Northrop and the  airport, as well as the the 50th anniversary of the first flights of historic  bombers and fighter planes built by General Dynamics/Convair Division and  Lockheed.  </P> <P> Vintage World War II planes will arrive in a flyover starting at 1 p.m.  Saturday. A current American fighter, the F-111, will fly in at 1 p.m. Sunday.  </P> <P> Sightseeing rides in light aircraft and old-fashioned biplanes will be  available for a charge. In the case of the light plane, the cost will be 7  cents a pound. "They'll have scales to weigh people," airport Administrator Bob  Trimborn said.  </P> <P> People may also rub elbows with aviation pioneers at a dinner held by the  Chamber of Commerce on Saturday at 6:30 p.m. at the Stouffer Concourse Hotel,  5400 W. Century Blvd., near Los Angeles International Airport. Among those  being honored are Sir Frank Whittle, the inventor of the jet engine, who  conducted the first successful laboratory test in England in 1937. The dinner  is open to the public by reservation at $40 a person. Call 676-1163.  </P> <P> If the accent will be on history, the latest in Northrop technology -- the B-2  Stealth bomber -- also will get some attention. Col. Richard Couch and Bruce  Hinds, test pilots on the craft's maiden flight last year, will be at the  Northrop exhibit to talk about the plane.  </P> <P> Trimborn notes that the airport and Northrop have had a 50-year "open arms"  friendship: When Jack Northrop was shopping for a location, the city helped  lure him by building him an airfield, and Northrop brought Hawthorne industry  and jobs.  </P> <P> Said Trimborn: "We've had 50 years of a very good partnership." Gerald Faris  What: Hawthorne Air Faire. When: Saturday, Sunday, 10 a.m to 4 p.m. Where:  Hawthorne Municipal Airport, 120th Street and Crenshaw Boulevard, Hawthorne.

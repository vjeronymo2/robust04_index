			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Scholes Investors must clearly learn not to take at face value a company's recommendation of a bid. When the board of William Low recommended Tesco's initial offer, it did so in the hope that it would start an auction. The board of Scholes also found themselves in a corner last month and decided that only by recommending Hanson's offer could they provide shareholders with all the facts they needed to make a sensible decision. Scholes cannot withdraw its recommendation and still describes Hanson's price as fair. But it has now made it clear that it would be in the company's best interests to switch technology partners to Felten &amp; Guilleaume rather than stay with ABB as under the Hanson terms. Its figures have also shown the scope for further profit recovery once sales turn, which may just tempt other bidders into the ring. Scholes' version of events directs no criticism at Hanson but its difficult relations with ABB are a reminder of how fraught relations between big companies and small ones can sometimes be.</p>

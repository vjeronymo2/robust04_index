The application package for this program will include a list of States with review systems and the single point of contact (SPOC) in each State for the review. Applicants (other than federally-recognized Indian tribal governments) should contact their State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SPOCs as early as possible to alert them to the prospective applications and receive any necessary instructions on the State process. For proposed projects serving more than one State, the applicant is advised to contact the SPOC of each affected State. The due date for State process recommendations is 60 days after the application deadline. The BPHC does not guarantee that it will accommodate or explain its response to State process recommendations received after that date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Grants will be administered in accordance with HHS regulations in 45 CFR part 92. This program is not yet listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: January 13, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> William A.

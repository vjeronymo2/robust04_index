			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WARRANTS ISSUED FOR CRA COMMISSIONERS  </P> <P> Five Community Redevelopment Agency commissioners who failed to appear at a  trial of a man they charged with disrupting a May commission meeting were  issued bench warrants Monday, but agency officials said it was all a mistake  stemming from an attorney's illness.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Municipal Court Commissioner Robert Sandoval issued "body  attachment" orders for agency Commissioners James Wood, Frank Kuwahara, Dollie  Chapman, Daniel Horwitz and the Rev. Thomas Kilgore, who were subpoenaed to  testify at the trial of a man who allegedly heckled the commissioners.  </P> <P> Robert Alaniz, director of public affairs for the redevelopment agency, said  the city attorney representing the CRA had planned to ask Monday for a  continuance, but was stricken with an illness and was not represented by  another city attorney, so the trial proceeded.  </P> <P> "The CRA attorney will be there the first thing in the morning to straighten it  out," Alaniz said.  </P> <P> The trial stems from a May 17 meeting when Wood, the commission's chairman,  made a citizen's arrest of William Hayes and Howard Watts for allegedly  disrupting a public meeting.  </P> <P> Transcripts of the meeting show that Watts openly challenged Wood on a number  of disputed points concerning the CRA's controversial plans to build a massive  Los Angeles County complex on 1st Street. However, the charges against Watts  were dropped, and the CRA pursued Hayes, even though transcripts show Hayes sat  quietly through the meeting.  </P> <P> According to the transcript, the only time Hayes spoke was when Wood directed  another speaker to use a microphone. "There's one on the table," Hayes is  quoted as saying.  </P></p>

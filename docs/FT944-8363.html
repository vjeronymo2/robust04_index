			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Polls test adds to pressure on Italian coalition The fractious Italian government of Mr Silvio Berlusconi yesterday faced its first electoral test since June, at the end of a week of political turmoil and social unrest. Italians in more than 200 towns and regions voted in local and regional elections, the first poll since the June elections to the European parliament in which Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement increased its share of the national vote at the expense of the other main parties. Within the last week, Mr Berlusconi has had to contend with anti-government demonstrations across the country, starting with a rally of more than 1.2m people in Rome on November 12 against plans for pension and welfare cuts. Official results - due today - will be difficult to interpret because of different alliances, sometimes pitting government allies against each other. In some big mayoral elections there could be a second round of voting on December 4. Exit polls broadcast by state television last night indicated that Forza Italia's share of the vote had dropped since June in the large cities, while the centre-left opposition parties had gained. However, the leader of one coalition party - Mr Gianfranco Fini of the far-right National Alliance - pointed out that the government parties' candidates seemed to have accumulated more support overall than the opposition. Mr Berlusconi is likely to be more concerned about the passage of the crucial 1995 budget through parliament, and Thursday's meeting with union leaders at which the government will try to avert the second general strike this autumn, scheduled for December 2. The government was defeated in the lower chamber of parliament last Thursday, when the populist Northern League  -one of three main coalition parties - allied with opposition deputies to approve amendments watering down reform of the overburdened pensions system. The chamber of deputies is likely to approve the overall package of measures today. Closer co-operation between the League and, for example, the opposition Popular party could make it easier for the government to push through the budget package in the upper house, where it does not have a majority. Financial markets reacted positively on Friday, as investors looked forward to possibile agreement with the unions. Mr Sergio Cofferati, leader of the CGIL - one of three main trade union federations - yesterday warned that it was premature to suggest that the general strike might now be called off. But he agreed that 'the certainty of reform and the commitment of the whole parliament and the social partners to it would be a reassuring signal for the markets'.</p>

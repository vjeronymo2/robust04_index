			<p>BFN     [Text] Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov stated  in Ankara that Bulgaria does not oppose the participation of  Turkish troops in the UN peacekeeping forces in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Ending two days of talks with his host,  Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin, Daskalov stressed that  regional countries in principle should not send their troops on  such delicate missions.    Cetin and Daskalov expressed the concern of their  governments  over the continuation of the war in Bosnia, and called on the  international community to put in an added effort in order to  end the Bosnia-Herzegovina drama. The two sides also expressed  their commitment to ending the embargo against  Bosnia-Herzegovina. According to domestic media reports,  Ministers Cetin and Daskalov said this should be done as soon as  possible.</p>

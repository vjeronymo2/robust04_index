			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article] </F>   [Text] With the DPRK (North Korea) having announced its  withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),  the question of imposing sanctions against that country has  entered a critical stage. However, the sanctions are not  expected to affect Japanese industry much because the scale of  Japan's trade with North Korea is small while travel between  these two nations is close to nonexistent.  <H5>  Trade </H5>   Japan-DPRK trade ran to about 100 billion yen a year from  the  late seventies and early eighties. During that period, Japan's  exports to North Korea continuously exceeded its imports by a  ratio of almost 2:1. But since North Korea announced a policy  to balance imports and exports in 1986, Japan's exports to the  country decreased by half [the next year] and Japan has imported  more than it has exported since 1987. Overall trade came down  to a 50-60 billion yen level.    Japan's main exports to North Korea used to be manufactured  products, like machinery. But since 1992, textile products,  such as woolen fabrics, and automobiles have been its major  export items. As for imports from North Korea, nonferrous metals  used to be major products, but recently men's suits and coats,  mushrooms, and anthracite coal have come to be major items.  <H5>  Aviation and Traveling </H5>   There are no regular airline services between Japan and  North  Korea. Only chartered planes operate from Nagoya and Niigata  Airports. Mushrooms are the major air-freighted product from  North Korea, and personnel exchanges are limited to special  delegations. In case sanctions are taken, all of these airline  operations will be suspended.    As for surface shipping, even the Transport Ministry does  not  know accurate conditions. However, it is estimated that about  100 North Korean ships enter Japan every year. With  instructions from the Foreign Affairs Ministry or the Defence  Agency, the Maritime Safety Agency can conduct on-the-spot  inspections on these ships entering Japan by sending patrol  boats, but it is still uncertain how far the agency can go in  restricting entry of North Korean ships as part of economic  sanctions.  <H5>  Reaction From Business Circles </H5>   Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of the Japan Federation of  Economic Organizations [Keidanren], at a 13 June news  conference, commented: "This [DPRK issue] is an important  security issue for Japan, and we must take it seriously. I hope  that, if possible, North Korea will soon revert to a position  that can be accepted by the international community so that  sanctions will be avoided." Minoru Makihara, president of  Mitsubishi Corporation, said: "I think Japan can make moves on  its own more actively in close contact with the Untied States.  Although the sanctions' impact on Japan's economy will be  small, this is a problem that is taking place in Asia. How will  the government deal with it if the United States decides to wash  its hands of this matter?"</p>

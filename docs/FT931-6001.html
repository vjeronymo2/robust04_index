			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / International Company News: Norsk Data to de-list shares during debt talks NORSK Data shares will be de-listed for up to two months as urgent debt-restructuring talks continue. Norsk Data, the troubled Norwegian computer service group, has estimated debt of NKr650m (Dollars 92.75m), plus an outstanding NKr350m German bearer bond programme. The Oslo bourse said yesterday it was unclear what implications a debt restructuring solution would have for Norsk Data's share capital and ownership structure. The group has returned losses for the past five years. In 1991, losses were NKr810m against losses of NKr134m in the previous 12 months. Trading in Norsk Data was suspended three weeks ago when the group said it hoped to conclude talks with creditors by yesterday. Norsk Data is listed in Oslo, London and New York and its shares are traded, in the form of depository receipts, in Stockholm, Copenhagen, Frankfurt and Hamburg. 'Norsk Data and the main financial creditors have reached a common understanding concerning the . . . long-term debt situation. A final agreement offering a dividend to all creditors is expected to be formalised before the end of March,' the company said. Mr Carl Espen Wollebekk, senior vice-president, treasury, was optimistic that a deal would be concluded with Norsk Data's creditors by the end of the month. He said once the deal was settled, Norske Data could publish its 1992 result. It was due yesterday. Norsk Data reported that Nordic Data, a holding company set up in September 1991 with the same corporate management as Norsk Data, had a 1992 profit of NKr92m on turnover of NKr806m. Nordic Data's assets were NKr547m at the end of 1992 and total equity at NKr260m, corresponding to an equity-to-debt ratio of 48 per cent. 'The Nordic Data group has about 850 employees and the long-term strategy is to further develop the group within the profitable segments of the computer service business. Nordic Data's strong financial position will be a guarantee for future long-term business relationships,' it said. Mr Wollebekk said Nordic Data's figures were reported in an effort to calm the market about the temporary delisting.</p>

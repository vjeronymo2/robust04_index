			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Standard Chartered staff given 5.5% rise STANDARD Chartered, the British-based international bank, is to award its 2,000 clerical staff a pay increase of 5.5 per cent on basic pay and allowances from April 1. An additional one-off unconsolidated payment of 2 per cent will be paid next month to compensate staff for the fact that Christmas bonuses will not be paid after this year. The increase is among the lowest in the banking sector, although pay increases generally have been below inflation. Earlier this month National Westminster Bank told its employees it was imposing a 7.5 per cent pay increase, in spite of strong opposition from Bifu, the financial services union, which is organising a strike ballot in pursuit of an improved offer. Members of the NatWest Staff Association voted in favour of the offer. Lloyds Bank is to raise staff salaries by only 5 per cent. Barclays Bank, the first of the big four clearing banks to settle on pay, agreed a package worth more than 7 per cent while a 6.75 per cent offer at Trustee Savings Bank has been rejected by Bifu. Bifu said yesterday that the pay award from Standard Chartered had been accepted by its negotiators and would be formally ratified after consultations with members.</p>

			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE TIMES POLL;  </P> <P> FEINSTEIN LOSES GENDER EDGE OVER WILSON  </P> <P> Democrat Dianne Feinstein no longer is getting "the women's vote" as she and  Republican Sen. Pete Wilson head into the fall election campaign running dead  even in their muddy race for governor, the Los Angeles Times Poll has found.  </P> <P> The candidates' standings have shifted little during the summer, according to  Times Poll interviews, but the complexion of the race has changed dramatically:  Feinstein has lost her once-substantial edge among women and Wilson no longer  has an advantage among men.  </P> <P> Apparently, the excitement of Feinstein's candidacy for women -- especially  women in the San Francisco Bay Area -- has cooled significantly, the survey  indicated. Meanwhile, she has improved her standing slightly among men,  particularly in Southern California. The result is that both women and men are  dividing their votes about equally between the two candidates.  </P> <P> For voters, the defining difference between Feinstein and Wilson at present is  not gender or any specific issue, but simply the candidates' party membership,  the poll showed.  </P> <P> The statewide survey of registered voters found Feinstein and Wilson tied with  39% apiece. "Others candidates" were preferred by 2%, and 20% of those surveyed  were undecided.  </P> <P> Given a margin of error of 3 percentage points in either direction, these  standings represent no significant change from a similar Times Poll survey in  mid-June, which showed Feinstein at 40% and Wilson at 37%.  </P> <P> In June, however, Feinstein had a 12-point lead among women and trailed by 9  points among men. In the latest survey, she is up by only 1 point among women  and down by 2 points among men -- in each case a statistical tie.  </P> <P> "The thrill is gone," observed Times political analyst William Schneider. "In  June, when Dianne Feinstein became the first woman ever to be nominated for  governor in California, there was a real sense of excitement about her among  women. In order to win in November, she's going to have to get that back."  </P> <P> Schneider added, "Her primary election victory also may have exaggerated the  gender gap between men and women voters. Now, it looks like things are  returning to normal."  </P> <P> The Times Poll conducted telephone interviews with 1,586 registered voters over  six days ending Wednesday night. The survey was supervised by Susan Pinkus,  assistant Times Poll director.  </P> <P> The poll's results seemed to reflect the mudslinging of each side in recent  weeks, as the candidates pummeled each other with negative television  commercials and harsh rhetoric. The sniping and bickering took its toll. The  voters' impressions of both candidates dropped during the summer, and  Feinstein's popularity particularly suffered.  </P> <P> The voters' impression of Feinstein dropped significantly, from 66% favorable  and 23% unfavorable in June to 54% favorable and 35% unfavorable in the latest  survey. The electorate's impression of Wilson fell somewhat less, from 60%-25%  to 56%-3l%.  </P> <P> However, party loyalty is strong. Democratic voters back Feinstein by nearly 3  to 1; Republicans support Wilson by nearly 5 to 1. Independents side with  Feinstein by 3 to 2.  </P> <P> Democratic women back Feinstein by nearly 5 to 2, and Republican women support  Wilson by almost 5 to 1.  </P> <P> When interviewers asked voters to name "the single most important quality" that  drew them to their candidate, the predominant answer was not a personal trait,  but political philosophy -- clear evidence that party labels are helping people  define the nominees.  </P> <P> On primary election day, Times Poll interviews with voters as they left the  ballot booths showed that the overriding factor in Feinstein's historic victory  was that many Democrats decided "it's time we had a woman governor." Later in  June, with Republicans inserted into the electoral mix, the voters as a whole  disagreed with that statement by 4 to 3. They still do, by roughly the same  ratio, according to the latest survey.  </P> <P> Voters also oppose, by 5 to 4, the notion that "California's governor ought to  see to it that the number of women and minorities appointed to state government  jobs is in proportion to their share of the population" -- as Feinstein has  pledged to do. This is the so-called quota issue, one that Wilson has tried to  hang around Feinstein's neck. So far, the effect seems to have been minor.  Voters are about evenly divided over which candidate they think "would make the  best appointments to public office."  </P> <P> Abortion remains a potent issue for Feinstein, as it was throughout her  Democratic primary campaign against Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp. Although  Feinstein and Wilson have similar positions on abortion -- they both support a  woman's right to decide for herself whether to have one -- voters believe by  nearly 5 to 2 that Feinstein "would do the best job of handling the issue."  </P> <P> Eight in 10 California voters think a woman should have the right to choose  whether to have an abortion without government interference, according to the  survey. Abortion ranks second -- just behind the environment -- on the voters'  list of "important issues" they are using to measure the gubernatorial  candidates.  </P> <P> Voters who regard the environment as a decisive issue are leaning slightly  toward Feinstein, interviews showed.  </P> <P> The No. 3 issue on the voters' list is crime, and this works best for Wilson.  Although Feinstein and Wilson strongly support the death penalty, voters think  by nearly 2 to 1 that the Republican candidate would do a better job of  fighting crime.  </P> <P> Government ethics is the No. 4-rated issue and Feinstein currently has a slight  edge there. Wilson tends to be seen by voters as being "more closely tied to  the special interests."  </P> <P> These perceived special-interest ties could become stronger in the voters'  minds if Feinstein should ever score with her attacks on Wilson for accepting  $243,334 from the savings and loan industry during his two Senate campaigns.  Feinstein has been hitting hard on the issue, but with apparently little  effect.  </P> <P> Three-fourths of the voters said they do not know of "any candidate running for  office in California this year who has received large contributions from the  savings and loan industry." Only one in 10 cited Wilson. But six in 10 voters  said that if there were such a candidate, they would be less likely to support  the person. Voters who feel this way now are split about equally between  Feinstein and Wilson.  </P> <P> A good issue for Wilson could be the economy, particularly if it gets worse. By  2 to 1, he is seen as the candidate who "would do the best job of managing the  state's economy and financial affairs."  </P> <P> Also, Feinstein continues to be haunted by her final year as San Francisco  mayor, when she left the city with a projected deficit of $180 million. Roughly  a third of the voters say they are "less likely" to support her because of  that.  </P> <P> Likewise, Wilson is seen as the candidate who would "do the best job on taxes."  The latest survey shows that the voters' willingness to pay higher taxes has  dropped somewhat over the summer -- a period when President Bush for the first  time signaled his willingness to hike taxes, Californians began paying a higher  gasoline tax, and Sacramento raised some taxes and fees to balance the state  budget.  </P> <P> In June, roughly three-fourths of the voters said they would be willing to kick  in with higher taxes for a specific purpose. That percentage now is down to  two-thirds.  </P> <P> </P> <P> VOTER PREFERENCES  </P> <P>  Following are results from a Los Angeles Times Poll of 1,586 registered  voters, as compared to responses

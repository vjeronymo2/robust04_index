			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> JAPAN'S STEEL EXPORTS TAKE DIVE  </P> <P> Japan's steel exports in fiscal 1989 hit a 19-year low largely because of  sluggish sales to its major customers, China and the Soviet Union, the Iron and  Steel Federation said in a preliminary report today.  </P> <P> The federation said exports in the fiscal year, which ended March 31, were  estimated at 18.99 million metric tons, down 18.3% from the preceding year and  the lowest since fiscal 1970, when Japan's overseas sales totaled 19.75 million  tons.  </P> <P> Federation officials said there is little possibility that Japan's sluggish  steel exports will pick up although domestic demand will remain strong.  </P></p>

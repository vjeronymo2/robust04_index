			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Mitterrand criticises Peugeot for cutting jobs while in profit FRENCH PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand launched a sharp attack yesterday on job losses at Peugeot, the country's largest privately owned company, in a move likely to worry others seeking to cut their workforces. His outburst came in a Labour Day radio interview arguing for strong European social policies. It was triggered by a row between Mr Jacques Calvet, Peugeot's chairman, and Mrs Martine Aubry, labour minister, over funding of early retirement pensions for the latest Peugeot workers to lose their jobs. It is 'intolerable to think that big companies . . . live by bragging over the billions they make every year, and at the same time shed their personnel', said Mr Mitterrand. 'Let them at least arrange things so that their employees receive their share of the profits . . . One just asks them to be fair and to consider that their profits are not simply theirs,' but that profits 'belong to all those who take part in the business - the workers, the employees, the others'. Mr Mitterrand's remarks are a reminder of his distaste for excessive profit-making and recall his attack two years ago on stock market investors, whom he criticised for making money while they slept. That speech was widely held responsible for sending equity prices into a slide. The bourse was closed yesterday for the May Day holiday and reopens on Monday. The attack also underlines Mr Mitterrand's uneasiness about job losses generally. Unemployment, now at 2.8m, or just under 10 per cent, stubbornly refuses to recede, contributing to the decline in the ruling Socialists' popularity and their humiliation in the March regional elections. The government has all the less sympathy for Peugeot's arguments only a month after it reported a FFr5.5bn (Pounds 550m) net profit for 1991, although this was a 40 per cent decline. Mr Calvet argues that the carmaker needs to lose 1,427 jobs at one of its main plants as an essential part of its strategy to match Japanese productivity. The detail of the dispute is over how much Peugeot should contribute to the pensions of 685 workers, who have been scheduled for early retirement by the company, and how much should come from the government. The government says it will accept the early retirements only if Peugeot pays a larger share of the cost than it was expecting. The row is as much financial as moral, because the government is facing a large deficit on its social security budget and wants to restrain early retirements or make companies pay a larger share of the bill.</p>

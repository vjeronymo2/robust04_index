			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, April 4 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Rural  development may help Cambodia to counter the threat of the  communist Khmer Rouge guerillas, visiting Cambodian Deputy Prime  Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut said Monday.    He said Cambodia wanted to learn from Malaysia's experience  in developing its rural areas which contributed to the  elimination of the communist terrorists.    The rural development policies of the Malaysian Government  were also successful in maintaining national unity, he told  reporters after a briefing at the Rural Development Ministry  here.    The briefing was given by the ministry's Planning and  Coordination Division Head Zakaria Mohamed Taib.    Sirivut, who is also minister of foreign affairs and  international cooperation, said Cambodia needed to develop its  rural areas to stop its people from supporting the communists'  armed struggle.    For example, if they get water supply, rural industries,  jobs  and so on, the need to fight would no longer exist, he said.    He said Cambodians could live and work peacefully once they  put their trust in the government to implement rural development  programmes.    Sirivut commended Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed for  playing a major role in Malaysia's success and also invited  Rural Development Minister Annuar Musa to visit Cambodia.    The Cambodian deputy premier arrived Sunday with a 10-member  delegation for a three-day official visit. He will meet Dr.  Mahathir Tuesday.</p>

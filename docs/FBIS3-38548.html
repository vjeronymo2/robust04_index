			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Press release issued by the UK Department of the </F> Environment: "Taking Rio Forward: the Government's Climate  Change Programme Launched"]    [Text] Prime Minister John Major and Environment Secretary,  John Gummer, today launched Britain's national programme for  combatting the threat of global climate change.    Published today following extensive consultation, the  Programme is intended to meet the UK's commitments under the UN  Framework Convention on Climate Change agreed in Rio in 1992.  More than 160 countries have signed the Convention; over 50 have  now ratified it, and it will come into force on 21 March.  Britain is one of the first to publish a detailed programme of  measures to show how it will implement the Convention's  requirements.    Since signing the Convention at the Earth Summit in Rio, the  Prime Minister has taken a lead in seeking to persuade other  leading countries to implement it as speedily as possible. In  his foreword to the Programme, the Prime Minister says:    "In order to help encourage a prompt start to action, I  pledged at the time that the UK would produce a programme of  measures to implement the Convention's commitments as quickly as  possible. This programme fulfils that pledge."  <H5>  Mr. Major stresses: </H5>   "The threat of climate change cannot be tackled by any one  country or group of countries in isolation; it requires a global  response. The Convention we signed at Rio represents an  important first step towards providing the framework for such a  response.    "At the same time, the measures required to tackle the  problem cannot simply be decreed by governments; they depend on  decisions and actions taken by all individual citizens in their  daily lives. For this reason, this Programme was drawn up after  widespread consultation within the United Kingdom. It seeks to  harness the efforts of all sectors of our society and the  participation of all our people in meeting the challenge for the  sake of future generations."    The Convention places a number of obligations on countries.  Chief among these for developed countries is a commitment to  take measures aimed at returning emissions of greenhouse gases  to 1990 levels by 2000. Britain is the first country in the  world to demonstrate under the Convention how it will do this  for each of the three main greenhouse gases.    For carbon dioxide, the most significant greenhouse gas, the  Programme is designed to achieve savings equivalent to 10  million tonnes of carbon (6 percent) against projected emissions  in 2000. This should ensure a return to 1990 levels. It  encompasses a wide variety of measures, (detailed in the  attached table).    For the other main greenhouse gases, the programme in fact  envisages reducing emissions by 2000: by 10 percent for methane,  by 75 percent for nitrous oxide, as well as substantial  reductions for other, less significant greenhouse gases.  Overall, taking account of the relative importance of each gas,  the Programme should achieve a reduction equivalent to some 5  percent of greenhouse gas emissions from the UK by the year 2000.    The Programme also looks ahead beyond 2000 and sets out some  of the longer term options for action that may need to be  considered in the light of the emerging scientific evidence and  the further development of the Convention. It emphasises that:    "As we enter the next Century, new and difficult choices may  have to be made if we are to achieve a sustainable future. We  will need to find ways of breaking the link between economic  development and increasing emissions of greenhouse gases." In  the transport sector in particular, "to have any major impact on  projected trends, measures would be required that would change  current patterns of transport use. People may not always be able  to make journeys as easily or as cheaply as before....  Individuals will have to reconcile their desire for travel with  their desire to protect the environment for future generations."  A copy of the Programme's summary is attached.  <H5>  Note to Editors </H5>   The Framework Convention on Climate Change was signed by  over  150 countries at the Earth Summit in Rio in June 1992. It will  come into force on 21 March, 3 months after 50 countries have  ratified (that is, agreed to be bound by its obligations). The  UK ratified on 8 December 1993 (DOE Press Release 832 of 3  December).    The Convention sets out a framework for an international  approach to tackling the problem of global warming. It requires  developed country Parties to:     -  Take measures aimed at  returning emissions of greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by the  year 2000    -  Provide assistance to developing countries.    All Parties are bound by other obligations on compiling  inventories of emissions, on producing and publishing national  programmes of measures to limit emissions, on promoting research  and public education about climate change.    Carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas. On  current projections, the Convention commitment means finding  savings in UK CO[.sup]2[/] emissions equivalent to some 10  million tonnes of carbon. The Government conducted a major  consultation exercise earlier this year on the options for  achieving this reduction. In July, the Secretary of State for  the Environment announced the Government's proposals, subject to  finalisation of some aspects of the package (DOE press release  507 of 26 July 1992).    The package was completed with the announcement in the  Budget  on 30 November that petrol and other road fuel duties were to be  increased by a further 3 pence per litre (8-10 percent)  immediately, and with increases in future years averaging at  least 5 percent above the rate of inflation.

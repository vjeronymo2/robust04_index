			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEAR AGAIN SEEN PROWLING IN TAHOE AREA  </P> <P> A large, hungry and curious black bear that has been prowling Lake Tahoe  neighborhoods for food during the last few days was spotted again Thursday.  </P> <P> The bear was sighted at about 1 a.m. near Chimney Rock, midway up Kingsbury  Grade, which leads to the Stateline casino district along the south shore,  Douglas County Sheriff's Sgt. Al Baumruck said.  </P> <P> Baumruck said that because of the reported size of the bear, deputies believe  it is the same one seen previously going through trash cans for food and  peeking into house windows during the last few days.  </P></p>

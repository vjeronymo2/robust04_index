			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Benetton team wins GS-Autogrill bidding An Italo-Swiss consortium, headed by Benetton, last night came away with the winning bid for GS-Autogrill, the last part of the SME foodstuffs group to be privatised. The winning consortium consists of Edizione Holding, the Benetton family's financial holding, plus the Swiss hotel and restaurant group, the Del Vecchio group, and Crediop, the financial institution. IRI, the state holding company, owns 62 per cent of SME. The bid was for 32 per cent of its stock, with the obligation to make a similarly priced offer for at least a further 20 per cent held by minority shareholders. The winner also then must buy up the remaining IRI shares. No value was put on the deal but analysts estimate Autogrill is worth L2,000bn (Dollars 1.31bn). IRI said it found the Benetton group's offer the best and would present the decision to a shareholders' meeting on November 4. The Benetton bid beat another offer on the table, from a Italian group comprising Rinascente, the quoted Italian retail group, Ferrero, the confectionery company and Fincomit, the merchant banking arm of Banca Commerciale Italiana. SME's shares were up 0.7 per cent at L4,086 yesterday ahead of the decision. In the first half of this year SME's consolidated turnover was L2,026bn, up 4.7 per cent on the same period in 1993. Of this, L1,370bn came from the stores side and L625bn from the restaurant business. The award concludes a long and painful attempt by IRI to find a buyer for SME's stores and motorway restaurant division. It also marks the end of the messy break-up of SME. The state-run group was split into three divisions to ease its privatisation in early 1993 - Italgel (frozen foods), Cirio Bertoli De Rica (oil, canned goods, milk) and GS-Autogrill. GS-Autogrill was first put out to private tender in September 1993 but the sale was dropped because the offers were considered unsatisfactory. A second attempt to sell was initiated in April this year, but in September the process was revoked and new bids sought.</p>

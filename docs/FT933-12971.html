			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: India aims for palm oil boost ITC AGRO-TECH and Mac Industries are among a group of companies which, encouraged by the federal government, plan to build integrated palm oil complexes in India. For technologies to promote oil palm plantation and set up crushing and refining factories they are turning to Malaysia, the world's largest producer of palm oil and India's most important supplier. During the period of the present five year plan, ending in 1996-97, the official target is to have at least 80,000 hectares (195,000 acres) under oil palm. This, however, constitutes only a small proportion of the nearly 575,000ha identified as suitable for oil palm cultivation by an expert committee appointed by the agriculture ministry. Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, the two southern states, each with the potential to grow oil palm over 250,000ha, will emerge as the most important centres for the crop. ITC and Mac have taken the first steps to promote oil palm plantation in Andhra Pradesh. ITC, whose partner in the venture is Kumpulan Emas of Malaysia, has already been allocated 20,000ha by the Andhra Pradesh government. It will eventually have 100,000ha under oil palm. Both companies are importing seedlings from Papua New Guinea to set up nurseries. According to industry officials, the success of oil palm cultivation in India will depend largely on the quality of farm services support provided to the growers by the companies, which must be ready to buy oil palm fruits at 'remunerative prices'. Initially, however, the companies will need financial assistance from the government, which believes that oil palm plantation on a large scale could make the country self sufficient in edible oil and also release high value oils, such as sunflower, for export. The government is considering the imposition of a levy on the vegetable oil industry to finance the support of oil palm cultivation. Oil palm is the highest yielding oil plant, with the productivity ranging from three to five tonnes of oil per hectare.</p>

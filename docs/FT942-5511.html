			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Aden calm despite attacks The civil war between north and south Yemen continued to rage yesterday, despite a UN Security Council resolution earlier this week calling for an immediate ceasefire. The southern stronghold of Aden, for weeks the main objective of the north's military offensive, now resounds hourly with the thud of distant explosions. But Adenis are continuing their daily lives convinced that their defences will hold and their city will not fall. Most observers in the port city consider northern units at Zinjibar the greatest threat to Aden. Located about 60 km to the east, the northern units numbering some 10,000 troops have been held in check for over a month, pinned down by a combination of southern ground, air and naval forces. The power of those forces remained evident yesterday as southern jets flew repeated sorties from Aden airport towards the east, the reports of their bombs soon reverberating throughout the city. Accompanied by sudden flashes lighting up the distant sky, the echoing explosions carried on well into the night. But the northern army continues to push. Frustrated by southern resistance lasting nearly two weeks at Al-Anad, a key defensive position 60 km north of Aden, northern army units on Tuesday opened a new offensive a few kilometres to the east at Tur Al-Baha. The move seems to have taken southern defenders by surprise. They are reported to have responded quickly, though, and to have slowed the northern drive. But northern artillery fire was just out of range, falling just 10 km short of Aden's oil refinery and outlying suburbs. Adenis are angered by the northern assault on their city. 'We did not ask for this war, but we will not accept such attacks ' said Mr Ahmed Kassim, a 35-year-old father of four. He was standing in the front room of his modest house, shattered just hours before by the impact of bombs dropped by northern jets. Southern political leaders have likewise remain undaunted by stepped-up northern attacks on their capital, continuing their efforts to form a functioning state in defiance of the north. The ruling presidential council, itself established just 10 days ago, announced on Thursday formation of a 30-man cabinet of ministers to run the government. The northern government in Sanaa accused southern separatists of violating the UN ceasefire call by setting up such a government. The southern leader Mr Ali Salem al-Baidh announced on May 21 that the south was setting up a separate state after four years of union with the north in a united Yemen. Full of faces already familiar to most southerners, the new cabinet held few political surpises and was clearly designed to maintain public confidence in the face of advancing northern hostility.</p>

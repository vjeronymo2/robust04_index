			<p>BFN     [Text] Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev believes that  the Republic has no other alternative but to pursue the policy  of market reforms and democratizing of society.    Speaking in the Kazakh parliament on Thursday [9 June], he  emphasized that the country had to face a very heavy economic  and social crisis. Nazarbayev suggested that reforms in the  credit-bank sphere were the guidelines of the economic policy.  He said that the key task was to fight down the run-away  inflation and to strengthen the national currency unit.    Nazarbayev underlined that to carry out the policy on  investments it was necessary that the inflation rate did not  exceed 10 pct per month. He said that the inflation rate might  decrease in autumn to 9 pct or 10 pct if a tough credit policy  be carried out.    In March, the inflation rate in Kazakhstan was 17 pct. In  April, it went up to 31 pct.    Nazarbayev insisted that all state expenditures be reduced  except for the vitally important ones and that there be no more  direct or hidden subsidies to enterprises.    He also considered it necessary to free prices for all goods  and services, and for bread.    "The budget must be tough in what concerns its  implementation," the Kazakh president pointed out.    Nazarbayev was against resignation of the Kazakh Government  led by Sergei Tereshchenko. "All of us can be changed. However,  there is no way to fool the natural laws. We will just defer  the agony and waste the time," he suggested.    Nazarbayev announced that the government had worked out a  new  program of anti-crisis measures. The president is expected to  confirm it in the near future. Over 15 months the government  may have a carte blanche for implementation of its program.    Nazarbayev proposed that a coalition of supporters of the  reforms be established, in which all powers and public and  political organizations would participate. He stressed that an  atmosphere of stability and national accord was required for  realization of the planned reforms.    Nazarbayev demanded that the government work out a special  program in order to put an end to migration from Kazakhstan for  ethnic reasons. He suggested that a new law on languages must  be adopted and the status of the Russian language be reviewed.  The Russian language in Kazakhstan is that of inter-ethnic  communication but not the second state one. The policy on  personnel issues must also be improved.    The Kazakh president said that the issue on citizenship was  still pressing. He believes that all handicaps for acquisition  of citizenship when moving from one country into another should  be eliminated.    However, Nazarbayev stressed once again that Kazakhstan  would  not accept dual citizenship since its introduction could  deteriorate the situation with inter-ethnic relations in the  country.    Commenting on his initiative on establishment of the  Euro-Asian Union, Nazarbayev emphasized that the CIS must be  transformed into a more efficient formation -- "from the old  irresponsible forms of integration to a totally new union." He  suggested that the CIS peoples sought this but were hindered by  the political elite.    Nazarbayev thought that the Euro-Asian Union could help to  overcome the economic crisis and would be a guarantor for  security of its member-states in the background of instability  in the southern CIS.    Nazarbayev said that putting an end to military actions  between the member-states of the future union would be one of  the obligatory condition for those countries, which would like  to join the Euro-Asian Union.</p>

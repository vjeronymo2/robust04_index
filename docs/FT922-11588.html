			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (23): A broad investment that will let you sleep at night - The international generalists / In the industry's biggest sector, you should expect neither to make a killing nor to incur a huge loss THE FASHION for clever and complicated split-level investment trusts has turned attention away from the large international general trusts in recent months. The general trusts aim to produce balanced income and growth, and are usually regarded as one of the least risky ways for the private investor to enter the investment trust sector. Assets are held in stock markets in different parts of the world, which should cushion the fund against sharp falls in a single area. Up to 80 per cent of assets can be held in any one geographical area, but most of these funds hold half or the majority of their assets in the UK (to a rough maximum of 70 per cent) and the rest in the US, Japan, the Far East and Europe. The general international investment trust sector is the largest of all investment trust sectors in terms of market capitalisation. In March, the average investment trust was capitalised at Pounds 281.9m, on a yield at 4 per cent. The spread of risk in the international funds means that this is not a sector in which you would expect either to make a killing or to incur a huge loss. 'You'll always find one sector outperforming it,' according to Philip Middleton, investment analyst at Smith New Court. 'But it is a sleep-at-night investment.' This is borne out by figures published by the Association of Investment Trust Companies. If you had invested Pounds 100 in an international general fund over 10 years, your lump sum would have grown fivefold to Pounds 585.80 by February 28 (mid-market to mid-market, with income reinvested). The return is much better than the average for the UK general sector (Pounds 498.40), but has been outperformed by both the UK capital growth (Pounds 618.40) and UK Income growth (Pounds 666.10) sectors. However, if you had put all your money into North America, your investment would have grown to only Pounds 370.20 over the same period. By contrast, someone who had invested in Japan would have been cock-a-hoop, having seen his initial investment grow to Pounds 603.30. The average performance of the international general funds has bettered that of the average of all investments trusts over 10 years, five, three and one years - which is one reason why these trusts have gained a reputation as a solid, if not too exciting an investment. A further advantage for many private investors is that market exposure and individual stock selection, can be left to the investment managers. Lewis Aaron, head of Investment Trust research at BZW, expects the sector to become even more popular, largely as a result of the change to the personal equity plan rules in the Budget. These raise the annual limit on unit and investment trust Pep holdings from Pounds 3,000 to Pounds 6,000. 'The Pep change means a potential Pounds 3bn could go into the generalist trusts,' he said, because private investors, hitherto limited to only Pounds 3,000, are now likely to sell some of their individual company shares in order to get a better spread in collective funds. However, the largest of these funds, Foreign &amp; Colonial, only qualifies for a Pounds 1,500 Pep, because it will not commit itself to keep more than half its funds in EC member states. Instead, Foreign &amp; Colonial's Pep scheme tops up a Pounds 1,500 holding with blue-chip shares. Alliance Trust is also a 'non-qualifying' international general investment trust. Industry analysts seem to agree that the average discount to net assets of 14 per cent in the international general funds, is quite wide at the moment, making the sector attractive to private investors. Philip Middleton believes the funds are 'very cheap and very good quality'. How should you go about choosing a fund in this sector? 'I can't think of a better investment vehicle for private individuals, so long as they pick a good management group with a good long-term record,' said Lewis Aaron. Some of the best known and well-performing names include Foreign &amp; Colonial, Bankers Investment Trust, and Alliance Trust. The discount to net asset value on Bankers was 7.1 per cent on March 16, 9.3 per cent on Foreign &amp; Colonial and 11.7 per cent on Alliance. The trick is to choose a good performer with a wide discount. Some investors may be tempted to go for a fund with a very wide discount, in the hope that it will fall prey to a takeover. But Lewis Aaron warns that, 'you should not buy a trust because of its discount only - it's a trap that many people fall into. A fund may be on a big discount because it is an awful performer.' Two years ago, the British Coal Pension Funds succeeded in a Pounds 1.11bn bid for the mighty Globe Investment Trust. If discounts increase above 20 per cent, there is a possibility that the sector could become vulnerable to the kind of predatory action it saw in the 1980s. However, predatory action may be bad news for the industry, because it means less diversity and less stock, but it is not bad news for the private investor. 'Corporate activity is good,' said Lewis Aaron. 'It takes the poor performers out of the market.'</p>

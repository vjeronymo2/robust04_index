			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Yeung] </F>   [Text] China has quietly stepped up preparations for the  1994-95 elections which will feature the most-ever pro-Beijing  candidates despite the Sino-British standoff, according to  sources.    A senior local Xinhua (New China News Agency) official has  been given the responsibility of coordinating the fielding of  candidates to the three sets of polls.    The main job of Huang Zhizhao, a deputy secretary-general,  is  to liaise with the three district offices of the de facto  embassy which handle district-level matters in Hong Kong Island,  Kowloon and the New Territories.    A more senior-level working group to be headed by Zheng  Guoxiong, a Xinhua vice-director, will be formed to map out the  overall strategy for pro-China forces in the elections for the  district boards, the two municipal councils and the Legislative  Council.    Mr Zheng is in charge of organisational matters within  Xinhua-- the most politically sensitive and secretive work of  Beijing's establishment in Hong Kong.    A source said yesterday that Mr Huang had been working  behind  the scenes for months to strengthen coordination among the three  district offices.    One of the major tasks of the district offices was to  identify pro-China supporters to stand for district and  municipal-level polls, he said.    Community staff from the offices will liaise with different  candidates to avoid direct conflict within the pro-China circle,  the source said.    "Staff of the district offices have often raised the  question  of whether there are good candidates for the forthcoming  elections... Such activities have not come to a halt because of  the political row," the source said.    Contrary to previous speculation, the pro-China camp would  not boycott the elections, he said.    Although Chinese officials have yet to spell out whether  pro-  China figures should take part in the polls, political groups  considered sympathetic to Beijing, such as the Democratic  Aliiance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB), have said they  will join the fray.    A DAB core leader said the party would field about 50 to 100  candidates to contest the 300-plus seats in the district polls  next year.    "It's out of the question that we should or would boycott  the  elections. No one has disputed that. We ought to seize the  opportunity to strengthen our links at district levels," said  Cheng Kai-nam.    In addition to the DAB, leaders of traditional pro-China  associations as well as kaifong groups will form the major  component of the left-wing forces.    Some pro-China figures said the scale of participation of  pro- China candidates in the next three-tier polls would be the  largest ever.    One veteran left-wing leader said he expected pro-China  candidates to contest more than half the district seats next  year.    Although some candidates might prefer standing in the polls  as independents especially in district board elections, he said  many are set to seek backing from the pro-China camp.</p>

			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> THE HIGH SCHOOLS;  </P> <P> SIMI VALLEY'S DURAN PICKS UP WHERE SHE LEFT OFF  </P> <P> On the Simi Valley High soccer field, goalkeeper Kim Duran is about as  permanent a fixture as the goal posts.  </P> <P> For two seasons, Duran's durability was exemplified with 54 consecutive starts,  a school-record 35 shutouts -- including shutouts in all 10 Marmonte League  matches as a sophomore in 1987-88 -- and a 47-5-2 record.  </P> <P> "Kim is a workaholic," Coach Mark Johnson said. "You can't throw enough work at  her. I have to send her home after practice because she wants to do more."  </P> <P> All of which might have contributed to Duran's being sidelined with  mononucleosis in November. But Duran's goal was to get back in goal -- pronto.  </P> <P> "High school soccer," Duran said simply, "is just really important to me."  </P> <P> After six weeks with the illness, Duran made her season debut Thursday and  posted career shutout No. 36 as the Simi Valley girls' team (17-0), ranked No.  1 in the Southern Section 4-A Division, blanked Royal, 3-0, to improve to 2-0  in league play.  </P> <P> "Except for overall conditioning, she hasn't lost anything," Johnson said. "She  gets tired out there, but her punts are still 40-50 yards. She's a veteran  keeper."  </P> <P> Duran feared that Johnson might not keep her as his keeper. Hence the  motivation for a speedy recovery.  </P> <P> "After being out for a month, I knew he wasn't going to give (the starting job)  back to me," she said. "I had to work my butt off.  </P> <P> "It's great to be back. It's exactly where I want to be."  </P> <P> Add soccer: All right, so nobody's perfect.  </P> <P> Certainly not the Agoura High girls' team. After 91 consecutive matches (45 of  them consecutive victories) without a loss, four consecutive Southern Section  titles (three at the 2-A level, one at 3-A) and two coaching stints by Dave  Godwin (one for five years, the second for the past three weeks), the Chargers  finally were defeated.  </P> <P> Agoura fell to El Toro, 2-1, Tuesday, snapping the incredible streak.  </P> <P> Godwin, who left the team after last season to pursue educational goals,  resurfaced in December to replace Coach Don Hagenburger, a friend of Godwin's  who had been a longtime assistant under him. Godwin has posted a 113-8-11  record as Agoura coach.  </P> <P> The Chargers have begun a new winning streak after pounding Santa Ynez, 14-0,  in a Frontier League opener Friday.  </P> <P> Hurts so bad: Surgery is scheduled Monday for Royal senior goalkeeper Nicki  Noyes, who suffered severe ligament damage to her left hand while diving for a  shot during warm-ups Dec. 29.  </P> <P> Noyes, Royal's scoring leader as a sophomore with 15 goals, was fifth on the  Highlanders' career scoring list before shifting this season to goalie, where  she is 6-0.  </P> <P> Noyes is lost for the season, according to Coach Kevin Corley, and also is  questionable for the upcoming softball season. She was an All-Marmonte League  selection last season as a second baseman.  </P> <P> "The team is kind of in shock," Corley said. "Nicki is so tough, no one ever  imagined her being hurt."  </P> <P> Junior Staci Blough, a starting striker, has missed six games this season  because of a sprained left ankle.  </P> <P> Basketball: The Burroughs boys' team finished fourth in the Mt. Carmel  Invitational in San Diego on Dec. 29.  </P> <P> The Indians (6-6) defeated San Pascual, 105-78, before losing to Poway, the  eventual tournament champion, 77-76, and Santa Barbara, 74-66.  </P> <P> Having split two nonleague games this week against Servite (a 60-49 loss) and  Alemany (a 52-48 victory), the Indians travel to Hart on Tuesday for the first  of two Foothill League meetings between the teams.  </P> <P> Last season, Burroughs captured its first league title since 1968, compiling a  17-7 overall record and a 9-1 mark in league play.  </P> <P> In the stands: Good thing nobody offered to play the San Fernando fans at  Friday's basketball game with Kennedy in a round of touch football.  </P> <P> In attendance were former Tiger football stars Chris Richards (Cal), Howard  McCrary (Cal State Fullerton), Keary Johns (Fullerton) and George Glaze (San  Diego State).  </P></p>

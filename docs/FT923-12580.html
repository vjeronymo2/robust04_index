			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy The gilts market could afford to shrug off June's initially forbidding PSBR figure of Pounds 4.2bn. Though the small print reveals a large jump in government spending, this may well have to do with the timing of payments to local authorities. There are no immediate grounds for further upward revision of expectations for the PSBR over 1992-93 as a whole. Besides, the market is between auctions, so it is free to concentrate on the better news on inflation. The latest such item is May's half-point fall to an annual rate of 6.5 per cent in average earnings growth. At long last, the high settlements of early 1991 seem to be dropping out of the equation, so earnings growth should continue to fall significantly between now and the end of the year. The 2.8 per cent annual rise in manufacturing unit labour costs over the three months to May is even more positive evidence of an ability to keep up with other European countries. In other circumstances that might be grounds for expecting lower interest rates. While ERM membership makes this impossible, the UK economy seems condemned to suffer disinflation without enjoying the benefits of growth. That is a combination which continues to bode badly for equities as much as it is an encouragement to gilts.</p>

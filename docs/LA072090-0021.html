			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CARE-A-VAN TAKES RESIDENTS TO DOCTORS  </P> <P> Unlike most Ventura County residents who rely on public transportation,  residents of Camarillo and Somis need not drive, call a taxi or take the bus to  visit a doctor.  </P> <P> In the only service of its kind in the county, the Camarillo Health Care  District offers an inexpensive door-to-door service to people who need to get  to a routine doctor's appointment.  </P> <P> The health care district is similar to a school district in that it is a  governmental entity and not a commercial enterprise.  </P> <P> The district's non-emergency medical transportation service is the only public  program that offers citizens of all ages rides to doctors' offices throughout  the county.  </P> <P> For a fee ranging from $3.50 to $8.50 for a one-way trip, depending on the  destination, residents can schedule a ride up to two weeks in advance or with  as little notice as 48 hours, said Annette Montoya, director of the Care-A-Van  program.  </P> <P> The Care-A-Van program offers residents an alternative to taxi fares that can  reach $40 and infrequent bus service. However, taxicab companies in Oxnard,  Port Hueneme and Thousand Oaks offer senior citizens low-cost rides to  destinations within city boundaries.  </P> <P> "Our service is absolutely critical," Montoya said. "Without us, many people  simply wouldn't be able to get the routine medical care they need."  </P> <P> Since it was established four years ago, the program has grown from  transporting an average of 400 residents a month to 550, prompting health care  district officials last April to purchase a new van to keep up with the demand,  Montoya said.  </P> <P> The district, which subsidizes the transportation program, now owns three vans  with space for 20 passengers and seven wheelchairs, she said.

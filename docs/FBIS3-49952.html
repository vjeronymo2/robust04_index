			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, Jan 20 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Moslem leader  Alija Izetbegovic was told on Thursday at NATO headquarters in  Brussels that the Western alliance would intervene in the  Bosnian civil war only at the request of the United Nations.    Izetbegovic, who was meeting NATO Deputy Secretary-General  Amadeo de Franchihis, reiterated the Moslem position for  resolving the conflict in the former Yugoslav republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina as presented at the peace talks in Geneva, a  NATO spokesman told TANJUG.    The peace talks ended on Wednesday without any concrete  results because Bosnian Moslems again rejected an  internationally drawn peace plan although the representatives of  the other two Bosnian nations -- the Serbs and the Croats -- had  met European demands for ensuring to the Moslems one-third of  the territory.    The NATO spokesman said de Franchihis once again confirmed  that NATO was ready to contribute to implementing any Bosnia  peace agreement and help plan any action demanded by the United  Nations.    The spokesman refused to comment on the details of  Izetbegovic's meeting with de Franchihis save for saying that it  was informative in nature and that Izetbegovic's visit to  Brussels was private in character and organized at his request.    U.N. General-Secretary Butrus Butrus-Ghali said on Thursday  he had not received any requests for a military intervention in  Bosnia and that he could not decide alone on that issue, but  only in consultations with the Security Council. Butrus-Ghali  was officially reminded of this by Russia, one of the five  Security Council members with veto powers, which opposes the use  of force in Bosnia.    Diplomats say that special U.N. envoy in ex-Yugoslavia  Jasushi Akashi said in a report to the secretary-general he was  explicitely against the use of NATO troops for a military  intervention in Bosnia.    Well-informed sources say Akashi has established that the  Serbs are willing to allow the replacement of Canadian U.N.  peace-keepers in the Moslem enclave of Srebrenica in eastern  Bosnia, and that the reopening of the airport in  Moslem-controlled Tuzla is not so urgent because humanitarian  convoys can reach the area by land.    At its summit in Brussels ten days ago, NATO threatened to  mount air strikes against Bosnian Serbs who the Western military  alliance alleged would not allow the replacement of the U.N.  troops in Srebrenica and reopening of Tuzla airport.</p>

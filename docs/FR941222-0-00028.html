			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> H. A number of commenters wanted site-specific analyses done for each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of the Standardized NUHOMS despite the fact that each licensee must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine that the site parameters are enveloped by the cask design specified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the SAR, SER, and Certificate of Compliance. The intent of Subpart K of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10 CFR Part 72 was to grant a general license to licensees of power reactors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to use NRC-approved dry storage casks listed in 10 CFR 72.214 without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional licensing review by NRC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> H.1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of commenters wanted site-specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Environmental Impact Statements (EIS). Several commenters stated that an EIS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be required on any waste facility that may be permanent along the Great  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lakes fresh water system. To say that this will have no adverse effect on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public health and safety is a prediction most of the public does not accept.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter believes that the generic ruling to use a dry cask storage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design at any reactor site is impossible and should be discarded. By relying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on environmental evaluations done in the 1970s before Davis-Besse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construction, the NRC was remiss in its responsibility to protect the people  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Ohio from harm by its licensee. Another commenter wants the NRC to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepare, at a minimum, an Environmental Assessment (EA) for each site,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including information on sensitive ecosystems, wildlife, demography,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meteorology, and geology. The EA should discuss the cask's capability to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withstand weather conditions and potential catastrophic events.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The potential environmental impacts of utilities using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Standardized NUHOMS (or any of the other spent fuel casks approved by NRC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10 CFR 72.214)) have been fully considered and are documented in a published  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Environmental Assessment (EA) covering this rulemaking. Further, as described  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> below, the EA indicates that use of the casks would not have significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental impacts. Specifically, the EA notes the 30-plus years of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experience with dry storage of spent fuel have shown that the previous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extensive NRC analyses and findings that the environmental impacts of dry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage are small and succinctly describes the impacts, including the non-radiological impacts of cask fabrication (the impacts associated with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relatively small amounts of steel, concrete, and plastic used in the casks are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected to be insignificant), the radiological impacts of cask operations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (the incremental offsite doses are expected to be a small fraction of and well  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the 25 mrem/yr limits in NRC regulations), the potential impacts of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible dry cask accident (the impacts are expected to be no greater than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacts of an accident involving the spent fuel storage basin), and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential impacts from possible sabotage (the offsite dose is calculated to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about one rem). All of the NRC analyses collectively yield the singular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conclusion that the environmental impacts and risks are expected to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extremely small.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NRC EA's for previously approved dry casks also concluded there was an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> absence of significant environmental impacts from dry cask storage at a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reactor site when they were analyzed in earlier rulemakings addressing 10 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part 72 as well as in the Commission's Waste Confidence decisions in 1984  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (August 31, 1984; 49 FR 34658) and 1989 (September 29, 1989; 54 FR 39765). In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 1984 Waste Confidence decision, the Commission concluded there was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable assurance spent fuel can be safely stored at reactor sites, without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant environmental impacts for at least 30 years beyond expiration of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NRC reactor operating licenses. The 1989 Waste Confidence decision review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reaffirmed earlier Commission conclusions on the absence of significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental impacts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given the Commission's specific consideration of environmental impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of dry storage and the absence of any new information casting doubt on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conclusion that these impacts are expected to be extremely small and not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmentally significant, the NRC is not convinced that meaningful new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental insights would be gained from either a new site-specific EIS or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EA for each site using dry storage methods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EA covering the proposed rule, as well as the finding of no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant impact (FONSI) prepared and published for this rulemaking, fully  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comply with the NRC environmental regulations in 10 CFR Part 51. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission's environmental regulations in Part 51 implement the National  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and give proper consideration to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidelines of the Council of Environmental Quality (CEQ). The EA and FONSI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepared as required by 10 CFR Part 51 conform to NEPA procedural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. Further analyses are not legally required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / RMT strike action set to escalate in rail dispute The executive of the RMT transport union last night decided to step up the railways signalling staff dispute. Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, said the executive was calling signalmen out on strike from noon on July 26 until noon on July 28 - in effect disrupting the network over three working days. This action will be followed by a further 24-hour strike from noon on August 3. The RMT said that it planned further action in the week starting August 7 which would hit commuters on two days. Details will be announced nearer the time. Railtrack's personnel director, Mr David Armstrong, said the escalation was 'vicious' and would have a 'devastating' effect on the railway industry. He accused RMT of being 'intent only on causing the maximum disruption and distress to the travelling public'. Next Wednesday's 24-hour strike will go ahead as planned. By moving the starting time of the strikes from midnight to noon the RMT executive believes greater disruption will be caused. In a further escalation, the union's executive also agreed to ballot its supervisory and management members employed at Railtrack to join the industrial action in support of the signalling staff. Postal votes will go out today to the members concerned. If they vote in support, they could be involved in the increasingly bitter industrial conflict by the middle of next month. The union repeated its readiness to negotiate on a restructuring package for signalling staff but only when Railtrack had agreed on an interim payment for past productivity performance. The 4,600 signalmen have been offered a 2.5 per cent rise, plus measures to be negotiated, involving job evaluation, a new salary structure and flexible working arrangements. The union wants an 11 per cent 'interim' rise for the railwaymen before entering negotiations on a new pay system. Railtrack insists that any increase above 2.5 per cent must come through a negotiated package of restructuring measures including job evaluation, more flexible hours and changes in working conditions. Last month Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, admitted he had warned Railtrack's management not to breach the government's public sector pay bill freeze. His admission followed the withdrawal of a negotiating 'proposal' by Railtrack to award signalling staff a 5.7 per cent rise. Regulator may curb Railtrack's profits, Page 8</p>

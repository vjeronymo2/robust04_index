			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HAHN SAYS BRADLEY SHOULD HAVE NO ROLE IN RITTENBERG PERSONNEL CASE  </P> <P> Citing "unique and extraordinary circumstances," City Atty. James K. Hahn said  Wednesday that Mayor Tom Bradley should be disqualified from deciding whether  to discipline City Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg, a central figure in the  controversy over the mayor's personal finances.  </P> <P> Bradley had requested a Personnel Department inquiry into Rittenberg's  performance last July after a series of disclosures about possible  irregularities involving city deposits placed in Far East National Bank, for  which Bradley was a paid consultant.  </P> <P> Hahn said in a written opinion that the city's Board of Referred Powers -- a  panel of five council members -- should hear the Rittenberg case, instead of  Bradley.  </P> <P> "Because of your own personal involvement in some of the events . . . members  of the public may well question your objectivity," the opinion said.  </P> <P> Hahn issued the opinion at the request of Bradley, who last week asked that he  be disqualified from the Rittenberg case, because the mayor or his staff may be  called as witnesses in the matter.  </P> <P> In a letter to Hahn, Bradley said, "The plain fact is that, because of my  relationship to parts of this matter, any action I might take concerning the  report would be questioned."  </P> <P> Bradley said that any action he took "might be seen as too lenient or too harsh  and as motivated by self-serving reasons."  </P> <P> It was Rittenberg's decision last March 22 to invest $2 million in Far East,  without competitive bidding, that thrust him into the middle of a controversy  over Bradley's relationship with the bank.  </P> <P> Bradley had telephoned Rittenberg on the morning the money was deposited, but  both men deny that the mayor attempted to influence the decision.  </P> <P> The mayor's office received the Personnel Department report on Rittenberg last  week, but the envelope has remained sealed while Hahn's office reviewed the  matter, according to Bill Chandler, Bradley's press secretary.  </P> <P> Under normal circumstances, Bradley would preside over a personnel matter,  recommending -- depending on the contents of a report -- either no action,  disciplinary sanctions or firing.  </P> <P> Attempts to reach Rittenberg for comment Wednesday were unsuccessful.  </P> <P> Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, a member of the Board of Referred Powers, said  Wednesday that the situation is "unprecedented" and that the board will now  have to design a procedure for dealing with personnel matters.  </P> <P> "It's going to be awkward," Yaroslavsky said.  </P> <P> The board was set up to act in place of city officials or commissioners who  have a conflict of interest on a specific issue.  </P> <P> As chairman of the City Council's Finance Committee, Yaroslavsky has presided  over a number of hearings on Rittenberg's investment policies and the handling  of the Far East deposits.  </P> <P> "I have never come to a conclusion about what I think should happen to  Rittenberg," Yaroslavsky said. "I think we can be fair, and I think we have to  be fair."  </P> <P> The contents of the Personnel Department report have not been publicly  disclosed and will remain private throughout any hearings by the Board of  Referred Powers, Yaroslavsky said. It is not known whether the report  recommends any disciplinary action, he added.  </P> <P> "Under the crazy Civil Service rules of this city, it is possible to commit a  wrongful act and not be punished for it," Yaroslavsky said.  </P> <P> The other council members on the board are Richard Alatorre, Ruth Galanter, Hal  Bernson and Joan Milke Flores.  </P></p>

He demanded that the United States withdraw the unreasonable  preconditions.    Reinaldo Tefelvelez, first vice-chairman of the National  Assembly of Nicaragua, in a statement March 8 said that if the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is to be settled, the  United States must withdraw its nuclear weapons from South  Korea, withdraw its unreasonable preconditions in the  implementation of the steps of simultaneous action agreed upon  at the DPRK-U.S. contact and sincerely approach the talks.    If the United States is really interested in dialogue, it  must prove this in practice and stop the anti-DPRK campaign,  first of all, he urged.    The French committee for recognizing the DPRK in a statement  March 15 said the United States must not abuse the International  Atomic Energy Agency and the international community for  justifying its sinister policy of stifling socialist Korea.    The statement strongly demanded that the United States  refrain from seeking a sinister political purpose with  unilateral demands to the DPRK.</p>

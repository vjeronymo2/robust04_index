			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON VIEW / MARY LOU LOPER: HAVING A BALL;  </P> <P> GROUPS FIND MORE THAN ONE GOOD CAUSE TO THROW A GLAMOROUS PARTY  </P> <P> The glorious galas: The Philharmonic Ball; Vista Del Mar Associates' theater  gala surrounding "Jerome Robbins' Broadway"; the Jewel Gala for the USC School  of Fine Arts; the Westside Guild of Childrens Hospital's Deck the Halls dinner  and dance; the Hollywood Salute to Dennis Weaver.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, 550 of the city's elite dined and danced on stage at the Dorothy  Chandler Pavilion. White chrysanthemums rose from silver Champagne buckets on  silver stilts. Vodka accompanied the cold caviar soup. Dessert came as white  chocolate grand pianos filled with berries. John Williams conducted the Los  Angeles Philharmonic in music ranging from waltzes to Glenn Miller.  </P> <P> Everyone loved it, giving president Liz Sobelle and co-chairs Joan MacLaughlin  and Susan Rhoades high marks. The night was a special tribute to Philharmonic  Executive Vice President and Managing Director Ernest Fleischmann. Kudos were  heady -- from Stanley Beyer, Michael Connell, Fred Nicholas, Esther Wachtell  and Gordon Davidson.  </P> <P> The locally and internationally prominent were there: Priscilla and Curt  Tamkin, Rocco (Eisenhower's personnel adviser) and Marion Siciliano (her art  tribute was titled "Music in Ernest"), Donn and Peggy Miller, Francine Bardo,  Glenn and Martha Mitchell, Dorie and Joe Pinola (off to the Taj Mahal), Keith  and Bill Kieschnick (down from Napa), Count and Countess Frederic Chandon (who  supplied the Moet &amp; Chandon Champagne), Budd Calisch, Ferrucio and Massimo  Ferragamo (opening the new Ferragamo shop on Rodeo Drive), Bob and Connie  Abell, David and Ginger Ludwick.  </P> <P> The Vista Del Mar gala drew more than 1,000 guests to dinner at the Century  Plaza and to the Shubert Theatre for "Jerome Robbins' Broadway." Good news: the  party grossed $500,000 for family mental health services.  </P> <P> Sandy and Betty Sigoloff hosted five tables of guests, including Joy and Josh  Lipman and Sondra and Sy Strasberg. Paramount were Vista's president, George  Konheim, and his wife, Eve, co-chairs Pam Schuman and Sylvia Mathes, and Vista  Associates President Jean Leserman.  </P> <P> At the Jewel Ball chaired by Frances Franklin and June MacMurray, Ed McMahon  received the Lifetime Achievement Award. His fiancee, Joanna Ford, threw him a  kiss when he revealed plans for a January wedding.  </P> <P> Jewels from the Diamond Information Center, Faith Porter's whimsies, and  fashions from Fred Hayman, David Hayes and Nolan Miler were among the  highlights at show time. Later, Rudy Varon and His Orchestra played for  dancers. Dean Lynn R. Matteson, who heads the beneficiary, the USC School of  Fine Arts, said the scholarship fund from the Jewel galas now has an endowment  of more than $1 million. Matteson also noted proudly that USC quarterback Todd  Marinovich is an art major. Big donors Eric and Mattie Stanieck were in the  audience.  </P> <P> Christmas decorating ideas were rampant at the Westside Guild's benefit in  Brentwood. On preview night, members and their husbands made high bids on  silent auction items. Holiday greens were everywhere in rooms decorated by Polo  Ralph Lauren, Williams-Sonoma, Neiman Marcus, Gumps, Terra Cotta, Silver  Birches, Foster-Ingersoll and Geary's. Giorgio Beverly Hills staged a fashion  show on the pool diving board.  </P> <P> Prepping for the holidays were Sandy and Turner Smith, Dayle and Kenneth Roath  (Roath, CEO of Health Care Property Investors, is listed in the new Business  Week as one of the top 1,000 corporate elite), Charles and Jessie Cale, Barbara  and Lee Danielson, Marianne and Norman Sprague, Jim and Nancy Birdwell, Dennis  and Brooks Holt, Liz and Dick Sobelle, Terry and Connie Lynch.  </P> <P> Roast master Stephen J.

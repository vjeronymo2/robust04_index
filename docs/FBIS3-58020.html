			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA)--The Federal Government is to allow Peru  to defer the repayment of around 150 million German marks [DM]  in public debts. A corresponding rescheduling agreement has now  been signed, the Federal Finance Ministry said today. The  agreement gives Peru breathing space for repaying to Germany the  majority of the debts, which would otherwise have been due by 31  March 1996. The repayment has now been extended over 15 to 20  years. The debts are based on credits as part of German  development aid, Hermes-guaranteed export credits, as well as  trade deals with the former GDR. Peru is to be excused  repayment of DM30 million of the development aid credit if it  uses one-third of that sum to protect and maintain the  environment.    The new debt regulation serves as further support for the  reform process in Peru, the Finance Ministry said. Peru has  already brought inflation under control, through its efforts  since 1990 to stabilize the economy: Inflation dropped from  7,600 percent in 1990 to 57 percent in 1992, and it is to be  reduced further to 27 percent. In 1991, real economic growth,  of 2.5 percent, was achieved again.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 18 May (EFE) -- The 27 OAS observers  who witnessed the 16 May elections in the Dominican Republic  said today that they detected irregularities and that many  citizens were not able to vote.    The OAS report stated that "in several municipalities,  citizens who had their identification cards could not vote due  to irregularities in the official voters lists." In other  words, the names of those citizens were not in the electoral  register previously delivered to the political parties. The  report added: "The OAS electoral mission, along with two other  international delegations, immediately presented this serious  concern to the Central Electoral Board (JCE) authorities. At  the moment, we are not in a position to evaluate the magnitude  or the implications of the irregularities in the electoral  register."    The OAS observers hope the Dominican authorities will make  an  effort to determine "the identity of the persons responsible for  the irregularities in the electoral registry." Finally, the OAS  stressed "the preliminary status of the observations. Several  members of the electoral mission will remain in the Dominican  Republic to prepare a final report to be presented to the OAS  Permanent Council as soon as possible."    Prior to the report's issuance, representatives from the  U.S. National Democratic Institute for Foreign Affairs and  members of Socialist International, SI, made similar  observations, expressed in even stronger terms. A spokesman for  President Ballaguer's Social Christian Reformist Party today  described the SI observers as "insolent," adding that "none of  them have any right to meddle in our national politics."</p>

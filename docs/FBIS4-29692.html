			<p>CSO     [Text] Taihei Dengyo, a plant construction company, has  received an order from Hong Kong Electric Power for construction  work on coal thermoelectric power plants. Hong Kong Electric  Power is building two 350,000 kilowatt electric power facilities  as part of the electric power base that it has been developing  on Lamma Island since 1980. The amount of the order is about 11  billion yen, and it will be the largest overseas project that  the company has received by itself. Taking advantage of this, it  is thinking of trying to get orders for power plants in China.    The order received is for execution of the No. 7 and No. 8  Hong Kong Lamma Island thermoelectric power stations. They are  coal power stations with an output of 350,000 kilowatts, and  will be built on a site of about 50,000 square meters. No. 7 is  scheduled to begin operation in December 1995, and No. 8 in  December 1997. The company has already dispatched about 10  technicians to the site and begun steel framework on the boiler  portion. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was in charge of design.    The two power facilities are comprised of a turbine  generator, boiler, desulfurization equipment, coal conveyor  facility, and coal incineration ash collection device, and the  company is in charge of this work as a package. It is expected  that it will dispatch at peak times about 50 expert technicians  in charge of the boiler, electrical controls, etc. Actual  execution will be left to three local cooperating companies such  as Power Generation Process Corp. (Hong Kong). However, it is  expected that company technicians will be in charge of important  portions such as the boiler welding work.    The Lamma Island Power Plant construction project began in  1980, and so far six coal thermoelectric power plants and six  gas turbine power facilities are in operation. The performance  of the company in undertaking jointly with Mitsubishi Heavy  Industries execution of five coal thermoelectric power plants  and gas turbines was assessed and it succeeded in receiving this  order.    When Hong Kong returns to China in 1997, it appears that  Hong  Kong Electric Power, which has ample capital, will embark on  construction of power plants in Mainland China. Taihei Dengyo is  strengthening its relationship with Hong Kong Electric Power by  this big order and would like to receive orders for power plant  construction work in China that is anticipated in the future.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Stanislav Kondrashov: "The Image Russia Has </F> Acquired by Its Sarajevo Presence"]    [Text] Initially it appeared to be merely a protest by an  aggrieved Russia, then it assumed the shape of a diplomatic  initiative which forestalled a dangerous escalation of the  Bosnian conflict.    Initially, Yeltsin, standing next to the British prime  minister, sharply stated that Moscow would not allow the Bosnian  conflict to be resolved without its involvement; and this came  across as a public challenge to NATO, which had resolved to bomb  the Serbian artillery around Sarajevo without enquiring about  the Russian leadership's opinion. But, one day later, on 17  February, Russia's deft maneuver had resolved the very problem  which the NATO countries were intending to tackle by means of  combat aircraft on the night of 20-21 February.    It was a masterstroke of diplomacy that, albeit to varying  degrees, satisfied everyone: It secured a cease-fire and  stopped the multiplication of casualties while humiliating no  one, each side being allowed to save face. The Serbs withdrew  their heavy armaments but not, as it were, under the pressure of  a NATO ultimatum but at the request of their Russian brothers.  The West, not without a sense of relief, called off  (postponed?) its risky bombing experiment in the Balkans, while  the inhabitants of Sarajevo came out on to the streets without  fear of shells or mortar projectiles.    And Russia? At a critical moment Russia's new partners had,  as it were, assigned it an insignificant role, while it had --  in a single move -- placed itself at the center of attention.  Yes, precisely at that moment Russia found the important and  only proper place for itself and played the role which no one  else could. Hats off! And, although we are not dealing with a  happy end but merely with an episode in a tragedy to which no  end is in sight, you cannot fail to be delighted at the skill  shown by our country's diplomats, those people who brilliantly  prepared the initiative behind the scenes, allowing the Russian  president, who sealed the initiative with his assent and  signature, to reap the reward.    Such obvious successes in the search for a role and identity  are very rare, and for that reason you are doubly delighted that  realism mingled with a sense of dignity prevailed, while foreign  policy romanticism is disappearing just as its counterpart --  market romanticism -- has disappeared. They have, by the way,  exhibited common traits -- an intoxification with the West's  prescriptions to the point of losing all sense of proportion and  sense of personal identity.    In the case of Yugoslavia this loss occurred when Russia  joined in the economic blockade of Serbia, forgetting that  history looks different from Moscow, Washington, or Bonn and  that it is not the Americans and the Germans but the Russians  who would have to pay the price. As a result we lost, I think,  in the eyes of the South Slavs more than we did during the  period of Stalin's split with Tito's Yugoslavia and the many  years of suspicious rejection of a country building its own  route to socialism. Thank God, the intolerable nature of that  loss was realized pretty quickly -- and not without pressure  from both moderate and implacable critics in the Supreme Soviet,  which has now disappeared into history. And historically strong  roots of pragmatism were preserved within the Foreign Ministry.  No one has worked so hard as Deputy Minister Vitaliy Churkin in  reestablishing our severed links with brother Slavs. The most  recent example of Russia's restored position is the friendly  reception accorded Russian peacemaking soldiers around Sarajevo.    When speaking about the components of our success, in  addition to the foreign elements, it is necessary to highlight  the domestic, Russian ones. The foreign elements are obvious  and have already been mentioned. The domestic, Russian ones  reside in the fact that essentially the whole of Russian society  and all political factions -- ranging from Gaydar to  Zhirinovskiy -- have approved what happened. In current times  such a consensus is an extraordinarily rare, extraordinarily  important, and wholly understandable thing. Not only diplomats  but society too needs examples of self-confirmation. Foreign  policy begins at home. National interest is developed and  guaranteed by a degree of national accord. It is perfectly  obvious that in the latest episode in the Bosnian crisis the  Russian diplomatic service operated skillfully not just because  it put forward a solution which took account of the real  situation and position of the direct participants in the  conflict but also because (mainly because) it felt support back  on the "home front."    And yet until quite recently and quite often more concern  was  paid to the reaction of our foreign partners. From that  perspective, we have also bidden farewell to foreign policy  romanticism, which Vladimir Lukin, who was Russian ambassador to  the United States and has now been elected chairman of the State  Duma Committee for International Affairs, persists in calling --  and with reason -- "infantile pro-Americanism." Whereas  previously the main thing when determining our stance on the  Yugoslav question was achieving consensus with the West, for the  sake of which we neglected our own public opinion, now,  especially since the December elections, pride of place is taken  by domestic consensus, which neither the president nor the  Foreign Ministry can ignore. Foreign policy, if it is to be  sound, must be based on majority support within the country --  which is an indispensable rule for democratic states. American,  German, British, and other Western diplomats operate within this  constraint, accepting it as a fact of life.    Ultimately, whether you approve or even if you don't, it is  Russian policy that takes account of Russian interest based on  Russian public opinion which is taken seriously.    Hence the respect for Moscow's independent initiative in  lifting the siege of Sarajevo, particularly if it also holds out  the promise of breaking the deadlock, a deadlock created not  without the West's involvement.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 27 (BTA) -- Bulgarian Prime Minister  Lyuben Berov today submitted before parliament a declaration on  the cabinet's programme by year's end. Providing income  adjustments after prices nearly doubled in late March and early  April and offering national security guarantees were pointed as  the major tasks facing the cabinet at that particular moment.  The declaration also proposed that deputy prime ministers be  put in charge of the social policy, structural adjustment in  economy and foreign policy, and a minister, on foreign  investments.    Prof. Berov's declaration was prompted by the demands of the  pro- cabinet Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) which last week set  April 25 as the deadline for the prime minister to come up with  his proposals for changes in the social and economic departments  of the cabinet and May 15 to submit a report on a new  socioeconomic policy.    The cabinet's first task is to restore the lost  prices-incomes balance and curb the rising inflation, Prof.  Berov told the MP's. He proposed that an interdepartmental  council on prices and incomes headed by a deputy prime minister  be set up with the Council of Ministers to this end. He further  vowed to bring the trade unions back to the negotiating table  within the framework of the Tripartite Council by the end of  this week and said the cabinet is ready to start serious  negotiations. Bulgaria's two major labour organizations backed  out of the tripartite negotiations after the cabinet declared it  freezes the salaries in the state-financed sector.    Prof. Berov said a deputy prime minister should be appointed  to coordinate and oversee the structural adjustment in economy.  This step is aimed to overcome the cabinet's failure to make a  headway with privatization, a situation which, "among other  things, was brought about by a rift between the deputy prime  minister in charge of privatization and the rest of the  ministers", Prof. Berov's declaration read without naming any  ministers. Privatization- related matters are now within the  powers of Deputy Prime Minister Valentin Karabashev. A second  deputy prime minister is needed to take over the foreign policy  issues and coordinate the work of the different institutions in  this sphere, according to the prime minister. He also said it  is necessary to appoint a minister on trade and another one to  take the lead of the Foreign Debt Management Committee and  control the foreign investments.    Prime Minister Berov told the MP's he was considering  changes  in the Defence Ministry leadership. An updated programme will  be submitted within two weeks to specify the cabinet's activity  in two stages: the first one ending in September and the second  one, with year's end. It will also specify the structural and  personnel changes to be made in the cabinet.    An attempt of the opposition Union of the Democratic Forces  (SDS) to put Prof. Berov's declaration to debates was voted down  by the other parliamentary factions. SDS floor leader Stefan  Savov asked what this declaration in fact sought to achieve,  saying it proposed no specific personnel or structural changes,  all the more that the cabinet had already had one programme on  which it was formed in late 1992. Mr. Savov further reiterated  SDS' stand that this Cabinet can no longer remain in office and  cabinet overhauls would do no good.    "The assessments Prof. Berov's declaration makes are  identical with those of the Socialist Party but what matters  here is the prime minister's actions and the effect they will  have," BSP floor leader Zhan Videnov said. According to Mr.  Videnov, the personality of the those to enter the cabinet is of  primary importance. He gave the cabinet a couple of weeks' time  to make the effect of changes perceptible.    "We expected to see a more specific programme and proposals  to underlie the forthcoming structural and personnel changes in  the cabinet," ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms  spokesman Yunal Lyutfi told a radio correspondent.    Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov, whom the declaration  indirectly pointed to in connection with future changes among  senior Defence Ministry officials, said in the parliamentary  lobbies he did not intend to resign adding that Prime Minister  Berov was obviously subject to political pressure.    The MP's accepted a SDS motion that parliament tomorrow  discuss the foreign-currency reserves and the cabinet's  foreign-currency policy.</p>

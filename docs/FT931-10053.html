			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: Warner plans global retail chain WARNER BROTHERS, the Hollywood studio subsidiary of the Time-Warner group, will announce plans today to launch an international chain of retail merchandise shops, to be known as the Warner Brothers Studio Store. Warner, which already has 21 such shops in the US, will open a further 35 new outlets, including five in the UK next autumn. If the British shops prove successful it is expected more could be opened next year elsewhere in Europe and in the Far East. The company, which could achieve more than Dollars 100m of annual revenues by year-end, is presently negotiating to open a flagship shop in Regent Street, central London. Warner is also looking at two locations in London suburbs as well as possible sites in Manchester, Newcastle, Sheffield and Birmingham. The shops will sell a variety of entertainment and retail items based on Warner Brothers characters, from Batman to Bugs Bunny. At present Walt Disney is the only other Hollywood studio with significant retail merchandising interests. Planners at Warner Brothers are considering the possibility of an even more ambitious international network than the 56 outlets that will exist by year-end. As many as 30 new shops could be opened in 1994. The flagship shop will be opened on New York's Fifth Avenue as a 30,000 sq ft emporium on three floors. Mr Peter Starrett, president of Warner Brothers' worldwide retail division, said that from April other US shops will open in Chicago, California, Connecticut and Boston. Warner Brothers is the leading studio in Hollywood, having earned Dollars 410m last year on revenues of Dollars 3.5bn.</p>

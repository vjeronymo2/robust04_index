			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Businesses prepare for a kick to the economy: Members of the CBI and the British Chambers of Commerce will have one topic uppermost in mind at their meetings this week: the timing and scale of recovery. Michael Cassell and Paul Cheeseright went to Leicester to gauge the mood there LEICESTER finally has something to celebrate and it is not just the unseasonally warm sunshine. City, the local football club, is just one match away from a lucrative place in the new premier league. While the fans pray City's promise is fulfilled, Leicester's economy appears poised for recovery, although it seems reluctant to get on with it. Mr Des Cloake, president of Leicestershire Chamber of Commerce, says: 'I think there are small signs of recovery. It's much to do with attitudes.' The changing climate, he emphasises, is less noticeable in manufacturing and more evident in the retail sector. Surveys for the city council by Nottingham Business School showed that towards the end of 1991 the local economy stopped deteriorating. Mr Andrew Ross of the council's economic unit says there is 'cautious optimism' but this is not yet reflected in a marked increase in investment. He adds: 'We are certainly not yet out of the recession.' Business leaders have always believed that Leicester's economy was sufficiently diversified to provide a cushion against hard times - but those cushions deflated as the recession became severe. From December 1990, the rise in unemployment accelerated. At more than 14 per cent, it is back to levels recorded in 1986. Manufacturing jobs have disappeared and one legacy of the recession will be a hard core of long-term unemployed. The city has a population of 300,000 and a broadly based engineering sector. It is strong in food manufacturing and has a small but developing services sector. Textile manufacture, which has for long been a staple of the economy, went into recession as early as 1988. Since then, 170 companies have gone out of business. Mr John Harrison, director of the Leicester-based Knitting Industries' Federation, says his industry is starting to perk up. He adds: 'It's not unusual that the first into recession should be among the first to come out.' The local printing industry also suffered badly, and most companies report sales volumes down by 25 per cent. The worst is now over, according to Mr Charles Mathew, managing director of Raithby Lawrence, a colour brochure printer. He says: 'Factory prices to us have been cut heavily. Inquiries from customers are up but although they appear more confident it has not been reflected in actual sales. I think it will be the autumn or even next spring before we see a real revival.' Jones &amp; Shipman, machine tool maker, also believes manufacturing industry is beginning to revive. The company last week announced more than Pounds 500,000 of new orders and Mr John Wareing, managing director, says an increase in the number of inquiries signals that manufacturers are 'beginning to inch out of the doldrums'. Sales at Rackham's, the House of Fraser department store, have been above expected levels. Mr David Illingworth, the manager, says up-market products have been selling best. He adds: 'The people with money to spend have been far more confident since the election.' At the Grand Hotel in the city centre, Mr John Jarvis, chairman and chief executive of Jarvis Hotels, says an improvement in business has accelerated since the election. In particular, companies were resuming using the hotel for training and management development programmes, which had been cancelled during the depths of the recession. Everard Breweries says it is too early to talk of a sustained improvement. Mr Richard Everard, chairman, says: 'Bar food sales held up during the eating out more in our restaurants, a sign things are easing up. It would be nice to say the recession is all over, but we've got some way to go.' Car dealers report patchy business, with corporate sales flat on their back but with some revival among private buyers in search of a bargain. Mr Peter Lowe, finance controller of Central Motors, a large Ford dealer, says: 'There is, as yet, no real sign of a sustained improvement in demand. People remain worried about unemployment and want to see further cuts in the cost of money.' Although the local construction industry remains in the doldrums, there are signals of rising interest and confidence in the residential property market. Mr Roman Toloczko, managing director of the central division of William H. Brown, estate agents, says: 'There has been a flurry since the election. I wouldn't say it's a stampede.' The greatest interest is in properties up to Pounds 50,000, but in Brown's suburban offices, dealing with more expensive property, there has not been the same activity. Just as the recession has tested the estate agents, so it has tried the entrepreneurial skills of Leicester's Asian community, an estimated 30 per cent of the city's population. Mr Keith Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East, says the thousands of Asian businesses have experienced one of their roughest trading periods. He adds: 'Many have only survived by moving into new areas and ensuring every member of the family works very hard to keep things afloat.' Mr Chandu Mattani, owner of Sona Rupa, a sari specialist, says business is still bad, reflecting high unemployment. He adds: 'The base factors for a revival are in place and there is less pressure on us with interest rates down.' Management, Page 13</p>

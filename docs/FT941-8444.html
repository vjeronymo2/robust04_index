			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading March Footsie futures fell sharply yesterday, pulling the underlying market lower and indicating further falls on Monday, as dealers reacted to a global bond market slide writes Joel Kibazo. An initial advance in the March contract on the FT-SE 100 soon gave way to worries about US inflation. At the official close March stood at 3,368, its low point of the session and a 14-point discount to cash on volume of 15,387 contracts. A further slide in after hours trading saw March close at at a 27 point discount to cash. Expiry of the index options was the main feature in the traded options. Turnover of 51,049 included 30,315 in the FT-SE 100</p>

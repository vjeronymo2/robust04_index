			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / International Company News: Banesto rescue calls for equity dilution Banesto, the ailing Spanish financial group, is to call an AGM on March 26 at which shareholders will be asked to accept a considerable dilution of their equity as part of a rescue plan. A company spokesman said that Mr Alfredo Saenz, the caretaker chairman who negotiated the rescue with the Bank of Spain and the main domestic banks, was 'reasonably confident' that he would obtain sufficient backing for the plan among the bank's 272,000 shareholders next month. However, Mr Saenz could encounter opposition from Mr Mario Conde, Banesto's former chairman who was replaced with the rest of Banesto's directors when the authorities intervened at the end of last year, and from a number of ex-members of the bank's board. Mr Conde and the former board could control up to 20 per cent of the bank's share capital. The most controversial suggestion in the plan is a 43 per cent write-down of the nominal value of Banesto shares from Pta700 to Pta400, to help Banesto absorb over-valued assets estimated at Pta605bn (Dollars 4.3bn). The spokesman said there had been 'ample conversations' with the Corsair Fund, which owns nearly 8 per cent of the bank's equity, but it was still not certain whether Mr Saenz could count on Corsair's support. If the AGM accepts the cut in Banesto's share value, the deposit guarantee fund, which is financed by the domestic banks, will inject Pta180bn fresh capital into Banesto in the form of a share placing, paying the new nominal value of Pta400 a share. The placing will make the guarantee fund the owner of nearly 75 per cent of Banesto's reconstituted capital, and the fund will subsequently auction its equity to a strategic domestic buyer - either an individual bank or a pool of banks.</p>

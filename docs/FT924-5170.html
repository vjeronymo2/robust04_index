			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Adversaries agree Angola ceasefire ANGOLA'S government and the Unita rebel movement agreed late yesterday to honour 1991 peace accords and implement a ceasefire across the country to avert renewed civil war threatening since a dispute over elections, Reuter reports from Namibe, southern Angola. High-level officials from the two sides, meeting for the first time since fighting killed thousands nearly a month ago, also agreed after a one-day meeting to ask United Nations peace monitors to remain past their November 30 deadline and intensify their role. UN and international observers attended the meeting. Mr Jonas Savimbi, Unita leader, rejected as rigged the results of Angola's first multi-party general election in September, in which the ruling MPLA party won 129 of the new parliament's 220 seats. President Jose Eduardo dos Santos won the presidential election but narrowly failed to gain the absolute majority he needed to avoid a run-off with Mr Savimbi.</p>

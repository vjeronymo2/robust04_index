			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By BUSINESS-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 12 TASS--In reply to Russian press  reports on difficulties in bilateral trade, which had allegedly  arisen through the fault of the German side, the FRG Embassy in  Moscow has asked BUSINESS-TASS to publish its press statement,  explaining the German view on this question.    The document notes, specifically, that, taking into account  the new German federal lands' difficult adaptation to the market  economy, the members of the Organisation for Economic  Cooperation and Development (OECD) had agreed to grant Germany  easy terms for crediting export trade during the transition  period. Such credit guarantees were issued to the sum of 8.2  billion German marks in the period from 1992 to 1993. This  meant that German companies could export their goods to Russia  while payment for such deliveries was guaranteed on easy terms,  within the limits of the indicated sum, by the "Hermes  Kredit-Versicherungds-Ag" company.    The point is that the German Government does not handle  administrative and technical matters linked with the insurance  of export credits. This job is entrusted to the foregoing  private firm, but decisions to grant credits are made by four  ministries: the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economics,  the Foreign Ministry, and the Ministry for Economic Cooperation.    The embassy's statement points out that the conclusion of  many contracts with Russian firms on the basis of the above-said  preferential guarantees was delayed for different reasons and  now they can no longer be applied, because the preferences were  annulled beginning from January 1, 1994. The authors of the  statement claim that the Russian side was notified about all  this in advance.    Nevertheless, export guarantees for goods delivered to  Russia  are still being granted, but now on general terms, corresponding  to the international practice and on agreement with credit  insurers within the OECD. For instance, advance and  intermediate payments, amounting to no less than 15 per cent of  the total cost of the deal, have to be made if it is financed  for a term of over 360 days. No preferential period is  envisaged.    Therefore, the statement of the FRG Embassy notes, there is  no deterioration of crediting terms, simply the period for  granting temporary preferences has expired.</p>

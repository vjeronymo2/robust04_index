			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Berkeley makes Pounds 44m cash call BERKELEY GROUP yesterday took advantage of the revival in the UK housing market to announce a Pounds 44.1m cash call on shareholders. It is the second housebuilder in a fortnight to announce a rights issue. The company is offering one new share at 295p for every four already held. The fund raising follows a Pounds 33.6m issue announced last month by Bellway. The companies plan to use the cash to buy land. Both previously had rights issues in 1991. Berkeley's share price yesterday rose 11p to 371p following its latest cash call. The announcement included a promise to increase the final dividend to 4.35p for the year to April 30 1993. This would make a total of 6p, representing a 20 per cent increase on 1991-92. The company said that the new shares will receive the increased final dividend. The company forecasts that pre-tax profits for the current year would rise by at least 19 per cent, from Pounds 12.6m to not less than Pounds 15m. Earnings per share would increase from 13.1p to not less than 15.7p after allowing for the increased share capital. Mr Tony Pidgley, managing director, denied that the company was being opportunistic in asking shareholders for more cash just two years after its last rights issue. This also raised Pounds 44m. This money had been used, said Mr Pidgley, to finance land purchases, the acquisition of housebuilder James Crosby and to expand the group's commercial property joint venture with the Saudi Arabia Saad Investment. The group had been able to increase sales, offset falling house prices and maintain its margins by purchasing low priced land. It expected to have sold approaching 1,200 homes in the current financial compared with just 491 the previous year. Mr Pidgley said the company was not raising the money speculatively but was already negotiating to buy several sizeable sites which would enable it to increase the number of regions in which it builds. The company, which specialises in more expensive up-market homes, currently operates in the south, the Midlands and north-west England. The rights issue has been underwritten by County NatWest. Brokers are SG Warburg Securities. COMMENT The trading ability of Berkeley's managing director to buy and sell land and houses is matched by few builders. Net margins on house sales of 10 per cent during the second half of last year are a tribute to the company which is well placed to take advantage of a housing market revival. Shareholders, however might feel a little aggrieved that the company has not called on banks to raise cash, especially as it currently has no debt. It is reflection of the times that companies which do not need a rights issue receive a warm welcome while those that desperately need money to strengthen crippled balance sheets may not risk asking the market for funds. Berkeley, however, could be looking at profits approaching Pounds 25m before tax next year on sales of 1,500 homes, giving improved earnings of 22p on the increased capital. The company deserves its high rating despite a yield of little more than 2 per cent on the higher dividend.</p>

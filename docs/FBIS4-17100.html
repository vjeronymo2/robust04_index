			<p>BFN     [Text] Aleksandr Vengerovskiy, deputy chairman of the State  Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, has called for  a military and political union of Russia and Serbia and for  Russia to play a more active role in the former Yugoslavia.    "It is not NATO or the United Nations that should dictate  their terms to the Serbs but Russia that must determine the  policy there," said Vengerovskiy, who is one of the leaders of  extreme nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic  Party.    At a news conference in Moscow on Wednesday, Vengerovskiy  criticized the Duma's decision to suspend debates on the  situation in ex-Yugoslavia until the return of a Duma delegation  due to leave for the war-torn country on Thursday. The Duma is  trying "to get off easy by setting up another commission, which  would engage in political tourism.    Commenting on his recent trip to Pyongyang, Vengerovskiy  said  relations between Russia and North Korea are today at a "zero"  level. Asked whether he discussed the issue of the North  Korea's nuclear facilities during his visit, he said that, when  he asked whether Pyongyang had an atom bomb, his hosts replied,  "We don't know."</p>

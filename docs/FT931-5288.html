			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / International Company News: Deutsche Bank acquires Spanish unit for Pta42bn DEUTSCHE BANK, Germany's largest bank, is doubling its share of the Spanish banking market with the Pta42bn (Dollars 357m) purchase of Banco de Madrid from Banesto, one of Spain's biggest banking groups. The move, Deutsche's first significant acquisition outside Germany since Mr Hilmar Kopper took over as chief executive three years ago, will give the German bank a 2 per cent share of the Spanish market. The deal is a major success for the German bank's negotiators, who have whittled Banesto down from an initial asking price of around Pta60bn. Although Banesto will not be paid what it hoped for Banco de Madrid, the agreement will come as a huge relief to its president Mr Mario Conde. Banesto announced a 62 per cent fall in net group profits in 1992 earlier this week. But Banesto will make a clean profit, analysts in Madrid say, of Pta30bn from the sale of Banco de Madrid. That, in turn, would enable it to almost wipe clear Pta40bn of provisions the Bank of Spain has insisted it make by next year for bad loans. Following the transaction, which is subject to banking authorities' approval, Deutsche Bank's Spanish operations will have assets of DM16bn (Dollars 9.6bn) and employ 3,000 operating from 400 branches. Deutsche Bank operates in the Spanish market through Banco Comercial Transatlantico (BCT). Deutsche Bank took a majority stake in this institution in 1989, the same year as the Pounds 950m (Dollars 1.35bn) purchase of Morgan Grenfell, the UK merchant banking group which is Deutsche's biggest foreign purchase to date. The acquisition is part of Deutsche's strategy of cautious expansion in foreign retail banking markets. In this business area it moved abroad in a substantial way only in 1986 when it bought the Milan-based Banca d'America e d'Italia. Italy and Spain remain the only two foreign countries where Deutsche operates a full-scale retail banking network. The acquisition is likely to coincide with a restructuring of the Banco de Madrid and approximately 500 out of the 1,700 people currently employed by the bank will remain with Banesto. After restructuring, the Banco de Madrid's assets are likely to amount to DM6bn.</p>

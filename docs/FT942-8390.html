			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Sharp fall to Pounds 168,000 at Delyn Shares in Delyn fell 8p to 99p yesterday after the packaging and housebuilding group reported pre-tax profits down from Pounds 998,000 to Pounds 168,000 for the year to January 30. Turnover rose 14 per cent at Pounds 14m. An interim loss of Pounds 142,000 had been caused by exceptional costs relating to Delyn's former French associate and start-up problems with new machinery at Calendered Plastics. Mr Paul Norman, chairman, said that after a slow start, Calendered improved its performance in the second half and was now progressing well. The new machinery had provided the company with increased capacity and the ability to produce a greater variety of plastic film. Reflecting the progress expected in the current year, which Mr Norman said had started well, the final dividend is maintained at 1.17p for an unchanged total of 1.67p.</p>

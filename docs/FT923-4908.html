			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / International Company News: Alcoa sells Mexico aluminium stake ALCOA, the world's biggest aluminium group, has sold its 44.3 per cent interest in Grupo Aluminio, an aluminium producer in Mexico, as part of a strategic change of direction there. The buyer, Grupo Carso, a diversified Mexican company, paid Dollars 50m and Alcoa says it will show a pre-tax loss of about Dollars 3m on the transaction. Aluminio owns an aluminium smelter with an annual capacity of about 66,000 tonnes, which was shut temporarily earlier this year because of depressed market conditions, and associated fabricating operations, including three mills. At the same time, Alcoa has bought a metals distributor, Alutudos, from Aluminio for an undisclosed sum. Alutudos operates 15 distribution centres. Alcoa said yesterday it was making an evaluation of its strategic options in the country.</p>

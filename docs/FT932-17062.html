			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Letter: Sums not done properly Sir, R M Bale (Letters, March 31) asserts that railways are alone among transport forms in requiring a state subsidy. He has not been reading his FT closely enough: your own Richard Tomkins demonstrated ('For whom the road tolls' February 13) how the UK road system demands a public subsidy at least four times that of British Rail, if the sums are done properly and environmental costs, policing, National Health Service treatment of accidents and so on are taken into account. Nobody has asked the improvements to the M20 to the Channel Tunnel to show a financial return; why expect the rail link to the tunnel to do so?

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Elf and Total resume Iraq oil exploration discussions IRAQ has contacted Elf Aquitaine and Total, the French state-controlled oil groups, to negotiate possible exploration and production-sharing accords in southern Iraq. Both groups confirmed yesterday that they had restarted talks, shelved since the imposition of the United Nations embargo at the start of the Gulf war, on the exploitation of two large oil and gas reserves north of Bassorah near the Iranian frontier. Iraq, in desparate need of foreign exchange to tackle shortages of basic supplies and to rebuild the economy, approached them to study crude oil buying contracts in preparation for the possible ending of the trade embargo. It then extended the talks to cover exploration and production sharing. Other western oil groups have also been approached, said Elf and Total. Both French oil groups emphasised the talks were at an early stage, that they had not signed commitments and would not sign anything until Iraq had obeyed its obligations to the UN and the embargo had been lifted. However, the Iraqi vice president, Mr Taha Yassine Ramadan, yesterday said oil production would restart soon, and would not necessarily await a UN security council decision. 'Certain countries realise that it is in their interests to re-establish relations with Iraq,' he told a Jordanian newspaper. Elf said: 'We are simply preparing for the moment when Iraq will become integrated into the international community. We have signed nothing and will sign nothing until Iraq is part of the international community.' Total warned against expecting an early agreement. The move is the first indication of French willingness to renew trade links with what used to be its closest ally and main trading parter in the middle east.</p>

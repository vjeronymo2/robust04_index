"It's a little bittersweet."  </P> <P> Foster, who announced last fall that this season would his last with the  Hurricanes, had a 78-71 record at Miami. His teams failed to earn a postseason  bid and attendance was rarely more than 3,000.  </P> <P> Sophomore Jerome Scott scored a career-high 22 points for the Hurricanes.  </P> <P> TOURNAMENTS  </P> <P> Missouri Valley  </P> <P> Illinois St. 81, Southern Illinois 78 -- Rickey Jackson made three free throws  in the final 1:26 as the Redbirds upset the Salukis at Normal, Ill., giving  Illinois State an NCAA tournament berth.  </P> <P> East Coast  </P> <P> Towson St. 73, Lehigh 60 -- Kurk Lee scored 22 points to lead the Tigers to the  championship at Towson, Md., and their first NCAA tournament berth.  </P> <P> Devin Boyd added 13 points and Kelly Williamson had 11 for the Tigers (18-12).  </P> <P> Dozie Mbonu scored 23 points to lead Lehigh (18-12), which was seeking its  third NCAA tournament bid in six seasons.

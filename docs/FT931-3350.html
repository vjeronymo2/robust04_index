			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (25): Charm offensive, part 2 TROUBLESHOOTER 2 by John Harvey-Jones BBC Books, Pounds 14.99, 216 pages IN HIS latest book, to mark the recent Troubleshooter 2 television series, Sir John Harvey-Jones looks back at the fortunes of the businesses he visited in the first series and offers his own brand of consultancy to a further six organisations - smaller public companies and public sector businesses. His impressions of these visits, the background, the experienced, sympathetic probing and analyses make fascinating reading. The man's natural curiosity, enthusiasm and charisma are matched by the sort of detailed grasp one would not associate with the former head of any large organisation, let alone Britain's largest company, ICI. The book, even more than the TV series, demonstrates the man's determination to see a problem from every conceivable angle. Whether he is visiting Tolly Cobbold, a small East Anglian brewery, Norton Motors or Charles Letts, the diary manufacturers, he talks to finance directors, production directors, marketing and sales heads, and to all levels in the factory or workshop, calls on retail stockists, even meets trade press editors. In the case of the South Yorkshire Police Force and Bradford Hospital Trust, he seems even more resolute to get to the root of rather different but still essentially management problems, but always with courtesy and understanding. The man is living proof that there is more to life after conventional retirement age than collecting the odd non-exec directorship, playing golf and growing better roses. Perhaps he should be pressed into government to restore our manufacturing strengths.</p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Britain's pay and benefits costs low BRITAIN'S employment costs are among the lowest in western Europe, research on average pay and benefits shows. The study, by actuarial consultants Noble Lowndes, found that Britain's employment costs - comprising pay, social security contributions, income tax paid by employees, and voluntary and mandatory supplementary benefits - are only marginally higher than Spain's. The comparison of likely living standards upon retirement shows that state social security plus private pension provisions will earn the average Briton 77 per cent of net earnings at retirement. This compares with 93 per cent for Dutch pensioners, 91 per cent for Italian pensioners and 75 per cent for German pensioners. The costs of social security in Britain are also more evenly spread between employer and employee than in some other EC states. UK employers pay 40 per cent of social costs while in Italy they pay 70 per cent. Sweden and Switzerland respectively are the most expensive countries when pay and social costs are considered against the purchasing power of the local currency. In Sweden, for instance, for each Skr100 of take-home pay, an employer must allocate a further Skr105 to cover social costs. In the UK, the employer must provide an additional Pounds 67 for every Pounds 100 of take-home pay. 1993 Guide to Pensions and Labour Law in Europe.

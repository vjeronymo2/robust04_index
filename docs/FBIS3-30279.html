Moslem Radio Sarajevo reports that three civilians have been  killed and 14 wounded when the forces of Bosnian Croats and of  the former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia Sunday afternoon fired  over 80 artillery shells on the Moslem part of Mostar, town in  the southern part of the former Yugoslav Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    According to Moslem media, the Croat anti-aricraft and  artillery units Sunday night fired on demarcation lines in  Mostar, and Monday morning renewed their attacks on Moslem  positions in Konjic, Jablanica and Prozor areas in central  Bosnia.    Bosnian Serb military sources report that Moslem forces have  been attacking practically all Serb communities and defense  lines in the Sarajevo area, trying unsuccessfully to provoke  large-scale clashes in order to renew the anti-Serb media  campaign.    According to the same sources, Moslem forces have also  attacked Serb communities and positions in northern  Bosnia-Herzegovina -- the areas of Doboj, Gradacac and Maglaj,  as well as Olovo in central Bosnia.    Moslem formations have carried out a fierce artillery and  infantry attack on Serb positions in the Maglaj area, but have  had to withdraw, with losses, to their starting point, Bosnian  Serb military sources report.</p>

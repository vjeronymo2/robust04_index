			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEEP SPRINGS COLLEGE  </P> <P> As an alumnus of Deep Springs College, I want to commend Thomas J. Meyer and  Max Aguilera-Hellweg for "School on the Range" (May 14). In both words and  photographs, they allowed the place and people to speak for themselves, and  kept to a minimum the stereotypic interpretations inevitable of "outsiders."  </P> <P> JAMES D.

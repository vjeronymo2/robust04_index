			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 23 Jun -- Preparations for the launch of a  "Start" missile within a conversion program for the use of  weapons systems for peaceful purposes have started. The  preparations are under way at the state test range of strategic  missile troops in Mirnyy, Arkhangel Oblast. In an exclusive  interview with an ITAR- TASS correspondent, Lieutenant General  Yuriy Zhuravlev, head of the test range, said that henceforth  "Topol" missiles would not be destroyed after their service  life. According to him, after modification at the factory, each  system will be used for placing non-military satellites into  near-earth orbit.    Using extra-budgetary funds, enterprises of the defense  complex have carried out experimental and design work to improve  "Topol" specifications and presented an experimental specimen  for tests at the state test range of strategic missile troops.  In Gen. Zhuravlev's view, a new rocket, named "Start," has been  developed. It has a strictly peaceful purpose promising great  economic benefits to Russia. Contracts for launching  communications satellites, worth many millions, have already  been signed with South Africa and other countries.    In Gen. Zhuravlev's view, the "Start" can put satellites in  orbit from anywhere in the world. Its movable platform and  control block can be carried by different transport vehicles.  Preparations for a launch take no more than several minutes.  After test range trials the "Start" will put a satellite in  orbit, and this will be the first step in using the famous  "Topol" system for peaceful purposes. The launch is to take  place somewhere in September, and in the meantime preparations  for using this unique Russian missile system in a new role are  in full swing, Lt.-Gen. Zhuravlev said.</p>

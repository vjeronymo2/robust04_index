			<p>920627 FT  27 JUN 92 / Mandela warns of 'disaster' in S Africa SOUTH AFRICA is on the 'brink of disaster', Mr Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress leader, warned President FW de Klerk last night. He issued his warning as further allegations surfaced of government complicity in township violence. The deadlock in constitutional negotiations and the government's alleged role in political violence have created an 'untenable and explosive situation', Mr Mandela said in a memorandum to the president setting out the ANC's reasons for withdrawing from constitutional negotiations. The ANC leader's warning came after the Goldstone judicial commission, investigating township violence, heard evidence yesterday from a mine security guard linking a police unit to the massacre in which 42 people died at the Boipatong township near Johannesburg last Wednesday. The witness claimed that a member of the unit told him it had taken part in the killings. Earlier this week the commission had revealed the existence of the 40-strong unit, consisting of ex-members of a counter-insurgency force known as Koevoet and based in the grounds of a mine east of Johannesburg. The Koevoet, now disbanded, won a reputation for brutality and dirty tricks during operations in Namibia's war for independence. When the commission visited the base this week, they found trunks containing rifles and ammunition. Two white officers were in the force, described by police as an anti-livestock theft unit. The member concerned, who also gave evidence, denied the conversation had taken place and police said its own investigation of the massacre revealed 'no evidence whatsoever' of the unit's involvement. But the very existence of the unit has shocked South Africans, and reinforced speculation about government involvement in political unrest. In his memorandum, Mr Mandela said while the government insisted in the constitutional negotiations 'on a minority veto in whatever form . . . the deadlock will be unresolved'. He added that demands presented to the government, including an international inquiry into Boipatong, were 'the minimum' required for talks to resume. President de Klerk went part of the way towards meeting this condition by offering to include international jurists on the inquiry. Last night it was announced that India's former chief justice, Mr Justice Bhagwati, and a UK academic, Dr PA Waddington, are to join the commission.</p>

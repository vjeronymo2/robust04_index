			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE TASTE OF TRAVEL: TRUFFLE SEASON OR NOT, PIEDMONT'S COUNTRY-STYLE COOKS ARE  NONPAREIL  </P> <P> Piedmont (from pie di monte or foot of the mountains) is a wine region in  northwest Italy best known for its Barbaresco and Barolo wines, and for the  glorious white truffle found in the Langhe and Monterrato hills.  </P> <P> In truffle season (roughly October to January), aficionados from Milan, Turin,  Switzerland and Germany swoop down on the medieval hill towns and country  restaurants to feast on truffles and game and fabulous old vintages. Every  restaurant is fully booked; getting even a simple room takes planning.  </P> <P> What some people forget, since so many are so focused on the heady scent of  truffles, is that this region boasts wonderful country cooking all year. And  for my money, the cooking of spring or summer and early fall is far more  interesting. The pressure is off; this is the quiet season, and cooks can  concentrate on really cooking.  </P> <P> At Ristorante Cacciatori in Cartosio, a hamlet outside Aqui Terme, Maria Milano  faces her daughter-in-law Carla across a battered cutting board. The curved  blade of the mezzaluna (a crescent knife/cutter with two handles) rocks across  the board, sending up a fragrance of rosemary and sage.  </P> <P> First thing each morning, Milano lights the wood-fired oven that sits beside  the sturdy gas stove. Light streams in the windows, and two cats watch her  every move from outside. Her chickpea soup made with pork rind and bones goes  on a back burner.  </P> <P> She concentrates on the doughs and stuffings, while Carla prepares the meat  dishes and vegetables. Son, Giancarlo, rolls out the pasta on a smooth pine  board.  </P> <P> As it gets closer to lunchtime, guests begin to arrive, and poke their heads in  the kitchen to see what's on for today -- to admire hefty porcini mushrooms,  the pheasant a hunter has dropped by, or the startling gold of polenta poured  onto a wooden board.  </P> <P> Giancarlo Milano has no use for show. He believes in the honest and true  cooking of this region.  </P> <P> "If we make polenta, it should be made the way it really was," Milano said.  "Why should we serve it on a golden plate and try to elevate this already  sublime and earthy dish?"  </P> <P> Served with pollo alla cacciatori (hunter's style chicken), the dish has a  remarkable depth of flavor. It's the farmhouse chicken. It's the mushrooms that  come from the wooded hillsides nearby. It's the polenta, stirred with a wooden  stick for a full hour. And it's the experienced hand of the cook.  </P> <P> "My mother has her own natural measure after all these years," Milano said.  </P> <P> The kitchen turns out deceptively simple dishes, perfectly executed.  </P> <P> To start, there's focaccia (a rather flat bread, brushed with garlic butter and  sprinkled with herbs), cooked in a heavy iron skillet, slender stuffed zucchini  or deep-fried ravioli filled with spinach and ricotta.  </P> <P> Giancarlo then will always inquire what you might feel like eating next.  </P> <P> A raw porcini salad? Transparent slices of exquisitely flavored veal carpaccio  with a drizzle of Ligurian olive oil? If it's mushroom season, he might offer a  few of the rare ovoli mushrooms cooked with potatoes in the oven. Or a plate of  tagliolini, a type of pasta heaped with porcini. He never insists.  </P> <P> If you'd like to eat light, Giancarlo might suggest a boned rabbit rolled with  herbs and served sliced in its juices, pan-roasted chicken or a small portion  of fritto misto, one of the classics of Piedmontese cuisine.  </P> <P> It's a mixed fry of tiny veal cutlets, brain, marrow, sweet semolina balls,  artichokes, sage leaves, apple slices and more. For dessert, try creme caramel  cooked in the wood-fired oven or zabaglione made with a fragrant moscato d'Asti  (a sweet wine) and served in a cup and saucer.  </P> <P> Prices for Piedmontese wines from Angelo Gaja, Bruno Giacosa, Aldo Conterno,  Ceretto, and Scarpa and Vietti are very low, based on what the Milanos paid  when the wines were first released.  </P> <P> Another favorite with local winemakers is La Contea in Neive d'Alba, a  diminutive medieval hill town next to Barbaresco's famous vineyards. The  setting is a 17th-Century palazzo on a tiny piazza just below the church, which  once belonged to the counts of Neive.  </P> <P> On winter mornings, the restaurant is filled with the heady scent of truffles  as truffle hunters gather in front of the marble fireplace, and townspeople  troop in for an espresso at the bar.  </P> <P> With soft candlelight reflected on frescoed ceilings and faded gilt wallpaper,  the aristocratic rooms are a romantic setting for Claudia Verro's regional  cooking.  </P> <P> In summer, the tall windows are flung open on the cherry tree outside,  old-fashioned roses fill the vases, and Verro concentrates on lighter, summer  cooking.  </P> <P> One of Italy's top chefs, she enjoys researching old recipes and has written a  seasonal cookbook. Her kitchen garden provides her with masses of fresh herbs  and organically grown vegetables.  </P> <P> A summer meal here might begin with fresh salmon carpaccio crostini topped with  the artichoke hearts, green tomatoes, sweet peppers or eggplant she puts up in  olive oil every summer.  </P> <P> There may be slices of peppery homemade salami, hazelnut bread and grissini,  the crunchy breadsticks that accompany every meal in Piedmonte.  </P> <P> Thirty egg yolks go into every kilo of flour to make her silken pasta. Among  the best pasta dishes: her maltagliate ("badly cut" scraps of pasta dough) with  herbs and robiola cheese, and her carbonara monferrato sauced with raw egg,  Parmesan and pancetta (Italian bacon), and showered with fresh fava beans,  asparagus and zucchini.  </P> <P> Next might come salmon or trout in a gritty hazelnut sauce, tender little lamb  chops with thyme or pigeon alla diavola, cooked rare. One very old Piedmontese  dish is finanziera, a rich innards stew with cockscombs, an essential  ingredient.  </P> <P> Her version transforms it with spring peas, asparagus, fresh fava beans, bits  of zucchini and the requisite marrow, and cockscombs (yes, the real thing --  crunchy little zigzags) in a sauce with lots of herbs.  </P> <P> Or she might make Tonino Verro's grandmother's recipe for braised duck, serving  it with a bundle of slender asparagus, tiny pan-roasted potatoes and peas with  pancetta on a bed of creamy polenta.  </P> <P> For dessert, there's lemon or grape sorbetto, moist hazelnut torta with honey,  or bonet, a loaf-shaped coffee or chocolate custard, cut in slices.  </P> <P> Tonino Verro is the ebullient host and maitre d', and he seems to be everywhere  at once -- on the phone, making appointments for clients and guests to visit  winemakers, rushing off to Imperia on the Ligurian coast to pick up a special  olive oil, or up the precipitous drive to Castelmagno to buy cheese made in  mountain villages there.  </P> <P> He's also got an excellent, broad-ranging cellar of Piedmontese wines, and a  good selection of grappas at the bar.  </P> <P> Lidia Alciati at the more formal Guido, a Michelin two-star restaurant in  Costigliole d'Asti, cooks only in the evenings and then only by reservation and  never for more than 36 people.  </P> <P> That's because, unlike a French two-star restaurant, she has no brigade of  junior cooks slaving away cutting vegetables, skimming stock and saucing  plates.  </P> <P> The middle son, Ugo, now bakes bread and exquisitely light pastries under his  mother's tutelage, but other than that, Alciati is entirely alone in the  kitchen and insists on cooking every dish herself. That may be why the food is  so consistently good.  </P> <P> Alciati is a traditionalist who's most at home cooking the classics of  Piedmontese cuisine, yet her presentations are austerely elegant: a dome of  duck liver mousse is crowned with shaved white truffles, a cold rabbit  galantine garnished with strawberry-scented aspic.  </P> <P> But it's taste that's most important to her -- the rich shock of her wild  mushroom soup enriched with egg yolks and Parmesan, or her ethereal handmade  agnolotti (a variety of raviolo) with a subtle stuffing of chopped veal and  pork roasts, cheese and greens.  </P> <P> She might have venison or succulent capretto (roasted kid) fed on sweet spring  grasses, or a stracotto (a veal or beef stew) cooked in the same '78 Barolo her  husband Guido pours to accompany it.  </P> <P> Guido Alciati knows every inch of the Langhe hills, every plot of vines, every  cellar. He logs almost 100,000 miles on his car every year in search of the  best local ingredients.  </P> <P> He visits the farmer who raises capretto (kid) or baby goat for him, stops by  another for the zucchini flowers and fresh herbs. He has special sources for  tender robiola di Roccaverrano made from half goat's milk, half pecora or  sheep's milk.  </P> <P> And his truly extraordinary cellar is filled with thousands of bottles of  Barbarescos and Barolos laid down years ago, and served only when he deems them  ready to drink. He buys only in the good years and in quantity. Prices for  these top wines are still astonishingly low.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Finding the Restaurants  </P> <P> Restaurants: Ristorante Cacciatori, Via Morena 30, Cartosio, Italy. Call (0144)  40123.

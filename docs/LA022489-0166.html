			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> 2 CHILDREN DIE, 7 STRICKEN BY ILLNESS BELIEVED SPREAD AT CHURCH SOCIAL  </P> <P> Two children died and at least seven others were hospitalized after suddenly  coming down with an unexplained illness they apparently developed while  attending a social gathering at a Samoan church in Hacienda Heights,  authorities said today.  </P> <P> A number of adults who were at the gathering also became ill.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Fire Department spokeswoman Arden Beer said the children who  died lived in the same house, although it was not immediately known whether  they were related.  </P> <P> Toby Staheli, a spokeswoman for the Communicable Disease Control section of the  county Health Department, said the agency is investigating what may have caused  the deaths but has not reached any definite conclusions.  </P> <P> She said investigators are looking into the possibility the illness may be  related to a recent outbreak of measles in Long Beach that left two other  Samoan children dead.  </P></p>

BMW said Rover engineers visited its Munich headquarters last week to discuss the deal. The BMW six-cylinder diesel engine is widely recognised as one of the best car diesel engines in production. It is understood that BMW is also in negotiations with General Motors Europe to supply the diesel engine for use in GM's new generation Opel and Vauxhall Omega executive car to be launched next year.

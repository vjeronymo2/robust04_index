			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Recovery hopes given boost by CBI survey HOPES OF a revival in UK consumer demand have been given a boost by the latest distributive trades survey from the Confederation of British Industry. The survey, released early today, found that Britain's retail, wholesale and motor trades increased volume sales in January compared with a year ago at a faster rate than expected. According to the CBI, the distributive trades increased their sales slightly last month compared with December. If the CBI's findings are backed by signs of recovery in December's industrial production figures, due out today, and by tomorrow's official January retail sales figures, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will be able to frame his Budget on March 16 with greater confidence that the UK economy is moving out of recession. The CBI survey, which polled companies with 15,000 outlets in retailing, wholesaling and the motor trades, found that retailers in January experienced their strongest increase in sales on an annual basis since May last year. Wholesalers reported higher sales compared with a year ago after three consecutive months of decline, while motor traders reported their strongest year-on-year increase in sales for four years. Motor traders and wholesalers said they expected a further strong increase in sales this month, with motor traders reporting on balance that their stocks are less than adequate to meet expected demand. However, Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel, warned that it was too early to be sure that the recovery in consumer spending is sustainable. 'Despite the overall improvement in retail sales, the picture is still very mixed across different sectors,' he said. Retail sales boost, Page 9</p>

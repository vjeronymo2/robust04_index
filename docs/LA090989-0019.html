Revenue rose 24% to $1.02  billion. The company said higher interest and depreciation costs related to an  expansion program kept profits lower than in last year's first quarter.  However, it also noted that after losing money in the final quarter of fiscal  1989, the company did return to profitability.  </P></p>

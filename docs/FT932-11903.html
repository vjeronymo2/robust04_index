			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / UK Company News: Kwik Save mounts advance to Pounds 61m KWIK SAVE, Britain's largest discount grocery retailer, yesterday reported a 19.1 per cent increase to Pounds 61m in interim pre-tax profits despite growing competition. However, the group cautioned that it did not expect to maintain this level of growth against a comparatively stronger second half last year. Earnings per share of 26.5p for the 28 weeks to March 13 were 18.9 per cent ahead of the 22.29p recorded a year earlier. The interim dividend is increased 15 per cent to 5.4p (4.7p). Mr Graeme Seabrook, the chief executive who is leaving next month to become managing director of Dairy Farm International, the Hong Kong-based group which owns 28 per cent of Kwik Save, said the results demonstrated the continued success of the group's 'no-nonsense' approach to food retailing. He will be replaced by Mr Graeme Bowler who has been running Franklins, Dairy Farm's wholly owned Australian subsidiary. Yesterday, Mr Seabrook acknowledged the growing competition in the discount grocery sector but brushed aside suggestions that Kwik Save's margins could come under increasing pressure. He said the group had continued to make 'substantial gains' in market share in a strongly competitive environment and was continuing to reduce overheads as a percentage of sales, in part by investing heavily in new technology. Sales, including VAT, grew 14.3 per cent in the first half to Pounds 1.49bn (Pounds 1.31bn). Underlying volume from like-for-like sales rose 8 per cent, while the 35 new stores opened during the period added 6 per cent. The group operates more than 788 stores and its recently accelerated expansion plans call for opening at least one new store a week, including its first in Scotland. It has also recently launched a range of own-label No Frills generic products which will be sold alongside discounted branded groceries in all its stores. Drinks and tobacco, sold through the Liquorsave off-licence chain, increased slightly as a percentage of total sales and represented about 23 per cent of the total mix. Overall, grocery sales rose 13.4 per cent while lower-margin liquor sales increased 18.7 per cent. Mr Seabrook said grocery margins were consistent with the previous year and liquor/tobacco margins slightly improved. Operating profit increased 16.3 per cent to Pounds 61.4m (Pounds 52.8m), including Pounds 10.3m (Pounds 8.6m) of rental income mostly derived from in-store concessions. Net interest costs fell to Pounds 400,000 (Pounds 1.6m) and the group ended the period with net cash balances of Pounds 25.9m. The group expects to maintain a low level of underlying borrowings.

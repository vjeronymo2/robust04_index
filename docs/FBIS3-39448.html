			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- On Thursday [17 February], the Federal  Government expressed regret about the "unilateral" Greek trade  blockade against Macedonia. The blockade of the access to the  sea is "noted with concern," Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin  Erdmann stated on inquiry. Thus, the Federal Government has  taken up a position against a European Union [EU] partner who is  also holding the EU Presidency in the first half of 1994. The  Federal Government wants "more and not less stability" in the  region.    FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel will broach the new  development within the framework of the EU troika, which had  previously announced it would meet in Athens this Friday. The  troika consists of Kinkel and the foreign ministers of Greece  and Belgium. The three acting EU foreign ministers wanted to  discuss the Russian attitude toward the Bosnian crisis and the  NATO ultimatum. Greece's announcement that it will block  Macedonia's only access to the sea has obviously surprised the  ministers.    Now the extraordinary case might come to pass that Greece  must expect a contrary decision by the Brussels Commission. The  Bonn Foreign Ministry pointed out that an EU member "simply  cannot" block "the trade routes of other EU members" who want to  conduct trade with the Republic of Macedonia through Salonika.</p>

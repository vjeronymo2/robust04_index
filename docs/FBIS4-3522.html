			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Ye Jundong (0673 0193 2639)] </F>   [Text] Guangzhou, 21 Apr (XINHUA) -- Centralized,  province-wide operations to find and halt the production and  sales of pirated audiovisual products launched by Guangdong  authorities have yielded initial results. The Guangzhou City  Copyright Administration today destroyed publicly more than  63,000 pirated compact and laser discs and audio and video tapes.    As revealed by the person-in-charge of the Guangdong  Provincial Copyright Administration, the province-wide  centralized operations against compact and laser discs started  at 1300 on the 19th. Well-thought out plans and joint raids by  the city's copyright administrations, public security personnel,  administrations for industry and commerce, news and radio and  television broadcasting units scored good results.    Judging by incomplete figures, as of 0400 GMT on 20 April,  province-wide, 1,657 vendors had been searched, and 140,000  compact discs, 1,322 laser discs, and 85,000 audio and visual  tapes had been seized. Operations in Guangzhou, Shenzhen,  Zhuhai, and some other places were especially large. Guangzhou,  for example, on 19 April launched a citywide "Action Week on  Enforcing Copyright Laws and Protecting Intellectual Property  Rights" activity in conjunction with inspections and raids.    The person-in-charge said that since China became a  signatory  to the "Bern Convention," "Universal Copyright Convention," and  the "Convention on Sound-Recording Products," copyright  protection in China has been incorporated into the international  copyright system. Guangdong provincial departments attached  great importance to protecting intellectual property rights, and  last year launched six operations against illegal publishing  activities, and another operation devoted to cracking down on  illegal audiovisual products was launched at the end of the year.    At present, local authorities are continuing such raids on  the basis of local practical conditions. Provincial departments  are formulating a range of measures to strengthen standard  management on the processing, dubbing, wholesaling, and selling  of audiovisual products. It has been learned that the Guangdong  authorities will place all the province's 16 compact  disc-producing factories under the charge of the press and  publications departments when the current rectification is over.  The provincial copyright administration has drawn up methods  for registering, scrutinizing, and verifying copyrights for  compact disc production. From now on, authorities will pursue a  "permit-first-and-license-later" procedure on wholesaling and  selling audiovisual products; that is, operators must obtain  operating permits from concerned departments before getting  their operating licenses. Customs will also be stepping up  operations against the smuggling of audiovisual products to stop  the influx of illegal overseas publications.</p>

			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / The George Walker Acquittal: Heavy blow for Serious Fraud Office The acquittal of Mr George Walker, the former head of the Brent Walker group, is a heavy blow for the Serious Fraud Office that has come at a particularly sensitive time. Its entire future is under consideration. The attorney general, Sir Nicholas Lyell, will soon decide whether to wrap up the office in its current guise and merge it into the Crown Prosecution Service - or to expand its size and operations. His decision is expected within two months. The perception of the office inside and outside the City will be crucial to the politics of Sir Nicholas' decision. To expand the office would require an expression of ministerial confidence. To place it under CPS control would be seen by some as an admission that the original thinking behind the office was misconceived. Within the SFO there is common agreement that the forthcoming Maxwell trial will be the ultimate test of its credibility. However, the failure of such a high-profile case as Mr Walker's will undoubtedly make it more difficult for Sir Nicholas to endorse the SFO's operations. So after Blue Arrow and Mr Roger Levitt, what went wrong for the SFO this time? Some defence lawyers complained the case was too large and, lasting 4 1/2 months, too long. However, at no stage in the trial did the prosecution suffer any disastrous collapse of parts of its case. No witness gave evidence which left its case fatally flawed. The case was very dependent upon the jury following complicated flow-charts which outlined the transfers of money. However, lawyers involved felt the issues were put across clearly to the jury. The jury was told not to consider one theft charge brought against Mr Walker, but this was considered a minor setback. The prosecution's case appeared intact and the SFO's lawyers were reasonably confident to the end. The SFO's allegations were that Mr Walker had orchestrated the fraudulent boosting of profits by some Pounds 19m between 1984 and 1989. He had done this, it claimed, through bogus film rights transactions handled by the Brent Walker film division. The office alleged that effectively, Brent Walker was funding its own profits and to cover this up the money transfers were disguised through a complex laundering operation involving off-shore companies and family trusts in the Bahamas and the Isle of Man. The prosecution said this took place at a critical time - when the Brent Walker group was expanding from being a medium-size company in the property and leisure sector to becoming a big-time organisation. The fraud was necessary, the prosecution claimed, to attract the support of investors and banks which was necessary for the expansion. Mr Walker's defence was robust. Giving evidence from the witness box for more than a week, he repeatedly insisted he was innocent. He denied the prosecution was correct in its insistence that the profits had been inflated at all. Confronted with evidence of the money transfers, Mr Walker maintained he had little or no personal involvement. Mr Walker stressed repeatedly to the jury that he was the chairman and chief executive of an extremely large and busy company. The transactions complained of amounted to a mere fraction of his daily workload, he said. Although he was involved in the principles of decision-taking about deals, he left the detailed work to senior executives he trusted. If they brought him documents to sign, he would do so without question, he said. Two such executives featured largely in the trial - Mr John Quested, a former managing director of the film division, and Mr Donald Anderson, the subsidiary's former finance director. Both men had been accused by the prosecution of being part of the conspiracy to falsify accounts. Mr Anderson left the UK shortly before a warrant was issued for his arrest. His whereabouts are still unknown. Mr Walker himself expressed his trust and faith in the integrity of both men. However, his lawyers, while still disputing that anything illegal had taken place, nevertheless pointed the finger of any blame firmly in the direction of Mr Quested and Mr Anderson. One piece of evidence may have worked in Mr Walker's favour and helped convince the jury of his innocence. One of the documents relating to the alleged money laundering bore Mr Walker's signature. Mr Walker had maintained from the start of the inquiry that this was a forgery. This was confirmed during the trial by a hand-writing expert. Those at the SFO involved will now re-examine their handling of the case to try to establish where they might have gone wrong. The SFO was yesterday making no official comment on the outcome, but those inside the office were bracing themselves for another dousing in the cold water of bad publicity.</p>

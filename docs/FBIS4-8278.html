			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 11 (CTK) -- Loic Bouvard, chairman of  the North Atlantic Assembly (NAA), and Peter Corterier, NAA  secretary, are convinced that the Czech Republic should have  "differentiated status" within the Partnership for Peace  programme, in comparison to some other post-communist countries,  which are "less fit for integration".    They said they considered the Partnership for Peace a step  towards full NATO membership, Czech Deputy Chairman Jan Kalvoda  told journalists after his meeting today with the two  representatives, who arrived in Prague on Sunday [10 April].    Kalvoda quoted Corterier as saying he had registered "more  accommodating stances" towards the Czech Republic's admission to  NATO in parliaments of NATO member countries than on the level  of NATO representatives. Kalvoda refused to specify which the  countries "less fit for integration" were, according the guests  from the NAA, saying that no Czech Republic's direct neighbor  was among them.    He said he had discussed with the NAA representatives the  ways of Czech Republic's coping with the infiltration of the  exponents of the former, communist regime in the new democratic  structures. Asked by CTK in this connection, Kalvoda said that  he considered the passage of the screening law a correct  legitimate act. However, he added he was personally  dissatisfied with judicial punishments for concrete wrongdoing.    "The principle of individual responsibility could be applied  to more people," Kalvoda said, stressing that the issue was  fully in the courts' jurisdiction.    The Screening Law, adopted by the Czechoslovak parliament in  1991, bans from high government and economic posts until 1996  peopled linked to the former communist StB secret police,  Communist Party officials and members of the People's Militia.    Bouvard and Corterier today also met with Czech Economics  Minister Karel Dyba. Dyba informed journalists after the  meeting that he had discussed with the NAA guests mainly the  economic situation in the Czech Republic and the country's  relations towards the European Union and NATO.</p>

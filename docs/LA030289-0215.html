			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 'BETTER FOR HEALTH';  </P> <P> SOVIETS UNCORK CAMPAIGN TO SELL NEW SUPERVODKA  </P> <P> Under Lenin's dour gaze from a giant portrait, Soviet officials uncorked their  new export supervodka and hustled American guests like born-again capitalists,  with grins, backslaps and heaping bowls of caviar.  </P> <P> Glasnost was in full flower Wednesday night at the Soviet Embassy, and warm  feelings of "openness" were stoked by frequent gulps of Stolichnaya Cristall,  the ultra-premium Russian vodka that will appear on liquor store shelves in 10  American cities, including Los Angeles, this week.  </P> <P> "You might ask, what is the difference between Stolichnaya and Stolichnaya  Cristall," Soviet Ambassador Yuri V. Dubinin smilingly told the happy throng.  "I suspect the effect is just the same, but Stolichnaya Cristall is better for  your health."  </P> <P> If Dubinin and his marketing comrades get their way, Stolichnaya Cristall will  be good for the health of the Soviet economy, which suffers from a shortage of  hard Western currencies.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department says the United States imported a record $1.7 billion  in Soviet goods last year, compared with U.S. exports of nearly $2.8 billion to  the Soviet Union. The U.S. export figure, representing largely grain, was up  87% from the previous year but below the record $3.6 billion in 1979 before the  Soviet invasion of Afghanistan prompted a U.S. embargo.  </P> <P> Stolichnaya Cristall, like the older Stolichnaya brand, is bought by PepsiCo  Inc. for resale in the United States.  </P> <P> Stolichnaya Cristall is named for the Cristall distillery in Moscow, one of the  two plants that produce the prestige export vodka. The latest version,  developed in 1982, is made from the finest winter wheat and the purest spring  waters from the Moscow region.  </P> <P> Drawn from the finest 5% of the alcohol that trickles through three sets of  activated charcoal filters, Stolichnaya Cristall is "like taking the cream off  the top of the milk," a PepsiCo official said.  </P> <P> Retail U.S. prices will be ultra-premium as well. A bottle of Stolichnaya  Cristall will sell for $18 to $20 retail.  </P></p>

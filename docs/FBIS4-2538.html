			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The provincial united front work conference was  held in Changchun on 8 April. At the conference, the guidelines  of the national united front work conference were relayed and  implemented, and demands were set on the province's united front  work in the future.    He Zhukang, secretary of the provincial party committee,  attended the conference and made a speech. He said: The  party's united front work is extremely important to the new  historical period. Major indicators are: The scale of the  united front work is even wider, tasks even more important, and  [words indistinct]. Thus, the united front work can only be  strengthened rather than being neglected. The goal of the  united front work lies in mass unity and mass alliance. By  unity and alliance, we mean making friends with people on all  sides.

Without the  knowledge on market economy and on new and high technology, it  will be very difficult for cadres to do the united front work  well. United front cadres must not only study Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on the socialism with Chinese characteristics  but also study the theory on market economy and the knowledge in  various other aspects so that they can raise the united front  work in the new period to a new level.

			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / International Company News: Safeway sees third-quarter fall in income SAFEWAY said it expects its third-quarter net income to be about half of the previous year's Dollars 36.1m, excluding extraordinary items, Reuter reports from California. The supermarket chain said it expected its third quarter ending September 5 to reflect continued pressure on sales and margins. Safeway's 1991 third-quarter net was Dollars 36.1m before a charge of Dollars 12.7m on early retirement of debt and a gain of Dollars 16.9m on the stock offering of an affiliate. ***** DOMINION Textile, Canada's only surviving integrated textile group, has sold its Wayn-Tex carpet-backing manufacturing unit in the US to Mancuso, the New York merchant bank for CDollars 72m (USDollars 61m), writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. The sale is a key part of Domtex's restructuring. The company is reducing debt and concentrating on fewer product lines, while developing its international business in the US, Europe and Asia. It is keeping its US non-woven fabrics subsidiary. ***** CANADIAN Pacific is ready to sell its Canpar parcel delivery unit if a long search for a strategic partner to help modernise it fails, writes Robert Gibbens. Canpar has been loss-making for the past three years and CP says its trucking unit can no longer support it. Canpar has annual sales of CDollars 100m and 1,700 employees. ***** EMLAK Bankasi, Turkey's third largest bank in terms of assets and deposits, is negotiating to start a new trade finance bank in Italy in a joint venture with Banco Ambrosiano Veneto of Milan, writes John Murray Brown. The new bank, to be capitalised at Dollars 20m, will provide merchant banking facilities to take advantage of Turkey's expanding trade with Italy. Emlak will provide 80 per cent of the equity, its Italian partners putting up the balance. ***** HAGEMEYER, the Netherlands-based international trading company, reported a 25 per cent climb in first-half net profit to Fl 42.1m (Dollars 26.6m) from Fl 33.6m during the same period a year earlier, writes David Brown. However, the company expected its growth rate to moderate during the second half, due to the weakening outlook for the European consumer electronics and automotive markets and instability of the US dollar exchange rate. Consolidated net turnover advanced by 28 per cent to Fl 1.61bn from Fl 1.25bn. Operating profit also rose 28 per cent to Fl 83.1m from Fl 64.4m.</p>

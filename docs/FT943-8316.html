			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Australia raises interest rates The Australian Reserve Bank yesterday raised official interest rates by 0.75 percentage point to 5.5 per cent, the first rise in five years, Emilia Tagaza reports from Melbourne. The rise is aimed at keeping Australia's underlying rate of inflation at about 2-3 per cent and preventing the economy, which has grown by 5 per cent, from overheating. Until a fortnight ago, Prime Minister Paul Keating and Mr Ralph Willis, the federal treasurer, had tried to delay the increase, saying that inflation was manageable and that business borrowing for investment was still slow. However, the continuing increase in employment and the strong growth in building approvals and home lending have sparked concern over inflationary pressures. The timing of the Reserve Bank's announcement was finally influenced by the latest rise in US interest rates, the fifth increase in that country since February. The financial markets expect the Reserve Bank move to be only the first in a series of interest rate increases. Mr Chris Caton, chief economist at the Bankers' Trust Australia, said rates could be expected to go up again towards the end of the year or early next year. He said rates could peak at 8 per cent, well below the 18 per cent high reached in January 1990.</p>

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Prince dissolves Vaduz parliament FAITHFUL to his threat, Prince Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein dissolved his tiny principality's 25-seat parliament, setting off the second general election campaign this year. The prince, the last reigning monarch in Europe with real power, left little doubt that his ruling was aimed to discomfit the parliamentarians who had earlier this week sacked Mr Markus Buchel, their prime minister in a vote of confidence. 'In my view, this was no reason for confidence in him to be withdrawn,' the prince said at a press conference yesterday in Vaduz. Mr Buchel's own party, the conservative Progressive Citizens' party, complained that he had become unco-operative with other members of the government. They hoped to be able to replace him without having to face a fresh election. But the prince observed dryly that these complaints did not emerge until the prime minister had chosen a member of the opposition party to become head of the civil service. The elections are likely to be held on October 23. This is the second time in less than a year that Hans-Adam has flexed his princely muscles. Last October, he threatened to dissolve parliament unless it followed his guidance in promoting Liechtenstein's membership in the European Economic Area.</p>

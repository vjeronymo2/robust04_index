			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Charity Fund Investment (8): Alarms and diversions  -The national lottery BRITAIN'S first national lottery, in 1569, raised money to repair the Cinque Ports. For the following 250 years lotteries regularly financed public works and the Exchequer. The historical precedent is not lost on leaders of Britain's voluntary sector, who are apprehensive about government proposals to revive the national lottery in a bill about to go before parliament. They have two main anxieties: that it will divert money from other charity fund-raising activities, and that lottery receipts paid to charities might eventually replace other forms of public sector finance. Furthermore, some charities have moral objections to the national lottery, seeing it as state encouragement of gambling or even as a tax on the poor. Surveys show that poorer people are likely to spend a greater proportion of their income on lottery tickets, while some of the causes benefiting from the lottery (such as the arts) are disproportionately patronised by higher income groups. The government apparently believes that the lottery might eventually achieve an annual turnover of Pounds 4bn - at the high end of a range of estimates. Once prize money and administration costs are deducted, the remaining proceeds - probably less than one-third of total lottery income - would be available for distribution to good causes. Such causes would include the arts, sport, heritage and a special Millennium Fund for big projects, as well as charities. Charity managers are concerned that the public might buy lottery tickets to support good causes and, as a result, withdraw from alternative forms of charitable donation, without appreciating that the lottery proceeds were going to sports projects and other activities that some people would not regard as charitable. To compensate for the feared loss of income, a number of the big charities have argued that half the proceeds available for distribution should go to the voluntary sector. Since the lottery is likely to go ahead, in spite of the concerns of charity managers, the voluntary sector is now devoting its efforts to trying to secure the most advantageous arrangements. Two working parties - one set up by the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO), the other by the Association of Charitable Foundations (ACF) - have come to similar conclusions about the appropriate organisational structure to administer the lottery. Government observers sat on both working parties, and their reports are likely to influence future decisions on the lottery. Both reports call for a national board and regional structure, with separate committees for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, to take responsibility for making grants to charities from lottery proceeds. A central theme of the reports is that awarding grants must be free from government interference. Otherwise, says the NCVO, there would be a danger of 'direct political control of allocation decisions by government' and an increased risk that the lottery would gradually replace other public sector funding. The ACF says the distribution board should adopt a general policy statement that 'lottery money will not substitute for government grants, nor be directed towards the main areas of public expenditure.' It acknowledges that there is increasing difficulty in deciding what welfare activities are normal and proper candidates for public expenditure, as the government tries to develop a mixed economy of care; but, it says, public bodies should be excluded from direct benefit. 'It should be made clear that state schools, National Health Service institutions, local authority social services and other public bodies cannot apply for lottery support.' Another common theme in the reports is that lottery proceeds should be available to the widest range of not-for-profit and voluntary organisations, and not restricted to registered charities. Both the 1988 Local Government Act and the new 1992 Charities Act contain broad definitions of institutions which - although not necessarily registered charities - are established for philanthropic purposes; the voluntary sector wants these definitions applied. Whatever distribution system the government sets up, the question of deciding which charitable causes should benefit from lottery grants will be a complex and potentially controversial one. The ACF report says that, while dividing the available money thinly between all 170,000 registered charities and a similar number of other voluntary groups might appear fair, it would involve charities receiving support irrespective of the merit of their work. 'Exercising some discretion in allocating the proceeds is essential to make a more effective contribution to social welfare. Rather than allocating money indiscriminately, grants must be awarded on merit, with an application process providing the basis for initial comparison.' Both reports argue that a proportion of the lottery proceeds should be used to benefit low income groups. And, says the ACF, the lottery should provide an opportunity to redress existing imbalances in the distribution of charitable money by concentrating some resources on programmes that are unpopular in conventional fund-raising terms. Experience gleaned from state lotteries abroad and from UK appeals like Telethon, it says, suggests that this would be unlikely to arouse public resistance so long as the lottery funded more 'appealing' and 'photogenic' causes as well. Indeed, adds the report, 'in many cases it is remarkable how little interest is shown in the distribution of publicly-raised funds.'</p>

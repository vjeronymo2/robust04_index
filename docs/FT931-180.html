			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Arts: Big Night Out . . . - Theatre You never know what kind of show Sandi Toksvig's Big Night Out at the Little Sands Picture Palace is going to be. By turns, it is backstage farce, a sentimental tale of small lives in a small town, a Dennis Potter-type exercise in lacing realistic narrative with fantasies of period music, and a crazy hide-the-corpse black comedy. Does that sound a bit much? Well, so it proves. Toksvig and her director, Pip Broughton, cannot quite bring off all her changes of tack. The play, at the Nottingham Playhouse, never gels. But right up to the end it keeps on surprising you with its sudden shifts of tone. Things seem to arrive at one rousing musical conclusion, only to move onto a quiet epilogue with a startling last piece of plot. Neither finale nor epilogue is quite pulled off in context of the whole show, and yet the mixture of absurdity and pathos leaves a touching impression. Likewise the blend of theatricality and intimate tenderness. Big Night Out is set in an old seaside cinema, formerly a theatre, now on its last legs. The main three characters are its usherettes - Molly (played by Toksvig herself), Barbara (Anita Dobson), and Grace (Una Stubbs). Molly is eccentric, inefficient, but crazily devoted to the old theatre. Barbara is part man-crazy bimbo, part soft-voiced martyr and do-gooder ('You try my patience - and I thank you for it'). Grace, by contrast, is a sane, cynical, chain-smoking and wise-cracking old bird whom life has passed by. Though the play does not succeed in making us believe in all their inconsistencies, its attempt to make them three dimensional, complex beings is its finest feature. The two features that are most arresting are its farcical craziness and its sudden switches into musical-theatre numbers. Part of the farce business is standard - the man caught with his shirt off, the panic to hide the evidence, and so on. But the farce is also taken to dizzy, if contrived, heights because the play is set in an old theatre, with old chunks of scenery hanging around and masses of ropes (each hoisting who knows what). The corpse, for example, is swung on ropes, trolleys, and down a trapdoor. As for the musical-theatre stuff, this is the old theatre's very ghost. Molly is always in touch with it; it suddenly consumes Barbara; and it finally envelops Grace too. The theatre's ghosts are a fine team, led by the solo singer Beverley Klein, whose way of putting over a big song without microphone is a pleasure rare in the theatre today. (Hers could be a major talent. I wish only that she were a little less invulnerable and camp.) As for Toksvig, Dobson and Stubbs, they deliver performances worthy of their roles - which means that Dobson, in particular, discovers new possibilities. Were this plot played without laughs, hers would be its most daring feat of psychopathology. She shows you that, and yet makes the character absurdly funny too. She is all soft-voiced sweetness covering a wild fury, an easy lay who later reveals that she has never truly enjoyed sex. The way she hugs the corpse in her arms as if he had never died is daft, but so poignant that it wipes the laugh from your face. Nottingham Playhouse until May 1</p>

			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Greek Elections: Greece's politicians avoid the M-word - A campaign in which the vital question of neighbouring Macedonia is being ducked NOWHERE is the contradiction between rhetoric and reality in Greek politics more apparent than in Florina, a northern Greek town close to the borders with Macedonia and Albania. A decade-long drought has reduced cereal and dairy production there and exporting companies on Florina's industrial estate are reported close to bankruptcy as export subsidies have been abolished and transport costs have soared because of the war in Bosnia. However, the region's most serious problem is the loss of contact with Macedonia since Greece stopped issuing entry visas for Macedonians last year. Greek political leaders have avoided raising the Macedonian question in an election campaign fought so far on economic issues. Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis, leader of the New Democracy party, is not keen to draw attention to what many voters see as his failure to solve the nomenclature dispute in Greece's favour. Refusing visas is one of the ways that Greece's conservative government has tried to pressure Macedonia into changing its name. Greece argues that the former Yugoslav republic's choice of name amounts to a territorial threat against the northern Greek province of Macedonia. The opposition Panhellenic Socialist Movement, expected to win a clear victory in the October 10 poll, is promoting a new, pro-European Community image that could be ruined if nationalist rhetoric is allowed to take over. The message to steer clear of foreign policy issues has been passed down to parliamentary candidates in both main parties. Even in Florina, where the Macedonian issue has had a severe impact on the economy, candidates have been giving it only a passing mention in speeches. Because Greek visas are no longer easily available, Florina has lost its main source of income, the 20,000 Macedonians who crossed the frontier daily on business and shopping trips. Ties with Macedonia were particularly close because a large percentage of the district's population belongs to a Slav-speaking minority, many of whom have relatives living across the border. Dozens of shops in Florina have closed and the unemployment rate has risen to about 30 per cent. As a pre-election concession to local traders, the government has agreed to freeze interest payments for three years on loans from state-controlled banks amounting to Dr2bn (Pounds 5.6m). Mr Pavlos Altinis, a foreign-educated lawyer in his 30s running for the New Democracy party, wants to persuade local farmers to adopt better irrigation methods to defeat the drought. Communications must be improved, with the help of European Community structural aid, he says, in order to attract investment. However, like most other local candidates, he insists on taking a hardline view of the Macedonian issue. 'We are not prepared to accept terms, such as recognition, that will compromise our national interests, just in order to make money out of Skopje (Macedonia),' he says. At the same time, he acknowledges that his constituency has little chance of climbing out of recession unless cross-border trade can resume. Like New Democracy, the socialists say they will refuse to recognise Macedonia under that name. However, Mr George Lianis, a Pasok candidate in Florina, says their approach would be moderate. 'We must communicate with Skopje,' he says. 'We can start with cultural links, and there's no reason why we shouldn't get on to trade.'</p>

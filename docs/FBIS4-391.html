			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Monitored in progress] </F>   [Excerpts] ...because of the insecurity that has prevailed  lately, the first meeting of the Council of Ministers today made  decisions on this issue. Concrete measures and decisions were  made. By 11 April at the latest, there will be a meeting of all  the prefects of prefectures which will be presided over by the  interior minister upon his return from a mission abroad. If he  has not returned, the meeting will be chaired by the prime  minister, Jean Kambanda. [passage omitted]    Today's Council of Ministers also expressed regret over the  unilateral decision of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] to  resume the war. Because this decision has been made,  preparations are under way on the Rwandan Government side. That  is why the Council of Ministers called upon the national Army to  redouble its vigilance to eventually counter the attacks and  advances of the RPF, if it persists in adopting this war  mentality that we thought we had buried with the signing of the  Arusha Accord last August. That is why the Rwandan Government  urges the RPF to abandon this war mentality which benefits  nobody, certainly not the RPF.    The government urges the RPF to readopt the logic of peace  and to resume discussions with the Rwandan Government which is  the other signatory to the Arusha peace accord. In this way the  broad-based transitional institutions as provided by the Arusha  peace accords can be put in place in the coming six weeks, to  meet the deadline given by the UN Security Council on 5 April  when it rediscussed the Rwandan case on whether or not to  maintain UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda in our country.

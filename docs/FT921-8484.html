			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Observer: Tory spinners The opinion polls may show the two main parties in immovable deadlock. But there is no doubt who is winning the war to catch the ear of political journalists at Westminster. After years during which they were left standing by Labour's slick pr machine, the Conservative spin-doctors have seized the initiative. The balance has been tilted by the permanent presence in the House of Commons press gallery lobby of Tim Collins, a former adviser to employment secretary Michael Howard. The inexhaustible and well-briefed Collins is available day and night (including Sundays) to provide a suitable ministerial quote for a 'friendly' story or to highlight the latest 'gaffe' by a Labour opponent. Meanwhile the Labour side is still suffering from the departure two years ago of the irascible but highly-skilled Peter Mandelson and, more recently, that of his deputy Colin Byrne. Political journalists, used to being spoon-fed, have started giving the benefit of the doubt to the Conservatives.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In Algeria the FIS, the Islamic Salvation Front, is  pleased with the change of prime minister. Rabah Kebir, the FIS  representative in exile, believes that the replacement of Mr.  Redha Malek by Mr. Mokdad Sifi -- a relatively unknown  technocrat -- is a positive act in the framework of the search  for a negotiated solution. Rabah Kebir also claimed that  contacts were continuing between Lamine Zeroual, the head of  state, and the imprisoned FIS leaders.    Is this dialogue not likely to be held at the expense of the  traditional parties? That will mean forgetting the large  proportion of the people who reject the choice between the Army  and the fundamentalists, and who also reject civil war. That is  the opinion of Hocine Ait-Ahmed, the chairman of the Socialist  Forces Front [FFS], who held a news conference in Paris  yesterday. Mr. Ait-Ahmed also believes that France is not  condemning the repression in Algeria strongly enough. His words  were recorded by Farida Ayari:    [Begin Ait-Ahmed recording] I think France has adopted an  attitude of the least possible criticism with regard to what is  happening in our country, in particular, as far as repression is  concerned. We would like it to raise its voice about violations  of human rights.    Then, since Algeria is the keystone of the Maghreb as a  whole, I do not think anyone will fail to see that the only  highway the fundamentalists can use to achieve power is to  continue down the path of repression, and that if Algeria falls  into the hands of armed groups, the whole of the Maghreb will be  destabilized, and the security of the Mediterranean as a whole  will be threatened.

			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (6): Areas ripe for technology - Where would software have most effect in the textile industry? CLOTHING and textiles are industries unlike those that make canned soup or assemble motor cars. Two hundred years ago, they were the first to be industrialised. They still have their roots in craft industries and parts of them remain to this day highly labour-intensive. Most important of all, they are vertically integrated. Europe's biggest textile company, Coats Viyella, for example, makes thread, cloth and garments and retails them too. It is as if Ford owned British Steel and Shell's service stations. Perhaps not surprisingly, then, the challenge confronting textiles and clothing executives is as much where to computerise as how to do it. In the 1990s, they have the possibility of introducing computers into just about any link in the manufacturing chain. Computers are even used at the very start of the process. More than a year before a cotton shirt is bought by a consumer, a computer model of plant development helps US cotton growers maximise yield and quality. After harvesting, the cotton is then sent to depots where a software package, developed by a company owned by the cotton growers, helps to choose a suitable blend of raw fibres. By selecting combinations of fibre characteristics, such as thickness and length, the qualities of the eventual yarn can be determined. The software is linked to cotton mill storage areas. It directs the placement on the warehouse floor of different cotton bales. The automatic machinery that picks up the bales in a preprogrammed sequence and takes them to be blended into the raw material for yarn making. As well as helping determine the feel of the yarn and cloth to be made, the software helps determine its strength, a critical element in setting the speed of spinning and weaving machines. The idea may be extended beyond cotton, if a European Community-funded project now under way comes to fruition. It aims to allow clothing designers to specify the characteristics of the cloth and ask a computer to tell them the best way of making it. The clothing designer will be offered a range of routes to achieve a given fabric performance without recourse to the expense and time involved in selecting fibre, yarns, weaving finishing and testing samples. As well as cutting design costs, it could simplify the production cycle, improve quality - important for developed countries in competition with low labour-cost rivals - and even help introduce new fabric ideas and clothing constructions. In the long chain of production involved in making clothes, the stage after yarn selection is weaving or knitting. Like other manufacturing processes, they have already seen the introduction of computers for monitoring and process control. But several areas remain that are ripe for the introduction of the latest high speed computer technologies. Once the cloth is made, it must be inspected. This is still usually done by a worker looking at the cloth as it rolls by. Even in the latest factories, such as Toray's polyester plant in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, fabric inspection needs the human eye. Some clothing makers duplicate the effort and employ staff to scan the rolls of cloth looking for imperfections. UK consultancy Era Technology is working on an automatic inspection system that would automatically alert machine operators to the presence of defects. It hopes to extend the principle to the monitoring of leather, paper, printing and footwear sectors. This kind of procedure, as with most image-based analysis, relies on high-powered electronics. The ERA systems uses parallel processing integrated circuits in an array of TMS320C40 digital signal processing chips. This in turn feeds information into Transputer chips for analysis. Cloth design is also being done increasingly on computers. At Nottingham-based Sherwood Group, one of Europe's largest lace manufacturers, for example, designers have forsaken pen and ink for the power of computer-aided design (CAD). In the US, CAD is being used to create fabric print designs. It goes a stage further than Sherwood's system because it links the design function to manufacturing. One system, called the Apparel and Accessory Manufacturing Pipeline (AAMP), integrates the cloth-cutting, printing and stitching processes. The Dollars 1m package allows rapid prototyping and short production runs. It is a short step from CAD to using computers to reduce wastage of cloth when it is cut into shapes ready to be stitched into garments. Cloth-cutting has long been mechanically assisted. Traditionally, the cutter follows lines drawn by hand on the cloth itself. UK-based clothes manufacturer Burberry this year introduced a simple IBM PC-based software package that allows the shapes of the cloth pieces to be fitted together jigsaw-like to make the best use of the width of cloth available. The PC outputs the design onto a wide carriage printer and the outlines are used as stencils by the cutter. The next logical stage, already in use by some clothing manufacturers, is to link such a CAD system directly to cloth-cutting machines. This is a technique favoured by manufacturers in Germany as part of 'outward processing', a system of manufacture that minimises the labour content within a high wage-cost country. After automatic cutting, cloth pieces are shipped to lower wage cost countries for assembly into garments. Garment-making itself is still resistant to the introduction of computers: clothes manufacturers still find it more productive to shift production to lower wage-cost regions than invest in the possibility of automated garment assembly. Nevertheless, efficiency can be improved through computer links with garment retailers. A typical system is an 'integrated supply chain product' made by UK company Prologic. This software package links garment orders with information on supply bottlenecks in, for example, the schedule of cloth delivery. For example, if a retail chain orders a range of clothes, the salesman keys in that information. The computer responds by providing possible supply dates. If a higher priority is given to the new order, the software calculates what the knock-on effect will be on other orders that need the same cloth. Prologic's customers include such companies as Aquascutum and Paul Smith. Computer-literate textiles and clothing executives face a dazzling choice of ways to introduce computer technology into their companies' manufacturing processes. But unlike office managers, it is not a question of which accounts or spreadsheet package to buy. Instead they need to examine their production process and consider where, precisely, computers would make the most difference.</p>

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Currencies Yesterday's drop below 21,000 on the Nikkei emphasises the dilemma facing the Japanese authorities. On the one hand, they need a higher Yen to stave off protectionist pressure from the US. On the other, the risk that falling equity prices could prompt a banking crisis suggests a further cut in interest rates is imperative. Caught in the middle is the dollar, which closed in London 3 per cent below its pre-weekend level against the yen, thanks largely to Friday night's intervention in New York. In the short run, it looks as though the authorities will not find it too difficult to shore up the yen ahead of Saturday's ministerial meeting of the Group of Seven. Intense US political pressure on the trade issue may just help to hold the yen up thereafter. That could resolve the policy dilemma by allowing the hitherto reluctant Bank of Japan to cut interest rates once more without worry about a revival of inflationary pressure. If, however, the markets prefer to concentrate on the effect of low Japanese bond yields on capital flows, it will be touch and go whether the Miyazawa administration can pull off the conjuring trick. It would doubtless help if the US were to cut its own rates again in the not-too-distant future. It would also help if the dollar turned out not to have embarked yet on a sustained upward trend, despite its worldwide rally last week. A stronger dollar would also make it harder for Germany to start cutting rates as its domestic economy weakens. There is a co-operation challenge for G7 ministers here. The question is whether they will grasp it.</p>

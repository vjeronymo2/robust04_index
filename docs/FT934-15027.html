			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (11): Gains made despite recession - The long-term role of the sector is assured, with Asian and eastern European markets offering huge potential / The drinks industry THE DRINKS industry achieved a further increase in exports last year in spite of recession in many of its most important markets. Although Guinness dropped two places to 12th in the Top 100, the group recorded close to a 15 per cent rise in export sales to Pounds 975m. Allied-Lyons moved down three places from 27th to 30th but recorded a 12 per cent increase to Pounds 402m; Grand Metropolitan also fell from 36th spot to 40th but raised overseas sales by 6.6 per cent to Pounds 308m. Seagram slipped one place to 44th. Bass, the brewing and hotels group, remains outside the Top 100 but managed to increase its sales by 12 per cent to Pounds 73m. Its success is based on an increasing thirst for Bass ale in the US and Spain, and Tennent's lager in Italy. Scotch whisky was the mainstay of the international spirits groups' performance. While sales of Scotch fell by almost 10 per cent in the UK, the value of exports rose for the ninth successive year to Pounds 1.96bn. Overseas markets now account for nearly 86 per cent of the industry's sales. Overall world demand for spirits, however, fell slightly during the year. In general, the marketing and distribution strengths of the leading UK-based groups have enabled them in recent years to offset a slow decline in domestic demand and in mature markets such as the US and Canada, with growth in continental Europe, Asia/Pacific, and Latin America. This proved more difficult to achieve as 1992 wore on. While conditions in the US - and particularly California - remained depressed, recession began to bite in other important markets. The most serious blow to the spirits exporters came from the deteriorating economic conditions in Japan, one of the biggest high-value growth markets of the late 1980s. Growing unemployment and waning consumer confidence were quickly reflected in the demand for imported spirits. The squeeze was felt most severely in the high-priced bar trade and gift-giving sectors, which accounted for 30 per cent of volumes and a higher proportion of value sales. Elsewhere in East Asia, Taiwan remained healthy but Thailand, another de-luxe market, and Korea weakened. In Europe, the German market began to decline as the euphoria of unification gave way to recessionary forces. Demand also slackened in Italy and France, but improved in Scandinavia with a reduction in excise duties and more liberal regulation. More affluent young consumers sustained relatively buoyant markets in Spain, Greece and Portugal. Latin America, which accounts for 11 per cent of Scotch whisky export volumes, showed greater volatility. There were huge increases in consumption in some countries. Sales to Argentina were 70 per cent higher; consumption of mainly de-luxe whisky brands in Venezuela, the region's largest market, were 43 per cent ahead. But economic difficulties in Brazil caused a 32 per cent fall in shipments. Under the impact of worsening economic conditions, consumers in several markets began to trade down to lower-priced spirits brands. Exporters of Scotch, in particular, found this pressure on prices compounded by over-production and surplus stocks. The worldwide trend towards lower inflation rates also restrained the 'confident pricing' policies that had ruled throughout the late 1980s. Patchy trading conditions have persisted this year and will hold back export growth. Anthony Greener, Guinness chairman and chief executive, reported: 'We are still seeing signs of further deterioration in some major markets and any overall recovery remains elusive.' While economic conditions in some countries, such as the US and Australia, appear to be improving, other markets, such as Spain and Germany, are being increasingly affected by declining consumer confidence. In the first six months of the year, Guinness increased volume sales but found the gains concentrated in the lower-priced segments of the market. The group has been able to achieve only modest price increases for its brands, reflecting lower inflation and a highly competitive environment. However, the longer term role of the drinks groups among the UK's leading exporters seems assured. International quality spirits' share of the overall world market is just 7 per cent - and everywhere they continue to gain at the expense of local products. Trade barriers which have protected some of the biggest markets are crumbling. China, India, and eastern Europe offer huge potential. Whatever the doubts in the US and UK about the value of brands, vast numbers of consumers in the emergent markets aspire to drink Johnnie Walker, J &amp; B, and Ballantine's Scotch. Guinness says:'The world market for whisky of all kinds is around 200m cases. Scotch, the most authentic whisky, only accounts for 72m cases, or 36 per cent. In Asia alone, from India to Japan, 80m cases of whisky are consumed every year of which only 5 per cent is Scotch. Even if we only convert 1 per cent of whisky drinkers every year, think what that can do for the sales of the major premium brands.'</p>

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / The US Strikes Back: Progress out of chaos - America's high-tech industry is in the lead again The much-trumpeted revival of US manufacturing in the 1990s, though patchy, seems beyond dispute in one vital area. In high-tech electronics, especially the converging worlds of computing and telecommunications, the US has reasserted its dominance in the past three years. Some would say America's lead here was never really in doubt. But in the mid-1980s, it seemed to be narrowing. At one end of the chain, the US consumer electronics industry was in a nosedive. Further up, the Japanese were taking over the production of semiconductor memory chips. At the top of the chain, and perhaps most worrying from a strategic viewpoint, the US was rapidly losing ground in the market for the highly sophisticated equipment needed to manufacture semiconductor chips. Now, while the US has ceded the manufacture of low-profit-margin, commodity electronics products such as memory chips and television sets, it is racing ahead in many aspects of information technology. US companies dominate such critical areas as microprocessor chips, computer software and personal computers. There has even been a comeback in machines for making semiconductors. The leading US supplier, Applied Materials of California, now claims to be the biggest in the world. For once, the revival is not just a function of the shrinking Japanese economy and the strength of the yen. The electronics industry is seeing shifts in technology and markets which play to America's strengths, just as the 1980s exposed its weaknesses. In information technology, runs the argument, the US has three basic advantages: Communications. Competition in long-distance telephone services and the growing freedom of the regional 'Baby Bells', created by the break-up of AT&amp;T in the early 1980s, have encouraged innovation in US telecommunications, producing lower-cost, more advanced telephone services. At the same time, the American talent for entertainment - especially TV and video - has produced explosive demand for cable television networks. As a result, the spread and variety of electronic links between US offices, factories and homes is a long way ahead of Japan. Use of personal computers. The vast majority of US offices are equipped with networked PCs. About one-third of US households also have at least one PC. Japan by comparison has been slow to take advantage of PC technology. The enterprise culture. California's Silicon Valley is still characterised by a diversity of start-up companies, underpinned by a powerful and sophisticated venture capital industry. On the basis of these advantages, the US is racing to build broadband networks, able to convey interactive media, which link homes, offices, schools and hospitals. The Clinton administration has called the development of such an 'information super-highway' a national goal. Industry leaders claim the super-highway will not only create markets for their inventions, but change the world, or at least the US. 'Sceptics may disagree, but I believe the impact of this revolution will rival that of the electric light or the telephone or, perhaps, printing itself,' says Larry Ellison, president and chief executive of Oracle, a leading US database software company. The confidence that imbues the US industry is in contrast to the defeatism of the late 1980s. There are still exceptions, such as International Business Machines and Digital Equipment, the two largest computer companies, which are struggling to adapt to shifts in technology and markets. As a whole, though, the sector has turned itself round. In personal computers, the US was bracing itself in the 1980s for a Japanese invasion. The Japanese had captured the semiconductor market, it was said, and their next target would be PCs. The reverse has happened: US PC manufacturers are making inroads in the Japanese market. One reason is the pace of technology change. 'The big players in the Far East used to think all they had to do was fill a boat with cheap products and send it here,' says Safi Qureshey, head of AST Research of California, the world's fourth-biggest personal computer maker. 'Now it turns out that, by the time the stuff lands here, it's a little bit slow, a little bit old, and they can't sell it at a profit.' Some Silicon Valley executives say the pace of change also favours US entrepreneurial companies in a more fundamental way. Harvey Jones, head of the software company Synopsys, argues the electronics industry alternates between two phases: that of innovation, or chaos, and that of production, or standardisation. At present, he says, the industry is going through a chaotic upheaval. In telecoms, he says, 'we have Ericsson, Alcatel, Siemens, NEC, Fujitsu and AT&amp;T as customers. When we see them all in frenzied mode after God knows how many telecom strategies, you say to yourself that we're in a huge cycle of innovation. The same is true in multimedia. It's all pre-standardisation, and all creative invention.' This is the phase in which US-style creative diversity wins over the large-scale, straight-line approach of the Japanese giants. Take the initial innovative stage of semiconductors, says Jones. 'That was a phase when companies like Intel and Fairchild could do no wrong. Then, as it settled down, people said 'hey, a memory's a memory, and it's got to fit into this one kind of socket on the board'. Then, all of a sudden, the Japanese came in and took over.' This does not mean that the US is doomed to lose its high-tech edge again. US companies are more aggressive today in protecting their intellectual property rights. Semiconductor manufacturers demand higher royalties on their patents, and software companies vigorously enforce their copyrights. Thus it will be more difficult for any foreign competitor to take advantage of Intel's latest microprocessor innovations than it was for Japan's chipmakers to become leaders in the market for the dynamic random access memory chips, which Intel also invented. Through international alliances, US companies are also taking advantage of low-cost mass production abroad - in Taiwan, China, Singapore and Malaysia, for example. Even though the majority of circuit boards for PCs are made outside the US, American companies win most of the profits in the world PC market. The biggest advantage for US high-tech manufacturers, however, is that technology trends are being set in their home market. This has long been the case in computer hardware and software, but it is increasingly true of telecommunications and even consumer electronics. Most important, the US leads the world in working out how these technologies converge. Report by Martin Dickson, Louise Kehoe and Tony Jackson. Earlier articles appeared on February 7 and 15</p>

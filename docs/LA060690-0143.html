			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE HIGH SCHOOLS: YAKEL'S CAREER OPPORTUNITIES KNOCK EARLY  </P> <P> Most surprised, it seems, by John Yakel's rapid ascent to the position of  baseball coach at St. Francis High is John Yakel.  </P> <P> "Personally, I hadn't planned on it for about five years," conceded Yakel, 24,  a 1984 graduate of St. Francis. "You set your goals out of college and when you  reach them in three years, you feel real lucky."  </P> <P> Yakel, an assistant under Tom Moran for the past two seasons, will replace his  mentor. Like Yakel, Moran was an early bloomer and was hired as St. Francis  vice principal at 24. Moran, 37, recently was hired as principal at Chaminade.  </P> <P> "They like to keep their own people involved," Yakel said. "It keeps the  tradition alive."  </P> <P> St. Francis finished 6-11 overall this season and fourth in the Del Rey League  with a 4-8 mark.  </P> <P> Record season: Westlake High, which lost in the semifinals of the Southern  Section 5-A Division baseball playoffs last week, broke 35 school records  during its 28-2 season.  </P> <P> All-American catcher Mike Lieberthal, selected third overall by the  Philadelphia Phillies in the amateur draft Monday, owns eight of the nine  career offensive records set this year and five single-season marks. Lieberthal  set season records for home runs (13) and runs batted in (43), and holds career  records in homers (20), RBIs (75) and hits (105).  </P> <P> USA Today officials were at Westlake on Tuesday to photograph Lieberthal, who  will be named to the newspaper's All-American team at catcher.  </P> <P> Mike Eby, a senior left-hander who will attend UCLA on a partial scholarship in  the fall, set four season records and has six career records. He owns season  marks in wins (11) and innings pitched (85 1/3), and career records in  earned-run average (2.02), wins (23) and strikeouts (153).  </P> <P> Westlake, which was ranked No. 2 in USA Today's national poll most of the  season and was promoted to No. 1 the day it lost in the semifinals, was dropped  to No. 19. But USA Today officials told Coach Rich Herrera that the Warriors  likely will be promoted before the final poll is released in two weeks.  </P> <P> Hollow doubts: ESPN criticized the Phillies for selecting Lieberthal third. The  television network joined doubters who claim Lieberthal's 6-foot, 165-pound  frame cannot handle a 162-game schedule.  </P> <P> "I didn't really pay that much attention to it," Lieberthal said. "In a couple  of years, I'll be at least 20 pounds heavier. I'm only 18. I'm still going to  grow."  </P> <P> Record in sight: Tum Ratanatraiphob, a sophomore second baseman at Highland  Hall who stole 50 bases this season, raised his two-year total to 89 and placed  himself in fast company. He is tied for sixth place on the all-time Southern  Section list with Lenny Dykstra, the leading hitter in the major leagues and a  former Garden Grove High player.  </P> <P> With two seasons to go at the Small Schools Division level, Ratanatraiphob is  almost certain to break the career record of 113, set by Dave McLelland of Rio  Hondo Prep (1976-80).  </P> <P> Leaps and bounds: Judging by the order of competitors in the long jump at  Friday's state track and field preliminaries, Marcus Reed of Canoga Park was  given little chance of qualifying for the final Saturday night.  </P> <P> Entering the state championships with a personal best of 22 feet 10 inches,  Reed leaped 23-0 3/4 in the preliminaries and 23-8 in the final to finish  third. Jerome Price of San Diego University City took first with a leap of 25-3  1/4.  </P> <P> Reed is only the third Canoga Park athlete to finish in the top three in the  state meet in 22 years. Ricco Sanchez won the 800-meter title in 1968 and  Anthony Bailous was second in the long jump in '84.  </P> <P> Wake-up fall: Creighton Harris of Hoover placed fifth in his heat of the 1,600  meters in a personal-best 4:14.33 in the preliminaries of the state meet on  Friday.  </P> <P> Harris had the 10th-fastest qualifying mark and missed the ninth and final  berth in Saturday's final by 0.28 seconds.  </P> <P> He had planned to run in the 3,200 meters instead, but a fall from the top of a  bunk bed a week before the Pacific League finals in the first week of May  altered those aspirations. He sustained contusions on his left leg and a  laceration that required stitches.  </P> <P> Mike Glaze, Kirby Lee and staff writers Steve Elling, Sam Farmer and Jeff Riley  contributed to this notebook.  </P> <P> </P> <P> REGIONAL BASEBALL TOP 10  </P> <P> Final Poll  </P> <P> Selected by sportswriters of The Times  </P> <TABLE CWL="1.34IN:2.66IN:2.44IN:1.78IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Rk  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Team  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> League  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Record  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Westlake  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Marmonte  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 28-2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Chatsworth  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> West Valley  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 24-5-1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> El Camino Real  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> West Valley  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 21-3-1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Hart  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Foothill  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 23-2-2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Poly  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> East Valley  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 22-4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> San Fernando  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> North Valley  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 18-7-2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Birmingham  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Mid-Valley  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 19-7-1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Saugus  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Golden  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 20-6-1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 9  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Montclair Prep  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Alpha  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 25-3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 10  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Rio Mesa  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Channel  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 18-6-2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE></p>

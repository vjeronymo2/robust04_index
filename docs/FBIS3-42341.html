			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The Interior Ministry has issued a positive  assessment of the results achieved over the last year in the  struggle against subversion, noting that the strategy of taking  a legal-political approach to fighting terrorism was  consolidated in 1993.    In the opinion of the ministry, the political isolation of  the armed groups has been reinforced, while progress has been  made in disrupting the operations of their principal factions.  The goal for 1994 and 1995 is to take further steps toward  neutralizing once and for all the organizations that practice  political violence in Chile.    Another element that was emphasized in the official report  is  the fact that in 1993 there were no selective murders, such as  those that took the lives of Senator Jaime Guzman and the  bodyguards of Metropolitan Intendent [mayor] Luis Pareto.    It also predicted that the next phase of the government's  strategy will be to isolate the so-called "combatant jail" by  building a high-security facility to house terrorist leaders so  that they cannot continue to exert influence over the operative  cadres that are still free.    Before presenting a preliminary report on the matter, Luis  Toro, attorney for the Interior Ministry, stated that that  public entity is preparing an overall report on the results of  the antiterrorist struggle over the past few months.    A few days ago, Justice Minister Francisco Cumplido hailed  the accomplishments of the government and law enforcement in  this area, noting that now there are about 80 members of the  Manuel Rodriguez Front and the Lautaro Movement who are being  held and prosecuted for various crimes that are subversive in  nature.    Without citing specific figures, Toro ventured to say that  there has been a significant decline in terrorist activities in  the last year. He also emphasized that several major criminal  actions were discovered in advance.    The official indicated that perhaps one of the most serious  situations to arise in this regard took place last October when  terrorists tried to rob a bank in Las Condes. The ensuing clash  with police forces resulted in eight casualties.    Another negative development that he mentioned is the  various  opinions on how much involvement Chilean citizen Sergio Olea  Gaona had in the assassination of Senator Jaime Guzman. The case  is awaiting judgment in Division 3 of the Supreme Court.    Toro noted, however, that major progress has been made in  investigating the assassination of the man who founded the  Independent Democratic Union (UDI). Some of the conspirators and  perpetrators of the assassination have already been arrested,  including Front members Mauricio Hernandez Norambuena  ("Commander Ramiro") and Ricardo Palma Salamanca ("El Negro"),  for whom life sentences have been requested.    Except for the case of Olea Gaona, the Interior Ministry  attorney stressed that the vast majority of the cases prosecuted  by the ministry have culminated in guilty verdicts in the higher  courts after two or three years. In his opinion, this is proof  that the government's evidence is solid and conclusive.    In addition, the government official noted that in the last  12 months, forces have been successful in breaking up the  central structure of terrorist factions such as the "Raul  Pellegrin Detachment," a military wing of the autonomous Manuel  Rodriguez Front.    He also cited as an accomplishment of the government the  eradication of other political-criminal groups such as the  People in Arms Movement. He explained that these are bands made  up of former members of terrorist groups who are collaborating  with common criminals to carry out their actions.    He further contended that the Lautaro group is still  suffering major losses in its upper ranks, with the capture of  the number-two man in the Lautaro Popular Liberation Forces  (FRPL), Claudio Melgarejo Chavez, and later of Delfin Diaz, both  members of the top leadership. As a result, the noose has been  tightened around the head of the organization, Guillermo  Ossandon Canas ("Diego Carvajal"), who still has ties with  inexperienced members.    "The government's strategy called for an initial phase of  politically isolating the terrorist groups, so that the police  could then proceed to break them up. That phase is still in  progress," he indicated.    The official explained that the next step in the immediate  future is to isolate the "combatant jail" by opening a  maximum-security prison facility inside the former Santiago  Penitentiary to house persons convicted of terrorist offenses  committed after 11 March 1990.    "This is something that terrorist groups are very fearful  of,  because it would mean that their principal leaders in custody  would be precluded from exerting any strategic or tactical  influence over cadres who are currently free," he emphasized.    He acknowledged, however, that it cannot be said yet that  the  subversive groups have been neutralized. "This year we will  consolidate the great progress we have made toward breaking them  up, and we plan to have them neutralized sometime during 1995,"  he indicated.    He explained that the strategy of politically isolating  terrorists has been manifested in the gradual severing of ties  between these bands and the more traditional left, the  widespread condemnation of their actions, and the shunning of  the most active militants.    Despite this optimistic official approach, various civilian  sectors and political opposition organizations have constantly  questioned the administration's ability to deal with the issue  of citizen security in general, and political violence in  particular.    The criticism has focused primarily on the Coalition's  erroneous conclusion that normalizing democratic life alone  would reduce terrorist activity, and on the other hand, the fact  that it has sent the wrong signal by granting pardons to people  convicted of this type of crime.    The latter situation has been aggravated by the president's  decision to commute life sentences to exile in Europe for  members of extremist organizations that participated in actions  resulting in the death of law enforcement personnel, such as the  assault on the Lautaro Bakery and the armed attack on the Los  Quenes Reserve Post.    A total of 19 people have had their sentences commuted to  exile.    Another 14 individuals are still serving time for subversive  offenses; of those, four are candidates for pardon, including  the gunmen who attacked Gen. Augusto Pinochet's presidential  entourage. Another case has not yet applied for a pardon, and  the others are awaiting conviction to be eligible.    The last prisoner to receive a presidential pardon, having  his sentence commuted to 20 years in exile, was Hugo Gomez Pena,  sentenced to 35 years in prison for the death of Carabinero  Miguel Vasquez Tobar on 18 April 1986. He went to Belgium on 22  December.    During the Aylwin administration, 435 prisoners convicted of  subversive offenses have been released.    In addition to stressing the negative signal these pardons  send, as officials strive to develop an effective strategy  against terrorism, political leaders and parliamentarians  concerned with this issue also note that certain government  circles and the political coalition that backs the government  have failed to show consistent political support for the work of  the police.</p>

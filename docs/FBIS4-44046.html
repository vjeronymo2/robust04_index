			<p>BFN     [Text] President Rauf Denktas received Joe Clark, the UN  secretary general's special representative, at 1100 today. In a  statement to the correspondents after the meeting, which lasted  nearly 90 minutes, Denktas said that Joe Clark has not been able  to convey UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's letters to  the Turkish and Greek Cypriot sides because of Greek Cypriot  leader Glavkos Kliridhis' negative approach. Clark has been  unable to fulfill his mission as a result of Kliridhis'  approach, he said. Denktas said the following:    [Begin Denktas recording] Mr. Clark has been unable to  convey  the document or letter the UN secretary general is reported to  have sent to the two sides. We have been informed by other  sources that Glavkos Kliridhis talked with the UN secretary  general by telephone for 45 minutes yesterday. He warned  Butrus-Ghali that he should not be given a document and that he  will resign if a document is conveyed to him. As far was we  know, Kliridhis has objected to many points on the  confidence-building measures. He pretended to agree, however,  because he believed that the ball was in our court. His design  was foiled when we agreed with the UN officials on all the  issues. Consequently, he has moved to make a threat. Therefore,  I was compelled to ask Mr. Clark whether he traveled all that  way just to say hello to us. He replied that he believed that  his talks with us were useful and that they gave him an  opportunity to learn more about the problems. Obviously, he was  unable to fulfill his mission because of Kliridhis' approach.    We asked Mr. Clark why the UN secretary general has not  submitted a report to the UN Security Council to inform it of  the developments that have taken place since 30 May and the  initiatives the Turkish Cypriot side has made in goodwill,  particularly the sacrifices it has made for the sake of reaching  and signing of an agreement. We asked why he had failed to do  so during the past 23 days, regardless of the fact that he had  promised to submit a report.    Kliridhis will use the UN secretary general's 30 May report  in the meeting to be held in Corfu. That report blames the  Turkish Cypriot side. Is there an agreement to support  Kliridhis? We insist that a realistic report be submitted. A  decision at Corfu in favor of the Greek Cypriot side will have  negative effects. It would be useful for all sides concerned to  realize that. We underlined that to Mr. Clark. He responded  that he is not concerned with what may happen in Corfu. But he  has to be concerned, because the outcome of the meeting in Corfu  may complicate his mission. It may even create a very  unfavorable state of affairs.    Yes, we discussed all that. We reiterated the decisions that  have been adopted and the agreements that have been reached. He  promised us that he will inform the correspondents that the  Turkish Cypriot side has done what it was expected to do. It  will be recalled that he informed the world after we met last  time that the ball was in our court. However, the ball was in  the Greek Cypriot side's court at that time as well. We also  underlined that Kliridhis seems to have agreed to the  confidence-building measures because of the Greek Cypriot side's  tactical approach. However, he will not sign an agreement,  because the Greek Cypriot side has no need for an agreement.    Yes, we exchanged views. As he himself has said, he has  observed the Turkish Cypriot side's goodwill once again.    Mr. Clark said that time is required to allow the problem to  cool down. We have been accused of wasting time. However, he  suggested that time is required because of the Greek Cypriot  approach. We should try to find a way to resolve the problem in  time. We responded by saying: No other way exists but to draw  up a written agreement. An agreement has to be drawn up and  signed. Otherwise, no agreement can be reached. Therefore, you  should hold talks with Kliridhis. He is obliged to sign the  agreement. That is his duty.    The UN documents and Kliridhis' statements refer to the  agreement to be concluded and signed by the two leaders. Our  people have authorized us to conclude a fair and balanced  agreement. Nothing can be achieved in the absence of an  agreement that will be signed by both sides. [end recording]    Replying to a question, President Denktas called on Butrus  Butrus-Ghali to maintain an impartial approach. He said: If  Butrus-Ghali wishes to maintain an impartial approach and  refrain from giving Kliridhis an opportunity to use the 30 May  report against the Turkish Cypriot side in Corfu, then he should  submit a report on the developments that will favor the Turkish  Cypriot side. He still has time to do so. He can quickly draw  up a new report.</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Management: Consult across Europe Judging by the latest UK Management Consultancies Association survey, the market for consultants continues to mirror economic recovery. But what sort of work are clients demanding? One admittedly anecdotal answer was offered this week at a meeting in London of the members of ECN, an alliance of eight national management consultancy companies with offices in 10 European countries. ECN, whose combined fee income of about Pounds 50m last year puts it among the top 20 European players, claims mutual servicing of customers among its companies, multinational projects and the exchange of know-how make it more than just a routine consultants' lunch club. What was striking at the meeting was the different regional experience. The two Scandinavian firms, for example - Carta Corporate Advisers of Stockholm and Sami of Helsinki - have found that there is a strong strategic bias in their territories as companies seek to expand internationally. This was not the picture elsewhere in Europe. In Germany, said IBB International of Cologne, the demand for expertise in linking organisations from east and west after unification is now tailing off. 'Cost optimisation' work of the kind familiar to the UK in the early 1990s is of greater interest. In France and the Benelux countries clients are increasingly seeking to quantify the returns from using consultancy services. In France there is growing interest in innovation, while the significance of the public sector has increased in the Benelux countries. As for the UK - where the ECN member is the accountancy firm Stoy Hayward - managing director Michael Grunberg says the 'catchphrase remains process re-design', though he says people differ on whether this refers to incremental improvements or a complete re-design.</p>

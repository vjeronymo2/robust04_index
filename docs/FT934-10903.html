			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / France and Germany set out economic convergence plans GERMANY and France yesterday jointly presented the broad outlines of proposals to bring their economies together as part of plans for European economic and monetary union by the end of this decade. The joint presentation was designed to give some public impetus to economic convergence, prescribed by the Maastricht treaty which came into force on Monday. However, it coincided with the emergence of serious differences within Germany's coalition over European integration. Mr Edmund Stoiber, Bavarian prime minister and a powerful political figure in the Christian Social Union, said the idea of Europe as a federal state was finished. The CSU is sister-party of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union in the coalition. The plans for economic convergence were released after a meeting of the Franco-German Economic and Financial Council in Berlin, comprising their finance and economics ministers and central bank presidents. Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, said plans to converge the French and German economies by 1996 were 'crucial for the success of economic and monetary union' among European Community member states. French and German finance ministers plan to give more details of the plans to their EC colleagues at a general discussion of European economic convergence on November 22. Germany has made little change to its earlier plan to bring its budget deficit, currently the equivalent of 4 per cent of gross domestic product, to within the 3 per cent guideline laid down in the Maastricht treaty by 1995. By contrast, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, and Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, the French budget minister, set out for the first time yesterday their country's medium-term goals. Mr Sarkozy said France intended to reduce its budget deficit, around 4.5 per cent of GDP, to about 2 per cent by 1997. The only previous indication which prime minister Edouard Balladur had given of his government's medium-term planning was a promise to reduce public borrowing to 2.5 per cent by 1997. French and German ministers agreed that their economies should aim for 3 per cent growth from 1995 onwards. French ministers said they were assuming French growth would be between 2.8 and 3.5 per cent from 1995. They have predicted that the French economy will contract by 0.8 per cent this year, but expand by 1.4 per cent next year. German growth is forecast at minus 1 per cent this year and plus 1.5 per cent in 1994. According to the Maastricht treaty, EC governments would make their first assessment of whether their economies are ready for monetary union in late 1996.

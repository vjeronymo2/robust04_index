			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Avesco losses Pounds 0.2m below forecast AVESCO, which serves the broadcasting, television and video markets, cut pre-tax losses from Pounds 2.26m to Pounds 1.35m in the year ended March 31 1993. The loss was also Pounds 200,000 below the forecast made with the Pounds 12m rights issue in March. Shareholders' funds had more than doubled and the group was in a much stronger financial position, said Mr Richard Murray, chairman. VideoLogic's planned expansion continued and its alliance with IBM to produce low cost multimedia solutions had already resulted in the first product, Mediator LC. Each of the service businesses was profitable and their outlook for the coming year was encouraging with growth expected in all areas. AVS Broadcast, the television products operation, substantially reduced its loss in the second half and should improve in the current year. Turnover in 1992-93 expanded from Pounds 17.9m to Pounds 23.4m. To the operating loss of Pounds 140,000 (Pounds 1.52m) VideoLogic contributed Pounds 677,000 (Pounds 673,000), television products Pounds 558,000 (Pounds 709,000), and services division profit Pounds 1.05m (Pounds 164,000). Discontinued activities accounted for losses of Pounds 5,000 (Pounds 202,000). Losses per share came to 2.2p (3.4p).</p>

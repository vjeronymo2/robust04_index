			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Taiwan shows big increase in imports TAIWAN'S trade surplus fell 87 per cent to Dollars 210m (Pounds 109.9m) in July from Dollars 1.61bn in the year-earlier month, AP-DJ reports from Taipei. The Ministry of Finance said the month's total exports amounted to Dollars 6.89bn, down 2.7 per cent from the same month a year earlier, while overall imports stood at Dollars 6.68bn, up 22.1 per cent. The country registered surpluses in trade with Hong Kong and the US, while showing deficits with Japan and Europe. The largest contributor to July's surplus was the trade balance with Hong Kong, which rose to Dollars 1.15bn, up 8.9 per cent from the same month a year ago. The remaining surplus was generated by trade with the US, netting Dollars 810m, down 9.8 per cent from a year earlier. Washington is pressing Taipei to cut the surplus. However, Taiwan suffered a trade deficit of Dollars 1.34bn with Japan in July, 40 per cent wider than the gap a year earlier. The republic also suffered a trade deficit with Europe of Dollars 160m, in contrast to a surplus of Dollars 320m a year earlier. Officials said the strength of the Taiwan dollar, which hit a record high of 24.5070 to the US dollar on July 9, helped to depress exports. Imports were fuelled by purchases of machinery and materials for massive infrastructure projects. The government envisaged spending Dollars 300bn on the projects between 1991 and 1997.</p>

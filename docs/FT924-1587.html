			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Letter: Pay and experience of non-executive directors Sir, David Daws suggests (Letters, December 12) that to do a proper job non-executive directors need to commit a minimum of 180 hours a year to a company and should receive fees of Pounds 32,000-Pounds 63,000. As we advise NEDs and remuneration committees we are frequently asked to recommend fee rates for partially executive chairmen, partially executive and non-executive directors. Our solution to the problem posed by Mr Daws, whereby top flight professionals could be unwilling to accept the Pounds 12,000-Pounds 20,000 normally offered, is that stand-by fees should be arranged to cover additional training, crisis management or takeover bids where the NED is required to commit additional time at short notice. The problem with high fees for partially executive directors is that they can lose their independence as two or three such appointments add up to a significant income. We have recently recommended fees of Pounds 45,000-plus for partially executive chairmen of medium-sized PLC groups but are conscious that in a takeover with no service contract such fees might lead them to over-oppose a bid. There appears to be no shortage of high quality candidates at current NED rates though I know that leading professional firms are unwilling to allow their partners, for conflict of interest and fee reasons, to serve as NEDs as often as they probably should.

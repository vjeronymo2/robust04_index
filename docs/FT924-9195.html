			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / International Company News: McCaw registers Dollars 77.7m deficit as stock soars McCAW Cellular Communi- cations, the wireless telecommunications group which on Wednesday announced plans for an important alliance with American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, yesterday reported improved third-quarter operating results but a Dollars 77.7m net loss. AT&amp;T, the largest long-distance telecommunications group in the US, is negotiating to spend Dollars 3.8bn on a 33 per cent stake in McCaw, the country's largest cellular telephone service company. Shares in McCaw, which were suspended before Wednesday's news, soared Dollars 5 1/4 to close at Dollars 32 on the Nasdaq market yesterday, while AT&amp;T fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 44 3/8 on the New York Stock Exchange. McCaw has expanded extremely rapidly over the last few years, thanks both to the organic growth of the cellular industry and acquisitions. However, its takeovers have loaded it down with a heavy debt burden, which have kept its bottom line in the red. The AT&amp;T deal would involve a Dollars 2bn injection of cash for new shares and allow it shrink the Dollars 5.3bn of borrowings on the balance sheet. Net revenues for the third quarter attributable to its cellular interests totalled Dollars 332.2m, up from Dollars 256.5m in the same period of 1991, while cash-flow (income from operations before depreciation and amortisation) from cellular interests grew 44 per cent to Dollars 155.4m. Net revenues for the group as a whole totalled Dollars 448m, up 28 per cent. The net loss of Dollars 77.7m, or 43 cents a share, compared to net income of Dollars 77m, or 39 cents a share, in the same period of last year on a one-time gain of Dollars 243m due to the sale of cellular properties. Lin Broadcasting, a cellular company in which McCaw has a 52 per cent interest, reported a net loss of Dollars 23.2m, or 45 cents a share, compared to a loss of Dollars 42.2m, or 82 cents, for the same period of 1991. McCaw said the number of cellular subscribers in its markets and those of Lin rose 37 per cent to 2.04m between September 1991 and 1992.</p>

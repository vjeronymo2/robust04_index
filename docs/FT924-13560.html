			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Democrats seek to dispel potent magic: What Bill Clinton would like America to think about James Baker INSIDE the Beltway and around the world, James Addison Baker 3rd is a name mentioned with serious reverence. Beyond Washington's ring road and inside the nation's boundaries, the perception is less sharp. But it is this second market that he is now seeking to reclaim, not for the first time, for George Bush. Not only is he again running the president's struggling re-election campaign, he has now been requested to shape economic policy and create a new economic team for a second term, if there is one. In either fear or recognition, perhaps both, of his reputation, Bill Clinton's campaign banged out an indictment of Mr Baker within hours of Mr Bush's mentioning his new role in the first televised debate on Sunday. It includes subjects rarely mentioned in the polite Washington society that the current White House chief of staff holds in thrall. For example, that, as President Reagan's first chief of staff, he was 'the political mastermind behind efforts to cut taxes for the wealthy and services for everybody else'; that, as treasury secretary in the second Reagan term, he 'presided over the most disastrous finance debacle in recent history - the Dollars 500bn savings and loan scandal'; that, as Bush's secretary of state, he played 'a central role' in 'the secret policy of aid to Saddam Hussein'. It got more personal: that Mr Baker was a notorious frequent user of military jets while on personal business; that the Baker plan for third world debt was also designed to protect his own private holdings in a big US bank; that he is partner in an oil barge business which successfully lobbied to prevent the enactment of expensive environmental rules. Mr Baker has not stooped to respond, except for one little incident. Flying commercially from St Louis, he resisted the invitation from the cabin crew to move up to first class. No contemporary public figure, certainly none who has never won an election and only run once - for Texas attorney-general in 1978 - has commanded such mystique. To his admirers, who are many, he is the consummate deal-maker able to work effectively in Washington and from Brussels to Beijing. To his detractors, who are growing in number, he has the extraordinary facility to do bad as well as good, but never, never to get the blame for anything that goes wrong. Mr Baker, a Houston patrician polished by an Ivy League university, Princeton, is said to dislike politics. He has admitted he found his 1978 race personally 'distasteful'. His relationship with Mr Bush goes back 30 years and must be complex. He may be smarter than his president, and is reported to have no compunction about ordering him around in private, but is dependent on his patronage. Each, it seems, serves the other's needs. In his farewell speech in August to the state department, where he was not universally admired, he said that he was only leaving - 'one of the most difficult decisions of my life' - because he believed in the necessity of global US leadership. He then recited a long list of accomplishments. By this logic, Mr Baker is only doing what he is now in order to go back to what he was doing as soon as possible. A short intermission in control of domestic policy, if the electorate grants that, seems the limit of his desire. A reluctance ever to create public hostages to fortune has always been his trademark, as much in negotiations in the Middle East as in his various political roles. It explains why some people even speculate that he could be useful to a President Clinton on some specially-defined mission, if not immediately, then after the passage of a decent interval. This week's Democratic indictment of him makes this now a little fanciful.</p>

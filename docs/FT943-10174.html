			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Further demand for Recs Regional electricity company (Recs) shares hit all-time relative highs against the broader market as dealers scrambled for stock ahead of the pricing review on Thursday. Analysts have been taking an increasingly optimistic view on how much the Electricity Regulator (Offer) will order the Recs to cut distribution costs, which make up about a quarter of electricity bills. From a staggering 30 per cent in May the general belief now is that Offer will order a 15 per cent one-off cut followed by price caps of 2 to 3 per cent below inflation for the next five years. The review could reduce household bills by 4 per cent and is being carried out to redress the generosity of the terms at privatisation. City optimism has been fuelled partly by the recent lenient attitude of the water regulator and analysts believe that if their predictions are correct the Recs will be able to generate real dividend growth of 5 to 6 per cent a year. However, a wide range of cuts is forecast with Eastern Electricity and Southern, up 4 at 692p and 671p respectively, seen as benefiting from the greatest leniency. London (off 6 at 615p) and East Midlands (off a penny at 667p) could be hit the hardest.</p>

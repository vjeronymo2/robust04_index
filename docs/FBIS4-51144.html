			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article from the "Opinion" page: "The Ripple Effect of </F> Rural Migration"]    [Text] If the mass movement of peasants to the urban areas  over the last few years is an indication of a trend, the '90s  will possibly be remembered as the decade of migration.    Anyone having had the misfortune of riding a train during  the  Chines Spring Festival holidays can testify to the enormous  scale of the migration taking place.    Young peasants, their belongings in a bedroll, clog railway  station courtyards, often for days, before they head into the  city to find their dream job as construction worker or domestics.    The exodus, mainly from central and western regions by  farmers in search of a job in the east or coastal areas, has  been analyzed in depth by the journal, Chinese Rural Economy  [ZHONGGUO NONGCUN JINGJI].    The study covers the migration's causes, characteristics and  social impacts and discusses governmental attitudes and the need  for action towards the phenomenon.    The scale of the migration has been swelling rapidly.  Statistics from Sichuan, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Henan and Jiangxi  provinces indicate that, in 1982, fewer than 1 million farmers  left their hometowns to do seasonal work in other areas. A  decade later, the number had skyrocketed to at least 24 million.    The bulk of the increase has appeared in the last two or  three years.    For example, in the first half of 1991, only 200,000 farmers  left their hometowns in Jiangxi Province, but in 1993, more than  3 million followed the tide--accounting for one fifth of the  province's rural labourers.    Studies also show that the migrants are going further  afield.  In the early '80s, farmers worked only in neighboring cities or  counties, but in 1993 20 million of them went to other provinces  or even foreign countries.    They also have tended to stay away from their homes for  longer stretches of time.    They are engaged in a greater variety of businesses,  including industry, civil engineering, transport, commerce and  service trades. Some have even become experienced technicians.    Among Beijing's lOO,OOO rural farmers from Anhui Province,  57  per cent of them work in the industrial and civil engineering  sectors.    Migration is a gregarious activity. Few set out alone. Most  travel in groups organized by themselves or local companies.    Many factors have contributed to farmers' migration.    Firstly, rural areas simply don't have enough jobs for all  the labourers. At present, rural areas have more than 100  million surplus labourers. As the population grows, the  situation can only worsen. Demographers estimate that this  number will swell by another 6 to 7 million.    Secondly, the rapid development of certain regions creates a  need for migrant labourers. Once employed, migrants can earn  about 2,500 yuan ($287) a year, far more than they were able to  make back home.    Thirdly, the widening gap in the cost of living between  different areas and trades is also a driving force. This is due  in part to the soaring prices of fertilizers, insecticides and  machinery needed for agriculture, while farmers can still fetch  only relatively low prices for their goods.    Fourthly, the farmers' change of attitude and the  governments' flexible policy towards migration have made the  movement possible.    Overall, is migration a good or bad phenomenon? Undoubtedly,  it has benefited both rural and urban areas. In 1992 migrating  farmers from Sichuan, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Henan and Jiangxi  provinces earned a total of 28 billion yuan ($3.2 billion ).  Farmers from Anhui alone made 7.5 billion yuan ($862 millions,  2 billion yuan 1$230 million) more than the province's annual  financial revenue.    The increase in the farmers' personal wealth has improved  their living standards. Some money has been used to start other  industrial businesses and service trades, thus creating more job  opportunities.    Also, with fewer farmers cultivating the land and fracturing  the market, the farms can, if well-managed, reach economies of  scale with high productivity and reasonable profit margins.    Advanced regions have employed the cheap labour force to  develop their industries and service sector as well as  developing suburban agriculture for the city markets.    The flow of labour has strengthened the connection between  rural and urban areas, helped the formation of a unified and  open national labour market, and put pressure on the government  to speed up the reform of residence and employment laws.  Finally, migration has educated farmers.    However, the phenomenon is not without its negative  consequences. Great pressure has been exerted on the country's  transport, urban infrastructure and social stability. Some  farmers see migration as an opportunity to skirt around family  planning laws.    The article recommends the government take certain measures  to put the migration in order.    Firstly, the government should set up a unified labour  market  composed of job centres that help the surplus labourers locate  work. Information networks that provide forecasts on labour  supply and demand would also be useful. Laws on labour, labour  contracts and social security should be drafted.    Secondly, to facilitate the establishment of a unified  labour  market, trans-provincial co-operation should be enhanced to  better regulate the labour flow.    Since 1991, Guangdong, Sichuan, Hunan provinces and Guangxi  Zhuang Autonomous Region have decided to collaborate on the  labour flow. A further five provinces have now joined the group.    In 1989, 70 per cent of the labourers entering Guangdong had  no arrangements for work; now only 5 per cent of the annual 6.5  million come without preparation.    Thirdly, the central government should make the development  of labour resources part of the country's comprehensive social  and economic development plan.    While planning for urban construction, the authorities  should  consider the issue of migration.    Policies should be made to encourage the shift of farmers to  other businesses. The system of land use and the management of  collective property should be reformed. Some places now permit  farmers to transfer land-use rights, while some have introduced  the share holding system in the management of collective  property. The article said that these experiments are  worthwhile.    The current residence registration system should be reformed  to allow farmers to become urban residents in towns and small  cities.    Fourthly, measures should be taken to check the volume of  labourers during the busy Spring Festival period.    Lastly, rural township enterprises, towns, farmland capital  construction and the service industry should be encouraged to  create more job opportunities within the rural areas.</p>

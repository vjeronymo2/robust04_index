I have received reports from people in  Hebron.    [Al-Husayni] Yes.    [Zissowitz] From the information you have, how many have  been murdered, and how many wounded in the shooting spree.    [Al-Husayni] About 35 people were murdered. There are 18  dead in al-Ahali Hospital, 11 in 'Aliya Hospital, and four in  al-Maqasid, and we are being updated by the minute.    [Zissowitz] Have the Palestinian negotiators in the peace  talks worked out any response to this action?    [Al-Husayni] Of course, but first of all we want the  settlers to be disarmed. Second, we want international  protection and a committee to investigate what happened, who is  responsible, and how the Army responded.    [Zissowitz] Do you doubt that the IDF [Israel Defense  Forces] did all it could to defend the Arab worshipers?    [Al-Husayni] No, definitely not. The Army permitted a  settler to enter a holy place with weapons and do what he did.  It is clear that the Army did not do what it had to do. Later,  the Army fired at people, apparently causing many casualties. I  also have reports that the Army later killed two people.    [Zissowitz] I am sure you do not deny that the Army is doing  everything it can to defend the lives of Jews, yet it does not  always succeed, and Arab terrorists succeed in harming and  killing Jews.    [Al-Husayni] It has never happened in a place under such  heavy Army protection. It has to defend such a holy place yet  it permits settlers to enter armed. What we want is for all  settlers be immediately disarmed.    [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0750 GMT on 25 February  carries a similar interview with al-Husayni by Itay Engel, in  which al-Husayni is asked whether he joins the call to  Palestinians not to carry out reprisals for the Hebron incident.  Al-Husayni replies: "Today, I call on the people not to make  reprisals, but at the same time, I can not ask people not to  defend themselves."]    [Zissowitz] Did you have any contact after this morning's  events with the prime minister or foreign minister?    [Al-Husayni] I did not speak with the prime minister or the  foreign minister. I tried but failed, but I talked with others  in the government.    [Zissowitz] What did they tell you?    [Al-Husayni] I want to transfer the conversation to Mr.  Ziyad Abu-Zayyad.    [Zissowitz] I asked Mr. al-Husayni whether you had any  contact with Israel's top political echelon, the prime minister,  foreign minister, or those participating in the talks?    [Abu-Zayyad] We are in touch with cabinet ministers, whom I  do not want to name, Knesset members, officials in the Civil  Administration, and the coordinator of government activities in  the territories. We demanded information and an investigation,  and we are following events with deep concern.    [Zissowitz] Do you think these events will influence the  talks with Israel in any way?    [Abu-Zayyad] Personally, I hope not although it is a crime  and a great tragedy. I hope it will not harm the process  because the peace talks are a strategic aim for both the  Israelis and the Palestinians. We must not allow an incident,  no matter how painful and dastardly, to stop the talks.    [Zissowitz] When you hear a unanimous denunciation by the  left and right, does this convince you of its sincerity?    [Abu-Zayyad] I have always said that there is no  denunciation that can bring a dead man back to life. Therefore  it does not help. What can help is to immediately remove the  arms from the settlers and to ban them from carrying arms, for  the Army to be in control of the situation. It is responsible  for the safety of the Jewish and Palestinian populations.    [Zissowitz] There were denunciations not only by people  supporting the peace process, but a unanimous denunciation among  those fervently opposed to the process, which is unusual.    [Abu-Zayyad] I am not looking for lip service from anybody  and the words do not always reflect what the heart feels and  desires, therefore I cannot depend on words.</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Observer: My goodness Brian Baldock, aside from being deputy chairman of Guinness, is also chairman of the Lord's Taverners, and Wednesday's eve-of-test match dinner was supposed to be his big night. So imagine his feelings on spotting his former boss, ex-jail bird Ernest Saunders, not only among the guests but bang next door to one of the two Guinness tables. The two apparently had not met since Saunders' ignominious exit in 1986. Given that Baldock owes his job at Guinness to Saunders, it was good to see him shake the old rogue warmly by the hand.</p>

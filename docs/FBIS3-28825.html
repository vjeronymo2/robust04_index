We consider this action  has been unavoidable in view of the given unpredictable  situation of the economy and the fast approaching Japan-U.S.  summit. It will have the effect of stimulating the economy. We  believe it should be turned into a first step for fundamental  tax reform, and should be linked to discussions on tax reform --  with the future of Japan's economy in perspective.    A public opinion survey conducted by phone by NIHON KEIZAI  SHIMBUN revealed about 60 percent of the people recognize the  need to raise the consumption tax in the future. If this is  viewed against the hustle among the government and ruling  parties over the last several days, it becomes clear that the  politicians and bureaucrats have wasted precious time in  anachronistic bargaining.    The general public accurately understands the need for  fundamental tax reform. The happenings witnessed in the prime  minister's out-of-the-blue announcement for a "national welfare  tax" of 7 percent, and then scrapping the idea, are nothing but  an outcome of attempts to deceive the people. Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa insisted "there was a problem in the process  of arriving at a decision." But he should have also repented  for not having trusted the people.    What is important in future discussions is to define the  forthcoming tax reductions as the first step in fundamental tax  reform which will be based on readjusting the weight of direct  and indirect taxes. To do that, it is essential to make  reductions in the income and residential tax not a temporary  event for only one year, but to incorporate the reductions in  the revised progressive system when the taxation system is  reformed next year.    The revenue for shortfalls from the tax reductions must come  from increasing the consumption tax. Of course, thorough  rationalization of expenditures should become a condition to it.  But raising the consumption tax is unavoidable if the  government wants to stop the financial conditions from worsening  further, and yet still build a taxation system appropriate for  the upcoming society made up of an aged population. Hence, the  point of concern should rest only with when the increases begin  and how high the rate should be set.    The coalition parties have agreed to pass related bills by  the end of this year. In view of the existing economic  situation, it is desirable that they be extensive and flexible  in substance. Furthermore, as we have said time and again,  debate on them should be made on the principle of respecting the  "neutrality of tax revenue" [as published]. The government  should push ahead with the new tax measures, regarding them as  tax reductions to stimulate the economy, and also as a step  toward building up a tax system which can support a society made  up of an aged population.    In doing so, the government should present a future vision  of  Japan's economy as specifically as possible.    Besides, in increasing the consumption tax, the government  needs to take another look at the current simplified levying  [kani-kazei] system which is creating the problem of the  so-called "eki-zei" [pocketing of tax money by businesses].    The government should not think about changing the name of  the consumption tax or about confining uses for the money  collected from it. It should not be necessary to again point  out the problems which will arise if the consumption tax --  which is as important a source of tax revenue as much as the  income tax -- is made a specific tax earmarked for use only for  stated purposes. It should not even be necessary to cite past  examples when warning about the danger of such actions creating  rigid expenditures.    It is essential that discussions on tax reform should  involve  all Japanese. The government must not rely on politicians'  logic or bureaucrats' theories alone. Of course, using tax  reform as a means of political strife must be banned. We  request the government provide as much information as possible  to the general public to aid in their understanding and as a way  of ensuring no mistakes are made in the future.</p>

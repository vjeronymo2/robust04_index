			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Nato air strike ultimatum to Serbs: Gorazde ceasefire agreed as allies threaten bombing raids from midnight tonight Nato yesterday warned the Bosnian Serbs it would bomb their forces unless they stopped shelling the enclave of Gorazde immediately and withdrew from the city today. The threat appeared to draw a swift response from Belgrade, where Serb leaders and UN officials announced a ceasefire agreement late last night which a UN spokesman said met the terms of the Nato ultimatum. Envoys from the Nato defence alliance meeting in Brussels demanded an immediate ceasefire in Gorazde, withdrawal of all Serb forces from a 3km exclusion zone by midnight GMT tonight, and access to the city for peacekeepers and medical workers. If these demands were not met, air attacks could start against any Serb military targets within 20km of the city. The Serbs were also threatened with bombing runs unless they withdrew heavy guns from 20km around Gorazde by early Wednesday. Nato stopped short of issuing similar ultimatums for four other UN-designated 'safe areas', although a senior diplomat said they would do so if 'there are attacks or clear threats of attack'. In Belgrade, President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia said the UN and Bosnian Serbs had reached 'full agreement' on a ceasefire and the normalisation of relations between the two sides. Mr Yasushi Akashi, senior UN official in former Yugoslavia, described the talks as 'positive' with respect to 'the urgency of the crisis we face in Gorazde'. He said Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, had agreed to an immediate ceasefire which was due to come into force at noon local time today. No details of the ceasefire agreement - one of many this week - were immediately available, and it is uncertain whether Bosnian Serb forces will comply. Shelling resumed in Gorazde last night after an early evening lull. Nato's threats are the toughest warning the alliance has issued to the Bosnian Serbs. They underline a sense of urgency over conditions in Gorazde, where more than 500 people have been killed and 1,700 wounded in a Serb offensive. Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, said: 'Half-measures will not do. The alliance has decided to take resolute action. The situation demands action.' In Washington, President Bill Clinton said the Bosnian Serbs 'should not doubt' Nato's willingness to act. 'This decision provides Nato forces with broader authority to respond to Bosnian Serb attacks.' Mr Clinton contradicted reports that his administration was reconsidering its refusal to send ground troops to Bosnia before the completion of a peace agreement, and also said that extending bombing raids into Serbia 'would not be appropriate at this time'. But Mr William Perry, defence secretary, said any air strikes resulting from the ultimatum should be 'vigorous. . . That means in quantity of airplanes sent over and in diversity of targets'. Targets for bombing would be defined by the alliance in consultation with Unprofor, the UN protection force in Bosnia, according to a Nato statement. This indicated the alliance had secured greater freedom of action than before in choosing where to attack. City where the dead are lucky Page 2</p>

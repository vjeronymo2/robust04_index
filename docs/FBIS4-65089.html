			<p>BFN     [Text] Madrid, 11 May (EFE) -- Spanish Prime Minister  Felipe Gonzalez reiterated today, Wednesday, his decision not to  resign and to remain in charge of the executive branch to  achieve "an atmosphere of confidence, which is necessary for  strengthening the economy."    In an appearance before the Parliament, Gonzalez recognized  the "social alarm" and the "political uncertainty experienced in  the last few days" in Spain, but he pointed out that "a greater  atmosphere of instability would be created" if I were to resign.    Gonzalez said he was willing to ask for the parliament's  vote  of confidence but only "at the necessary moment and that moment  is not here yet."</p>

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Prices fall as India relaxes bullion imports THE BOMBAY bullion market reacted bearishly yesterday to the Indian government's proposed relaxation of the 22-year ban on gold imports. allowed to import 5 kilos of gold as part a bid to end smuggling, the government announced in its Budget statement over the weekend. Smuggling has hitherto been the main source of supply to citizens who crave for the precious metal. The gold price on the Bombay market - pacesetter for other Indian centres - fell by 232 rupees or 5 per cent to Rs. 4,418 (Dollars 168.78) per 10 grams of gold yesterday, the first day of trading since the announcement. Monday was a holiday. A 15 per cent import duty on gold, payable in convertible currencies, will be levied with the twin purpose of narrowing the gap of Rs. 900 per 10 grams between local and international gold prices and of easing India's present foreign exchange crisis. India is estimated to consume some 220 tonnes of gold a year. Two-thirds of the country's demand is met by imports and most of the rest is met by scrap or recycled old jewellery. Only about two tonnes of gold a year is mined in India. India has strict foreign exchange controls. They have encouraged a flourishing underground economy and substantial premium for the dollar over the official exchange rate. Dubai-based gold smugglers also operate as money changers for Indian expatriates, who remit money for their families back home and use the convertible currencies to finance gold imports to India. The Indian government has introduced a dual exchange rate for the rupee in an attempt to put unofficial money changers out of business. Sixty per cent of proceeds from merchandise exports and invisible earnings can be sold at market rates and the remaining 40 per cent has to be handed over to the Reserve Bank of India at the official rate. The US dollar was quoted at Rs. 29.40 on the free market on the first day yesterday against the black market conversion rate of Rs. 31.50. When parity is achieved between the two and expatriate Indians bring in gold in sufficient quantity, smugglers will have no role as money changers for expatriates in the Gulf and in gold supply.</p>

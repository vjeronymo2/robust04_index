			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Active trade in utilities The British Gas strategy meeting, details of the Offer review of the Scottish power companies, and confirmation that the government is to sell its remaining 40 per cent stakes in the two English generators, triggered exceptionally heavy trading in the utilities areas of the market. The water sector provided one of the FT-SE 100's best performers in Severn Trent, which advanced 9 to 551p after more switching from the regional electricity companies (recs), while the two Scottish generator groups plunged, with Scottish Power easily the FT-SE 100's worst performer. Utilities analysts said the Offer review was broadly as expected but that the stocks were hit for a number of reasons. These included the market's overall poor performance, over-optimistic expectations of real dividend growth which some of the bulls said could be in the region of 8 to 10 per cent, the underperformance of the English generator companies, and worries about Scottish Hydro-Electric taking its case to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Three of the market's heavyweight broking firms, BZW, SG Warburg and Kleinwort Benson, were said to have adopted a bearish view of the regulatory review and been partly responsible for driving Scottish Power down 31 to 349p in 15m shares traded and Hydro-Electric 45 lower to 327p on 8.5m. National Power outperformed the market and lost only 3 1/2 at 450 1/2 p and PowerGen managed a marginal gain at 514 1/2 p, with dealers expect-ing the big institutions to chase both stocks ahead of the share sales. There were no real shocks in British Gas's strategy presentation; the stock receded 9 1/2 to 290p on turnover of 28m. Some analysts were disturbed by the apparent inconsistency on dividend policy, but others professed satisfaction with the company's performance at the meeting and especially that of Mr Giordano, the non-executive chairman. Ms Irene Himono at Strauss Turnbull increased her current year dividend forecast from 14.5p tp 14.75p and that for next year to 15.5p. Mr Steve Turner at Nomura moved his dividend estimates up to 14.8p and 15.5p and labelled British Gas a 'trading buy'. He added: 'It was a very positive presentation, with the management committed to delivering real dividend growth.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 9 TASS--ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI carries an  article about Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev's current  three-day visit to Transcaucasian republics. The visit began on  Wednesday. The article is headlined "Will Russian Peacekeepers  Be Brought to Abkhazia?".    "Fifteen hundred Russian peacekeepers are supposed to be  brought to the area of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict.  Peacekeeping units from other CIS countries are to be brought  to the region at subsequent stages of the operation to settle  the situation there.    "Final decisionmaking is within the competence of the  Russian  president who chairs the council of the heads of state of CIS  countries."    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA runs an article contributed by Russian  Defence Minister Pavel Grachev under the headline "The Military  Doctrine and Security of Russia".    Grachev explains the essence of the most important  provisions  of the military doctrine and peculiarities of the contemporary  military-political and geostrategic position of Russia,  determining basic approaches to ensuring her national security.    Touching upon nuclear weapons, Grachev pointed out as  follows: "One of the paradoxes of the nuclear age is the fact  that nuclear weapons while piling up in the arsenals of  adversaries during the Cold War, assumed a new form of their  existence as a political deterrent to a large-scale war".    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (Red Star) carries an article about the  Russian Defence Ministry's special control service which  monitored foreign nuclear tests.    "The main method to detect underground nuclear explosions is  a seismic one. Over a span of 35 years, the ministry's  monitoring service recorded more than 600 various nuclear  detonations at foreign test sites. They were conducted by the  United States, France, China, Britain, and India.    "After the Cold War ended, nuke test monitoring problems did  not diminish. Countries began to conduct only underground  nuclear detonations of low and very low yield. There also  emerged countries which are potential possessors of nuclear  weapons".    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA reports, referring to informed sources  in the Russian Government, that "the question of Viktor  Chernomyrdin's resignation from the premiership on health  grounds and the appointment of Yuriy Skokov has been decided in  principle in President Boris Yeltsin's entourage".    The newspaper's opinion is that Skokov's expected  appointment  is prompted by the fact that "the Russian parliament ceases to  be controlled by the president. Therefore, most likely, Skokov,  in exchange for his appointment to the premiership, promised  Yeltsin to ensure the pilotage of the president-drafted bills  through the State Duma".    TRUD runs an open letter by researchers from the Russian  Academy of Medical Sciences to Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin. The researchers urge him "to keep the established  procedure for financing the academy as a separate item in the  federal budget".    Researchers point out that "research funding has ceased.  Funds assigned for the payment of salaries to the research  staff and attending personnel in April-May 1994 accounted for 65  percent of the necessary amount. Russian medico-biological  science, which once won world recognition, may be ruined and its  restoration would take decades".    PRAVDA carries an interview with Olzhas Suleymenov, a  prominent Kazakh poet and member of the republican parliament.    Touching upon the idea of establishing a Euro-Asian  confederation, Suleymenov expressed the conviction that "a  confederation or a union of independent states of Eurasia is a  historical inevitability. The Commonwealth of Independent  States is the threshold of such an entity".    The newspaper SEGODNYA (Today) comments on the incident  involving the U.S. C-130 cargo plane which was forced to land at  Adler by Russian jetfighters while on a flight from Frankfurt on  Main to Tbilisi.    The paper points out that "in view of the break-up of the  Soviet air defence system, Russia has to set up new air defence  district boundaries, in the Caucasus in particular, which served  as the subject of study by U.S. and NATO radio reconnaissance  centres in Turkey. The presence of reconnaissance equipment on  board the C-130 is not ruled out. According to onboard  documents, the plane carried a diplomatic cargo, an inspection  of which was scarcely probable".</p>

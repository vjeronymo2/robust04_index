			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / TV advert joint ventures explored SCOTTISH Television is talking to Granada Television and Meridian Broadcasting, the new south of England ITV company, about possible joint ventures in television airtime sales. TVMM, the Scottish company's joint venture with HTV, the ITV company for Wales and the West, also sells advertising for its northern neighbour Grampian Television and for Westcountry. Granada is also talking to Meridian, which decided to sell its own airtime when it began broadcasting in January rather than join an existing sales house. A Granada link with TVMM or Meridian would take both up to a 25 per cent share of ITV advertising - the maximum allowed under existing legislation. It would also create a powerful sales force which could command television advertising sales of about Pounds 400m a year. The talks are taking place against growing tension in the commercial television industry. Last month London Weekend Television paid Pounds 14m for a 14 per cent stake in Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television. The deal was accompanied by a five-year advertising sales contract under which LWT will receive a fixed annual fee plus commission for selling the Yorkshire group's advertising. Granada was interested in the Yorkshire stake and was upset to be pipped to the deal. Mr Tim Wootton, managing director of TSMS, the largest sales house, pointed out last night that in 1989 there were 14 separate sales points for ITV advertising. There are now seven.</p>

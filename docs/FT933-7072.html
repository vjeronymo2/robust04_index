			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Texas Homecare recruits chief executive amid board changes TEXAS Homecare, Ladbroke's DIY chain, yesterday announced a shake-up at the top. It appointed Mr John Coleman, former managing director of the Dorothy Perkins chain, as chief executive. It also revealed that Mr Ron Trenter, Texas chairman, would move shortly to another position within Ladbroke. The announcement, in the wake of rumours that Mr Cyril Stein, Ladbroke's chairman, was about to retire, may lead to speculation that Mr Trenter is being groomed to succeed him. Analysts said this was unlikely, as Mr Peter George, vice-chairman, had long been seen as heir apparent to Mr Stein. Ladbroke would say only it had 'something lined up' for Mr Trenter, but could not reveal what this was. It said it originally intended to replace Mr Peter Hartley, the Texas managing director who left in July after 'differences of opinion' with Mr Trenter, with another managing director. But its search process produced candidates of such quality that it decided to make Mr Coleman chief executive, enabling Mr Trenter to move on - something he was keen to do after 20 years at Texas. Mr Coleman assumes his role, and a seat on Ladbroke's board, on September 13. Mr Trenter is expected to stay until Christmas to ensure a smooth handover, but will then leave Mr Coleman effectively to fill the roles of chairman and chief executive. Texas will be hoping Mr Coleman's appointment will restore stability after several management changes. In addition to Mr Hartley, Mr Peter Hallett, finance director, left in June for Hobson, the toiletries group. Mr Coleman joins Texas at a difficult time. A price war among the main DIY chains last year resulted in a fall in profits at Texas - number two in the market with an 8 per cent share - from Pounds 47.5m to Pounds 43.5m, and trading remains tough. Ladbroke announces interim results on September 2, with Texas expected to disclose a 27 per cent fall in profits to about Pounds 19m. Mr Coleman left Dorothy Perkins in April, officially because of differences in management style. But there were stories in the trade that he was talking to headhunters about other senior retail positions - including the chief executive's role vacated by Mr David Dworkin at Storehouse.

			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / International Company News: Swiss banks lifted by first-half improvements FIRST-HALF results from three medium-sized Swiss banks underpin expectations of a banner year in prospect for the industry. BZ Bank, the Zurich securities house headed by Mr Martin Ebner, reports first-half net income of SFr49.9m (Dollars 35.6m), not far from the SFr59.5m earned in the whole of last year. It was the first time BZ, which is privately held, reported interim results and no comparative figures were given. Last week, Banca del Gottardo, the Lugano based bank controlled by Japan's Sumitomo Bank, said cash flow rose 22 per cent to SFr61.4m in the first half. While two weeks ago, Julius Baer, another Zurich banking group, said its first-half net profit was about SFr70m, slightly higher than the figure for the whole of last year. Lower interest rates, a buoyant local stock market, big new inflows of investment funds and controlled costs are the factors contributing to these results. The Swiss stock market's all-share index is up 22 per cent since the beginning of the year, enabling banks to make large gains in trading and commission income. Baer said its trading income more than doubled in the first half, Gottardo said stock trading and new issue commission income was up 30 per cent while BZ's securities related income, at SFr50.9m, was 28 per cent above the figure for the whole of last year. Baer, which specialises in asset management, said its commission income from this business was up 20 per cent. Also, clients' assets grew by about 10 per cent in the first six months and total SFr36bn. Analysts said funds had been pouring into Switzerland this year, partly because of continuing turbulence in exchange rates in other European countries. Mr Bernhard Tschanz, head of investment research at Credit Suisse, said Switzerland's decision last December to stay out of the European Economic Area helped. Baer's net interest income gained 10 per cent, reflecting widening spreads as interest rates fell. The big three Swiss universal banks, Union Bank of Switzerland, Swiss Bank Corporation and Credit Suisse, are the main beneficiaries of this trend, and they are all expected to report sharply higher first-half profits. Most banks are benefiting from two years of aggressive internal cost cutting. Baer's expenses in the first half were up only 6 per cent while Gottardo's declined.</p>

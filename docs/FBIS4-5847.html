			<p>BFN     [Text] Radio correspondent Le Thanh reports that the Hanoi  Capital Military Region Party Committee [HCMRPP] held a mid-term  party conference.    The political report presented at the conference states that  in the last three years, the HCMRPP has exerted many efforts to  consolidate its force and improve its military form, thus  creating an important foundation to work with other forces to  maintain political stability in the capital. On that  foundation, the awareness of function and duty in the entire  party committee has been strengthened and deepened. Compared  with the duty requirements, however, the Hanoi Capital Armed  Force [HCAF] still has to improve its service quality. It must  pay more attention to building an all-people national defense to  match the market-oriented economy and broaden its external  economic relation, which is still slow in its renovation  undertaking. The political knowledge and ability of the HCAF  are not on a par with its responsibility.    Attending and addressing the conference, Senior Lieutenant  General Le Kha Phieu, member of the Political Bureau and  director of the Political General Department, hailed the efforts  and achievements of the HCMRPP over the past two years and more.  The general also repeated the requirements imposed on the  HCMRPP in the coming period. First of all, the entire party  committee must strive to improve its capacity and knowledge to  match all requirements for a capital military region. Together  with the upgrading of political ability, every cadre and party  member must have complete knowledge and capacity to accomplish  all entrusted duties. The entire party committee must  satisfactorily complete its duty to build a regular armed force  and to build the military region up to the trust of the armed  forces in the entire country.</p>

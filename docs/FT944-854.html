			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / People: Ellis takes his castles to France Nigel Ellis, BAA's 55-year-old finance director, is opting for a change in lifestyle before he gets too old to enjoy himself. He has decided to chuck in his job at Britain's biggest airport operator so that he can spend more time at his home in France's Dordogne region. Ellis, whose recreations include collecting Swedish stamps and chess, joined BAA in 1988 shortly after the government had privatised the old British Airports Authority. Having started as an articled clerk in 1957, he worked as chief accountant in several firms before becoming finance director of Hammerson Property in 1979. Ellis was unavailable yesterday, but BAA stressed that his departure was very much his own decision. Sir John Egan, BAA's chief executive, says Ellis has made an 'invaluable contribution' to the company's success and would continue to act as a consultant. Ellis intends to retire at a mutually convenient date after the end of the current financial year ends in March 1995. BAA will begin its search for his successor in the New Year.</p>

			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Observer: Sober thought Exam-obsessed Britain's long-running debate over whether John Major gained any O-level passes, has largely overlooked the question of how he might have benefited if he had. Fortunately, an answer emerged at the British Psychological Society's conference, which ended yesterday. It has hitherto been a mystery what passing such exams enables people to do  -except, of course, for things they are bureaucratically prevented from doing if they fail: such as higher education. But UK psychologists Adrian Skinner and Christine Williams have noted one practical benefit. Heavy drinking has less of a brain-scrambling effect on boozers with O-levels than on those without. So it's probably as well that Major downs only the odd one.</p>

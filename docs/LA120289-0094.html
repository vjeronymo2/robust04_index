			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DAY HIKE: TAKE A WALK ON THE WILD SIDE OF PALM SPRINGS  </P> <P> Palm Springs today is a curious sight -- a chain of sparkling green islands on  the desert sand. For a good overview of the resort, hikers can take Museum and  Lykken trails.  </P> <P> This hike in the hills begins at the Palm Springs Desert Museum, where  natural-science exhibits recreate the unique ecology of Palm Springs and the  surrounding Colorado Desert. Displays interpret the astonishing variety of  plant and animal life in addition to the powerful geological forces that shaped  this desert land. The museum also has exhibits portraying the original  inhabitants of the Coachella Valley, who managed to live in what seems to be a  harsh and unforgiving land.  </P> <P> The steep Museum Trail ascends the western base of Mt. San Jacinto. Letters  painted on the rocks suggest that this was once a nature trail. After a mile  climb, Museum Trail junctions with Lykken Trail. This trail, formerly known as  Skyline Trail, winds through the Palm Springs hills north to Tramway Road and  south to Ramon Road.  </P> <P> Skyline Trail was renamed Lykken Trail in 1972 in honor of Carl Lykken, Palm  Springs pioneer and the town's first postmaster. Lykken, who arrived in 1913,  owned a general merchandise store and later a department/hardware store.  </P> <P> Early Palm Springs social life consisted of stopping at the Desert Inn to check  if any new and interesting guests had arrived, then dropping by Carl Lykken's  store to pick up the mail, make a phone call (Lykken had the first telephone)  and catch up on all the gossip.  </P> <P> Directions to trailhead: From Highway 111 (Palm Canyon Drive) in the middle of  downtown Palm Springs, turn west on Tahquitz-McCallum Way, then right on Museum  Drive. Park in Palm Springs Desert Museum's north lot.  </P> <P> The trail begins behind the museum, between the museum and an administration  building, near a plaque honoring Carl Lykken. During the hot summer months, the  trail is closed for health reasons (yours), but it is thoroughly enjoyable  during cooler months.  </P> <P> The Hike: The trail ascends the rocky slope above the museum. Soon you'll  intersect a private road, jog left, then resume the trail walking up the  mountainside. As you rapidly gain elevation, the view widens from the Desert  Fashion Plaza to the outskirts of Palm Springs to the wide-open spaces of the  Coachella Valley.  </P> <P> A mile's ascent brings you to a picnic area built by the Desert Riders, local  equestrians whose membership included Carl Lykken. One of the Desert Riders,  former Palm Springs Mayor Frank Bogert, is a real trail enthusiast whose  efforts have contributed much to the state's trail system.  </P> <P> The Carl Lykken trail's north leg goes to Tramway Road; it's not too exciting.  Instead, bear left (south) on Lykken Trail, which travels the hills above town  before descending to Ramon Road near the mouth of Tahquitz Canyon. You can  follow Ramon Road to downtown Palm Springs or return the way you came.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lykken Trail  </P> <P> Palm Springs Desert Museum to Desert Riders Overlook  </P> <P> 2 miles round trip; 800-foot elevation gain  </P> <P> Palm Springs Desert Museum to Ramon Drive  </P> <P> 4 miles round trip; 800-foot elevation gain  </P></p>

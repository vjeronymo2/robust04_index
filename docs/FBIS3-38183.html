			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Odinzov report: "Chernomyrdin's Promise"] </F>   [Text] Rome -- "The Russian prime minister gave his full  and clear confirmation that the reform program will continue,  even if it does have ups and downs." This short sentence,  tossed out almost absent-mindedly by Prime Minister Ciampi  following his talks with Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin,  was the key to reading the joint declaration, which might have  been a bit unbalanced in its good proposals and readiness if it  had not actually been upheld and guaranteed by this  "confirmation." Both the Italians and Russians feel that the  aim of Chernomyrdin's official visit, which will end this  evening, was on the one hand to allow Ciampi to check that the  reform process has not been compromised by conservative  reticence applied by the new government in Moscow, and on the  other hand assure the Russian prime minister that the  continuation of the cooperation agreements with Italy would  contribute to the reforms.    Moreover, Ciampi explicitly emphasized that on the Italian  side "everything is linked to political developments in Russia,"  thus virtually making bilateral economic cooperation a  condition. In this way, the joint document turned into a  declaration of intent which provides for mutual opportunities  and interests in the future for reinforcing all links and  agreements, in particular those concerning the energy sector --  both petroleum and nuclear -- "via the rapid conclusion of  negotiations on the new agreement to promote and protect  investments." "The rapid finalization of this agreement," added  the document, "which takes account of the significant progress  made by the Russian Federation toward the market economy, will  certainly be able to contribute to the growth of reciprocal  flows of investment and to the intensification of bilateral  relations."    An initial sign of the importance Italy attaches to the  Russian Federation can be seen in the fact that our country is  already in second place, after Germany, in bilateral trade.  There has also been a recent agreement between ENI [National  Hydrocarbons Institute] and Gazprom -- worth more than $2  billion -- to supply 5.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas  between now and 2017.    Nevertheless, the path to be followed does not seem short.  Chernomyrdin and Ciampi have not actually succeeded in  overcoming the stumbling block of double taxation which is  crucial to the interest of Italian businesses in joint ventures.  No progress has been made in restructuring the former Soviet  foreign debt, and the prime minister committed just a vague  promise when Chernomyrdin asked him for "Italian support to  transform the G7 into the G8." For Yeltsin, who will be in  Naples for the July meeting of the group of the most  industrialized countries, full membership in this private club  would be a personal and political success which would confirm  the West's trust in his program and which would indirectly belie  the dire predictions made a few days ago by Jeffrey Sachs, his  chief economic adviser who has now resigned.    Indeed, at the G7 meeting in Naples the Italian-Russian  document seems to postpone the final examination and "the  occasion to analyze the initiatives under way which aim to  encourage Russia's progress toward a market economy."    Yesterday's talks at the Villa Madama [Foreign Ministry  venue  for hosting top-level foreign guests] also tackled the crisis in  Bosnia (examined by Foreign Minister Andreatta and Russian  Deputy Foreign Minister Adamishin) and the Partnership for Peace  program launched at the recent NATO summit.    On this last point the Italians made an imperceptible slide  toward the Russian idea of favoring the CSCE over the Atlantic  Alliance for managing security in Europe. Indeed, the joint  declaration states that the Partnership for Peace aims to  involve the Alliance in an increasingly close and reassuring  relationship with eastern Europe with the prospect that this  partnership will contribute to the expansion and reinforcement  of European stability and to the creation of a single collective  system of European security within the framework of the CSCE.    With regard to the Yugoslav conflict, while reconfirming  Russia's pro-Serb position against any use of force, he stressed  that crisis could only be solved "by political means."</p>

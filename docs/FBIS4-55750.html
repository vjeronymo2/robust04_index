			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Dejan Lukovic] </F>   [Text] The behavior and intentions of Vojislav Seselj,  leader of the Serbian Radical Party [SRS], to create his own set  of values in the order of the political scene of Serbia -- along  the lines of a holy and infallible inquisition -- both toward  individuals and institutions, oversteps the limits of true  endurance and tolerance. Like a genie from the lamp, he  appeared on the political scene, where -- instead of activism --  he has very frequently and deliberately displayed aggression,  and -- instead of respecting other protagonists in political  life -- he has practiced the skill of passing judgment without  evidence.    Yesterday's scandal -- that has to be the right word for it  -- in the FRY Assembly is only a continuation of a string of  similar acts by Mr. Seselj. Let us remember how he tried to use  violence against the taxi drivers, how he showed his strength in  the close encounter with the teachers, and how -- instead of  presenting arguments -- he told his female colleague, the deputy  from Montenegro, that she should go to a gigolo club. He has  been using language devoid of all the basics of decency to keep  smearing people and vulgarizing the public scene in Serbia, all  under the guise of political activity, in which the measure of  truth is only what he says or does.    His publicly displayed inclination toward violence or -- to  be more precise -- toward extreme radicalism, is deeply  contradictory to democratic and political pluralism, and it  cannot justify itself through violent confrontation. To accept  such methods is the limit that, if exceeded, leaves room for no  surprise, including physical clashes with those who have  different political views. The behavior of Radical leader Mr.  Seselj irresistibly reminds one of a mutation of democracy. It  is no exaggeration to say that, rather frequently, he has  skillfully combined elements from the political grey area and  his status of inviolability to leave a large number of ordinary  people with the feeling of real fear. Never was anything good  achieved through bad means. Particularly not when the first  signs of the improvement in the situation in former Yugoslavia  are to be seen, and when a climate is being created that is not  favorable to the political options and methods of Mr. Seselj.    The leader and some of the SRS deputies can of course  continue to behave in the manner of smashers of civilized  dialogue, proposers of the abolition of other political  organizations and different views. The question is, however,  whether more indifference and contempt as a moral stand can be  our alibi for our reluctance to define clearly and decisively  the pathological in the political and everyday life. The later  it is done, the higher the price to be paid.</p>

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs set to urge BCCI repayments A COMMITTEE of backbench MPs is poised to recommend that customers who lost money when Bank of Credit and Commerce International collapsed should receive compensation. The move will increase pressure on the government to provide additional funds for the bank's UK depositors. In an unusual supplementary report, understood to be in the process of being drafted, the Treasury and Civil Service committee is also expected to urge the Bank of England to shoulder a greater share of the blame for the collapse. The report follows last month's appearance before the committee of Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank, and two other senior Bank officials. At that meeting, Mr Leigh-Pemberton and his colleagues endured a fierce cross-examination by MPs over the Bank's supervision of BCCI, including repeated questioning over why he or another senior official of the Bank had not resigned. The report, which may be published before MPs rise for the Christmas recess on December 17, is not expected to put a figure on the amount that should be paid to BCCI's former customers. Mr Giles Radice, the Labour MP for Durham North who acted as committee chairman for the purposes of last month's examination, is thought to be anxious to secure the unanimous support of all committee members, including Conservatives and Mr Alan Beith, the lone Liberal Democrat. Mr Radice was called to the chair when Mr John Watts, the Tory MP for Slough who is the elected chairman, declared an interest, saying: 'One of the clients of my accountancy practice suffered a substantial loss in the collapse of BCCI.' In October, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor,rejected calls for extra compensation to be paid to BCCI depositors in the UK, saying the existing depositor protection scheme had already paid out Pounds 50m to about 9,000 people and the total might reach Pounds 85m. This followed publication of Lord Justice Bingham's report into the affair, which criticised the Bank for failing to take appropriate action after receiving a series of warnings over many years that fraud was taking place at BCCI. The report, commissioned by the Bank and the government, was also critical of Price Waterhouse, BCCI's auditor, for failing to brief the Bank fully about the extent of the fraud it had uncovered there in early 1991, and of Abu Dhabi, the Gulf state which had a majority shareholding in BCCI. In February, Abu Dhabi agreed a compensation deal with BCCI's liquidators which could lead to a payment of up to Dollars 2.2bn to creditors. During last month's examination, Mr Leigh-Pemberton said the Bank should not have waited until BCCI's closure before tightening supervision, but he could not 'take absolute responsibility for every bank.' Although the Bingham report criticised various aspects of how BCCI was handled, it never stated that the Bank was 'negligent,' he said.</p>

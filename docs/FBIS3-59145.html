Between 1975 and 1980, the defendant passed on some 35,000  sheets of confidential military documents from an archive of the  IBM Special Systems company [IBM Sondersysteme] to the main  Department II of the MfS [former GDR Ministry for State  Security], which handled counterintelligence. In the event of a  military conflict, the betrayal could have led to the complete  destruction of NATO's navy.</p>

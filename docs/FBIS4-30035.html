			<p>BFN     [Text] Recently, the Dong Nai Province Agricultural  Materials Corporation imported 40 tonnes of poor quality DK888  corn strains from Thailand for sale to peasants in Xuan Loc  District, Dong Nai Province, causing heavy losses to production.    After reviewing a report by the Government Office and the  action taken by the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry  and the Dong Nai Province people's committee, the prime minister  of the Government instructed the people's committee to prepare a  detailed report on the case to determine the responsibility of  the Agricultural Materials Corporation [AMC] for the imports and  sale of poor quality corn strains to peasants, take appropriate  disciplinary action against those individuals involved, and  adopt urgent practical measures to ensure the interests of the  peasants.    The prime minister also instructed the people's commitee to  direct the Agricultural Materials Corporation in contacting the  Thai exporter to resolve this problem.    Following this incident, the prime minister instructed state  management agencies and organs and units in charge of supplying  agricultural materials countrywide to uphold a sense of  responsibility in preventing a recurrence of such an incident.</p>

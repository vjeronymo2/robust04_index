			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, 17 Feb (ITAR-TASS) -- The Russian Foreign  Ministry today issued a statement in which it calls on the  United States and the countries of the European Union "to exert  the necessary influence on the Bosnian Government in order to  ensure that it cooperates with the United Nations in completely  unblocking and demilitarizing Sarajevo."    The document notes that, as a result of the steps which have  been undertaken by the Russian leadership, "the firm and  consistent line, excluding unilateral ultimatums, has produced  results." In response to an appeal from Russia, the Bosnian  Serbs adopted a decision to withdraw their heavy weapons from  the region of Sarajevo.    In this connection, the Russian Foreign Ministry calls on  the  Bosnian Government "without delay to place all its heavy weapons  in the region of Sarajevo under the control of the UN forces."    Russia's Foreign Ministry considers that in addition to  lifting the blockade from Sarajevo, the UN Security Council  should "urgently begin searching for ways to establish UN  administrative rule in the city, as well as implement measures  aimed at reinforcing other safety areas on the territory of  Bosnia-Herzegovina."    Russia also announces that it is ready to send part of its  military contingent within the UN forces "on a mission of  ensuring that the agreements on removing the blockade from  Sarajevo are observed."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 1 KYODO -- The government of Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will aim to cut or loosen a total of  1,450 government regulations starting in the next fiscal year  beginning in April, government sources said Tuesday [1 February].    The target is contained in the final draft of the cabinet's  deregulation plan, a copy of which was obtained by KYODO NEWS  SERVICE.    The draft says about 60 laws must be revised to conduct the  deregulation. Of the 60, the Hosokawa cabinet will submit 50  amendment bills to the current ordinary session of the Diet,  which began its 150-day run Monday.    The plan will be officially adopted Thursday by the cabinet  task force on administrative reform promotion, headed by  Hosokawa, as part of the government's efforts to stimulate the  sluggish economy, the sources said.    The 1,450 items contain 800 regulations to be trimmed and  650  rules to be eased. The government will draw up a concrete  deregulation promotion plan by the end of March 1995, which will  be carried out over the next five years, according to the plan.    The government's proposal on administrative reform has eight  chapters including deregulation, transferring administrative  power to local authorities, fostering access to administrative  information and streamlining administrative procedures.    In a related move, an advisory body urged Transport Minister  Shigeru Ito on Tuesday to ease regulations on pilots' health,  taking improved medical techniques into consideration.    The Transport Ministry hopes to revise related laws by the  end of June and implement the council's proposals by fall,  ministry officials said.    The panel submitted a report saying that the ministry should  allow pilots to wear contact lenses instead of glasses.  Although the ministry does not allow pilots to fly if they put  on more than 30 percent of the standard weight for their height,  the council said they should be allowed to fly if their  circulatory and respiratory systems are functioning healthily.    Pilots must pass health checks every half year and other  crew  members every year, the ministry said. A total of 13,000 pilots  and other crew members undergo medical examinations annually and  an average of about 50 fail, the officials said.</p>

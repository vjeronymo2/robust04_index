			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Cost of borrowing falls in France, Sweden and Ireland FRANCE, Ireland and Sweden yesterday took advantage of Thursday's German interest rate cuts to ease their own cost of borrowing. The Bank of France yesterday made a slight reduction in its overnight lending facility, to try to alleviate the financial pressure on the French banks and defuse the threat of a rise in base rates. The cut in the overnight rate - from 11.9375 per cent to 11.625 per cent - was the second in French short-term rates in a week. It was part of the central bank's efforts to cut the borrowing costs of the commercial banks, hit hard by the discrepancy between market rates and their own base rates. Despite yesterday's cut in overnight rates, economists are sceptical about the chances of a significant reduction in French official interest rates until German rates have come down further and the Bank of France has had time to replenish its reserves, run down last month during its battle to protect the franc. Tensions in the Dublin financial markets also eased yesterday as Ireland's Central Bank restored its short-term lending facility of 13.75 per cent, cutting its minimum lending rate by a quarter of a point. The STF is the peg by which the banks and building societies fix their commercial lending and mortgage rates. It was replaced last November by an overnight advance facility, used by the bank as its main weapon to defend the punt against speculative attacks during the currency crisis. Its restoration is a signal that liquidity and stability are returning to the market. The key one-month rate on the interbank market was down to 14 per cent yesterday, which building societies have said is the level needed to avoid mortgage rate increases. In Stockholm the Swedish Riksbank, the country's central bank, lowered its key marginal overnight lending rate to 9.75 per cent from 10.5 per cent, with effect from February 9. The marginal interest rate has now fallen by 2.75 percentage points since Sweden floated the krona in November.</p>

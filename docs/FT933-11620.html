			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Recycling forecast to hold back mined lead output A STEEP rise in production of secondary lead from recycled and scrap metal will hold back output from the mines, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit consultancy organisation. It points out that secondary lead already has a 50.5 per cent share of total western world production and output can be expected to grow by more than 27 per cent between 1992 and 1997, from 2.223m tonnes to 2.83m tonnes. This would take its share of forecast total output in 1997 - 4.925m tonnes - to 57.5 per cent. The EIU notes that, although lead and zinc are usually mined as co-products, miners can pick projects that shift the lead/zinc balance in the way the market indicates. So it sees mine production of lead falling by more than 6 per cent from 2.317m tonnes in 1992 to 2.17m tonnes in 1997. In contrast, mine production of zinc is forecast to rise marginally by 2 per cent to 5.73m tonnes between 1992 and 1997. However, environmental pressures will ensure more zinc is recovered from furnace dusts and the EIU expects secondary zinc production to climb from 357,000 tonnes in 1992 to 395,000 tonnes in 1997. Total refined zinc output is predicted to rise from 5.435m tonnes to 5.85m tonnes in that period. The report suggests lead and zinc prices will recover in the years to 1997 but not regain earlier peaks. The London Metal Exchange cash settlement price for lead will rally from under 18 cents a lb today to an average of 32 cents in 1997, it predicts. For zinc, the report forecasts rise from 43 cents to 62 cents a lb. It says each metal has a strong core market that accounts for a growing proportion of consumption: batteries for lead and galvanising for zinc. Net exports of these metals to the West from the former communist bloc countries 'should be reduced to much more manageable proportions by 1995-97', it adds. The EIU forecasts that average gross domestic product growth in member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in the five years to 1997 will grow at 2.3 per cent annually. Total zinc consumption is predicted to rise by an annual average of 2.3 per cent and that of lead by 2.5 per cent. The report makes a strong plea for the LME not to be turned into 'a proper futures market' with the consequent abandonment of the cash and three month system of trading and all pretence of physical delivery. 'The LME has long been the vehicle for orderly trade in base metals, without which chaos would have reigned. To distance the LME from the physical trade now would be a betrayal of the industries which increasingly rely on it both as an element of stability and a help in the conduct of their day-to-day operations,' the report adds.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>   [Text] Chisinau, 28 Feb -- The Agrarian Democratic Party  [ADP], led by Petru Lucinschi, speaker of the Moldovan  parliament, has won a convincing victory in Moldova's first  parliamentary elections on a multiparty basis, which ended late  on Sunday evening.    An ITAR-TASS correspondent learned from reliable unofficial  sources that according to preliminary vote counts, the ADP  gathered more than 43 percent of votes. In spite of forecasts,  an unexpected success was achieved by the bloc of the Socialist  Party and the Yedinstvo Intermovement, relying on the support of  the Russian-speaking population, which received more than 20  percent of votes. Like the agrarians, this bloc also supports  Moldovan independence, a just solution of the Gagauz and  Dniester problems, and the strengthening of links with the CIS.    Judging by the preliminary election results, in the new  Moldovan parliament their opposition will comprise the Popular  Christian Democratic Front, supporting unification with Romania,  which received approximately 7 percent of votes, and the bloc of  the intelligentsia and peasants, led by Aleksandru Mosanu,  ex-speaker of the Moldovan parliament, which gathered  approximately 13 percent of the votes.    In the view of observers, these figures indicate that  nationalistically oriented parties have won a major victory in  the Moldovan elections.    Judging by the preliminary election results, of the 13  parties and movements that took part in the elections, so far  only four have managed to pass the 4 percent barrier.    The Central Electoral Commission is still summing up the  final results of the voting. However, in the view of party  representatives, these are unlikely to differ from the  preliminary results.</p>

			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Singapore goes all out to turn its citizens into share owners - The 'stocks are good for you' policy is a significant change WHEN Singapore's leaders decide on a new policy, the state's considerable propaganda apparatus swings into action. Earlier this year Mr Goh Chok Tong, Singapore's prime minister, announced plans to turn the island republic into a share-owning society, saying: 'The aim is literally to allow Singaporeans to own a piece of the economy'. Since Mr Goh's March speech, Singaporeans have been bombarded by state-sponsored television and newspaper advertisements describing the virtues of share ownership. For Singapore, a carefully-controlled society where speculative business activity and risk-taking have been officially frowned on, the new 'stocks are good for you' policy represents a significant change. The government has granted considerable incentives to those who put their money into the stock market. Tight regulations on the use of funds from the Citizens Provident Fund (CPF), a compulsory national savings scheme, have been lifted. Singaporeans have been urged to use a greater portion of their CPF funds, once viewed as sacrosanct by the government, to invest in the market. From the beginning of this month more than SDollars 20bn (Pounds 8.3bn) of additional CPF funds was made available to buy shares. There are political reasons for the new approach. The People's Action party (PAP), in power since Singapore's independence in the mid-1960s, is concerned about a decline in its vote in recent general elections. The PAP wants to rebut criticism that Singapore is becoming a more inequitable society: one way is to widen share ownership and make people feel they have a financial stake in the economy. But economic considerations are central to the new policy. In recent months official recognition has been increasing that the rapidly developing Singapore economy risks outgrowing its small home base. Singapore is sitting on a mountain of savings. The island republic of less than 3m people has foreign exchange reserves of more than Dollars 40bn (Pounds 25.9bn). The CPF's total assets are now put at about SDollars 50bn. The country's vast savings should be better used, say the policymakers, and directed into overseas investments. Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's senior minister and still the main architect of many policies, said earlier this year that if the country failed to internationalise its economy and develop a 'second wing', it would be quickly left behind by newly-industrialising countries such as South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong. 'We will be a failed story, one that nearly made it but stalled half-way,' said Mr Lee. The hope is that Singapore's citizens will now invest their saving in listed companies, thereby providing the financial muscle for a push overseas by corporate Singapore. Though Singaporean investors have traditionally been far less adventurous than their counterparts in Hong Kong, signs are that the official campaign, known as 'Invest Singapore', is having results. Recent share flotations of a number of companies, some of them former state-run enterprises, have been oversubscribed several times. The real test of the new policy will come this month as Singapore Telecom (ST), the state post and telecommunications service, goes on the market. ST is one of the world's most modern telecoms companies, with some of the lowest customer costs. ST's net income rose 9 per cent to SDollars 1bn on sales of SDollars 2.8bn in the year to March 1993. The ST flotation, being billed as the largest public listing yet in South-East Asia, will take place in carefully-planned stages. The government has offered an array of incentives to local investors to take part in the flotation, including big discounts to those who buy ST shares on a long-term basis. The launch is likely to set the pattern for future listings, which are planned to include the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit System, the port and the board of public utilities. Urging the public to go on a share-buying spree could backfire on the government. ST and other companies have done very well in the protected home market. The central question now is whether these companies can compete overseas. With few exceptions, Singapore companies have not distinguished themselves overseas. Analysts point out that many cash-rich companies have been very hesitant about competing abroad. Mr Lee himself has berated Singaporean business people for their stay-at-home attitude, their lack of entrepreneurial flair and their reluctance to take risks. If corporate attitudes do not change, Singapore investors might be disappointed in their investments. In turn, people could become angry with a government which has so zealously preached the virtues of participation in the stock market.</p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Veg stalls fail to see any green shoots THE GREEN shoots of recovery have yet to flourish on the fruit and vegetable stalls. Mr Philip Porter, of Porter's in Kingston upon Thames, London, said there had been an upturn but it was brought about by another kind of green shoot - the arrival of bedding plants. 'In general, it has been poor and there are no signs of a real revival,' he said. Mark, a stallholder in Lower Marsh market near London's Waterloo station, said: 'Business is well down on last year, which was bad enough,' He blamed lack of customers partly on empty office blocks. Another stallholder, Mrs Vera Cooper, agreed. 'Business is worse than ever. People are often just buying potatoes and nothing else, whereas they used to buy fruit and vegetables as well.' The only market stalls in London that appear to be doing well are those in or near busy areas such as Oxford Street, with passing trade from office workers and from tourists. Mrs Joyce Lee, who is a trader in Market Street, near Manchester's Arndale shopping centre, said: 'It's been terrible since Christmas. There's no sign of it changing. Honest to God, it's got worse in the last few weeks.' Mr Stephen Murphy, who runs a fruit and vegetable stall on Manchester's Deansgate, said: 'People don't come out at lunchtime if it's raining. You won't be able to tell if the economy has turned until the sun shines. If I'm not doing well then, you'll know we're all still in trouble.'</p>

			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Food stocks hit Broker and institutional presentations by a number of food manufacturing groups led to a welter of downgrades in the sector yesterday. United Biscuits appeared to be the hardest hit as three profits downgrades were reported by dealers following meetings in the City. BZW, Cazenove and Hoare Govett were all said to have reduced their forecasts, with the blame being attached to difficulties being encountered by UB in passing on rising costs to the powerful food retailers. UB shares retreated 7 to 377p. Unilever recovered from talk of a downgrade by SG Warburg to gain 5 at 1005p. Hillsdown's forecasts were also reported to be under review by a number of houses. The shares lost a penny to 143p.</p>

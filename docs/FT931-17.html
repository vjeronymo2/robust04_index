			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / German industry may have to recycle its goods GERMAN industry may soon become responsible for taking back and recycling the goods it sells, as the cabinet today considers a controversial bill drafted by the federal environment ministry. The bill, the first of its kind in Europe, says industrial producers will be responsible for collecting and recycling the waste they produce. Manufacturers will also have to prove that no recycling is possible before being able to incinerate their products or send them to waste deposits. The bill forbids export of any remaining waste. The environment ministry hopes such a law will force industry to create products that can be more easily recycled and re-used in the economy and reduce the increasing amount of industrial waste it produces. The German Industry and Trade Federation attacked the proposal, saying it would lead to heavy bureaucracy and burden enterprises financially. It warned that smaller enterprises would not be able to bear the higher costs the law would add to their already tight budgets. The federation criticised German efforts to implement drastic environmental laws unilaterally, saying the issues should be dealt with by the European Commission in Brussels. The Chemical Industry Federation criticised the restriction that the law would place on burning waste. 'Waste incineration is not always unecological, especially if energy can be produced as a result,' said Mr Manfred Ritz, the federation spokesman. The federation warned that the law would force producers to increase their end-prices. Moves to recycle goods have already been made by some German producers, such as the motor vehicle industry, which is devising ways car components could be re-used. Deutsche Telekom, the state telecommunications monopoly, announced last month it would create, together with the industrial groups Preussag and Alcatel Sel, a company to recycle the telecommunications equipment it sells. The bill follows a similar law, adopted in 1991, which forces industrial producers to take back and recycle consumer packaging. But the law, which led to creation of a nation-wide packaging collection network, called Deutsche System Deutschland, has recently come under attack by green lobbyists, who claim it only collects packaging and does not ensure its final recycling.</p>

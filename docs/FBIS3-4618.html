Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Sri Annwar Ibrahim said the  companies, which accompanied British Prime Minister John Major's  visit to Malaysia in September last year and which had signed  several memorandums of understanding (MOU) and intent letters,  had yet to sign the actual agreements.    He said one of the companies is (Balfour Beckley), a British  company which heads the British-Japanese consortium for the  construction of the Kuala Lumpur international airport at Sepang  at a cost of about 9 billion ringgit.    With the exclusion of Britain from the consortium, a new bid  will be issued soon for the construction of the project. He was  addressing a news conference to announce the cabinet's decision  stating that the Malaysian Government will not award any new  contracts to British companies.    The cabinet made the decision in view of the British media,  which hurled unfounded criticisms at Malaysia and its leaders  and also at the British leaders. The media reports indicated  that most of the major projects involved British companies that  embarked on dishonest agreements and the corrupt leaders of the  two countries.    All British companies that had signed MOU's or intent  letters  were duly informed of the new ruling. However, the new ruling  does not include services, administrative meetings, and  education.    Mr Major's visit was aimed at boosting his country's  economic  relations with Malaysia. Five MOU's, which were signed with the  British companies, could create 25,000 employment opportunities,  which are badly needed by the sluggish British economy.    Meanwhile, British Government sources stated in London that  a  senior diplomat was expected to be sent to Kuala Lumpur soon to  try to coax Malaysia into withdrawing its decision, which could  make the British firms lose several million pounds. Malaysia's  decision could also result in a huge number of workers losing  their jobs. Chancellor Kenneth Clark pleaded with and urged  Malaysia to understand that the British newspapers are not  controlled by the British Government, contrary to the situation  in Malaysia. The governments or trade deals had become the  victims of what was published in the newspapers. He said trade  with Malaysia is important, and economic relations between the  two countries are also important to Malaysia.    Mr Clark told the BBC that Malaysia would return to its  previous good and warm relationship with Britain.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] According to the latest information from the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Electricity Board, the technical conditions  have been created for the eastern part of Mostar to receive one  megawatt of electricity. This amount is sufficient for priority  consumers, and there will also be some distributed to the  general public, insofar as this can be done through the very  badly damaged distribution network. Repairs are under way on  two more facilities to provide Mostar with electricity. At the  same time work is under way on repairing the street lights and  the first light bulb has already started to illuminate Mostar.</p>

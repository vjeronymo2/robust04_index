			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Japan refuses to intervene in flagging market THE Japanese authorities yesterday declined to intervene to support the country's flagging stock market, which fell yesterday to its lowest level since October 1986. The Nikkei index lost 400.24 points to close at 16,045.56 - some 8 per cent down on the week so far and 59 per cent off its all-time high recorded in 1989. The market has been hit by gloomy reports about the state of the economy, including a survey by the Bank of Japan published last Friday which showed business confidence had sunk to a five-year low. Investors' fears have been compounded by warnings from securities companies of further declines in corporate profits. Many investors and businessmen alike believe the economy will recover only if the government and the Bank of Japan take measures to boost growth, including an increase in public works spending and a further cut in interest rates. Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren, the employers' federation, yesterday called for extra public works spending to boost the economy. But Ministry of Finance officials said there were no plans to intervene in the stock market or to increase public spending. Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, told a Diet committee that the government was still monitoring the effects of a public works spending package announced at the end of March and of a cut in the official discount rate in April. However, many economists believe it is a matter of time before the government and the Bank of Japan consider further such measures. Japan is under US pressure to make a strong pledge to promote growth at the Group of Seven leaders' summit in Munich early next month. Reuter adds: Japan said yesterday it extended a record Dollars 11bn (Pounds 6bn) in official development assistance in 1991, up 19.6 per cent from the year before. The sum accounted for 0.32 per cent of gross national product against 0.31 per cent in 1990, the Foreign Ministry said.</p>

			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ARTS  </P> <P> ABT Names Co-Directors: Jane Hermann, 53, and Oliver Smith, 72, were named  co-directors of American Ballet Theatre, it was announced Thursday. Smith held  the title of co-director with Lucia Chase from 1945 to 1980.  </P> <P> The announcement by the ABT board confirms that Hermann will continue to run  the company artistically as well as administratively. Named ABT executive  director last September, Hermann said that she originally intended to work  together with artistic director Mikhail Baryshnikov. She assumed total control  after Baryshnikov abruptly quit. The company performs in Costa Mesa through  March 18. "I think I have an enormous amount to do," Hermann told The Times  Thursday, "but I'm going in to this tremendous challenge with enormous backing  from the board. It is a great trust and I take it very, very seriously." BETH  KLEID  </P></p>

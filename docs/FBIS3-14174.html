			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Tehran, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Iranian  security forces in a number of Iranian cities and areas were  placed on a partial state of alert yesterday following reports  that armed opposition groups were planning a series of attacks  on the occasion of the Iranian new year which begins tomorrow,  Monday.    Informed sources have confirmed that the security  authorities  arrested hundreds of people in a major combing operation and  that the detainees included a number of mullahs opposed to the  government in Tehran, Shiraz, and Tabriz.    According to some other reports, the current Revolutionary  Guard exercises in the Gulf will now be reduced to only four  days instead of the seven days originally scheduled. The  sources did not say why that decision was made.    An official source has strongly denied opposition claims  that  25 armed clashes occurred recently in which about 300  Revolutionary Guard members were killed or wounded.    The sources said that most of the detained mullahs are  supporters of Ayatollah Mir Mohammad Rowhani and Ayatollah  Hoseyn 'Ali Montazeri, both serious candidates for the Shiite  leadership. [passage omitted]    The government had some good news yesterday. It announced  that it had reached agreements with Austria and Switzerland for  the rescheduling of $1.2 billion of debts.    Iran has also concluded a similar agreement with Germany for  the rescheduling of $3 billion of debts. Current talks with  Japan for the rescheduling of $1.4 billion are close to  conclusion. Furthermore, India and China have agreed to hold  negotiations for the rescheduling of Iran's debts. That is in  addition to talks with 22 creditor countries from Malaysia to  Brazil. Iran's short-term debts are estimated at $9 billion and  its total foreign debts are believed to be $30 billion.</p>

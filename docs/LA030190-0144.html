			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OCTOBER'S BAY AREA EARTHQUAKE WAS MANY TIMES MORE POWERFUL  </P> <P> The magnitude of an earthquake is determined by measuring the ground motion  that results from the quake, and a 5.5 quake like the one that struck Southern  California Wednesday would be at least 60 times weaker than the 7.1 quake that  devastated parts of the San Francisco Bay Area last October.  </P> <P> Earthquake magnitude is measured on a logarithmic scale, so a 7.1 quake is 10  times more powerful than a 6.1 quake and 100 times stronger than a 5.1 quake.  </P> <P> When an earthquake hits, it sends out two general types of shock waves: surface  waves, which travel along the Earth's surface and generally do the most damage,  and body waves, which travel through the Earth. The fastest waves are body  waves called compressional waves, or primary waves, and these are the waves  felt first, usually as a sharp thud. They will be followed by secondary body  waves, which arrive with a second jolt.  </P> <P> Then comes the rolling of the ground caused by the arrival of the surface  waves.  </P></p>

			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / How To Spend It: Shoppers' chance to buy more than they had bargained for - The best sale bargain is perhaps obtained by blowing all you have to spend on one special, timeless item IF IT is January, it is sale time. The rush is on, the stores are full. Britons all over the country are taking part in the annual ritual of scrummaging through the rails for the magic garment, the must-have accessory, in the hope that it comes into that elusive category known as a bargain. But perhaps this is the year to rethink your strategy. Instead of homing in on the cheap and cheerful, of coming away with a handful of garments that are quite good value but not very special, why not blow all you have to spend on something truly special? Adopt some inverse psychology. Be prepared to spend more than usual. Go to the shops with the idea of buying something that will last you a lifetime, something special, something timeless that you will treasure. If you get it right, the pleasure of wearing it will be with you long after you have forgotten how much it cost. Imagine that you were to spend up to Pounds 1,000 or even more on just one item which, every time you put it on, made you feel wonderful. It could be a longed-for coat with swish and swagger, an evening dress that could take you anywhere or a knock-out day-time suit. Take coats. The Loewe sale, at 130 New Bond Street, for instance, is full of unique designs. The most striking include a suede swing coat with fox fur collar, new-buck leather and Loewe emblem buttons, reduced to Pounds 1,113 from Pounds 1,590. Then there is a lambskin, three-quarter length wrap coat with belt, similar to suede on the outside with soft fur on the inside, now Pounds 1,245 reduced from Pounds 1,780 - soft as butter, light as air, made from all one skin in honey, rose pink or chocolate brown. Or there is a silk puffa three-quarter length coat, with a fox fur collar - something you could dress up or down for any occasion and reduced to Pounds 756 from Pounds 1,080. And last but not least, the double-breasted 100 per cent cashmere coat with velvet collar that at Pounds 860 reduced from Pounds 1,720 seems like real investment dressing. Aquascutum in Regent Street has its sale now in full swing and also offers a range of its seasonless tweed coats with raglan sleeves - they have a slightly flared fit without any pleats or vents at the back and are now Pounds 275, reduced from Pounds 475. There are some pure wool, double-breasted red coats with flat gilt buttons and raglan sleeves reduced from Pounds 349 to Pounds 250. For Callaghan fans, Liberty of Regent Street has a three-quarter length cashmere and wool coat designed by Romeo Gigli in midnight blue only, with revere collars and beaded cuffs, reduced from Pounds 769 to Pounds 384. One stunning evening or cocktail dress can do wonders for the morale. There must have been a time when you have peered into your wardrobe and discovered that you have nothing to wear. The acquisition of one beautiful dress can solve the problem. Yves Saint Laurent at 135, Bond Street, for example, has a wide selection, the most eye-catching being a consummate long, black velvet and silk evening dress with sash: reduced from Pounds 1,030 to Pounds 395. Next door to YSL, Valentino is taking 60 per cent off evening wear from previous seasons' collections and between 40 and 50 per cent off this winter's collection. There is, for instance, a brown linen and black silk evening dress with a large bow that sits just below the neckline and suitable for any dinner or formal function. Alternatively, if you prefer a dress with a touch more daring, there is a black silk and velvet number with a back button fastening. Both are reduced from Pounds 1,100 to Pounds 440 and either would add class to any wardrobe. Ralph Lauren of 143 New Bond Street begins its sale today. Here there is an evening dress worth blowing the budget for - a black tulip split, strapless cotton and silk affair from the New York collection which has 50 per cent off, reduced from Pounds 940 to Pounds 485. There is also a plain silk, strapless, bodice-hooked dress, with a satin strip down the side, which was Pounds 335 and is now Pounds 234.50, a worthwhile reduction of 30 per cent. The Harrods sale started on Wednesday and it is worth getting there as soon as you can. For those who move in seriously dressy circles, it has a full, multi-colour sequinned, above-the-knee sleeveless number with a scoop neck by Oleg Cassini, reduced to Pounds 199 from Pounds 349. There is a full-length version with fewer sequins for those who prefer a less dramatic style, down from Pounds 649 to Pounds 389. Finally, for that special evening that we all hope for - a Ben Di Lisi crushed velvet, full-length column dress with buttons from the centre of the neck-line to the ankle, reduced from Pounds 399 to Pounds 199. Lastly, something elegant for the day. YSL have some marvellous reductions on their suits. For instance, a black and white dog-tooth check, single-breasted wool blazer which was Pounds 1,135 is now Pounds 717. It has a plain skirt to match that falls just under the knee - down from Pounds 285 to Pounds 185. There are some pin-stripe wool suits with wide lapels and bold silver buttons with skirts to match: reduced from Pounds 1,070 to Pounds 642. Ralph Lauren stock some definitive suits, most of which are reduced by 30 per cent: a sage coloured, twill wool, simple but spruce single-breasted jacket, which was Pounds 440 is now Pounds 308 - matching trousers are reduced from Pounds 195 to Pounds 130.50, while the matching above-the-knee skirt is Pounds 80.50, reduced from Pounds 115. For those who love the archetypal dog-tooth check, Ralph Lauren also has a range of double-breasted, hacking style jackets at Pounds 346.50, down from Pounds 495, with a skirt to match reduced from Pounds 130 to Pounds 91. Byblos, another great label often beyond one's reach in normal times, has some honey-check, wool, single-breasted jackets with patch pockets in Harrods sale - down to Pounds 265 from Pounds 365. There is a co-ordinating pair of blonde-coloured ski-pants which flatter the jacket at Pounds 195, down to Pounds 115. Marella at Harvey Nichols offers a charming, tuxedo-like suit with a single-breasted blazer in 100 per cent virgin wool, with shiny jet buttons and a matching knee-length skirt with a slit at the back (Pounds 145 from Pounds 290).</p>

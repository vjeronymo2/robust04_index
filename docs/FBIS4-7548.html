			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From BTA press review] </F>   [Text] Sofia, April 1 (BTA) -- After a four-day protest,  newspapers' publication was resumed today. Some compensate  their temporary suspension by larger volume. The Sofia dailies,  as well as most provincial ones, did not come out for four days  in protest against the value-added tax introduced as of April 1,  which newsmen call a "killer-tax" that will ruin the Bulgarian  press and book publishing. A bill exempting the media from VAT  is expected to be included as item No. 1 in today's agenda of  parliament.</p>

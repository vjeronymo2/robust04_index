			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPTON DOUBLES UTILITY TAXES AT SPECIAL MEETING  </P> <P> Utility taxes for residential and commercial users were doubled this week from  5% to 10% at a special session of the Compton City Council.  </P> <P> The tax hike, which passed on a 3-1 vote, takes effect immediately and is  expected to generate $3.6 million in badly needed revenue for the city.  </P> <P> In a memo to the council, City Manager Howard Caldwell said that without an  increase in the utility tax, he would have no alternative "but to recommend  significant layoffs in order to remain financially solvent as a municipality."  </P> <P> The utility tax, Caldwell also said, is the only significant revenue source  that will stabilize the General Fund, out of which most salaries are paid. Over  the last two years, budget shortfalls have forced the layoff of more than 100  people largely because of increased costs and the failure of redevelopment  projects to generate anticipated revenues.  </P> <P> In addition, the Legislature passed on new costs to the cities, Caldwell said  after the vote. Lawmakers allowed counties, which desperately need money for  social services, to begin charging cities for prisoners they put in the county  jail and also to charge cities for collecting their property taxes. The jail  fees alone, Caldwell said, could cost the city $150,000 this year.  </P> <P> The vote on the tax hike occurred at a special meeting of the council Monday  afternoon, which was held immediately after a council workshop on the city's  financial health.  </P> <P> However, the council had decided more than a week earlier to schedule the  emergency vote on the utility tax in order to beat the vote Tuesday on  Proposition 136. The proposed constitutional amendment, which was defeated,  would have required city or county governments to get voter approval to raise  any taxes.  </P> <P> Patricia A. Moore was the only member of the council to vote against the tax  hike. She said the council has a responsibility to find other ways to generate  revenue. Compton is in such poor financial health because city leaders in the  past mismanaged redevelopment, she said after the council vote on the tax.  </P> <P> "We have spent millions of dollars redeveloping parts of the city but not seen  any return on the money," Moore said. She cited as examples the transit center,  which has failed to attract significant numbers of tenants; a hotel, which is  not drawing enough business to generate revenue, and the auto plaza, which has  only one dealership left.  </P> <P> "So who has to now help the city stay solvent? The taxpayers," she said.  </P> <P> Moore also said she was upset that the council had passed the tax at a special  meeting designed to circumvent Proposition 136, which she said reflected  legitimate concerns of the taxpayers.  </P> <P> Moore is one of three council members seeking to replace Mayor Walter R.  Tucker, who died last month of cancer. A special mayoral election will be held  in April. Her two mayoral rivals on the council, Bernice Woods and Maxcy D.  Filer, voted for the tax hike.  </P> <P> "It's needed by the city and that's the only reason we enacted it," Filer said  after the utility tax vote.  </P> <P> He said he did not worry about a probable voter backlash against him and the  rest of the council because it voted on the utility tax the day before the  statewide vote on Proposition 136.  </P> <P> "I'm thinking of the total city," Filer said. "I studied the issue. I don't  look to the election to see how I'm going to vote."  </P> <P> In Lynwood, about 200 residents tried to squeeze into the tiny council chambers  Tuesday to protest the city's passage of a 10% utility tax last week. Los  Angeles County sheriff's deputies removed two people, and others demonstrated  outside the building.  </P> <P> More than 10 residents spoke to the council, urging officials to rescind the  tax. Council members scheduled a public hearing on the issue at 5:50 p.m.  Monday in Bateman Hall, a large auditorium in the city's civic center. Some  council members indicated they would be willing to reduce the tax percentage.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Lee Harris contributed to this story.  </P></p>

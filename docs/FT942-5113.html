			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / UK consumer borrowing slips but trend is firm Borrowing by British consumers fell back slightly in April but the figures were welcomed in the City where it has been feared spending was growing too quickly. However, the trend over three months remains strongly upwards suggesting the UK is on track for a healthy recovery. Net lending to consumers through finance houses, bank credit cards with the Visa and Mastercard system and non-mortgage building society loans fell to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 413m in April, down from Pounds 518m the previous month. The Central Statistical Office said yesterday the figures may have been distorted by the timing of the Easter holiday, which fell in both March and April, and stressed that three-monthly figures were a better guide to the trend. These showed that net lending reached record levels in the three months to April, running at Pounds 1.282bn. The level of new credit advanced to consumers in that period was also a record, at Pounds 15.105bn. The figures were welcomed by the Treasury, which suggested they provided hints that consumer borrowing had not yet been dented by April's tax rises. 'It is too early to say what the full impact of the tax increases will be. But clearly it is encouraging that the trend remains upwards - this is consistent with an upward trend in consumer spending,' a spokesman said. The figures also received a warm reception among City analysts, who noted that April's dip followed an exceptionally strong level of consumer credit in March. Analysts had predicted April's net lending figure could fall as low as Pounds 300m, after a survey by the Finance and Leasing Association earlier this week reported a small drop in consumer credit in April. Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist with investment bank SG Warburg, said: 'This is almost the perfect set of numbers for the government and markets. It shows that the recovery is continuing but not overheating - it would be difficult to argue for a base rate rise on these figures.' But with the economic figures still painting a slightly uneven picture of consumer behaviour, analysts warned it was too early to predict the full impact of the April tax rises. Although recent retail sales and narrow money supply figures have pointed to strong consumer activity, housing figures have suggested a slowdown in mortgage lending. Consumer confidence surveys have also pointed to relatively muted levels of confidence - a factor that may be feeding through to consumer borrowing figures. The main factor in the drop in April's net lending figure was a fall in borrowing from finance houses, the form of finance normally used to buy cars and large consumer goods, such as fridges. Car credit, which represents about half of total finance house lending, fell to Pounds 871m in April, its lowest level since October. This was partly offset by other data released yesterday, which showed car sales rebounded sharply in May, after weakening earlier in the year. Finance lending dips, Page 9 Lex, Page 20</p>

			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of Birmingham and the West Midlands (1): Manufacturers matter again - The region is moving smoothly out of recession  -and traditional industries are leading the way When delegates to the annual conference of the Confederation of British Industry approach the International Convention Centre in Birmingham this morning, they will see the evidence of a publicly-funded exercise in economic diversification. The centre, along with the National Exhibition Centre and the nearby National Indoor Arena, represent an attempt by civic leaders to demonstrate that there is more to Birmingham than its traditional position as the UK's industrial heartland. Yet it is the traditional industries - the engineering and automotive companies - that have led the West Midlands out of recession. Surveys from regional chambers of commerce have reported a steady rise in the proportion of manufacturing companies with fatter export order-books. Service companies, on the other hand, saw the growth in export orders flatten out in the middle of the year. For both manufacturing and services, the flow of domestic orders slowed in the second and third quarters. Apart from exceptions such as companies tied to the aerospace and construction sectors, there has been a rise in ouput. But there is scope for more. 'One of the concerns is whether the chancellor of the exchequer is trying to slow down growth because of capacity constraints, but nobody I've talked to has got capacity constraints,' said Mr David Probert, chairman of W. Canning, the chemicals company and president of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce. Notwithstanding such reservations, the region is moving out of recession with relative smoothness, and economic forecasters agree that, in the short and medium term at least, growth is likely to be at or near the national average. Oxford Economic Forecasting and Northern Ireland Economic Research Centre, for example, estimate that gross domestic product across the West Midlands will expand in 1995 by 3.4 per cent, compared with 3.5 per cent for the UK. The longer-term future is more difficult to predict, and the question of finding the economic balance between manufacturing and services remains. Manufacturing is the mainstay of regional wealth but not the source of jobs: indeed, Ereaco, the European research organisation, forecasts a 6.7 per cent fall in the region's manufacturing employment every year until 1997. Although output from the services sector in Birmingham, the regional centre, is forecast by the Birmingham Economic Information Centre to grow 4.1 per cent a year until 1997 and 3.9 per cent a year until the year 2005, job expansion over the same periods is predicted at 1.78 per cent and 1.38 per cent respectively. The services sector - through the development of, for example, the complex that houses the National Exhibition Centre, the International Convention Centre and the National Indoor Arena and its associated business tourism; the Merry Hill shopping centre; and back office facilities in Coventry - has created an impetus of its own since the early 1980s. Both financial and business services have expanded. But none of this has been sufficient to remove manufacturing from its pivotal position in the regional economy. What was deemed a weakness in the 1980s, when fashionable thinking downplayed manufacturing as a source of growth and looked to services as the basis of expansion in an advanced economy, is now deemed a strength. 'No advanced economy has survived without a manufacturing base,' said Mr David Ritchie, regional director for the Government office of the West Midlands. 'If this country is going to become competitive in any realistic sense in the future, it has to have a manufacturing base.' The UK government is so keen to advance manufacturing that it is planning a celebration of industrial achievement in the West Midlands next year. For manufacturing in Britain to prosper, Birmingham and the West Midlands must thrive. Figures from the 1991 census of production showed that, in terms of gross value added during the manufacturing process, Birmingham was by far the strongest centre in the UK. Coventry was third; Sandwell, in the Black Country, was fifth, Stoke-on-Trent 11th and Wolverhampton 14th. In any event, the futures of the manufacturing and services sectors in the region cannot be disentangled. A report for the CBI, from Coopers &amp; Lybrand, accountants, noted that 40 per cent of jobs for men and 16 per cent of jobs for women were directly dependent on manufacturing, with much of the service industry base directly dependent on supporting manufacturing activity. The difficulty is that the manufacturing sector, after the retrenchment set off by the 1980s recession and the rationalisation caused by the 1990s recession, is too small for comfort, suggested Mr David Botterill, chief executive of the Engineering Employers Federation West Midlands. 'What is there is infinitely healthier. It's much stronger, more alive and more internationally competitive. It's made considerable inroads into European markets,' he said. Sharp cost differentials have emerged between UK engineering companies and their continental European competitors. They have enhanced the ability of West Midlands engineering companies to supply components to, for example, German car manufacturers. 'To penetrate French and German markets it used to be virtually essential to have a plant there. Now they are prepared to buy from outside,' said Mr Probert. At the same time, the existence of the cost differentials has helped speed the flow of inward investment into the region, taking the sums committed back to pre-recession levels. 'The 45 investments from European companies represented the largest source of inward investment into the region,' reported the West Midlands Development Agency. In common with other regions, there has also been over the past year an increase in mergers, acquisitions and management buy-outs. Demand for capital to expand still lags behind 1980s levels, however, according to 3i, the venture capital group. Over the longer term, the region needs sustained investment, directed not only at the creation and expansion of companies and the introduction of new products, but also at the development of a better infrastructure. Disparate organisations are combining to seek UK and European funding, and to devise new partnerships between the public and private sectors, to work on a lengthy list of improvements, such as new roads in the Black Country and east Birmingham, a light rapid transport system to join Birmingham and Wolverhampton, and expansion of the airport. The second essential requirement is to raise the level of education and skills in the regional workforce. According to government analysis, the West Midlands has the poorest qualified labour force in Great Britain: in spring 1993 nearly three in 10 workers had no qualification. Because the lowest levels of attainment are in the cities, and frequently in the inner areas where there is a high proportion of ethnic minorities, the social implications are profound. There is already a growing proportion of people in the inner city areas who, because they lack skills, are permanently outside the jobs market. During the next decade, said Mr Bruce Epps, director of strategic management at Birmingham City Council, 'we have got to get around the fact that a lot of the jobs in the city are filled by people from outside.' It is a reminder that the gloss of the city centre, with the bustle of the International Convention Centre, is a world away from the tower blocks which look down on it.</p>

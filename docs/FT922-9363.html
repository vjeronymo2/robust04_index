			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Congress defies president over cuts in budget PRESIDENT George Bush and Congress are heading for stalemate over plans to cut unnecessary spending from the US budget for the current year. In March, Mr Bush sent Congress a bill to rescind Dollars 5.6bn of authorised funds, which he called 'wasteful spending.' Congress is now ready to send him a bill to cut even more, but is wielding the scalpel in places the president had not selected, creating the likelihood of a presidential veto. Mr Bush's list of cuts targeted agricultural research programmes in the home districts of influential Democratic senators and representatives. The Democrats hit back by picking on administration spending, such as the cost of a door-to-door chauffeur for the director of the Agency for International Development. Aside from this backbiting, the core of the debate has been over the future of the Seawolf submarine, a very expensive boat whose usefulness is felt by defence analysts to have died with the Soviet Union. Mr Bush wanted to end the Seawolf programme after the one submarine already under construction. The House of Representatives voted for two vessels. The Senate - influenced by its two members from Connecticut, where the Seawolf is built - wanted to build three. It preferred to trim funding for the B2 stealth bomber and the Strategic Defence Initiative, drawing Mr Bush's veto threat. It was disingenuous of Mr Bush to call the Seawolf, whatever its merits or demerits, an example of pork-barrel spending. Less than a year ago, his administration fought to preserve the Dollars 2bn submarine. Besides, the Seawolf's principal advocates, although motivated primarily by concern for Connecticut jobs, can make a reasonable case for preserving the US capacity to build nuclear submarines, even at the cost of building vessels that are not needed. Meanwhile, neither side has found the willpower to cut the big spending programmes which are swelling the US budget deficit: social security and medical insurance.</p>

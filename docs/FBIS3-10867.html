			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "U.S. Oversight Is Unacceptable"] </F>   [Text] Yesterday we informed our readers about another  hostile position adopted by the U.S. Congress which, hiding  behind AID, "expects to conduct a parallel and independent vote  count during the presidential elections in Mexico." In light of  this intention to oversee the elections, six parties represented  in the Chamber of Deputies have unanimously condemned this sham.  Legislators of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, the  National Action Party, the Party of the Democratic Revolution,  the Popular Socialist Party, the Cardenist Front for National  Reconstruction Party, and the Authentic Party of the Mexican  Revolution have not hesitated to point out that "it is one thing  to accept foreign observers -- because, whether or not we like  it, the eyes of the world will be upon Mexico -- but it is  another thing to accept meddling by another nation."    The legislators' opposition to this move is legitimate. It  is not possible to let the United States supervise our  government, especially now that our government has made much  progress in guaranteeing transparency in the elections. If the  dependability of our electoral registry is as good or better  than that of the U.S. electoral registry, if our election  materials possess features that make them practically  unforgeable, if steps have been taken to create a tribunal in  charge of investigating electoral crimes, and if the presence of  international observers is being permitted as long as these  observers do not belong to or sympathize with any of Mexico's  political parties, then any parallel vote-counting by another  nation is unacceptable. What will be decided and done by the  Mexicans can only be overseen by the Mexicans.    With this in mind, the position of U.S. AID and the U.S.  House of Representatives Budget Committee makes no sense. Here,  however, the situation that is emerging could be similar to that  created by Representative Torricelli, who, armed with the sword  of xenophobia, has launched himself against Mexico on many  occasions. This type of attitude cannot be tolerated from a  country that claims, at least in its public pronouncements, that  it is a friend of Mexico.    Only two options are valid in the face of the sham being  planned by AID and some members of the U.S. House of  Representatives. One would be that the U.S. Congress recant and  apologize to our Chamber of Deputies. The other is that the  government of Bill Clinton allow the Mexicans to oversee the  forthcoming U.S. elections in order that we may show the United  States how to hold absolutely clean elections.</p>

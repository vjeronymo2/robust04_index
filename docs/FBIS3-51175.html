Since the people's revolt in Santiago del Estero, this  is the first sign of alert made jointly in disagreement with  Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo.    The meeting was attended by the economy ministers of  Tucuman,  Raul Paulino Rios; Catamarca, Herman Colombo; and Jujuy, Daniel  Gomar; La Rioja Finance Secretary Pablo Manuel Aguilera; and  Salta Public Works Secretary Julio Guzman.    The meeting was not attended by the representative of  Santiago del Estero, where the revolt took place and whose  government has been intervened by the federal government.    After analyzing the social conflicts that are nearly  permanent in their respective provinces, the growing  unemployment in the public sector, and the recent demonstrations  staged by tobacco workers, the ministers drafted a critical  diagnosis of the consequences of the national economic policy.  At the meeting's end they released a short communique.    The most important paragraph of the joint declaration states  "the need to adapt the public sector's national reform policy to  the provinces' reality."</p>

			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Carmakers corner the wholesale sector: VW's plan to control UK importing Operating a national franchise for one of the world's leading carmakers can be a lucrative business, but the openings are closing fast. Volkswagen's determination to take eventual control of its UK VW/Audi importer/distributor operations from Lonrho is part of an established pattern, as car manufacturers seek to extend their influence over key parts of their wholesale operations. In the UK, Toyota and Nissan have recently taken expensive steps to acquire control of their importer/distributor operations from independent franchisees. Fiat has taken control of the Alfa Romeo and Lancia operations in the UK. Such moves are nothing new to Lonrho, either. SEAT, the Spanish subsidiary of Germany's Volkswagen group, took over its UK distributorship SEAT Concessionaires (UK) from Lonrho in early 1990. At the time SEAT said that it planned an immediate equity injection of Pounds 4m into the company and announced ambitious plans for expanding its presence in the UK with a doubling of marketing expenditure to Pounds 11m. This week Lonrho also said it will sell to MAN Nutzfahrzeuge, Germany's second largest truckmaker, the UK MAN distribution activities. Faced with increasingly fierce global competition most car producers have decided this sensitive part of their operations is too important to leave to independent operators in main markets. In the UK, apart from VW and Lonrho, there is only one exception, namely Volvo Concessionaires, a subsidiary of Lex Service, which holds the Volvo franchise in the UK and has built it into one of the most important markets worldwide for the Swedish carmaker. For Volkswagen, the priorities of its commercial strategy in large volume markets are clear. 'Towards the end of the 1980s we formulated the strategy that in the car producing countries of the world the manufacturer must also be in the wholesale business. That was and is our strategy,' said Mr Hans-Jorg Hungerland, sales director for the VW and Audi marques worldwide, in an interview late last year. 'You must be in control of the big markets. In Europe the leading five markets (Germany, Italy, France, the UK and Spain) account for 83 per cent of the total volume.' VW already controls its wholesale operations directly in Germany, France, Italy and Spain. The Italian importer/distributor, Autogerma, was fully acquired in mid-1985, while the Spanish operations were established under VW's direct control in the wake of its progressive takeover of SEAT, the Spanish carmaker, in the second half of the 1980s. Volkswagen, Europe's leading carmaker, has evolved different strategies for the big volume markets in Europe on the one hand, and the small and medium-sized markets on the other. In smaller markets, such as Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Austria, VW is happy to retain independent importers and distributors. 'We do not want to engage ourselves there in wholesale or retail operations,' said Mr Hungerland. But VW believes in a different strategy in the main car producing countries. 'The pressures in the big five countries will grow the fastest,' said Mr Hungerland. 'There is a different climate that leads to different pressures in terms of production and pricing.' Nowhere is this more true than in the UK, which is in the frontline of the Japanese assault in Europe. The first three Japanese car plants in Europe are all being developed in the UK, where the three leading Japanese carmakers Toyota, Nissan and Honda will have a combined assembly capacity for more than 600,000 cars a year by the mid-1990s. Both Toyota and Nissan have decided that with such big strategic investments in the UK - Pounds 840m by Toyota and Pounds 850m by Nissan in the engine and assembly plants alone - they must also control the wholesale operations. Most importantly this offers control of: overall sales and marketing strategy; the extent of financial incentives to be used in sales support; the relative emphasis on retail and fleet sales; selection, training and co-ordination of the dealer network; and advertising, image and market positioning. The means to the end can be very different, but the end remains the same. VW and Lonrho insisted yesterday that the details of their contract relationship were confidential. Toyota chose to take control amicably. In early 1990 the group reached agreement with Inchcape, the international motor distribution and motor retailing, services and marketing group, to eventually take a 51 per cent stake in Toyota (GB), its British distributor and an Inchcape subsidiary for Pounds 61m. It currently holds a 5 per cent stake in Toyota (GB) and this will rise to 51 per cent by 1998. At the same time it awarded Toyota (GB) an 18-year exclusive distribution contract for Toyota vehicles. Nissan was forced to take a different route to the same vital goal. Unable to negotiate a friendly takeover of Nissan UK, the privately-owned importer/distributor of Nissan vehicles in the UK controlled by Mr Octav Botnar, Nissan took drastic action at the end of 1990. It terminated the NUK contract with 12 months' notice, landed in a protracted legal battle and took on the onerous task of setting up an alternative dealer network within 12 months. Less publicly, but also under heavy strategic pressures, Fiat of Italy has set about taking direct control of its franchises in the UK. It bought out the Alfa Romeo franchise from TKM in January 1990 and took over the Lancia franchise from Heron Corporation in May 1989. It has appointed new senior executives and has announced plans to invest around Pounds 100m over the next three years in order to strengthen the ailing UK dealer networks. In the era of the single European market from 1993 direct control of key national wholesale operations is vital for the big carmakers, as they seek to rationalise operations across Europe. With the concentration of the industry the Volkswagen group now has four marques in Europe, VW, Audi, SEAT and Skoda. It will take time but Mr Hungerland is determined gradually to wring more synergies out of the wholesale operations of the four marques across Europe. At a retail dealer level Skoda and SEAT will be kept entirely separate from VW/Audi, but at the wholesale level he said he expected large savings to be possible through shared facilities - such as parts depots - and shared book-keeping. Such synergies demand a unified control.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LONRHO  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Year end Sep               1989        1990        1991                          (Pounds)    (Pounds)    (Pounds)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Turnover                  5.11bn      5.48bn      4.85bn Pre-tax profits            273m*        273m        207m  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Includes Pounds 38m sale of bulk whisky stocks  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- VAG (UK)*  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            1989        1990        1991                          (Pounds)    (Pounds)    (Pounds)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Turnover                  1.13bn      1.15bn      1.02bn Pre-tax profits           30.6m        22.6m       20.0m  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Includes related companies  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PARENT BUY-BACKS OF UK DISTRIBUTORSHIPS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Lancia (Fiat)          from Heron                      May 1989 Alfa-Romeo (Fiat)      from TKM                        Jan 1990 Toyota*                from Toyota (GB) - Inchcape     Jan 1990 Seat                   from Lonrho                     Feb 1990 Nissan                 from Nissan UK                  Jan 1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Toyota Jan 1990 - 5% to 1998 - 51%  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

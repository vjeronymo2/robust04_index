			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] African heads of state and government from 14  franc zone countries are meeting this afternoon in Libreville  six months after the devaluation of the CFA franc. The summit  will take stock of the situation after the devaluation and it  follows two previous mini summits of the West African Monetary  Union and the Central African Economic and Monetary Community  for Central Africa. Closed consultations focused on reports  drawn up by experts last week in Libreville and then completed  by the finance ministers of the franc zone. One of their  recommendations was the revamping of economic activities by  placing emphasis on the payment of internal debts. Then the  heads of state will review the way the devaluation of the CFA  franc was managed, Gabonese Prime Minister Casimir Oye-Mba, said  in Libreville this morning. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Slovak Defense Minister Pavol Kanis by Milan </F> Rusko; place and date not given: "I Do Not Feel I Have To  Compete With Soldiers"]    [Text] The minister of defense of the Slovak  Republic is not, as he used to be in the past, a professional  soldier. Pavol Kanis, historian and philosopher, combines in  the present post his civilian views on the defense of the state  with the reality of military practice and, together with the  experts in the department, seeks the way toward the goals that  stand above all narrow partisan or group interests. We asked  him for an interview on the subject of the first weeks of his  work in the present post.    [Rusko] Sir, although you have occupied the ministerial post  for only a month now, you have held talks already with several  partners who have occupied their posts much longer. How would  you assess these meetings?    [Kanis] That month--i.e., one-sixth of the government before  the next parliamentary elections--passed very quickly. I have  tried to fill the empty shelves I "inherited" as quickly as  possible. The understanding of the important problems and  integral ideas of their systemic solutions require much more  time. The things are better in the sphere of foreign-security  policy. It is possible to build on the long-term orientation  trend of the Slovak Republic toward the transatlantic and West  European security structures. Similarly, the efforts at a good  relationship with the neighboring states and armies continue  uninterrupted. My meetings with Hungarian Defense Minister Fur  and Polish Defense Minister Kolodejczyk were carried out in this  spirit. The talks with these two partners concerned the  problems of security in Central Europe, cooperation between the  defense sectors of the Visegrad Four countries, and the  implementation of individual stages of the Partnership for Peace  plan. They included very stimulating exchanges of views on  cooperation in the military sphere and specific possibilities  for cooperation in special production. I also consider the  visit to Israel and the meetings with Prime Minister and Defense  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Sim'on Peres a  success. They proved that there are no fundamental points of  contention between the Slovak Republic and Israel. The approach  of Slovak foreign policy to the Israeli-Arab relations is  balanced and conforms to the criterion of rational detachment  from the Middle Eastern disputes and conflicts. Concord and  cooperation between the Slovak and Israeli military experts and  manufacturers and exporters of special technology could be very  interesting.    [Rusko] You are a civilian. What do you feel when you  decide on issues that have always been dominated by soldiers?    [Kanis] It is true that I am the first civilian defense  minister in this country. It has its advantages and  disadvantages. The advantage is, above all, that I do not feel I  have to compete with professional soldiers and that I can deal  with the issues much more forcefully, regardless of the rank.  Our Army is a young army. It needs numerous concepts and  regulations that are a part of the legal basis for the operation  of the army in a democratic state. This provides a lot of room  for a defense minister, a civilian. I focus, above all, on the  foreign-security dimension of the defense sector and the  society-wide context of the mission and operation of the Army of  the Slovak Republic.    [Rusko] What is the orientation of the Defense Ministry in  the sphere of foreign contacts?    [Kanis] The Defense Ministry will base its plans in the  sphere of foreign relations and international cooperation on the  foreign political line of the Slovak Republic, the Defense  Doctrine of the Slovak Republic, which is to be submitted for  approval in the government and the National Council of the  Slovak Republic, and the Presentation Document, which is a  specific derivative of the framework Partnership for Peace  document. The security of the Slovak Republic is a component of  European and world security. Therefore, in our efforts to  guarantee our own security, we orient ourselves, above all,  toward the North Atlantic Alliance, the Western European Union,  the CSCE, and the United Nations. We consider stable,  conflict-free, and fair relations with our immediate neighbors,  with an emphasis on the development of multilateral cooperation,  an important aspect of our national security. Cooperation in  the military sphere with the countries of the Visegrad Four  Group is of particular importance.    [Rusko] What specific steps will the Defense Ministry take  in the implementation of the Partnership for Peace (PFP) plan?    [Kanis] The main purpose of the participation of the Slovak  Republic in the Partnership for Peace plan is in cooperation  with the NATO-member countries to gradually create the basic  conditions for obtaining full membership in the North Atlantic  Alliance. All of the consequential political entities in the  Slovak Republic in principle agree on this step. Nonetheless,  we are realists and are aware that the Partnership for Peace  plan is also a result of considerations for the geopolitical  interests of the Russian Federation in the Central European  domain. At this time, after the signing of the framework  Partnership for Peace plan by the individual states, we have  reached the stage of the drafting and adoption of the  Presentation Document, and this will be followed by the  formation of the individual program of specific cooperation of  each signatory with the North Atlantic Alliance. According to  the adopted government policy statement, we will submit the  Presentation Document to the National Council of the Slovak  Republic. The individual plan, which expresses our joint will  and specifies join actions, will be something like a bilateral  agreement between the Slovak Republic and NATO. The main  objective of military cooperation within the Partnership for  Peace plan is the achievement of the degree of compatibility of  the Army of the Slovak Republic particularly on the tactical and  operational levels needed for its problem-free international  cooperation.    [Rusko] One can hear about our obligations (PFP) and the  modernization of the Army. There are certainly some budget  limitations that must be overcome. Is it at all feasible?    [Kanis] We must apply two criteria in the defense sector,  particularly in the process of building the Army of the Slovak  Republic--economy and military strategical efficiency. In the  drafted Presentation Document, we reckon with designating 1  percent of the 1994 Defense Ministry budget--i.e., 104 million  Slovak korunas--to cooperation within the PFP. How much longer  can the needs of defense be reconciled with the limited budget  possibilities of the Slovak Defense Ministry? Not much longer.</p>

			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: SFE to appeal against ruling on new 'option' The Sydney Futures Exchange is to appeal against a recent Federal Court ruling which permitted the Australian Stock Exchange to trade 'low exercise price options' (LEPOs), a new type of derivative which the SFE claims is essentially a futures contract. The SFE's move is the latest development in a long-running battle between the two exchanges over who should be allowed to run the market for individual share futures. The SFE introduced futures contracts on individual shares in May, becoming the first exchange worldwide to do so. However, the ASX countered with LEPOs, very deep 'in the money' call options. The SFE then mounted a legal challenge, stating that these amounted to futures contracts, and hence could not be traded on the ASX. Under Australian corporations law, there is a strict divide between the exchanges' territories - with the ASX allowed to trade securities and the SFE, futures. Earlier this month, a Federal Court judge sided with the ASX. However, yesterday Mr Les Hosking, the SFE's chief executive, reasserted the exchange's belief that LEPOs 'are, in reality, futures contracts . . . they function as a futures contract, have the risk profile of a futures contract and should be regulated as a futures contract'.</p>

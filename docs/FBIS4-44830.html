			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Claudio Donat-Cattin: "Iritel, Bridge Over the </F> Mediterranean"]    [Text] Rome--The "telephone stew" is about to go into the  archives. The MEDIA DUEMILA readers, who have followed the  difficult battles that have taken place over the last few years  to attain a single telecommunications operator, know this well.  It has been a rocky path full of snares that the Tangentopoli  [Kickback scandal] events have enabled us to understand better.    Today we are on the verge of forming Telecom Italia. The  boards of directors of the five companies that are involved in  the merger approved the balance sheets at the end of March, and  the unification of the installations should be concluded on 30  September. It is an epoch-making event, and an indispensable  requisite for presenting oneself with the right cards at  Community meetings focusing on the complete liberalization of  the telephone services market.    MEDIA DUEMILA dedicated an entire edition (Issue 114,  published December 1993-January 1994) to a description of the  history, technology, and policy of the reorganization. This  complete documentation also made those outside the  telecommunications world understand that Italy is staking a  large part of its industrial future at this table.    In an atmosphere that is characterized by continual sudden  dramatic events, hasty marriages, and equally hasty divorces, it  is opportune to open a window on the youngest of the five  Italian operators. We are talking about Iritel, a company that  was set up on 1 January 1993 to inherit the functions of the  ASST [State Telephone Services Agency].    It was a weighty inheritance. The tangles of the  unsuccessful reorganization were mixed up with questionable real  estate policies that in some cases have come under the scrutiny  of the "Kickback" judges. An excessive number of personnel  (almost 13,000 employees), who had become unmotivated because of  the prospect of a future that was rich in uncertainties, must be  added to this. There were all the conditions for giving up, or  for moving toward reorganization into the most ordinary  administration. All this obviously reflected on the quality of  the service and consequently on us, the citizens who are its  clients. Let us not forget that the ASST network was (and is  with Iritel) the backbone of long distance traffic.    However it was not like that. In 15 months there has been "a  silent revolution" that has changed the appearance, habits, and  rhythms of a company that was closer to collapse than to  relaunching.    It is a story that deserves being told, in an Italy where  the  "little bosses" of the public sector seem to be the order of the  day, and where only bankruptcy and crime make the news. It is a  story about men, about a group of managers who are professionals  and have known how to interpret the desire for change without  fear. It is not flattery to say that when uncontested managers  look out over the deck, the outraged public is also able to get  away from the adverse daily routine.    This is how it has been for Iritel. To understand what has  changed it is sufficient to spend a few hours wandering around  the building in via Europa, in EUR [Rome], that houses the head  office of the central administration. One breathes a different  air, it is a place where bureaucracy has finished up in the  attic. The therapy has certainly not been painless. The company  has been drastically slimmed down. The number of employees has  been reduced to a little over 8,000 and the final goal is 6,500.  There was a close confrontation with the trade union, that was  also favored by the seniority of the personnel in service.  Training and requalification courses are being started to adapt  to the requirements of computerization and new technologies.    Moments of friction have not been lacking, but the final  results show that there was no other way to regain  competitiveness. The gamble was to invest in the quality of the  network and services, and at the same time align the tariffs  with those existing in the European market. A course that has  made Iritel the first case of "administrative privatization."    The inserts accompanying this article [not provided]  describe  the missions and goals of Iritel and constitute a plan leading  to its merger into a single administration.    It is more interesting to analyze certain strategic choices  that were made at the beginning of 1993, and that are becoming  concrete realities today.  <H5>  Winning New Markets </H5>   Iritel's submarine cable network is the most extensive in  the  Mediterranean, and it is a real bridge between Africa and  Europe, and between the countries of the East and the  Mediterranean basin. Agreements are being worked out with  various partners. One particular goal is to turn the  international network into one of the most important windows  through which the Russians and their economy can look out on the  western world. This is a strategic goal, even if today 80  percent of the traffic takes place between the countries of  western Europe.    A series of initiatives in the field of submarine cables are  to be remembered: The ITUR (Italy-Turkey-Ukraine-Russia) cable,  that is destined to connect Palermo to Moscow; the TLB  (Italy-Albania-Macedonia-Bulgaria-Turkey), that will join  Istanbul to Bari; the cable from Italy to Tunisia, and others.  In less than two years the 3,000 kilometers of submarine cables  (mainly analog) will be increased to over 7,000 kilometers of  cables that are almost exclusively digital.    The network of submarine cables in Italy will be extended by  a further 1,500 kilometers when the Civitavecchia-Olbia,  Palermo-Cagliari, and Savona-Sassari lines are laid.  <H5>  Investments </H5>   A total investment of 3.4 trillion lire is planned for  1993-1994. The primary goal is to continue with the  modernization and technological innovation processes to digitize  almost the entire network (90 percent by the end of the year).  <H5>  Special Services and Networks </H5>   International competition can only be faced by offering  special networks. In 1994, the goal will be the diffusion of  private international virtual networks. A service to the United  Kingdom has been offered since last October, and one with France  since December. Services with Holland, Switzerland, Belgium,  Spain, and Germany will be started during the first six months  of this year.    The "Global European Networking," which Iritel joined in  September 1992, has made a flexible network connecting the  principal European countries available to the Italian  communications system.    At the same time, in agreement with the SIP [Italian  State-Owned Telephone Company], a major effort is being made to  diffuse the ISDN [integrated services digital network] network  that is particularly useful for business users. This will  enable Italy to align itself with the diffusion trend of the  French, German, and British operators by 1996.  <H5>  The START Project </H5>   This is the feather in the cap of Iritel's investment plan.  A total of 715 billion lire will be invested over 1993-1994 to  extend the optical fiber network that is available to business  users. A total of 6,299 kilometers of optical fiber cable will  be laid for the ground network, to create about 206,000  kilometers, and 400 systems of 565 Mbit/s [second] will be  installed.    The submarine network (as we have already mentioned) will be  further upgraded by a total increase of 1,337 kilometers of  cable and 10,710 kilometers of optical fiber, with 18 line  systems at 565 Mbit/s.  <H5>  Tariffs </H5>   There have been two tariff reductions in the past year (the  first by 30 percent) and these have brought our tariffs into  line with those in Europe. Looking ahead this will particularly  favor the business user.  <H5>  The Moral Issue </H5>   The new administration, with its clear and transparent  rules,  has marked a turning point with respect to the management of the  ASST that was violently shaken by the Kickback cyclone. As  General Manager Tommasi stressed, they have turned a leaf "by  revolutionizing the regulations and procedures on bidding for  tenders in a European context, and by establishing a new  procurement office management, whose task will be to work in a  transparent way and to avoid overlapping and waste with the  other operators."  <H5>  A Model for the Future </H5>   Business culture and competitiveness have been the two key  words around which work has focused for only 15 months. These  are two decisive words for the future of the sole operator,  which Iritel certainly will not become a part of by entering  through the back door, and will introduce concrete results and a  group of managers who are able to meet the new challenges.    In an Italy that is suffering from patronage and  back-handers, it is important to discover that there are humane  professionals in critical fields if we want to remain among the  leading group of industrialized countries and avoid sliding into  the second division.</p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> EGYPT'S NUBIANS ARE A FORGOTTEN PEOPLE  </P> <P> Dislocated and disinherited, Egypt's Nubians have become a forgotten people.  </P> <P> Flooded out of their ancestral homes almost 30 years ago to make room for the  Aswan Dam, they now eke out a living in desert villages far away. Their houses  are set in long concrete rows along sandy streets, the harsh landscape unbroken  by greenery.  </P> <P> Many young men have left to work in Cairo and women in long black dresses and  scarfs, their faces prematurely aged, sit outside with their children in the  near-deserted streets.  </P> <P> They dream of their old villages next to the Nile where mud houses, palm trees  and green cultivated terraces ran down to the river. Their new villages, about  190 miles to the north, have kept only the names.  </P> <P> They dream of traditions handed down, some say since the beginning of time,  when, like the Egyptians, the Nubians created one of the earliest  civilizations. In Pharaonic times, the Nubians had their own kingdom that  stretched north into Egypt and south into Sudan.  </P> <P> Mohammed Bashir, a Nubian and director of the State Information Service in the  town of Aswan, believes they are the oldest people in the world.  </P> <P> To him, the history of mankind started along the Nile. He says Stone Age  remains found in Nubian villages and the simplicity of the Nubian language  proves that they are an ancient people.  </P> <P> Their descendants, whose complexions are a shade darker than those of other  Egyptians, still speak Nubian languages. They were peasant farmers little  affected by the 20th Century until the early 1960s, when the Aswan High Dam was  built.  </P> <P> A dream of former President Gamal Abdel Nasser, the dam was built to supply the  country with electricity and prevent annual floods along the Nile. A huge  reservoir, named Lake Nasser, was created behind it.  </P> <P> At the time, an international campaign was launched to rescue Nubia's Pharaonic  remains, including the Temple of Abu Simbel and the Temple of Philae, which  were moved above the flood waters. But the villages around the temples were  lost, and some 50,000 people were moved north to new desert homes.  </P> <P> "Gamal Abdel Nasser came to Abu Simbel and made a speech. And he asked the  Nubians what they wanted. They told him we would like to be near the Nile,"  recalled Abdel-Rahman Hassan Gabr, a wizened old man in white robes and a white  turban.  </P> <P> "They told us: 'We know how you live and you will go to a village which is like  where you live, only better,' " he added.  </P> <P> When they arrived, the Nubians found that their new homes were half-built,  without roofs and far from the river.  </P> <P> Many people died from snake and scorpion bites. Some returned to their old  villages to find only the tops of the palm trees above the water.  </P> <P> "It was a shock. It was a big shock," Gabr said.  </P> <P> "I didn't believe a place like this could exist, a village with no greenery,"  an old woman said.  </P> <P> Thirty years later, the Nubians, who number 100,000 in Egypt, have  painstakingly recreated a kind of life, painting their houses and setting up  seats outside for their traditional street life. They have resumed making their  own Nubian bread, after years of relying on government-subsidized bread.  </P> <P> Nowadays, some young men prefer to stay in the villages rather than join the  teeming millions in Cairo. They have begun to invest in animals and farming.  </P> <P> But they remain torn between the rival pulls of tradition and modern city life.  They do not know whether to teach their children Arabic or Nubian.  </P> <P> Many wonder if they should return to the shores of Lake Nasser to build new  villages there, as Nubians from other villages have done.  </P> <P> "The people who live here would like to go back to live near the Nile," said  Gabr.  </P> <P> "But we would have to leave this village, which is part of our lives too. They  are willing to go there, but here is also a part of us. This is my home also."  </P></p>

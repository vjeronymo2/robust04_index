			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] On the occasion of 19 Bahman [8 February] -- Air  Force Day -- thousands of Air Force commanders, officers, and  NCOs were received by His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, the  great leader of the Islamic revolution and the commander in  chief, at Imam Khomeyni prayer house this morning. [passage  omitted]    Referring to the arrogant powers' propaganda invasion of  Iran  His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i said: The enemies of the  revolution accuse the Islamic Republic of Iran of having  military tendencies and seeking banned weapons, while America  and her accomplices, including the usurper Zionist regime,  produce, sell, and use -- wherever they feel necessary -- the  most forbidden of weapons such as chemical and nuclear weapons.  They placed masses of chemical weapons at the Iraqi regime's  disposal during the imposed war, which were used right in front  of their noses, and they saw our wounded, too. But they still  continued selling banned weapons to Iraq.    The leader of the Islamic revolution said the arrogant  powers  have no right to talk about banned arms. He said: We will do  anything which conforms to our principles, and if we deem it  necessary we will manufacture or obtain weapons, as we did  during the imposed war. But we do not seek to obtain and use  banned weapons, because we respect our principles and faith.    His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i attributed the largest  volume of weapons' sale in the region and the world to countries  in line with the aims of arrogant powers. He said: We have no  fear of the false and biased propaganda of the enemy. Such  propaganda will not prevent us from continuing on our correct  path. We have no arms deals. Compared to the large purchases  of countries which act in line with America's goals our arms  purchases are infinitesimal, because we do not need them.  [passage omitted]</p>

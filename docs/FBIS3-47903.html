Greater  efficiency and benefit is derived from utilizing the seaport in  the Islamic Republic of Iran and by avoiding the maritime  transportation route in the continuously troubled Ukaranian  region.    In a statement to KOMPAS at the Sukarno-Hatta international  airport on Saturday 8 January, Hashim Jojohadikusumo, President  Director of PT Prima Comexindo Trading stated to KOMPAS that in  future Bandar Abbas will become an important transit port for  the shipment of Indonesian export commodities to the former  Soviet republics.    According to him, the company shipped six containers loaded  with consignments of Indonesian ready-made garments to Tashkent  in October 1993. The consignments were found to be intact.  Hashim said, "The consignments only proceeded to Tashkent after  our careful study regarding the shipment of six containers  through Bandar Abbas."    According to the report forwarded by his company  representative based in Bandar Abbas, the transhipment of the  consignment at the Iranian port was rapid, safe, and the storage  charges are very competitive. He said, "That is the reason we  decided to use the port as a transit point for the shipment of  our commodities to the former Soviet republics."    It took only 47 days for the six containers to arrive in  Tashkent. Hashim added that there are two benefits to be  derived from using the new trade route. First, the competitively  short period in shipping commodities to their destinations  compared with the trade routes in West Europe and some others  that were previously used by PT Prima Comexindo. Second, the  journey of the commodities through Bandar Abbas is much safer by  avoidng the continuously troubled Ukaranian region.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Independent view from Emily Lau Wai-hing," directly </F> elected independent legislative councillor for the New  Territories East constituency: "Courage Needed To Keep  Autonomy"]    [Text] For the first time in 150 years of British colonial  rule the legislature has a chance to vote on the Hong Kong  Government's electoral reform package: I hope members will have  the moral courage to do the right thing for Hong Kong.    In moving the first and second reading of my private  member's  bill -- the Electoral Provisions (Miscellaneous Amendment) (No  3) Bill 1994 -- on June 1, I sought to implement a pledge I made  when I stood for direct election in September 1991, that is, I  would fight for a fully directly-elected Legislative Council.    To the British Government, Hong Kong people's demand for  democracy was a bargaining chip in negotiations with China to  help Britain secure economic benefits, as was demonstrated in  the Daya Bay nuclear power plant and the new airport. Britain  probably would not go out of its way to harm Hong Kong's  interests, but when conflicts of interest arise, Hong Kong would  inevitably lose out.    In 1984, Beijing and London foisted the Sino-British Joint  Declaration on the Hong Kong people. It stipulated that the  Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) legislature would  be constituted by elections and the SAR would have a high degree  of autonomy.    My bill is fully in line with the Joint Declaration and  provides for an important element in safeguarding the high  degree of autonomy which was promised. It is also in accordance  with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance. I admit my bill  violates the Basic Law stipulation that only 20 of 60  Legislative Council [Legco] seats should be directly elected in  1997, but the Basic Law only comes into force in 1997 and my  bill is about elections in 1995. Furthermore, since Beijing has  vowed to dismantle the Council in 1997 no matter how it is  constituted, concern for the so-called political through train  is irrelevant. The Basic Law, like the Joint Declaration, was  imposed on the powerless Hong Kong people in 1990. Given a  choice, I believe many would support universal suffrage rather  than a hopelessly complicated hybrid system.    To coincide with the Joint Declaration, the British  administration published a White Paper in November 1984 stating  that Hong Kong would make "a gradual start by introducing a very  small number of directly-elected seats in 1988 and building up  to a significant number of directly-elected seats by 1997". In  November 1985, sensing Britain's intention, the Chinese accused  it of deviating from the Joint Declaration and demanded all  arrangements during the transition period must converge with the  Basic Law, a mini constitution for post-1997 Hong Kong which  would be promulgated by the Chinese National People's Congress  in 1990. Former British foreign minister, Timothy Renton,  visited Beijing in January 1986 and said the British Government  agreed developments in Hong Kong should "converge" with the  Basic Law. So Beijing had virtual veto power over important  decisions during the transition.    Faced with growing demand for direct elections, the Hong  Kong  Government rigged an opinion poll in 1987 to say there should  only be 10 directly-elected Legislative Council seats in 1991  since the people's views on direct elections in 1988 were  divided. This was roundly condemned, among others by members of  the UN Human Rights Committee, which held hearings on Hong Kong  in November 1988. Shaken by the Tiananmen massacre in 1989, the  British did some damage control by offering to increase the  number of directly- elected seats in 1991 to 18.    When Chris Patten was appointed Governor, he proposed  cautious constitutional reforms in October 1992, seeking to  widen the franchise within the Basic Law. I called it "a drop  of democracy". Even then, it was brutally attacked by the  Chinese Government. Such an antagonistic attitude showed  Beijing would not even tolerate a limited degree of democracy,  let alone give the SAR a high degree of autonomy.    Apart from being less than democratic, the Government's  package is complicated and contrived. The other amendments  members have proposed are even more complex and have not been  examined by the Council. It is farcical to think the Council  might pass a bill which has not been scrutinised!    Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd once said he did not want the  final chapter of the history of the British Empire to end in a  shabby way. If the Government insists on putting forward an  undemocratic and incomprehensible system, Mr Hurd's fears could  well come true.</p>

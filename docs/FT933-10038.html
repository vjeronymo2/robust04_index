It said that, with the timetable for a single currency 'inevitably delayed', the early introduction of a common currency was of paramount importance for the European economy. Mr Peter Morgan, IoD director-general, said the present method envisaged for creating monetary union was unrealistic and that the hard Ecu 'currently represents the best alternative route'.</p>

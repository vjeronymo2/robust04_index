Youth and Experience Argued in the Far East  About the Middle East"]    [Excerpts] The Vladivostok airport was the venue for  yesterday's meeting between Andrey Kozyrev and U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher. Their discussions had been expected  to center on the Balkans. But recent events introduced some  changes: The Kozyrev-Christopher meeting in the Far East was  preceded by their urgent trips to the Middle East, thus the  interlocutors paid considerable attention precisely to the  problem of getting the Arab- Israeli talks back on track.  According to an official version, the Vladivostok meeting is  supposed to "have plastered over the cracks" that have run  across the building of Russo-American relations. Despite the  upbeat tone of the joint statement, more cracks may develop  soon. [passage omitted]    The meeting in Vladivostok has revealed some differences --  this time around, those of the sides' approach to the Middle  East settlement. The Russian Foreign Ministry head arrived for  the meeting from the Middle East without calling at Smolenskaya  Square [ministry's headquarters in Moscow]. The upshot of his  talks with PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat in Tunisia on Friday was the  Palestinians' agreement in principle to return to the  negotiating table. The Arabs, for that matter, demanded for  themselves guarantees of security via an international presence  on the Israel-occupied territories. Having backed the PLO's  demands, Russia also thought that the talks could only be  resumed after the Arabs and Israel agree on the question of  guarantees. The United States spoke for an immediate resumption  of the talks. Remarkably, its actions in recent days were  emphatically independent from Moscow. On Sunday, Christopher  stated that U.S. efforts to get the Palestinian-Israeli talks  resumed were successful. He made this statement after, having  been overcome with curiosity to know what Kozyrev had been  talking about, he phoned Israeli Premier Rabin and 'Arafat on  Saturday night. Already yesterday, U.S. Middle East settlement  coordinator Dennis Ross arrived in Tunisia for urgent  consultations with the PLO. Literally hours after, it was  announced that an Israeli delegation was also leaving for  Tunisia to join in the consultations. That is to say, there is  an obvious rivalry in Middle East peacemaking between Moscow and  Washington. [passage omitted]    Incidentally, local observers did not pass over the fact  that  the heads of diplomatic agencies did not meet in the local  Negotiations House but at the airport -- and at the Americans'  request. The formal reason was a banal shortage of time.  According to rumors being whipped up in Vladivostok, however,  Christopher had decided to respond to the hurt caused to  ex-President Richard Nixon in Moscow.</p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: Losses continue at Mannesmann MANNESMANN closed the third quarter with a loss, the German industrial, engineering and telecommunication group said yesterday in the prospectus for its recently-announced one-for-eight rights issue. It did not give any details of the size of the loss, but blamed it on structural measures, the costs of building up its mobile phone network and poor business conditions in July and August. In August, the Dusseldorf-based company reported a plunge into losses of DM467m (Dollars 292.6m) in the first half of the year, down from a profit of DM15m in the first half of 1992. The group expects to make a substantial loss this year, but turnover for 1993 is likely to be at around the same level as last year, when group turnover was DM28bn. The group said the loss reflected the costs of a one-off restructuring within the group. In spite of the short-term impact on profits, the measures would lead to a large reduction in the group's break-even level and there will be a substantial improvement in the group's results next year even if the economy continues to weaken. Another positive factor next year is that Mannesmann Mobilfunk, the group's cellular telephone subsidiary, is poised to make a profit in 1994 after years of losses. Bremer Vulkan Verbund, the shipbuilding and engineering group, said its machine tool unit had taken over rival Droop und Rein for an undisclosed sum, Reuter reports from Bremen.</p>

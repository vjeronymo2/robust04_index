			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GATES PRESSED ON HANDLING OF ANTI-ABORTION PROTESTS  </P> <P> Two members of the City Council charged on Friday that the Los Angeles Police  Department is still too vague about its plans for handling massive  demonstrations scheduled for later this month at area family planning clinics  and they demanded a clearer statement from Chief Daryl F. Gates.  </P> <P> Councilmen Zev Yaroslavsky and Michael Woo said they are concerned about police  protection for area clinics that are being targeted by Operation Rescue, an  anti-abortion group that stages sit-ins to disrupt business at family planning  clinics.  </P> <P> Although thousands of Operation Rescue activists have been arrested nationwide,  none of an estimated 500 that shut down two Los Angeles-area clinics in  February was arrested.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Clear Up Confusion  </P> <P> The two councilmen demanded and received a face-to-face meeting with Gates on  Friday to clear up their confusion over the LAPD's policy. Earlier in the week,  the full council grilled Los Angeles police officials over their low-key  handling of February disturbances and several demanded that the department  toughen up its enforcement of Operation Rescue sit-ins.  </P> <P> But while the two came away from their meeting with the chief satisfied that he  would aggressively enforce trespassing and unlawful disturbance laws, they said  they were later surprised by a written statement from Gates that they said  lacked the same force and clarity of his verbal assurances.  </P> <P> "I thought I heard in our meeting that . . . when push comes to shove --  literally -- that the Police Department would step in and clear the path," Woo  said in an interview Friday. "I don't see that clearly stated" in Gates'  prepared written statement to the press that followed the private meeting.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Different 'Tone and Substance'  </P> <P> "He was very clear in the meeting," Yaroslavsky said. "The tone and substance  of this is different than what was said in the meeting. This statement does not  reflect the clarity of the statement he made to us."  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky said: "The statement he issued reflects part of what the chief said  in the meeting . . . (but) what it does not reflect is that if people are  blocking doorways they will be arrested."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Right to Express'  </P> <P> In his brief statement Gates said, in part, "In America, people have a First  Amendment right to express themselves by engaging in public demonstrations. The  Los Angeles Police Department not only recognizes that right, but will actively  protect people while they exercise it."  </P> <P> The statement continues, "The right to demonstrate, however, does not mean that  the rights of others may be abused." Gates went on to say that lawbreakers will  be "subjecting themselves to immediate arrest by the LAPD." The councilmen  objected to the world "subjecting," charging that it was not strong enough.  </P> <P> Among the areas of concern raised by Woo was the role of Deputy Chief Robert L.  Vernon, an outspoken opponent of abortion. As director of the LAPD's office of  operations, Vernon is the official in charge of dealing with the protests.  </P> <P> "I raised the issue during the meeting . . . because of these questions on  Chief Vernon's personal views," Woo said. "I thought it was important for the  department to make it clear it would protect the legal rights of women seeking  to use clinic services."  </P> <P> Woo said that Gates responded by saying that the question of Vernon's beliefs  "would come up inevitably, but that they want people to know it isn't going to  make any difference in how the department enforces the law."  </P> <P> Neither Vernon nor Gates could be reached.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Qualified Police Executive'  </P> <P> However, LAPD spokesman Cmdr. William Booth said that strong religious views  "do not disqualify you as a qualified police executive." Booth added: "Bob  wouldn't be where he is, doing what he does, if he didn't conduct himself in  accord with" city and department policy.  </P> <P> Booth added that the chief's statement was an attempt to discuss the difficult  issue of the demonstrations "in civilized language, not tyrannical language. It  seems clear to me . . . if LAPD can arrest you -- if you break the law -- we  will."  </P> <P> Still, Woo said there remains "some confusion and concern on what will happen .  . . and we will be working with police so that we are all prepared and are all  ready on March 22," when the next round of demonstrations are expected.  </P> <P> "Zev and I would like more said between now and March 22 to assure the public  on how the department will react," Woo added.  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky said: "I think we need a clarification. . . . I think it's  something we'll have to monitor and talk to the chief about again."  </P></p>

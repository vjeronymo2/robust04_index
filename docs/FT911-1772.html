			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Arts: Today's Television Though Friday is not the best night for the enthusiastic viewer, this evening's early movie on BBC2 is a good one: The Crimson Pirate (6.00). The word 'swashbuckling' might have been invented for it. Burt Lancaster employs all the skills mastered in his early career as a circus acrobat, and delivers lines such as 'I'll fly my flag into the mouths of their cannon and if you've crimson in your veins you'll follow me' with that clenched teeth grin that became his trademark. Then ITV begins a new sitcom called Second Thoughts (8.00) which may be good, you never know; it does have former Likely Lad James Bolam in it and also Lynda Bellingham. However, we are told 'Divorcees Bill and Faith are moving in together but her teenage children and his ex wife are not making it easy'. Perhaps that makes your heart skip. It makes mine sink. The Chief (9.00 ITV) sustains a fairly impressive standard of production, even if it is not the most subtle or surprising police series. The plot is now much concerned with 'community policing' and in today's story Stafford appeals to the residents of a rundown estate for help in catching those who have killed a police officer.</p>

			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Indonesian journalists lament brief life of Suharto's political openness: Continued protests at the recent banning of three publications About 100 Indonesian journalists demonstrated in Jakarta yesterday against the continued ban on three prominent publications, including the country's respected current affairs magazine, Tempo. The protest was one of a number of small but vociferous demonstrations that have taken place since the clampdown six weeks ago on freedom of expression. Letters to editors deploring the forced closure of Tempo, Editor, another magazine, and DeTik, a weekly tabloid, appear regularly in much of the Indonesian press. Complaints have even come from China and Japan, where Tempo, which was enjoyed for its innovative use of language, was an important tool in teaching Indonesian language. Tempo, Editor and DeTik had their publishing licences revoked after their critical reporting of the government's planned Dollars 1.1bn acquisition of a fleet of former East German warships. Although the government never said as much, it is generally accepted that the publications lost their licences because they exposed high-level political wrangling over the cost and efficiency of the warships. Although it had a circulation of only 200,000, the 23-year-old Tempo was widely respected as Indonesia's equivalent of Time magazine. It suffered a temporary ban in 1982 for its reporting on the controversies surrounding that year's election campaign. Tempo's latest ban came as a surprise because, comparatively speaking, it tended to toe the government line, although it had of late become more daring. The much younger tabloid DeTik had a subscription base of 400,000 and growing when it was banned. Much of its appeal lay in reporting that tested the limits of President's Suharto's promises of political openness. With the ministry of information continuing to issue threats of closure to other publications, Indonesians are now re-evaluating the future of their country's era of fledgling political openness. An atmosphere conducive to open political debate was initiated by President Suharto himself after he was re-elected to his sixth five-year term in office last year. In speeches after his re-election, he called for the 'democratisation' of the country. Magazines and newspapers immediately picked up on this by reporting on subjects such as human rights in East Timor, the president's succession and ethnic Chinese domination of the economy, all previously taboo. The most recent threats were received last week by the leading daily newspaper Kompas and Sinar Pagi, Sinar magazine, the English-language daily The Jakarta Post and Indonesia Business Weekly, a two-year-old English-language business magazine. They were ticked off for their frank reporting of the media bans and for articles on military violence against protesters in the East Timorese capital of Dili. While many Indonesians regard the bans as a sign that political openness has ended, others are less pessimistic. 'These kinds of threats and bans are a cyclical thing,' said an editor of one of the recently threatened publications. 'We seem to go forward one step and then two steps backward as far as political openness is concerned. For the time being we just have to lie low.' The crux of the problem appears to lie in President Suharto's vagueness about what the government would tolerate from the domestic media. While President Suharto may have encouraged political openness and a more 'open' society in his speeches last year, what he says these days is also peppered with subtle warnings that openness should be accompanied by a sense of responsibility. 'In an effort to open ourselves, we want our national press to enjoy freedom but at the same time shoulder responsibility,' Mr Suharto said at the opening ceremony of the Indonesian Newspaper Publishers Association held soon after the bans. Press freedom 'should be aimed at improving the quality of life for Indonesians, both individually and collectively', he said. As long as guidelines are cloaked in such vague terminology, press bans and a self-imposed restraint on political and social debate can be expected to be a regular feature of Indonesian life. 'If this continues we don't know what kind of a press we will have to match the demands of society,' said Eros Jarot, editor of DeTik. 'Indonesia's economic policies are very liberal but anything to do with politics appears to be going in the opposite direction.'</p>

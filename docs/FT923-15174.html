			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / International Company News: Von Pierer named as Siemens' new chief THE APPOINTMENT of Mr Heinrich von Pierer, the former junior tennis champion of Bavaria, as the next chief executive of Siemens was confirmed yesterday by the supervisory board of the German electrical and electronics group. Mr von Pierer, 51, who has a law and economic education, was named as deputy chief executive a year ago to Mr Karlheinz Kaske, the 64-year-old head of Siemens who steps down from the top job on October 1. It was understood that Mr von Pierer would become the next chief executive, and the supervisory board decision has made this official. Since Mr Kaske became chief executive at the start of 1981, the Munich-based group's turnover has risen from DM32bn to DM80bn (Dollars 52bn). Under his leadership, Siemens has sought to break out of its bureaucratic mould - it employs 402,000 people - penetrate the US market more effectively, develop its position in telecommunications and computers, invest in east Germany, and move into the developing markets of eastern Europe. Among its most recent challenges was the acquisition of Nixdorf, the ailing computer company which is causing Siemens more problems than it anticipated. Siemens will give details of its group performance in the first eight months of its end-September financial year in Dresden on Monday. It has already reported an 8 per cent gain in net profits for the first half to DM859m (Dollars 521m). Mr von Pierer's main experience before joining the board of Siemens was as a director and then head of its KWU power station operation. He helped ensure that orders were dominated by conventional rather than nuclear power station business at a time when the latter was becoming increasingly controversial. He also convinced the Prague government and the management of Skoda Pilsen, the Czech engineering company, that Siemens was the best partner among the several concerns vying for the joint venture in power generation signed last year. This involved frequent trips to Czechoslovakia to cultivate politicians and offset fears that Siemens intended to drop the Skoda name and use Pilsen as a cheap production site. Associates of Mr von Pierer, who helped finance his studies by working as a local sports reporter near Nuremberg, say he has an open, easy going style and makes his views and criticisms known clearly. He still plays tennis and is senior champion of northern Bavaria, though his time on the court is likely to be curtailed by his new responsibilities.</p>

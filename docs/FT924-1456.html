			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Orders rise slightly as jobless total hits 2.91m BRITISH manufacturers yesterday reported a slight improvement in orders over the past month, but a bigger than expected increase in unemployment in November brought little hope of a speedy recovery from recession. The monthly trends inquiry from the Confederation of British Industry, the employers' group, found that manufacturers' order books were at their best levels for five months, although well below normal. Export order books had also improved, suggesting that the pound's decline since September's Black Wednesday might be prompting higher export demand. However, 26 per cent of the 1,383 companies polled by the CBI between November 26 and December 11 expected output to decline over the next four months compared with 19 per cent expecting a rise and 55 per cent expecting output to stay unchanged. Although the companies' output expectations were less gloomy than in November, the survey was the sixth monthly poll in a row in which more manufacturers forecast output decreases than increases. The CBI report covered companies accounting for about half of UK manufactured exports and employment. It did nothing to ease fears that unemployment would continue to rise after increasing by a seasonally adjusted 41,100 to 2.91m, or 10.3 per cent of the UK workforce, between October and November. The increase in the number of benefit claimants seeking jobs was more than the 35,000 expected by City analysts and higher than the average monthly increase over the past six months. The Unemployment Unit, an independent group campaigning for full employment, forecast that the official jobless total would reach 3m by February and peak at 3.2m by the early summer of 1994. After making allowances for the many official changes in the definition of unemployment made during the 1980s, the Unemployment Unit estimated that underlying unemployment in Britain was 4.06m last month. The latest government figures indicated that the unemployment data have not captured the full extent of job losses over the past year. While seasonally adjusted unemployment increased by 391,000 in the 12 months to November, Department of Employment figures showed that the UK workforce in employment fell by 861,000 over the four quarters to the end of September. Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, said there was a clear need for government action on unemployment. But the Treasury said the November figures related to activity levels before the government's Autumn Statement. It said that since Black Wednesday the government had eased monetary policy and acted to restore confidence and encourage recovery. South-east jobless rate above 10%, Page 7</p>

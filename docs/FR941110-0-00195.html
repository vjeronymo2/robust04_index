			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While we understand the concern expressed by the commenters that surveyors conduct prompt revisits to confirm substantial compliance, the fact remains that when a SNF or NF participates in the Medicare and/or Medicaid program, that facility agrees to maintain substantial compliance with the participation requirements. When a civil money penalty or any other remedy is imposed upon a SNF or NF, it is because it has not maintained substantial compliance with these requirements, and we want to motivate corrective action. While HCFA and the States will try to revisit the facility in as timely a fashion as possible, when a revisit is necessary to verify substantial compliance, neither HCFA nor the States will be constrained by a specified timeframe in which to conduct these revisits. Nor will HCFA or the States suspend a penalty until a revisit can be conducted. The revisit would not be necessary if the SNF or NF had met its commitment to remain in substantial compliance with the participation requirements. Therefore, it is the provider's poor performance that has generated the need for a revisit. Moreover, timeframes for revisits can vary from State to State and within a State due to geographical variations and available personnel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hence, in those cases in which an on-site revisit is determined necessary to verify that the SNF or NF has come back into substantial compliance with participation requirements, civil money penalties may accrue from as early as the date the facility was first out of compliance, as determined by HCFA or the State, until the date of the revisit which finds substantial compliance. Or, the civil money penalty may accrue from as early as the date the facility was first out of compliance, as determined by HCFA or the State, until the date substantial compliance was achieved as documented by written credible evidence submitted to, and accepted by, HCFA or the State before an on-site revisit, but which, in certain situations, must be confirmed by an on-site revisit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sometimes an on-site revisit is not necessary to establish that a facility has come back into substantial compliance; in those cases, the civil money penalty may accrue from as early as the date the facility was first out of compliance, as determined by HCFA or the State, until the date for which there is written credible evidence of substantial compliance which is acceptable to HCFA or the State without the on-site visit. In these cases, there is no reason to ``assure'' the timeframe of a revisit as stated by a commenter. In response to the concerns and questions of the commenters, we are revising &sect;488.438(h) to provide for the policies expressed above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters asked what documentation will be acceptable to HCFA or the State as credible evidence as stated in proposed &sect;488.230(i)(7) (redesignated as &sect;488.440(h)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to appropriately respond to each unique situation of noncompliance, HCFA or the State will evaluate written credible evidence on a case by case basis. HCFA and the State have the discretion to determine what constitutes written credible evidence. For example, a survey may determine that a facility's furnace is broken constituting a deficiency for violating a Physical Environment requirement by its failure to maintain all essential mechanical, electrical and patient care equipment in safe operating condition (&sect;488.70(c)(2)). In such a case, the facility may buy a new furnace, have it installed, and submit the receipt to the State or HCFA as written credible evidence of substantial compliance. If this written credible evidence is accepted by HCFA or the State, the accrual of the civil money penalty would stop as of the date substantial compliance was achieved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sometimes substantial compliance can be achieved before an on-site revisit and the retroactive substantial compliance date can be verified with an on-site revisit. For example, during a closed record review (which is an examination of the records of discharged, transferred or deceased residents), it may be determined that a facility was not recording the reason for transfer or discharge in the residents' clinical records. This would be a violation of a requirement under Admission, Transfer and Discharge Rights set forth at 42 CFR 483.12. Since it would be inappropriate to send residents' records in the mail as evidence of correction, a revisit would be necessary. During the revisit on May 30, 1994, documentation confirms that the facility came into compliance with this requirement on May 10, 1994, 20 days before the revisit. Since the revisit confirms compliance with this requirement as having occurred on May 10, 1994, the accrual of the civil money penalty for the facility could be from as early as the date the facility was first out of compliance as determined by HCFA or the State until the date for which the revisit established that substantial compliance was achieved, which would be May 10, 1994 in this example.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are other cases in which documentation cannot confirm the correction of noncompliance, and in these cases an on-site revisit is necessary. For example, one of the requirements for Infection Control is that personnel must handle, store, process and transport linens so as to prevent the spread of infection as specified in &sect;483.65. If a deficiency is cited for a violation of this requirement and a civil money penalty is imposed, submitting written documentation would not confirm the correction of the violation. An on-site revisit to observe personnel behavior is necessary in this case to confirm that the facility is, in fact, back in substantial compliance with this regulatory provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

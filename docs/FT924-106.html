			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Supermarkets begin fierce price-cut battle J SAINSBURY, the UK's biggest supermarket chain, prompted an aggressive round of price-cutting by grocery retailers yesterday as it pledged to reduce prices on 750 lines from Sunday, including savings of 50 per cent on some items. Competitors Tesco and Safeway quickly unveiled details of their own January promotions, raising the prospect of a full-scale price war, but most industry analysts dismissed this possibility. 'It's not the start of a price war, but it is a significant step up in the level of promotional skirmishing,' said Mr Nick Bubb, retailing analyst at Morgan Stanley. In the stock market, food retailers' shares were heavily marked down. Analysts said the price-cutting had been seen as an excuse for shareholders to take profits in the sector. They added that Sainsbury's move was a carefully planned campaign to bolster its market position. The supermarket group said its sales over Christmas were ahead of budget. Its campaign was likely to put most pressure on Tesco, on smaller chains such as Gateway and Co-op, and on some independent retailers. Tesco and Safeway said their promotions had been planned some time ago, and dismissed Sainsbury's announcement as a marketing gimmick, a repeat of last year's January promotion which they claimed had promised much but delivered little. 'It's very surprising that Sainsbury should repeat the same exercise as last year, when the reality was far different from customers' perceptions, and it had no impact on our business,' Tesco said. Mr Robin Whitbread, marketing director at Sainsbury, countered that the promotion involved reductions on 750 items, compared with 500 last year. It would also include substantial reductions of 25 per cent or more on about 100 items, compared with fewer than 30 last year, and would cover a wider range of goods. The campaign, moreover, was not limited to January but would continue for an unspecified period, with discounted items being rotated regularly. Tesco said it would launch its January promotion on Monday, involving more than 1,000 lines. This would include at least a third off more than 100 items, with many at half price. Safeway said it already had 1,000 special offers and would launch a new year promotion on Monday including 50 per cent savings on some basic items.

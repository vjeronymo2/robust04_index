			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO VETO -- 'JUNK FAX' GETS THE AX  </P> <P> A high-tech lobbying campaign backfired Tuesday as Gov. William A. O'Neill  signed legislation to restrict the use of fax machines to send unsolicited  messages.  </P> <P> Fax owners used their machines last week to flood the governor's office with  letters urging him to veto the bill, but O'Neill said the protest instead  convinced him to sign the measure.  </P> <P> The protest left O'Neill's office unable to use its machine to get information  from the state Office of Emergency Management about rising river levels and  possible flooding around the state.  </P> <P> "I had been following discussion about the legislation but frankly last week  was the first time the need for this kind of legislation was brought home to  me," O'Neill said in a statement.  </P> <P> The new law, which takes effect on Oct. 1, will allow anyone who receives an  unsolicited advertisement on a fax machine to sue for up to $200 or actual  damages, whichever is greater. It also allows a person who receives the  unsolicited material to seek a court order banning future transmissions.  </P></p>

			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Mr Major's Euro-wishes MR JOHN MAJOR'S instant reaction to the result of last weekend's torrid negotiations over the future of monetary co-operation in Europe already seems a little premature. Describing the outcome as a vindication of his decision to suspend sterling's membership last September, the British prime minister suggested that the effective collapse of the hard version of the exchange rate mechanism should accelerate economic recovery in Europe. He hinted that it could strengthen the case for further cuts in British interest rates and added that the Maastricht timetable for European monetary union was now 'totally unrealistic'. But first impressions can be misleading. A week later, none of Mr Major's assertions appears particularly secure. On his first point - the vindication of Black Wednesday - Mr Major's case remains weak. The UK was forced out of the ERM last September because the currency markets knew that the British economy's structural weaknesses made staying in the ERM at a parity of DM2.95 untenable. By contrast, France, Belgium and Denmark, all credibly low inflation countries, were forced last weekend to widen the ERM bands because they could no longer sensibly live with the high levels of real interest rates that Germany's structural difficulties were transmitting across Europe. Mr Major's half-hearted justification of events last September helps explain why his first prediction - the expected falls in European interest rates - has not yet materialised. Indeed, the French government has resisted the opportunity to reduce its short-term money market interest rates even from the double digit rates to which they were pushed to defend the currency. Going for growth One reason for this apparent obstinacy is an unwillingness on the part of the French establishment to admit that the franc fort policy of shadowing the D-Mark is no longer the route either to low inflation or economic stability. Another is that French prime minister Edouard Balladur does not want to appear to have been forced into the same position as Mr Major: a national leader who, having failed to defend an ERM parity, was forced to make the best of a bad lot by cutting interest rates and declaring that he was now 'going for growth'. But Mr Major's first prediction will probably prove correct in the end. It makes no sense for countries with inflation rates half that of Germany, and suffering deepening recessions, to maintain short-term real interest rates which remain twice as high as Germany's. French, Belgian and Danish interest rates may well not fall as far or as fast as Britain's. But economic logic does suggest that they must fall sooner rather than later. British exporters should be preparing for modest European growth. Last week's events do not suggest, however, that lower European rates will necessarily be accompanied by lower British interest rates. If sterling and the D-Mark had soared against Europe's depreciating currencies, then the need to cap such an appreciation by cutting British rates would have been compelling. But far from plunging dramatically, the French franc closed yesterday a mere 1.7 per cent lower against the D-Mark than last week's close. The franc might well even rise against the D-Mark when the French government finally cuts rates. Persistent deficits In any case, a cut in British interest rates looks desirable on domestic economic grounds. The Confederation of British Industry's latest monthly survey appeared to confirm that the recovery now under way is weak and patchy. The absence of inflationary pressures and persistent trade and fiscal deficits both argue for a looser monetary policy balanced by further fiscal tightening. Regardless of what happens in Europe a further cut in UK interest rates looks to be an essential element in Mr Major's strategy to revive the government's dismal performance in the opinion polls. Yet despite Mr Major's scepticism about the Maastricht timetable, the events of the past week do not necessarily mean that his European difficulties are behind him. France and Germany, far from rushing to distance themselves from monetary union, have been at pains to suggest that stage two of monetary union - the establishment of the European Monetary Institute followed by the fixing of ERM parities in narrow bands - will go ahead as planned at the beginning of next year. This may well prove to be bravado. It will depend, as always, on the willingness of the Bundesbank to bring German interest rates down fast enough to make a rapid return to narrow bands politically and economically sustainable. But the traumas of the last months do suggest that northern Europe will have to choose between carrying on indefinitely with the current dirty floating and moving more rapidly to some form of monetary union. Former chancellor Norman Lamont and other Euro-sceptics believe that Emu is dead. Mr Major will hope they are right. What matters is whether France and Germany agree.</p>

			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE'S REVERSAL OF MASSIP CONVICTION WILL BE APPEALED  </P> <P> Charging that a judge had abused his authority, Orange County prosecutors  decided Tuesday to appeal his decision to throw out a murder verdict against a  woman who claimed that she was suffering from a severe form of the "baby blues"  when she killed her 6-week-old son.  </P> <P> On Dec. 23, Superior Court Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald stunned a Santa Ana  courtroom by overriding a second-degree murder verdict against Sheryl Lynn  Massip of Anaheim. In acquitting Massip on grounds of insanity, Fitzgerald  found that the 24-year-old former hairdresser was suffering from postpartum  psychosis when she killed her colicky infant by running over him with the  family car.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Precedent Setter?  </P> <P> Legal observers said that the judge's decision to disregard the jury's verdict  and find Massip insane in such a case appeared to be without precedent.  Prosecutors charged Tuesday that the ruling was illegal and could send a  troubling signal of expanded judicial power.  </P> <P> "If we allow judges to replace a jury's verdict with their own opinions, the  jury becomes nothing more than an advisory board," Deputy Dist. Atty. Tom  Borris maintained in an interview.  </P> <P> Borris, who prosecuted Massip, met Tuesday with fellow Deputy Dist. Attys.  Michael Jacobs and Thomas Goethals, who oversee all appellate work in the  Orange County district attorney's office, to discuss how to proceed in the  case.  </P> <P> As expected, the prosecutors decided to move ahead with an appeal -- "an easy  decision," Borris said. But they also mapped out specific points of attack in  the case, and Jacobs, who will handle the appeal, plans to file papers today or  Thursday with the 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Believed She Was 'Bonkers'  </P> <P> In an interview shortly after his ruling, Judge Fitzgerald said he felt  justified in his decision because the evidence in Massip's 2-month trial  clearly showed that she was "bonkers." According to the evidence, Massip first  tried to throw her child into oncoming traffic, then hit him over the head with  a tool and finally ran over him with the family car on April 29, 1987.  </P> <P> Postpartum psychosis -- a more severe and rarer form of the common "baby blues"  -- is thought to prompt severe anxiety, delusions and even violence in about  one to three of every 1,000 new mothers.  </P> <P> Massip, the first woman in Southern California to test the postpartum psychosis  defense at trial, said Tuesday: "I figured they would go for an appeal, but I  just don't understand where the D.A.'s office is coming from, why they would  take this case to this extreme and just keep beating it and beating it and  beating it."  </P> <P> Of the appeal itself, Massip said, "Whenever your life is on the line, you have  to be worried, but I'm just trusting in the judge's decision."  </P> <P> Her attorney, Milton C. Grimes of Santa Ana, said that although an appeal had  been rumored since Fitzgerald's decision, he was still somewhat surprised to  hear of the prosecutors' decision.  </P> <P> "I kind of thought that they would look at the big picture. I was just hoping  that they would consider everything and look at what Sheryl's gone through and  realize that this whole thing should be over," Grimes said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Jury Independence Issue  </P> <P> He discounted suggestions by prosecutors that the independence of juries is at  stake in the appeal.  </P> <P> "We have to trust in our judges. Just because Fitzgerald (reversed the  conviction) doesn't mean that we should all get up in arms because judges are  now going to arbitrarily do away with the jury system. That's a false fear  that's being created," Grimes said. "The courts aren't going to turn to anarchy  because of this case."  </P> <P> Grimes added: "This appeal is really too bad for Sheryl. I know she and her  family really wanted this wrapped up. This will be torture."  </P> <P> But Borris said, "This now goes beyond Sheryl Massip's particular case; I'm  concerned with the precedent that this whole things sets."  </P> <P> The main thrust of the appeal will be that, while Fitzgerald could legitimately  have granted Massip a new trial if he found fault with the jury's verdict, he  "abused his discretion" by overturning it altogether, Borris said.  </P> <P> "He's denied the prosecutor a jury trial," Borris said. "He doesn't have the  authority to do what he did. He can't just willy-nilly reverse things."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Alleged Abuse of Power  </P> <P> Borris said he believes that Fitzgerald's reversal of the jury's finding that  Massip was sane at the time of the killing offers prosecutors their strongest  point for an appeal. But the appeal will also maintain that Fitzgerald abused  his power by reducing her conviction before he found her not guilty by reason  of insanity.  </P> <P> In his decision last month, Fitzgerald first reduced the jury's verdict of  second-degree murder -- for which Massip could have faced 25 years to life in  state prison -- to the lesser offense of voluntary manslaughter. He then  vacated that conviction altogether by finding Massip not guilty by reason of  insanity, meaning that Massip now faces only the prospect of court-ordered  psychiatric care.  </P></p>

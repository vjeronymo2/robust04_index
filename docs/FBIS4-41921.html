			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpts" of statement by presidential candidate </F> Alyaksandr Lukashenka during a news conference on 27 June; place  not given -- recorded, in Russian]    [Text] [Words indistinct] you are participating in a small  historical event. You should congratulate me for a small  victory -- the Commission for Fighting Corruption is now able to  come out from the underground and work openly. We came out  today. I should say that the commission was joined today by a  very large group of people's deputies who will officially  cooperate with this commission.    We have big apprehensions as to whether the second round of  presidential elections will be held at all. We expected  Vyachaslaw Kebich to withdraw his candidacy; by the way, some  journalists were already reporting this at 1500. We are  actually afraid of this happening. That would be the first step  toward a disruption of the second round, because later it will  be easy to control people going to the polling stations. They  will simply be forbidden, by leaders and other officials, to go  to the polling stations. If you go to your polling station  despite all the obstacles, it will mean that you are going to  vote for Lukashenka. That is, it will be a very personal-style  nationwide vote in the second round. However, this has not  happened.    We also receive information from all those circles, which  have started to scatter; they run [words indistinct] to our  team, as well. They report that [words indistinct] Kebich will  withdraw his candidacy. We thought that this would happen  today, yet it did not. This is one of the main topics discussed  by Kebich's team. I think that these people scarcely have any  chance of winning in the second round. A disruption of the  second round would lead to the Hryb scenario. According to the  Constitution, if the presidential elections are declared  invalid, [Supreme Soviet Chairman] Hryb will come to power.  Well, it is surely better and more convenient [word indistinct]  than that Lukashenka.    I had a very lengthy conversation with the head of the  Central Electoral Commission about the next round of elections.  This round may be held on 7 [July], but the Central Electoral  Commission fears that the technical side of the preparations  will be disrupted and that appropriate measures will be taken to  disrupt the elections [words indistinct]. For example, a lack  of ballots at the polling stations in due time may disrupt the  second round. This means that the election may be declared  invalid. Abramovich [head of the Central Electoral Commission]  will be the person to blame, but, still, the elections could be  declared invalid.</p>

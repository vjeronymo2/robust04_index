			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / People: Scapa group appoints successor to Kent Harry Tuley, chairman of mini-conglomerate Scapa, is becoming non-executive chairman of Staveley Industries. He replaces Brian Kent, who is retiring next month at the age of 61, after 16 years on the board of the measuring and mechanical engineering company. Kent had combined the roles of chairman and group managing director between 1987 and the autumn of 1992, when Roy Hitchens came in, from BOC, as chief executive. Hitchens says that Kent is stepping down because his other interests are taking up a lot of time. He becomes president of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in May. Staveley employed headhunters to find Tuley, a Scapa veteran of 25 years standing. 'The chemistry between the two of us is very good,' reckons Hitchens, who, as an accountant, says he likes 'the counterpoint' of Tuley being a trained engineer. 'It is not his company, but where he has operated - in America and continental Europe - that is of interest to me' says Hitchens.</p>

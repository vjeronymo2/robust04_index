			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Taking a shine to metals RTZ announces full-year results this week against the cheerful background of rising base metals prices. Copper, the company's most important metal, has risen by 15 per cent from the depths plumbed last autumn. That pattern has been repeated in aluminium, nickel and tin. The strength of the rally is surprising given the discouraging fundamentals. Most metals markets face huge overhangs of stock, which could increase again this year. Forecasting the supply-demand balance in most metals is unusually tricky at present. Imponderables such as the growth of Chinese copper consumption and the level of aluminium exports from the Commonwealth of Independent States cloud an already murky picture. Even on the most optimistic assumptions, though, stock overhangs are likely to remain a feature well into next year. On that basis, the turn in metals prices has come unusually early in the economic cycle. Speculative buying may provide an explanation. Low interest rates have always increased the attractions of metals for fund managers by reducing the carrying costs. With copper still 30 per cent below the peak reached in 1989, for example, the metal is clearly cheap. But rising trading volumes on the London Metals Exchange have made base metals more liquid investments in recent years. Improved clearing arrangements have added to the attractions. If a substantial proportion of stocks are now held by fund managers, metals markets may be tighter than hitherto assumed. Were such investment to prove more than a passing fad, rising metals prices may no longer be the late-cycle phenomenon of old.</p>

			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / World Bond Markets: London The gilt market will start the week in a nervous mood, with many fearing base rates will be increased today or tomorrow. The Bank of England's acceptance of Treasury bills at discounts of up to 5.75 per cent on Friday was seen by some as a sign that base rates, currently 5.25 per cent, were set to rise. However, the Bank also lent money on Friday at existing rates, traditionally a signal that base rates will be unchanged. The result was widespread confusion in the market. The Bank, which is now in charge of interest rate timing, could take the opportunity of Tuesday's inflation report publication to make its move. In the absence of a rate change, the markets will have a few economic statistics to assess. Today sees the publication of data on M0, the narrow money indicator which has been worrying Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England. Analysts think Mr George will get some good news, with the annual rate falling to 6.3 per cent in July, from 6.9 per cent in June. Industrial production and manufacturing output figures, due Friday, will provide further evidence of the strength of the economy. Very strong numbers will heighten fears in the gilt market of inflationary pressures, as did last week's Confederation of British Industry survey and the Purchasing Managers Index.</p>

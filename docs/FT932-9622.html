			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / City police revise guidance on bombs BUSINESSES IN the City must prepare for the constant threat of bombings such as those at St Mary Axe a year ago and Bishopsgate last month, City of London police told security and building managers at a meeting on contingency planning last night. Chief Inspector Peter Moore said that the scale of the attacks had changed the rules for dealing with bombs. Police no longer recommend evacuating a building in any alert. With acres of glass poised to fall the street was not necessarily the safest place. Internal evacuation to a building's core or basement should be considered. Businesses should liaise over their plans, added Mr Moore. One security manager said such an exercise in his part of London showed every company planned to assemble staff in Embankment Gardens - 30,000 people in one small park. The police also suggested setting up second locations for all businesses, fitting shatter-proof film to glass and storing security video tapes. The possibility of a pager system to alert all City companies to a threat simultaneously was being considered, he said.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Big rise seen in European gas market THE EUROPEAN gas market is likely to enjoy a period of sustained growth over the next 20 years, according to a report soon to be released by Wood MacKenzie, the Edinburgh-based energy analyst. But while it sees annual demand growth averaging 3.1 per cent for the present decade, it warns of a significant supply gap developing from the mid-1990s. WoodMac forecasts that European gas demand will rise to about 485bn cubic metres a year in the year 2000 from 353bn cu m in 1992, fuelled by strong demand for natural gas in the power generation sector. The proportion of gas in use in the power generation sector is expected to rise from about 16 per cent in 1992 to 34 per cent by 2010. The analyst says that Germany, Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands and France will continue to dominate overall European gas demand until 2000, but their combined share of total demand is forecast to slip to 64 per cent in 2010 from 70 per cent in 1992 as new markets like Spain and Sweden emerge. However, WoodMac warns of a 'significant supply gap' from the mid-1990s, which will hit 96bn cu m a year by the year 2000 and widen to 360bn cu m by 2010. 'Whilst part of this gap in the longer term can be closed by the extension of existing supply contracts, significant new volumes of gas are required,' it says. 'Although we consider that significant, additional indigenous production above currently contracted levels is possible from the North Sea, the remaining gap in supply during the late-1990s is a major concern.' Norway, which supplied Europe with 9 per cent of its overall demand in 1992, has considerable potential to increase gas supply but the substantial extra investments required to upgrade gas deliverability must be justified by an adequate return on investment. 'In this regard, the current Troll price negotiations could be crucial given the status of the Troll contract as a benchmark for future gas supplies,' Woodmac says. Norway's remaining recoverable gas reserves are estimated at 2,800bn cu m, of which some 56 per cent remains to be contracted. The pipeline capacity of Norway's transmission system to the continent will reach 46bn cu m a year in the mid-1990s with potential for expansion to 67bn cu m.</p>

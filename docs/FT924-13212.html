			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / International Company News: Philip Morris shares fall on lower US tobacco sales SHARES in Philip Morris, which earlier this week won control of Scandinavia's Freia Marabou in a Dollars 1.5bn bid, fell yesterday after the tobacco and food company reported a small decline in domestic cigarette shipments in the third quarter, and predicted a much larger fall in the final three months. By lunchtime, the shares were down Dollars 4 1/4 at Dollars 79 3/4 . Overall, the company - one of the nation's most reliable profit generators - posted a 16.4 per cent rise in net income, at Dollars 1.29bn, for the third quarter. The advance, which came on a 9 per cent sales increase, translated into a 20 per cent rise in earnings per share, to Dollars 1.44. Philip Morris said it still expected to post a 20 per cent increase in full-year earnings per share. But the third quarter threw up a significantly smaller, 10.5 per cent increase in operating profits, at Dollars 2.81bn. This reflected strong advances from the international tobacco and food divisions, single-digit profits growth in the domestic tobacco and food operations, and declining profits at the Miller Brewing Company subsidiary, the nation's second-largest beer manufacturer. In the big domestic tobacco business - which accounts for almost half of operating profits - the company saw cigarette shipments fall by 0.5 per cent to 53bn units, although sales, in value terms, were up by 5.4 per cent at Dollars 2.97bn, and operating profits 8.5 per cent higher at Dollars 1.3bn. Morris warned that the trend would continue. Results from the brewing business were also disappointing, with operating profits falling from Dollars 94m to Dollars 55m on sales of Dollars 1.04bn (down from Dollars 1.13bn). By contrast, the international tobacco business pushed up operating profits from Dollars 497m to Dollars 589m, and the international food side saw a rise from Dollars 209m to Dollars 277m. The results leave Philip Morris posting after-tax profits of Dollars 3.74bn (up from Dollars 2.24bn) on sales of Dollars 44.2bn (up from Dollars 42.8bn) for the first nine months.</p>

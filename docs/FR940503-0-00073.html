			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Implementation of Preferences for Elderly Families  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An owner who elects to provide preferences for elderly families in accordance with section 651, and who can compile and, on request, produce the required documentation to support a determination that the project was designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families (seniors), may, in selecting tenants for units in the project that become available for occupancy after the effective date of this regulation, give preference to elderly families who have applied for occupancy in the housing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An owner of a covered section 8 project is not required to solicit or obtain the approval of HUD before exercising the election of preference for elderly families provided by subtitle D. The owner, if challenged on the issue of the ``coverage'' of the project, must be able to support the project's coverage, and the owner's eligibility to make the election of preference through the production of the supporting evidence discussed earlier in this preamble. (The owner may be challenged by, among others, existing tenants, applicants for tenancy or HUD on this issue.) Additionally, the Department reserves the right at any time to review and make determinations regarding the accuracy of the determination of the project as an eligible project. The Department can make such determinations as a result of its ongoing monitoring of activities, or the conduct of complaint investigations and compliance reviews required under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601&hyph;19), section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and other applicable statutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When establishing the preference for elderly families, an owner also must reserve units for occupancy by disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly, as explained below. In no case, may an owner evict, without good cause, a family that is lawfully residing in a unit in a covered section 8 housing project to achieve the occupancy level that has been determined under the system of preferences or the reservation of units set forth in this interim rule. (Good cause would not exist where the eviction stemmed from the system of preferences or the reservation of units, or because of any action taken by the Secretary or owner pursuant to subtitle D.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Reservation of Units for Disabled Families Who Are Neither Elderly Nor Near-Elderly: Section 652  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If an owner elects to provide preferences for elderly families for admission to a project or a portion of a project that is determined to be ``covered section 8 housing project'' in accordance with section 651, then section 652 requires the owner also to reserve covered section 8 units in the project for occupancy by disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly. The number of units to be reserved for disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly is based on a calculation prescribed in section 652(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 652(b), an owner who elects to provide preferences for elderly families must determine the percentage of covered section 8 units occupied by disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly on October 28, 1992, which is the date of enactment of the 1992 HCD Act (the October 28, 1992 percentage). The next step is for the owner to compare the October 28, 1992 percentage to the percentage of covered section 8 units occupied by disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly on January 1, 1992 (the January 1, 1992 percentage), in order to determine the highest occupancy percentage of disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly in 1992. The owner must reserve the highest occupancy percentage (either the October 28, 1992 percentage or the January 1, 1992 percentage), up to a maximum of 10 percent of the covered section 8 units, for disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the statute and these regulations, an owner may, but is never obligated to, admit disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly to more than 10 percent of the covered section 8 units. The actual percentage required is the highest percentage in occupancy on the two ``snapshot'' dates in 1992 (again October 28, 1992 or January 1, 1992), unless that number exceeds 10 percent, in which case the requirement is set at 10 percent. Thus, under the statutory formula and this interim rule, if a project did not have any disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly residing in the covered section 8 units on both January 1, 1992 and October 28, 1992, the owner would not be required to reserve any covered section 8 units for such families. The Department believes that few, if any, projects will fall into this category.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the percentage of covered section 8 units required to be reserved may vary between 10 percent and zero, the Department reiterates that the required percentage is not a ceiling, and owners are encouraged to reserve (or permit admission to) a higher percentage of covered section 8 units for disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly where the need exists. Owners who choose to reserve (or permit admission to) a greater percentage of covered section 8 units than the percentage which is statutorily required for disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly would not incur any obligation to continue maintaining the higher percentage (than statutorily required by subtitle D) as vacancies arise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

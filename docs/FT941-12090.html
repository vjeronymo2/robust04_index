			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Canadians buy part of Rutland drinks arm Rutland Trust, the financial and business services group, yesterday sold part of Ben Shaw's, the Yorkshire soft drinks manufacturer, to Cott Corporation of Canada, the rapidly expanding North American soft drinks company. Last week Cott entered the European market through a five-year agreement with Cadbury Schweppes under which Cadbury bottling plants will produce drinks for a newly-formed Cott subsidiary in Europe. Cott is the leading producer of the private-label colas which are making big inroads into the US market. It has grown rapidly by supplying North American supermarket chains such as Wal-Mart with own-label colas. Profits at the nine-month stage to end-October last year were more than doubled to CDollars 26.2m (Pounds 13.2m) on turnover that also more than doubled to CDollars 502m. Mr Gerald Pencer, chief executive of Cott, said that the acquisition marked Cott's move into the UK market and was part of its wider strategy of developing into Europe. The Canadian company is initially paying Pounds 6m for 51 per cent of Ben Shaw's Pontefract canning line operation, which had a turnover of Pounds 40m in the 11 months to the end of December last year. Last August, Rutland paid Pounds 5.7m for 84 per cent of Ben Shaw's, a family-owned firm that ran into trouble through over ambitious expansion. Mr Michael Langdon, chairman of Rutland, said Cott had the option to buy a further 31.5 per cent of the Pontefract operation in 12 months time for a minimum of a further Pounds 5m and a maximum of Pounds 7.5m, depending on 1994 earnings. Rutland would retain 17.5 per cent. Mr Langdon, who is also chairman of Ben Shaw's and will be joining the board of Cott in the UK, said the company had rationalised its canning operations and aggressively pursued sales to the big UK supermarkets.</p>

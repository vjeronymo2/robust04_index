			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Venture Capital (9): Only a small slice of the UK investment cake - Technology-Based Companies ONLY a tiny fraction of the Pounds 1bn a year invested by the venture capital industry goes to start technology-based companies - and that fraction has fallen further during the current recession. According to the British Venture Capital Association, the total investment in start-up and other early stage companies fell by 55 per cent from Pounds 128m in 1990 to Pounds 55m last year. The BVCA figures do not break down the start-up investment figures into different industrial sectors, but the analysis of the overall Pounds 1bn investment tells a depressing story. Medical and biotechnology investments have fallen by more than half from Pounds 49m invested in 51 companies in 1990 to Pounds 23m in 43 companies in 1991. As the BVCA annual report notes, 'a high proportion of investments in this category tend to be start-up and early stage.' UK venture capital investment in most other technology based sectors fell last year too, though not as steeply as biotechnology. The exception was electronics, where venture capitalists put Pounds 36m into 80 companies in 1991 - up from Pounds 25m and 61 companies the year before. In the computer-related sector (mainly software and services) venture capital investment fell from Pounds 74m in 1989 to Pounds 67m in 1990 and Pounds 65m in 1991. The communications sector has shown a particularly steep decline: from Pounds 29m in 1989 to Pounds 17m in 1990 and just Pounds 6m in 1991. Altogether, UK venture capitalists put a total of Pounds 130m into 250 technology-related businesses last year - accounting for about 21 per cent of companies financed and 13 per cent of the total amount invested by the industry. In the US, in contrast, more than half of venture capital is invested in technology. Such statistics provide ample ammunition for critics who accuse venture capitalists in the UK of failing to nurture nascent high-tech entrepreneurs in the same way as their US counterparts. 'There is evidence that good technology-based projects are failing to secure the necessary investment because of a lack of entrepreneurism on the part of the UK financial industry,' says Mr John Allen, chief executive of Newtech Science Park in Clwyd, north Wales, and author of Starting a Technology Business, an excellent new book published this month.* 'There's no venture at the moment in venture capital.' As Mr Allen points out, there are few hard statistics to illustrate the size of the problem, 'since firms that are repeatedly spurned by venture capitalists either give up, increase their bank loans to unwise proportions or limp along, never achieving their true potential for themselves or the national economy.' But he quotes a survey of 284 technology-based companies which showed that only 3 per cent of start-ups and 8 per cent of growing businesses were financed by venture capital. To illustrate the problem, Mr Allen gives the example of a 'soundly based and growing firm in the medical and health care field' which he was helping to acquire about Pounds 500,000 growth phase finance. 'I contacted a venture capital company whose stated interests were in health care and technology and whose preferred level of investment ran 'from Pounds 0.5m to Pounds 2m for all stages of company growth.' 'I was told that they in fact rarely invested less than Pounds 0.75m, and only in businesses that were already profitable, with an established market. 'Technology was currently 'out.'' Mr Allen adds that the company eventually found the Pounds 500,000 it needed  -from an international pharmaceutical group, based overseas. The preference of the venture capital industry for large individual financings and its reluctance to make investments in the Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 300,000 range - the main requirement for new technology businesses in the UK - is perhaps the most frequent complaint by high-tech entrepreneurs. There are countless stories of science-based companies being told that they have a good business plan but the amount of money they are seeking is too small for the venture capitalist to bother about. This attitude is understandable in a way, because the cost to a fund, in terms of management and time, of assessing potential investments is largely independent of the amount of money required. Indeed the management needs of a small new company may be even greater. However, Mr Allen points out that venture fund managers can reduce the cost of assessing small-scale proposals if they do not look at every project that comes their way. Instead, they should build up more long-term relationships with people running enterprise agencies, science parks and business innovation centres, whom they could trust to act as filters, passing on only the more promising projects. 'This filtration would not, of course, abrogate the venture capital company's observance of due diligence on behalf of its shareholders, but it would reduce the number of total non-starters submitted in the first place,' he says. The venture capital industry has responded to a limited extent to the need for small-scale finance, by establishing a range of 'seedcorn funds' designed to get high-tech businesses started. But the demand far exceeds the funds available. At the same time, science parks are establishing specialised local funds for their own high-tech entrepreneurs. One of the pioneers was Aston Science Park's Birmingham Technology (Venture Capital) Ltd. Mr Harry Nichols, its chief executive, has an attitude quite different to the 'short-termism' that is associated, rightly or wrongly, with many British venture capitalists. 'We expect to take seven years on average before we get realisations; allowing for lead times and some failures, this may mean 12 or 13 years before the fund is fully mature and it becomes reasonable to evaluate performance - a very long time by most standards. However, this is a 10 to 15-year development business, as experience in the US has shown,' he says. Some universities also have specialised funds to help exploit research by their academics. Indeed, Cambridge has two: Cambridge Research and Innovation Limited (CRIL) and the Cambridge Quantum Fund. A different sort of gap in the way Britain finances high-tech companies is identified in another new book, Company and Campus Partnership by Ms Jane Bower of Heriot-Watt University Business School.** In the US, she says, the main providers of start-up finance are not the well-publicised venture capitalists but small informal groups of local investors - 'this is the category which is conspicuously lacking in the UK, and this may hold the real key to future success.' *Starting a Technology Business, by John Allen, Pitman, Pounds 27.50. **Company and Campus Partnership by Jane Bower, Routledge, Pounds 35.</p>

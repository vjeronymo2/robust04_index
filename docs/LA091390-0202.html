			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE REAL THING IN BRAND POWER IS COKE, GLOBAL SURVEY SHOWS;  </P> <P> MARKETING: CONSUMERS RATED PRODUCT SYMBOLS ON FAMILIARITY AND ESTEEM. THE  RANKINGS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE FIRMS CAN TOUT THEM IN ADS.  </P> <P> Coke is it. But Pepsi isn't -- the world's most powerful brand, that is.  </P> <P> At least, that's the conclusion of a survey of 9,000 consumers from America,  Europe and Japan by Landor Associates, a San Francisco corporate identity firm.  Sony ranked No. 2, and Mercedes-Benz rated third.  </P> <P> Pepsi placed 10th. And -- no surprise here -- among consumers in the Western  United States, Disney rated No. 1.  </P> <P> So, who cares? Plenty of marketing executives do. Rivals such as Coke and Pepsi  can use surveys such as this to try to win new business -- anything from orders  from a tiny grocer in southern France to those from a major fast-food chain.  </P> <P> Marketing executives say brand awareness is among the most vital of all sales  tools. What's more, as brands such as Pepsi and McDonald's (which ranked eighth  worldwide) try to gain greater acceptance throughout the world, the brands that  people use give them something in common.  </P> <P> "A person in Los Angeles is similar to a person in Tokyo because of the brands  they use," said Carlton Curtis, vice president of communications at Coca-Cola  Co. "The two people might not speak the same language, but they may both drink  Coke and use Sony Walkmans while listening to the same Madonna tape."  </P> <P> The "Image Power" survey evaluated 6,000 brands. Each consumer was asked to  make two ratings on each of 800 brands -- a rating on the basis of familiarity  with the brand and a rating on the basis of regard for the brand. The  combination of the two ratings helped determine the most "powerful" brands.  Those participating in the survey included 5,000 consumers from America, 3,000  from Europe and 1,000 from Japan.  </P> <P> For those who think that patriotism is dead, bear in mind that American-made  brands were consistently ranked tops by the American consumers surveyed. In  fact, the Top 20 brands picked by Americans are all made by American firms.  </P> <P> "The warm, fuzzy, non-glitzy brands seem to be playing best in America," said  Don Casey, president and chief executive of Landor. The company came up with  the name for Disney's Touchstone Pictures several years ago, and most recently  created the graphic identity for General Motors' new Saturn division.  </P> <P> Corporate image experts generally agree, however, that most successful brands  can no longer focus on making it big in just one country. "There are still very  few global brands," said Alan Siegel, chairman of Siegel &amp; Gale Inc., a New  York-based corporate identity firm. "But as the world closes in, we are seeing  the emergence of the need for the true global brand."  </P> <P> Why did Coca-Cola rate better globally than Pepsi? "I'd say Coke has understood  the essence of its product and communicated that image worldwide," said Casey.  "Pepsi has taken a number of different marketing approaches -- and that rarely  works."  </P> <P> Of course, Coca-Cola also happens to be a longtime Landor client. Coke also  ranked No. 1 in a similar -- but less ambitious -- survey the company did in  1988. Landor executives strongly deny that the company's working relationship  with Coke tainted the survey results. They point out that only two of the  companies in the Top 10 are clients.  </P> <P> Pepsi is hardly pleased with the results. "We don't take anything lightly when  it comes to consumer preferences," said Leigh Curtain, manager of public  relations at Pepsi-Cola Co. "You have to look at the methodology used in this  survey -- which is a mystery to us."  </P> <P> Several companies that suffered bad press the past year also did poorly in the  survey. Of the 2,000 firms in the survey, American consumers ranked Exxon 444th  in familiarity and 1,446th in esteem. Similarly, Perrier, which suffered a  contamination scare earlier this year, ranked a lowly 1,396th in esteem. Both  companies declined to comment.  </P> <P> In Europe, where Exxon is sold under the Esso brand name, the company ranked  20th in familiarity and 42nd in esteem. "Esso is not branded with almost having  destroyed the coast of the state of Alaska," said a Landor executive who asked  not to be named. "Exxon is."  </P> <P> WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL BRAND NAMES  </P> <P> 1. Coca-Cola  </P> <P> 2. Sony  </P> <P> 3. Mercedes-Benz  </P> <P> 4. Kodak  </P> <P> 5. Disney  </P> <P> 6. Nestle  </P> <P> 7.

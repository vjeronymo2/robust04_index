			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report THE GOLD price fell to the lowest level for several weeks yesterday as the bullion market came under pressure from European selling, particularly German and UK. But support held at just above Dollars 341 a troy ounce. Some traders suggested that gold might trade down to Dollars 340 an ounce without uncovering stop-loss selling orders. London Metal Exchange base metals prices mostly held steady during the afternoon. ZINC traded quietly in a narrow range for most of the day, but short covering was triggered when some buying pushed the three months price above Dollars 1,130 a tonne. The three months COPPER price continued to fluctuate either side of Dollars 2,250 a tonne with trade buying still supporting the market on dips but little follow-through evident. TIN and NICKEL prices sustained early falls following news of British Steel's production cut, but traders said this was a 'knee-jerk' reaction, and that the news would not make much long-term impact on the markets unless there was a round of substabtial European production cuts.

Ramiro Gurdian, Cosep [Council of Higher Enterprise]  president, made the statements at the end of a meeting during  which Economy and Development Ministry officials explained to  representatives of the private sector the production program for  this year, which should actually correspond to the available  resources and human capability.    The economy minister reiterated: "We are trying to create  appropriate financial and production programs. We are also  reviewing the possibilities to obtain resources so as not to  create expectations when resources are limited."    During the year, the government plans are aimed at promoting  areas the private sector identifies as potential production  areas, such as shrimp hatching and fisheries, as well as  products of nontraditional crops.    Pereira explained that the financial resources will come  from  the very payments made by debtors to the financial system,  savings deposited in banks, and foreign resources obtained from  the Central American Integration Bank (BCIE), the Inter-American  Development Bank (IDB), and other external sources.    Meanwhile, the Cosep president said the organization  prepared, together with Economy and Development Ministry  authorities, an agenda that will be reviewed weekly to discuss  what he called "bottlenecks" that may appear in the production  area.    "The reality is that we must all work this year without  thinking about goals; if the growth expected by the government  is achieved, then welcome it," he added.    Gurdian stated that Cosep has asked the government about the  need to revise the value of the cordoba, energy and diesel  costs, and production costs in general.    Meanwhile, Industries Chamber President Alberto Chamorro  highlighted the determination with which the government is  tackling the microaspects of the economy, such as production.    Chamorro predicted a boom in the fishing and food and  beverages sectors.</p>

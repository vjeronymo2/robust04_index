Vice Governor  Wen Shizhen presided over the meeting. Gu Jinchi, secretary of  the provincial party committee, made an important speech,  entitled "Emancipate the Mind, Strengthen Leadership, and Strive  To Effect Sustained, Rapid, and Sound Development in Liaoning's  Economy."    Gu Jinchi pointed out: At present, the province is  confronted with the following opportunities at least in  accelerating reform and development. First, although the  commencement of the series of state reform measures in finance  and tax, banking, investment, and foreign trade will inevitably  bring us some difficulties and clashes, these measures, when  viewed from the point of view of overall interest, will be  favorable to the province's development, and, in particular,  will bring us an extremely good opportunity to invigorate large  and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, to renovate old  industrial bases, to readjust the structures of industries and  products, and to develop foreign economic relations and trade.  Second, at present the investment made in China by foreign  firms, in particular by some large foreign enterprises and  financial groups that enjoy high popularity and have solid  strength, is gradually moving northwards, the state strategy for  developing the Bohai Economic Circle area has been carried out  further, and the economic exchanges and cooperation among  various countries in Northeast Asia have become closer and  closer. All these have provided the province with an extremely  favorable opportunity to further expand the scale of opening up  and to energetically develop an export-oriented economy. Third,  although the new economic growing points defined by the province  have witnessed relatively good progress over the past few years,  there is still tremendous potential. And, these new growth  points may enter the market rapidly, thus constituting an  extremely good opportunity to develop the province freely.  Fourth, the market network that has already been shaped  throughout the province's urban and rural areas, and, in  particular, the market of means of subsistence, which ranks  among the country's best in business volume and popularity, have  provided extensive and very convenient market conditions for the  province's textile, light industry, and foodstuff trades, which  are in dire straits.    Gu Jinchi said: It is not our purpose to understand  opportunity. What is important is to seize the opportunity to  develop ourselves. This is the only way for us to gain even  greater initiative amid the waves of the new round of reform and  opening up. This year, we should emphatically achieve marked  results in the following three aspects: 1) Enterprise reform,  the reform of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises in  particular; 2) rural reform; and 3) the building of market  system. We should correctly handle the relations between reform  and development, between speed and efficiency, between key  projects and non-key projects, and between economic work and  political work and should strengthen and improve leadership over  economic work in order to provide a powerful and effective  political guarantee for accelerating the province's economic  development.    Gu Jinchi stressed: To effect a rapid progress in Liaoning's  economy, we should pay attention to the following issues:  First, we should firmly embrace the idea that development is  the only essential criterion. Second, we should firmly embrace  the new ideas and new concepts that are suitable for the  socialist market economy and should be brave in and good at  obtaining and creating even more favorable conditions for  economic development. Third, we should firmly embrace hardwork  and the pioneering spirit of making unremitting efforts to  improve ourselves and should combine the spirit of being daring  to try and go ahead with the scientific spirit of seeking truth  and doing concrete work. Fourth, all professions and trades  should consciously submit and orient themselves to the central  task of economic construction and give rise to a joint force to  grasp economic construction in order to promote the rapid  development of the province's economy.    Attending the meeting were leaders of the provincial party  committee and the provincial government, including Yue Qifeng,  Wang Huaiyuan, Zhang Guoguang, Shang Wen, Li Guozhong, Yu Junbo,  Xu Wencai, Xiao Zuofu, Cong Zhenglong, and Gao Guozhu.</p>

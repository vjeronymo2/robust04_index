			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / World Bond Markets: New York The US bond market, buoyed on Friday by helpful employment figures for December, will be looking for good inflation statistics this week to bolster its positive new tone. The market rallied strongly on Friday on the release of figures that showed payrolls rising by 183,000 in December. This was well short of the figures that Wall Street had been expecting. The statistics suggested that the US economy grew at a moderate pace in the month, ameliorating fears that November's fast growth would be sustained, in turn leading to a higher rate of inflation and early action by the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. The 30-year-issue ended the week with a yield of 6.22 per cent - the lowest it has been since December 23, and down from 6.41 on Monday, which marked a 4 1/2 -month high. Analysts expect this positive backdrop to be reinforced by very small increases in the inflation indices for December. The producer price index, which is due on Wednesday, is expected to show no rise in the price of finished goods. The consumer index, which is due on Thursday, is forecast to show a 0.2 per cent increase, or 0.3 per cent in the core index, which ignores volatile food and energy prices.</p>

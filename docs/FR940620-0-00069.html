This PROGRAM satisfies the Federal mandate of the Clean Air Act (Act) to ensure that small businesses have access to the technical assistance and regulatory information necessary to comply with the Act. Since this Program does not impose any new regulatory burdens on small businesses, and because the EPA views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments, the EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rationale for this approval follows. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  This final rule will become effective on August 19, 1994 unless notice is received by July 20, 1994 that adverse critical comments will be submitted.

Background of Revision <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Implementation of the provisions of the Clean Air Act (Act), as amended in 1990, will require regulation of many small businesses so that areas may attain and maintain the National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and reduce the emission of air toxics. Small businesses frequently lack the technical expertise and financial resources necessary to evaluate such regulations and to determine the appropriate mechanisms for compliance. In anticipation of the impact of these requirements on small businesses, the Act requires that states adopt a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program (PROGRAM), and submit this PROGRAM as a revision to the federally approved State Implementation Plan (SIP). In addition, the Act directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to oversee these Programs and report to Congress on their implementation. The requirements for establishing a PROGRAM are set out in section 507 of title V of the Act. In February 1992, the EPA issued  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Guidelines for the Implementation of Section 507 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , in order to delineate the Federal and state roles in meeting the new statutory provisions and as a tool to provide further guidance to the states on submitting acceptable SIP revisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State of Wyoming has submitted a SIP revision to the EPA in order to satisfy the requirements of section 507. In order to gain full approval, the state submittal must provide for each of the following PROGRAM elements: (1) The establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) to provide technical and compliance assistance to small businesses; (2) the establishment of a state Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses in the regulatory process; and (3) the creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Summary of Submittal <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The deadline for submittal of the PROGRAM to EPA was November 15, 1992. The state of Wyoming did not meet this deadline, and on January 15, 1993, EPA made a finding of failure to submit the PROGRAM pursuant to section 179(a)(1) of the Act in a letter to the Governor of Wyoming. Within 18 months of the date of the finding, the state was to make a complete submittal of their PROGRAM to avoid the imposition of sanctions authorized under section 110(m) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Wyoming Environmental Quality Council adopted the final version of the PROGRAM on September 17, 1993, as authorized by the Wyoming Environmental Quality Act, Article 2, Sections 35&hyph;11&hyph;209 through 35&hyph;11&hyph;211. The Wyoming PROGRAM was submitted to EPA by the Governor of Wyoming on November 1, 1993 as an addition to the Wyoming SIP. It was initially reviewed for administrative and technical completeness. In a letter dated November 22, 1993, EPA requested additional information from the State in order to make a positive determination on the submittal. After receiving the additional information in a letter dated November 30, 1993, EPA notified the State in a letter to the Governor dated December 13, 1993 that the submittal was administratively and technically complete. At that time, the State of Wyoming had met all of the requirements of section 507 and the 18 month sanctions clock was terminated. The submittal was then reviewed for approvability by EPA Region VIII and EPA Headquarters, and received a concurrence from all reviewers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Small Business Assistance Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 507(a) sets forth six requirements <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that the State must meet to have an approvable SBAP to meet the requirements of the first PROGRAM element.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A seventh requirement of section 507(a), establishment of an Ombudsman office, is discussed in the next section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The first requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for developing, collecting and coordinating information concerning compliance methods and technologies for small business stationary sources, and programs to encourage lawful cooperation among such sources and other persons to further compliance with the Act. The State has met this requirement by committing in Addendum 1, page 5 of its SIP revision to ``track the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notices for proposed and new standards and utilize EPA's informational systems ... to provide notice of proposed standards, new standards, and compliance time frames and to assist and provide affected sources with various compliance methods and technologies ....'' The State will additionally ``continue to provide the small business community with technical assistance such as process and control technologies and, if required and sufficient resources exist, perform computer modeling analyses.'' The mechanisms the State has committed to use to accomplish this include ``... coordinate with the Small Business Administration, Ombudsman and other Department officials to disseminate compliance and technical information in a timely manner through: (a) Various trade and interest groups .... (b) Public service announcements. (c) Seminars and workshops. (d) Information packets.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The second requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for assisting small business stationary sources with pollution prevention and accidental release detection and prevention, including providing information concerning alternative technologies, process changes, products and methods of operation that help reduce air pollution. The State has met this requirement by committing in Addendum 1, page 5 of its SIP revision to ``... provide technical expertise for ... assisting small business stationary sources with pollution prevention and accidental release detection and prevention, including providing information concerning alternative technologies, process changes, products and methods of operation that help reduce air pollution.'' The mechanisms the State has committed to use to accomplish this are stated in 1. above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The third requirement is to develop a compliance and technical assistance program for small business stationary sources which assists small businesses in determining applicable requirements and in receiving permits under the Act in a timely and efficient manner. The State has met this requirement by committing in Addendum 1, page 5 of its SIP revision to ``... assist small businesses in meeting the requirements necessary to process the operating permits in an expeditious manner ....'' The State will accomplish this by determining applicable requirements as stated in 1. above. Additionally, the State has committed to ``... continue to inform affected facilities through direct mailing of any applicable proposed or final regulations or standards issued under the Operating Permit Program or the Clean Air Act or adopted through the Wyoming Environmental Quality Council.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The fourth requirement is to develop adequate mechanisms to assure that small business stationary sources receive notice of their rights under the Act in such manner and form as to assure reasonably adequate time for such sources to evaluate compliance methods and any relevant or applicable proposed or final regulation or standards issued under the Act. The State has met this requirement by committing in Addendum 1, page 5 of its SIP revision to ``... inform the small business stationary sources of their rights under the Clean Air Act.'' The mechanisms the State has committed to use to accomplish this are stated in 1. above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The fifth requirement is to develop adequate mechanisms for informing small business stationary sources of their obligations under the Act, including mechanisms for referring such sources to qualified auditors or, at the option of the state, for providing audits of the operations of such sources to determine compliance with the Act. The State has met this requirement by committing in Addendum 1, pages 5 and 6 of its SIP revision to ``... assist small businesses in meeting the requirements necessary to process the operating permits in an expeditious manner and encourage lawful cooperation and compliance with the Clean Air Act ....'' The State ``... will maintain a list of consultants who may provide audits for small business stationary sources.'' As resources allow, the State ``... may conduct audits of small business stationary sources to determine compliance or non-compliance with any rules, regulations, standards, permits or orders ....'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The sixth requirement is to develop procedures for consideration of requests from a small business stationary source for modification of: (A) Any work practice or technological method of compliance; or (B) the schedule of milestones for implementing such work practice or method of compliance preceding any applicable compliance date, based on the technological and financial capability of any such small business stationary source. The State has met this requirement by committing in Addendum 1, pages 5 and 6 of its SIP revision to ``... consider any request from a small business stationary source for modification of: (a) Any work practice or technological methods of compliance. (b) The schedule of milestones for implementing a work practice or method of compliance ....'' The procedures the State will use to accomplish this include determining the ``... technological and financial capability of the small business stationary source,'' and not granting any modification ``... unless it is in compliance with the applicable requirements established pursuant to Wyoming Air Quality Standards and Regulations, the Clean Air Act, and the requirements of the Operating Permit Program.'' Additionally, the State will ``... provide in a timely manner the Ombudsman with all small business operating permits and any small business requests for operational change and modification.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Ombudsman <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State has met the second PROGRAM element, the establishment of a State Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses in the regulatory process, by committing in Addendum 1, page 2 of its SIP revision to locate the position of the Small Business Ombudsman in the Department of Environmental Quality, but separate from the Division of Air Quality. Addendum 1, page 4 of the State's SIP revision details the responsibilities and authorities of the Ombudsman, including ``... act for and on behalf of the small business stationary sources in connection with the implementation of the operating permit program and the 1990 Clean Air Amendments ....'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Compliance Advisory Panel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The third PROGRAM element is the creation of a CAP to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP. The CAP must include two members selected by the Governor who are not owners or representatives of owners of small businesses; four members selected by the State legislature who are owners, or represent owners, of small businesses; and one member selected by the head of the agency in charge of the Air Pollution Permit Program. The Act also delineates four responsibilities of the Panel: (1) To render advisory opinions concerning the effectiveness of the SBAP, difficulties encountered and the degree and severity of enforcement actions; (2) to periodically report to the EPA concerning the SBAP's adherence to the principles of the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Equal Access to Justice Act, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ; (3) to review and assure that information for small businesses is easily understandable; and (4) to develop and disseminate the reports and advisory opinions made through the SBAP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section 507(e)(1)(B) requires the CAP to report on the compliance of the SBAP with these three Federal statutes. However, since State agencies are not required to comply with them, EPA believes that the State PROGRAM must merely require the CAP to report on whether the SBAP is adhering to the general principles of these Federal statutes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State has met these requirements by committing in Addendum 1, pages 2 and 3 of its SIP revision to appoint the members of the CAP as stated above, and to designate to the CAP the four responsibilities listed in the Act. Two additional members will be appointed by the Governor who represent major source operators in the State. The State considers the two additional CAP members to be appropriate because the operating permit fees from major sources fund the PROGRAM. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Eligibility <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 507(c)(1) of the Act defines the term ``small business stationary source'' as a stationary source that: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (A) Is owned or operated by a person who employs 100 or fewer individuals;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Is a small business concern as defined in the Small Business Act;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Is not a major stationary source;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) Does not emit 50 tons per year (tpy) or more of any regulated pollutant; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (E) Emits less than 75 tpy of all regulated pollutants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State of Wyoming has established a mechanism for ascertaining the eligibility of a source to receive assistance under the PROGRAM, including an evaluation of a source's eligibility using the criteria in section 507(c)(1) of the Act. This mechanism is contained in the Addendum 1, page 1 of the State's SIP revision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State of Wyoming has provided for public notice and comment on grants of eligibility to sources that do not meet the provisions of sections 507(c)(1)(C), (D), and (E) of the Act but do not emit more than 100 tpy of all pollutants. This provision is contained in Addendum 1, page 1 of the State's SIP revision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State of Wyoming has provided for exclusion from the small business stationary source definition, after consultation with the EPA and the Small Business Administration Administrator and after providing notice and opportunity for public comment, of any category or subcategory of sources that the State determines to have sufficient technical and financial capabilities to meet the requirements of the Act. This provision is contained in Addendum 1, page 2 of the State's SIP revision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Final Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In this action, the EPA is approving the SIP revision submitted by the State of Wyoming. This SIP revision implements each of the PROGRAM elements required by section 507 of the Act. Addendum 1, page 7 of the State's SIP revision contains a schedule of milestones which show implementation of the PROGRAM by November 15, 1994. The EPA is therefore approving this submittal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, the EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By this action, the EPA is approving a State program created for the purpose of assisting small businesses in complying with existing statutory and regulatory requirements. The program being approved does not impose any new regulatory burden on small businesses; it is a program under which small businesses may elect to take advantage of assistance provided by the State. Because the EPA's approval of this program does not impose any new regulatory requirements on small businesses, I certify that it does not have a significant economic impact on any small entities affected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental protection, Incorporation by reference, Air pollution control, Small business assistance program. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: May 11, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Kerrigan Clough, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Acting Regional Administrator. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Part 52, chapter I, title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 52_[AMENDED] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

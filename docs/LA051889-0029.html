			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PREP NOTES / ROB FERNAS: HAS THE STRIKE STRUCK OUT BASEBALL? COACHES HOPE NOT  </P> <P> Several L.A. City 4-A baseball coaches remain optimistic that their season will  be extended even if the teachers strike is not settled until after the start of  playoffs Wednesday.  </P> <P> However, City Section Commissioner Hal Harkness has not wavered from his  statement that the season will be canceled if boycotting 4-A coaches do not  field teams by the opening round.  </P> <P> "If they don't play Wednesday, there won't be any playoffs," Harkness said  Tuesday. "If the coaches think otherwise, that's their prerogative. It doesn't  matter what they think."  </P> <P> South Bay coaches seemed surprised by the deadline, considering the school year  doesn't end until June 23 and there would be sufficient time to make up games  if the strike was settled within two or three weeks.  </P> <P> "Isn't that something?" said San Pedro Coach Jerry Lovarov when informed of  Harkness' ultimatum. "I guess the only thing we can hope for is that they can  settle the strike by Friday or early next week.  </P> <P> "I hope we never get to the point where we have to cancel the season. I could  roll with it, but I'd feel sorry for the kids, especially the seniors. I could  come back and coach next year, but they couldn't come back and play."  </P> <P> Banning Coach Syl Saavedra believes Harkness is bluffing in an effort to  pressure 4-A coaches into abandoning the boycott. All 12 of Tuesday's 4-A  regular-season finales were canceled, including the showdown between Banning  and San Pedro for the Southern-Pacific Conference title.  </P> <P> "I still think everything is negotiable," Saavedra said, adding that the season  could be extended. "If we don't play at Dodger Stadium, who cares?"  </P> <P> The city finals are scheduled June 1 at Dodger Stadium. If the season was  extended, the finals might have to be held at another ballpark.  </P> <P> "I think (Harkness) is trying to tell us something," Saavedra said. "But don't  tell the kids they can't play. If they're going to punish me, fine."  </P> <P> Saavedra believes the 4-A baseball coaches might meet for a second time to  decide whether or not to boycott the playoffs. The 4-A coaches voted Monday to  suspend the season despite a recommendation last week by the L.A. City Coaches  Assn. that allowed coaches to honor picket lines and direct their teams after  school.  </P> <P> All but one of the 24 City 4-A baseball coaches honored the boycott Tuesday.  The lone holdout, Westchester Coach Ron Kasparian, was awarded a forfeit over  Palisades but failed to qualify for the playoffs because the Venice-University  game was ruled a "no contest" by Harkness.  </P> <P> Westchester needed a victory and a Venice loss to tie Venice for third place in  the Western League and force a playoff for the league's final 4-A playoff  berth. Kasparian had hoped the Venice-University cancellation would result in a  double forfeit.  </P> <P> The veteran coach was upset when informed otherwise.  </P> <P> "Then we're done," he said Tuesday night. "That's ridiculous. I can't believe  that. It just eliminates us."  </P> <P> However, don't expect Kasparian to receive sympathy from coaching colleagues.  </P> <P> Said Banning's Saavedra: "If I had his team on my schedule, I would say: 'Hey  buddy, I'm not going to play you.' I couldn't bring myself to play a guy who  wants to win at all costs."  </P> <P> The next round of the L.A. City 4-A baseball season is Friday when four  third-place teams are scheduled in two wild-card games to determine the final  two berths in the 16-team bracket.  </P> <P> Gardena is supposed to play Birmingham of Van Nuys and El Camino Real of  Woodland Hills is scheduled to play Cleveland of Reseda, although nobody is  quite sure where those games are to be played.  </P> <P> "No one has said anything to me about it," said Gardena Coach Mike Sakurai,  whose team finished behind San Pedro and Banning in the Pacific League. "I  don't know what's going on."  </P> <P> The winner of the Gardena-Birmingham game will meet top-seeded Chatsworth in  the first round of the playoffs. Chatsworth routed Gardena, 29-4, in the  opening round last season.  </P> <P> Asked if he was looking forward to a possible rematch, Sakurai said: "No, no,  no. I've been through enough punishment already."  </P> <P> How high are emotions running in the teachers strike?  </P> <P> Banning teacher and assistant football coach Rocky Garibay was charged with  assault on a school employee Wednesday morning after he allegedly struck and  spit at a substitute teacher.  </P> <P> Two swimmers and one diver from peninsula high schools captured individual  titles at the CIF-Southern Section divisional finals Saturday at Belmont Plaza  Pool in Long Beach.  </P> <P> Debra Kory of Rolling Hills won two swimming events in the 3-A finals, Sara  Marsh of Palos Verdes set a 3-A record in springboard diving and Jessica Tong  of Chadwick turned in one of the most impressive performances by a freshman at  the 2-A finals.  </P> <P> Kory set a 3-A record with a time of 1:05.87 in the 100-meter breaststroke and  won the 100 butterfly in 58.00. Marsh dominated the diving competition by  amassing 480.90 points and Tong won the 50 freestyle in 24.28.  </P> <P> Tong's time was better than the winning mark in the 3-A finals and would have  placed fifth in the elite 4-A finals.  </P> <P> Tong is "just naturally talented," Chadwick Coach Bryan Weaver said. "She has  strong legs and she's very competitive. She has about eight years of swimming  background behind her."  </P> <P> Weaver said Tong holds six national top-16 rankings in her age group.  </P> <P> Palos Verdes basketball Coach John Mihaljevich, who coached current NBA players  Bill Laimbeer of the Detroit Pistons and Mark Acres of the Boston Celtics, will  conduct two three-week clinics this summer for boys entering fifth through  eighth grades.  </P> <P> The clinics cost $150 and are limited to the first 30 boys who enroll. The  first clinic will run from June 26 to July 14 and the second will run from July  17 to Aug. 4 at Palos Verdes High.  </P> <P> Applications can be obtained at the Rolling Hills Estates City Hall or by  contacting Mihaljevich at Palos Verdes High.  </P> <P> PREP NOTES -- Joy Jackson of Chico High and Caleb Roope of Yosemite High in  Oakhurst have been named the 1988-89 Scholar Athletes of the Year by the State  CIF.

In the 1-A prelims, Netta Perkins of Palo Robles won the triple jump with a  mark of 37-6 to break the record of 37-0 1/4 set by Redondo's Anna Ralph in  1984.  </P></p>

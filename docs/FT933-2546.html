			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Agriculture reforms for Cuba THE Cuban government has announced farm reforms to reduce state control over agriculture, AP reports from Mexico City. In the Communist Party daily Granma, the government said it would set up co  -operatives on state land and allowing farmers to share in their profits. The move is the latest in a series of retreats from hardline socialist policy in Cuba, whose economy has shrunk by half since 1989, due to the loss of its socialist backers. The country's Catholic bishops, meanwhile, challenged the government to introduce political as well as economic reforms in the bluntest church criticism in decades of President Fidel Castro's regime.</p>

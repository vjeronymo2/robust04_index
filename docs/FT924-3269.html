			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Yeltsin twists again in effort to save Gaidar MR Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, yesterday offered a power-sharing deal and a further ministerial sacrifice in an effort to persuade the Russian Congress of People's Deputies to approve the reappointment of Mr Yegor Gaidar as prime minister. A vote on Mr Gaidar, at present the acting prime minister and sole candidate for the post, is expected today. Mr Yeltsin's latest concessions to the middle ground in Congress mean the outcome of the vote is likely to be very close. Mr Alexander Shokhin, a deputy prime minister, said last night that Mr Yeltsin would nominate Mr Gaidar a second time if turned down by the Congress today - and that he could legally sustain him in office for a further three months without the deputies' agreement. His comments reflected what has become a widespread belief that the government will, one way or another, survive until April next year - after which, he said, 'a new government' could find the economic situation easier. Mr Yeltsin yesterday recommended Mr Gaidar to the deputies as a man of courage, of devotion to the cause of reform and - to cynical laughter - 'just smart'. The president also proposed that the Supreme Soviet, or smaller permanent parliament, be given the right of veto over the appointment of four ministers - defence, security, interior affairs and foreign affairs, the so-called 'power block'. Such an arrangement would probably seal the fate of Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the liberal foreign minister, whose pro-western sentiments and perceived indifference to the fate of Russians in other former Soviet republics have angered conservative and centrist deputies. However, as a constitutional change this move would need a two-thirds majority. The signs were yesterday that it would be unlikely to obtain such a vote. Several faction leaders, who met Mr Yeltsin before the session, said that they would not vote for the deal because it did not include the key economic ministries. They also said they were unlikely to vote for Mr Gaidar. Mr Vassily Lipitsky, a leader of the Civic Union bloc which has been negotiating with the president over economic reform and the government, said yesterday he 'could not see a majority' - a minimum of 521 - for Mr Gaidar. Mr Oleg Plotnikov, the co-ordinator of the 'Smena' centrist faction in Congress said that 'whatever I think about Gaidar, I know that the people who elected me in Kostorma would hate it if I voted for him. He is very unpopular in the countryside, especially where they haven't seen anything good from the economic reforms'. If not confirmed today, Mr Gaidar may still live on as acting prime minister until the next Congress is convened in April - under a clause in the constitution which allows the president to appoint his choice as premier for three months before submitting a new candidate. Mr Yeltsin's offer, and the apparent willingness to sacrifice a foreign minister, marks the intensity of the struggle between the president and the parliament on the government's policies and personnel. However, his concessions to the middle ground means that the vote to confirm Mr Gaidar today is likely to be a cliffhanger.</p>

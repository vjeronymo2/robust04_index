			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / France set for more disruption to mail THE French postal service is poised for further disruption this week as post office trade unions try to step up industrial action that created chaos for the mail last week. Four of the largest postal unions will this morning hold mandatory meetings for members across France to discuss the next stage of their industrial action against the post office's proposals to cut 3,000 jobs this year. This latest call for action follows the collapse of negotiations on Friday. The areas worst affected by the dispute have been Rouen, Rennes, Le Havre and Marseilles, where the mail has been prey to intermittent strikes and stoppages for the past month. But last week the dispute spread to Paris, where the post office plans to shed 280 of its 7,000 employees. An escalation of the postal dispute would be a blow to the Socialist government, which also faces protests from farmers and fishermen in the run-up to next month's parliamentary elections.</p>

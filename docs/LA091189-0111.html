			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> 1 MILLION TIRES SMOLDER AT DUMP  </P> <P> A pile of more than 1 million used tires caught fire for the second time in  five years and spewed acrid, black smoke today, officials said.  </P> <P> About 50 people were evacuated from their homes and several roads were closed.  </P> <P> "By one report, there were flames going up 30 feet in the air," said John  Gifford, spokesman for the state Office of Emergency Management. He said it  could take days or even weeks to put out the blaze at the seven-acre dump.  </P> <P> Another fire burned at the site for days in 1984, and state officials have been  trying to get the pile cleared since then. Earlier this summer, Gov. Judd Gregg  declared the gargantuan pile "a plague on Danville and the state."  </P></p>

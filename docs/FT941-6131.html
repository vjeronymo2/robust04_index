			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Legal aid to go to higher incomes The Lord Chancellor yesterday said he would raise the income levels below which people qualified for legal aid. Lord Mackay wrote to the president of the Law Society and the chairman of the Bar proposing to raise the green form income limit from Pounds 61 a week to Pounds 70 a week - an increase of nearly 15 per cent. The Lord Chancellor said he was anxious to improve the coverage of the scheme for those who are dependent upon certain benefits, particularly invalidity benefit. The move restores some of the cuts in the legal-aid budget.</p>

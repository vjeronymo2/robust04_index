			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAN BEHIND SWATCH WATCHES WILL ENTER CAR BUSINESS  </P> <P> No one knows yet if its colors will be wild, if it will revolutionize  technology in its field, if it will win back a market progressively abandoned  to the Japanese, or if it will be called, say, Swauto.  </P> <P> For now, it's called simply the Swatch car.  </P> <P> The man who proved, with a watch called Swatch, that the Japanese are not  better at everything, is planning to enter the car business. In as little as  three years, Nicolas Hayek promises a high-volume, high-quality car that will  appeal to the kind of people who bought his inexpensive Swiss-made watch when  everyone said it was time to abandon watchmaking to the Japanese.  </P> <P> Hayek is serious about succeeding as an auto maker. For every person snickering  that a car is infinitely more complicated than a watch, there is an auto  manufacturing executive inquiring about a possible joint venture on the Swatch  car. But Hayek freely admits that his latest project is also a lesson in  progress for American and European manufacturers whose response to the Japanese  is to try to shut them out.  </P> <P> "People must wake up to realize that you do not win this kind of war by going  on the defensive with customs barriers and other constraints," he says. "You  have to fight back at their level, with a high-quality, high-volume and  low-cost product."  </P> <P> Hayek peppers his speech with references to war and with allusions, aimed at  his fellow Europeans, to deep sleep.  </P> <P> "Don't misinterpret me. I love the Japanese," he says. "Without them we would  all be sleeping very deeply, especially here in Switzerland." But he says there  should be no misunderstanding the Japanese. "When they attack a market, they  want it completely. By winning the high volume in the middle," he says, "they  can move to the luxury sector," where returns are higher.  </P> <P> Hayek, whose Zurich company SMH is the world's largest watchmaker, says his car  will embody the qualities that have made his watches, and more recently his  telephones, a success. "It will be unusual, provocative and fun," he says,  adding that it will also be "ecological." Some observers guess that means  electric.  </P></p>

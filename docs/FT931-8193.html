			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / GMTV recruits TV-am saviour GMTV, the breakfast television station, is calling in Mr Greg Dyke, who saved the ailing TV-am in the 1980s and made Roland Rat a household name, to spice up its programmes and woo more viewers. Mr Dyke, who succeeds Mr Harry Roche as non-executive chairman, insisted there was 'not a crisis' at GMTV, in spite of disappointing ratings. He said: 'GMTV's performance has been satisfactory although clearly not as strong as had been hoped for. Audiences are 15 per cent less than wanted, but we can improve them.' He added that when he joined TV-am in 1983, audiences were 200,000 and the channel had 'only two adverts'. GMTV, he said, was attracting nearly 2m viewers. But the station carries the burden of its hefty Pounds 34.6m franchise bid, which it must pay annually to the Treasury, together with 15 per cent of revenues. It has lost viewers since taking over from TV-am at the start of the year, and faces fierce and unexpected competition for viewers from Channel 4's off-beat Big Breakfast. City analysts are forecasting operating losses for GMTV each year until 1996. The station last week appointed Mr Eamonn Holmes to replace Mr Michael Wilson as co-presenter with Ms Fiona Armstrong. It has also signed up a cartoon based on characters in a Super Nintendo computer game. Mr Dyke refused yesterday to talk about personnel changes or specific plans, but said he had 'lots of ideas'. He added: TV is about good ideas'. He hinted that the much-vaunted 'F-factor' of GMTV's presenters might shift to 'family' rather than 'fanciability'. He said: 'What we want is a family of people who like each other and the audience like them.' C4's Big Breakfast said yesterday that Mr Dyke was wrong to dismiss it as a programme for 'kids', as young audiences were attractive to advertisers. Former associates emphasised Mr Dyke's abilities and 'instinctive understanding' of television, but said his non-executive role at GMTV would be different from that at TV-am, where he was editor-in-chief. He will continue as chief executive of LWT and chairman of the Independent Television Association. Mr Dyke, 46, who made his name at LWT with programmes such as the London Programme and Weekend World, boosted audiences at TV-am to more than 1m. TV-am later became one of the world's most profitable TV companies. His tactics included promoting the Roland Rat puppet, and presenters such as Nick Owen and Loyd Grossman. He would have been a favourite for the job of ITV's central scheduler were it not for 'golden handcuffs' keeping him at LWT - share options which are expected to make him a millionaire when they become exercisable later this year. Mr Dyke refused to discuss GMTV's financial position yesterday, saying it was too early in the year to draw conclusions. The company still hopes to make an operating profit. However, stock market and media analysts said GMTV, whose shareholders are Disney, LWT, Carlton, Scottish TV and the Guardian, was unlikely to meet its business plan forecasts for advertising revenues of about Pounds 80m-Pounds 90m this year. Ms Christine Walker, chief executive of media specialist Zenith, a subsidiary of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, said GMTV's revenues this year are likely to fall to Pounds 60m. 'The Big Breakfast and satellite are acting as a pincer movement against GMTV,' she said. According to Zenith's analysis of BARB's adult viewing figures, GMTV's audience share in January fell more than 20 per cent compared with January 1992. GMTV has been able to cut costs compared with TV-am - for example by reducing staff and contracting out news services. However, several analysts believe the station's high annual franchise fee, which is index linked, will push GMTV into a loss by the year end. Before yesterday's announcement, stockbrokers James Capel were forecasting 1993 revenues of Pounds 81m and a pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.8m. Capel said GMTV would make operating losses until 1996, and pre-tax losses until 1997.</p>

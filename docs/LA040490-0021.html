			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGRY COUNTY PRODS STATE ON FOSTER HOMES  </P> <P> Stung by allegations that they have failed to protect foster children from  abuse, Los Angeles County supervisors Tuesday told their critics in state  government: If they think they can monitor foster homes any better, they can  take over the job.  </P> <P> Supervisors voted 3 to 2 to terminate the county's contract with the state to  license and monitor foster homes, effective June 30, unless the state agrees to  provide the county with more money.  </P> <P> The action follows a scathing letter sent to county officials last month by  Linda McMahon, director of state social services. It accused the county of  repeatedly failing to promptly report deaths, abuse and overcrowded conditions  in foster homes to state officials so that the homes could be shut down.  </P> <P> In one case, McMahon alleged that county officials last July discovered 10  children sleeping on the floor of a foster home garage and 10 more youngsters  living in one upstairs bedroom. She charged that county officials waited five  months to report the case to state officials for license revocation.  </P> <P> Because of the alleged poor performance by the county's Department of  Children's Services, state officials also are considering terminating the  $3.3-million-a-year contract that gives the county authority to license and  monitor 3,800 foster homes housing more than 10,000 children.  </P> <P> Robert Chaffee, director of the county children's services department, told  supervisors Tuesday that the state has not provided the county with enough  money to adequately monitor foster homes.  </P> <P> "You can't have high expectations on one hand, and on the other hand, not fully  fund the activities to achieve that," Chaffee said.  </P> <P> He urged supervisors to "put the state on notice that if we can't come to terms  on money . . . since it is your activity by law, you administer it."  </P> <P> Chaffee said the state should provide the county with another $1.7 million. He  did not specify what the money would be used for.  </P> <P> Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, joined by Supervisor Ed Edelman in opposing  termination of the contract, said, "I believe in home rule. Why should we  transfer something to Sacramento when we should do the job?"  </P> <P> Edelman set up a private meeting between Chaffee and McMahon on Tuesday  afternoon in an effort to work out a compromise. Though none was reached,  Edelman said, "They're talking."  </P> <P> Kathleen Norris, public affairs director for the state Department of Social  Services, said the department is prepared to take over licensing and monitoring  of foster homes, but prefers to leave the job to the county.  </P> <P> She expressed confidence that "whatever happens, the care of the children will  improve."  </P> <P> Norris said the state pays based on caseload figures provided by the county,  and said she could not respond to the county's claim that it needs more money.  </P></p>

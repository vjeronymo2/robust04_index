			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEN WALK OUT AT SAN JOSE ST.  </P> <P> Ten San Jose State basketball players, accusing Coach Bill Berry of "mental  cruelty," have refused to play or practice again as long as Berry is the coach.  </P> <P> But Athletic Director Randy Hoffman backed Berry Wednesday and said that  although only 4 players remain, San Jose State will field a team in its  scheduled game against Cal State Fullerton tonight at Titan Gym.  </P> <P> "Bill Berry is our men's basketball coach. He has my confidence and is the head  coach," Hoffman said in a news conference Wednesday evening.  </P> <P> The group of players, including 4 starters, refused to practice Tuesday. The  players met with Hoffman Wednesday morning, then called their own news  conference in the afternoon, an hour after the team was to depart for  Fullerton.  </P> <P> "We feel that we have been through enough mental cruelty and enough threats,"  senior guard Anthony Perry said in a telephone interview.  </P> <P> The players declined to elaborate or provide examples, but Perry said "3 or 4"  players had sought psychiatric care as a result of Berry's actions.  </P> <P> "Since I've been here, he's snatched up a few players, not physically abused,  but snatched them by their jerseys," Perry said. "It's just things that go on  behind closed doors in practice. People see Berry as a jolly person and a great  guy, but no one knows what goes on behind closed doors. . . . We felt it was  time it came to an end. Until something is done, we refuse to play. . . . All  we know is we think they should make a change."  </P> <P> Berry said he was "hurt" by the players' action.  </P> <P> Berry said he swears at the players and admitted that he had been asked by  Hoffman to "mellow" this season.  </P> <P> "I felt I have done that," Berry said. "I do swear some, but I teach, and I  teach effectively and well . . . I don't feel I was asking them to do anything  I wouldn't do myself.  </P> <P> "I'm obviously disappointed in the decision by some of these players and the  emotional reaction of these young men," Berry said. "But we plan to field a  team and do it with dignity."  </P> <P> The team -- minus the 10 boycotting players among whom are starters Perry,  Steve Haney, Dietrich Waters and Rodney Scott -- is scheduled to travel to  Fullerton today.  </P> <P> The 4 remaining players have a combined average of 13 points a game, led by Jan  Svoboda, a 6-foot 9-inch senior center who has started 12 of 16 games and is  averaging 6 points and 4 rebounds a game. Dwain Daniels, a 6-4 junior guard,  has started 3 games, and Tom Desiano, a 6-1 junior guard, has started 1. Kevin  Logan, a 6-6 freshman forward, had been scheduled to be a red-shirt.  </P> <P> Athletic department officials Wednesday evening were seeking students to fill  out the squad, focusing on athletes in other sports whose eligibility already  is certified.  </P> <P> Berry said he would consider allowing the players to return if they change  their minds.  </P> <P> "I would handle each case individually," he said. "If a player came to me and  said he made a mistake, I would be willing to look him in the eye and say,  'OK.' "  </P> <P> The player walkout was thought Tuesday to be connected with the Spartans'  struggles this season. They are 5-11 and have lost 5 consecutive games. San  Jose State absorbed its worst loss of the season last month when it was routed  by Stanford, 89-39.  </P> <P> But the players said Wednesday that the losses were not a factor in the  walkout.  </P> <P> Berry, in his 10th season at the school, has a record of 142-132. The Spartans  were 14-15 last season and were led by Berry's son Ricky, who averaged 24  points a game, leading the conference in scoring.  </P></p>

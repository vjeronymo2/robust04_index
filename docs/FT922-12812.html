			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Scottish line-up changes emphasis MR John Major, the prime minister, has caused a significant shift in the political alignment of the Scottish Office ministerial team, which could herald a change in government policy for Scotland. He has brought in two new faces. Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, up to now Lord Advocate, is to be minister of state and deputy to Mr Ian Lang, the secretary of state. Sir Hector Monro, the MP for Dumfries, is to be one of three parliamentary under-secretaries. Mr Michael Forsyth, formerly minister of state in charge of education and health, is to leave the Scottish Office for the Department of Employment. Lord Strathclyde is also to leave the Scottish Office for the same department. Lord James Douglas-Hamilton and Mr Allan Stewart will remain as parliamentary under-secretaries. Whereas Mr Forsyth is known for his Thatcherite views, and Lord Strathclyde is to the right of the Conservative party, Lord Fraser, who has become well known to the public for his handling of the Lockerbie bombing in 1998, is to the left of many in the Tory party. He is an honorary president of the Tory Reform Group in Scotland, which favours some form of devolved Scottish assembly. Sir Hector, who last held ministerial office at the Environment Department in 1981, has been critical of some of the Thatcherite policies pursued by Mr Forsyth.</p>

			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> The paparazzi has been out in force in Manhattan where Marlon Brando is at work  in one of his rare feature films. "The Freshman" has been shooting in New  York's Little Italy section, setting the neighborhood abuzz as fans try to  catch a glimpse of the superstar actor. A crew member told Reuters that the new  movie is a "Mafia comedy," but Brando's publicists won't go that far. "Brando  plays a distributor. Matthew Broderick plays a film student. That's all I can  say," says Debbie Nathan, a spokeswoman for the production. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Tentatively oppose the resolution establishing a stipulated registration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system within the CITES Secretariat for plant nurseries artificially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> propagating specimens of species included in Appendix I. The United States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supports a system that would improve the credibility of the existing system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for determining which plant specimens are artificially propagated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The registration system proposed in this draft resolution is complex and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be costly to implement by many Parties. Furthermore, it may place  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> too much of a burden with nurseries themselves in determining what  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constitutes artificially propagated specimens, and thereby be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> counterproductive. The current draft of this resolution is an improvement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over previous versions, and the United States encourages the Secretariat to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to make progress in this important area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (b) Revision of the consolidated Resolution. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet; no position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is possible at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (c) Standard reference for Orchidaceae. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet. The United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States supports continued work toward a standard reference for traded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> orchid species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (d) Implementation of the Convention for timber species. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet; no position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is possible at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the United States notes that the provisions of CITES apply to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> all <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  species of wild fauna and flora, including tree species used as timber; some timber species are already listed in the CITES Appendices. CITES'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purview is in addition to the fact that the trade in timber species may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> come under the competence of another international treaty, convention, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (e) Ramin (Gonystylus bancanus). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet; no position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is possible at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 18. Significant Trade in Appendix II Species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the United States continues its long-standing support for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continued focus of the Parties on Appendix II species identified as subject  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to significant trade and the proper implementation of Article IV, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical to the implementation of the treaty and species conservation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Support the provision of funding for the coordination and implementation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant trade study projects, with oversight by the Animals, Plants,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Standing Committees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This topic refers to the trade in those Appendix II species identified as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to significant trade, for which a review is necessary to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if there exists sufficient biological information to warrant trade at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current levels. Many of these species may have been traded at levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detrimental to their survival. The CITES Parties have provided funds to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the World Conservation Union (IUCN) and the Conservation Monitoring Centre  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to assess priorities in studying these species. The United States has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided funds for field projects involving several of these species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This process has worked effectively since COP8, with the implementation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conf. 8.9. The Animals and Standing Committees have taken a very active  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> role in this process, with net benefit for the conservation of some species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and for improvements in the implementation of the Convention. The United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States supports continuation of this process, for both animals and plants,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a high priority being placed on implementation of studies by Parties,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scientific assessments, implementation of scientifically-based quotas when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate, and effective implementation of Article IV.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 19.

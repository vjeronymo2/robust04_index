			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tengiz Pachkoriya in the "NEGA reports" column: </F> "The Georgian-Abkhaz Conflict"]    [Text] Yesterday an enlarged session of the Liberation of  Abkhazia organization was held in Tbilisi, attended by deputies  of the Georgian parliament elected from the Abkhaz Autonomous  Republic, as well as by members of the Abkhaz Government and the  Georgian cabinet of ministers. The session discussed problems  related to the situation in the Abkhaz Svanetiya and in the  Zugdidi region (western Georgia), as well as the convocation and  holding in the near future of a congress of Abkhazia's Georgian  population forced to leave the zone of conflict (the congress,  in the opinion of its organizers, is to proceed under the aegis  of Liberation of Abkhazia, an organization that has been  operating in Tbilisi for several months now). The session  stressed the need to take prompt action for the Georgian side to  retain control of the high mountain villages in the Kodor Canyon  that have come under massed artillery bombardment by the Abkhaz  side. The session criticized the activity of the Georgian  leadership and the government of the Autonomous Republic of  Abkhazia (the reference is to the Georgian administration of  Abkhazia, temporarily based in Tbilisi). It was suggested that  the government of the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia work not  in Tbilisi but in Zugdidi, closer to the temporary location of  tens of thousands of refugees from Abkhazia. The session also  heard demands for the resignation of the incumbent government of  the Abkhaz Autonomous Republic based in Tbilisi. Boris  Kakubava, Liberation of Abkhazia chairman, noted that in the  view of the organization's council and deputies of the Georgian  parliament elected from Abkhazia, Georgia's current Vice Prime  Minister Tamaz Nadareishvili should combine the post of Georgian  vice premier with the duties of chairman of the Council of  Ministers of the Abkhaz Autonomous Republic, which, in the  opinion of the session participants, will facilitate  coordination of actions aimed to bring Abkhazia back under  Georgia's jurisdiction and ensure the return of hundreds of  thousands of refugees.</p>

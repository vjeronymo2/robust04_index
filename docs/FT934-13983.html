			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: AHP profits rise 4% to Dollars 397.6m AMERICAN Home Products, the US pharmaceutical company, yesterday posted a 4 per cent gain in third-quarter net income to Dollars 397.6m from Dollars 382.4m on sales up 3 per cent to Dollars 2.17bn from Dollars 2.11bn. Earnings per share advanced 5 per cent to Dollars 1.28 from Dollars 1.22 in the same period of 1992. Pharmaceuticals, which account for most of the group's turnover, saw sales slide 1 per cent to Dollars 1.19bn in the quarter. US pharmaceutical sales advanced only 2 per cent in the latest quarter. Sales of anti-inflammatory products grew following the introduction of Lodine 400, and helped to offset decreased sales of the group's infant nutritional products. International pharmaceutical sales fell 5 per cent in the quarter, reflecting unfavourable foreign exchange rates and weaker economies in some of the company's key foreign markets. Sales of consumer health care products rose 6 per cent to Dollars 493.4m in the quarter, led by strong growth overseas, while those of medical supplies and diagnostic products also grew 6 per cent to Dollars 216m. For the first nine months, net income stood at Dollars 1.09bn, or Dollars 3.50 on sales of Dollars 6.19bn. A year earlier, the company reported net income of Dollars 1.1bn, or Dollars 3.49, including charges for accounting changes and for acquired research. Stripping out these charges from last year's results, net income rose 8 per cent in the first nine months of this year.</p>

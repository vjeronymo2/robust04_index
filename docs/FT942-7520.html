			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Thorn EMI There may be some value in combining a music business with a book publisher. But Thorn EMI will have to work hard to convince investors of the benefits if it does decide to acquire a publisher. There are obviously similarities between music and books. They both involve handling creative talent and have similar distribution systems. What is more, several of the other music majors - Warner, MCA and Bertelsmann - are also in books. But none of this amounts to a compelling case. Thorn will need to show not merely that book and music distribution systems are similar but that combining them could cut costs. It will also need to show that the group's skills in managing intellectual property can be transferred from one area to the other. Otherwise, shareholders will be worried that the group's resources could be squandered. The sums involved could be large. One indication is that Thorn would be happy for interest cover, currently 10, to fall to three or four. To get to such a level, net debt would have to rise by Pounds 600m or more. Before Thorn embarked on a big publishing acquisition, investors would probably also want to see earnings in the existing business moving ahead. The 3.4 per cent increase in adjusted earnings per share in the last financial year was hardly much to crow about. Meanwhile, a demerger of the music and rental businesses inches forward. The rechristening of the rental side as the Thorn Group is a step in that direction. But chairman Sir Colin Southgate thinks a split cannot take place until the troubled defence interests are sold. Given that these have been on the block since 1989, a quick disposal cannot be guaranteed.</p>

			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Meggitt records 3% improvement to Pounds 12.6m MEGGITT, the Dorset-based engineering company, yesterday reported a 23 per cent fall in earnings per share but a 3 per cent increase in profits, helped by a reduction in the interest charge. In spite of the drop in earnings, the group is increasing the interim dividend by 4.2 per cent to 1.25p (1.2p), based on confidence that it was 'well placed to benefit from any changes in the industrial environment.' Pre-tax profits in the six months to June 30 rose from Pounds 12.3m to Pounds 12.6m on sales ahead 1 per cent to Pounds 152.9m. At the operating level, profits fell 17 per cent to Pounds 11.7m as the group came under margin pressure and the cost of competing in tough markets increased, according to Mr Ken Coates, chairman. Meggitt enjoyed the benefits of last November's Pounds 39.6m rights issue, which helped lead to a Pounds 2.78m swing to Pounds 901,000 interest earned. Gearing at the half year fell to 8.5 per cent in spite of Pounds 51.5m spent on acquisitions during the period, helped by the rights but also due to cash management and cash generation. Mr Coates said that after a fall in capital expenditure last year from a level below that of depreciation, there had been an increase in the first half. The research and development budget had also increased by 7 per cent over the same period last year. On the operational side, the controls and aerospace divisions came under greatest pressure with difficulties in the UK in the former and the latter down on the exceptionally high first half last year. Electronics and energy both improved their first half performances. On current trading Mr Coates said the group's order intake was ahead of the comparable period last year, helped by newly-launched products. There were, however, no clear signs of any lasting economic upturn.</p>

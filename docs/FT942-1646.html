			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: No nannying Sir, Many of your readers expect to find valuable and useful information in your pages. Some of them are not too happy to be patronised by an interviewer (Lucy Kellaway) who plonks her magnificent ego between them and a subject they might like to learn more about ('Put on your thinking caps', June 17). Since 'parallel thinking' has now been taken up by many corporations which find it more constructive than traditional argument, the personal opinion of your interviewer is probably of less value to your readers than an opportunity to find out about the method. Your readers can make up their own minds without being nannied as to what to think. Edward de Bono, L2 Albany, Piccadilly, London W1V 9RR</p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / After the Budget: Oil equities knocked by tax reforms OIL COMPANY shares were hit yesterday as the City reacted to news of the most significant overhaul to North Sea taxation in 10 years, an-nounced in Tuesday's Budget. The complexity of the tax changes means there will be substantial winners and losers. British Petroleum is one of the main beneficiaries from the new regime and its share price rose 6.5 per cent between the market close on Monday and the close last night. But some of the smaller exploration companies saw their shares fall - Clyde Petroleum and Hardy Oil and Gas were down 11 per cent and 5 per cent respectively. Mr David Simon, chief executive of BP, said the reduction in the rate of petroleum revenue tax from 75 per cent to 50 per cent was 'a long-sought and fundamental structural reform'. City analysts estimate that BP will add between Pounds 100m and Pounds 150m to its profits from the tax change. But Shell sounded a note of caution. Mr John Collins, chairman and chief executive of Shell UK, said: 'The inability to charge exploration and appraisal expenditure against income from PRT-paying fields puts a downward pressure on exploration and appraisal activity.' This is by far the most controversial part of Mr Norman Lamont's announcement. It will mean oil companies paying 64p of every pound invested, compared with 17p and could substantially reduce exploration activity, hitting smaller companies hardest. Mr John Walmesley, finance director of Enterprise Oil, said: 'The changes have taken away a lot of the incentive to re-invest your earnings in new projects in the North Sea.' Although Enterprise stands to gain from the tax overhaul, Mr Walmesley said the changes meant that oil operators, already suffering from low oil prices and high costs will reduce their exploration work. Mr Kenneth Waters, finance director of Goal Petroleum, one of the smaller exploration and production companies, said: 'We have to review our whole strategy as a result of these changes and we will look at putting more of our money overseas.' Mr Paul Zatz, finance director of Clyde Petroleum, said the company was already directing much of its investment overseas, particularly to the Netherlands. 'It will inevitably mean a drop-off in future activity in the North Sea.' The PRT rate reduction gives larger companies an incentive to extract more barrels from existing oilfields - an important boost at a time when many fields are nearing depletion. Mr Simon said this could raise the recoverable reserves and extend the productive life of some oilfields. Some industry analysts fear, however, that the government will kill off exploration in new areas of the North Sea, such as the west of Shetland region where it is costly to drill for oil. BP has just made a large discovery west of Shetland which was hailed as opening up a completely new offshore oil province. Mr Simon said yesterday the tax changes would help develop the discovery, where a higher rate of return was necessary. But analysts believe other companies could be deterred from becoming involved.</p>

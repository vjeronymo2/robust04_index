			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / International Company News: Weak demand and higher yen take toll on paper groups - Paper &amp; pulp The annual results of Japan's paper and pulp companies provide a vivid illustration of the competitive pressures on the country's materials manufacturing industries. Last year's rise in the yen has pushed paper makers' international costs above those of producers in neighbouring south-east Asia, resulting in loss of market share at home and abroad. Persistently weak demand, meanwhile, has driven down prices in yen terms faster than costs. As a result, the two largest paper producers, New Oji Paper and Nippon Paper, reported declining profits, while the number three, Daishowa, made a record loss, more than double the previous year. That was far bigger than expected, because of Daishowa's inability to sell assets as fast as planned, to reduce its Y434.7bn (Dollars 4.16bn) debt, a consequence of over-investment in new capacity in the late 1980s. Two creditor banks and a corporate shareholder are to install three executives at Daishowa to help reduce its debts. This ends one of the toughest years in Daishowa's history, following last November's arrest of its former president, Mr Ryoei Saito, on bribery charges. The only leading paper group to produce a slight profits gain last year, Mitsubishi Paper Mills, managed to do so by selling securities, a common technique used by industrial companies to tide their published results through hard times. Excluding a Y5.3bn capital gain on securities sales, Mitsubishi Paper would have made a Y2.9bn loss, said Mr Toshihide Kokuzawa, managing director. The group forecasts a 16.8 per cent earnings decline on stagnant sales in the current year. So far, the paper industry has managed to avoid heavy job losses and has sought instead to reduce costs through mergers. New Oji resulted from a merger last October between Oji Paper and Kanzaki Paper. Nippon Paper was created six months earlier by Jujio Paper and Sanyo-Kokusaku Pulp. Two others, Honshu Paper and Takasaki Paper, have stopped short of a full merger, but announced in January that they are to pool distribution and purchasing.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              FINANCIAL RESULTS, YEAR TO MARCH 1994 (Y BN)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Company                    Sales Change    (%)   Pre-tax     Change (%) New Oji Paper                 673.18     +7.27     12.23           -4.0 Nippon Paper                  626.78      -3.9      9.51          -16.0 Daishowa Paper                275.09     -11.3    -26.44   loss + 141.0 Mitsubishi Paper Mills        172.26      -7.7       2.4           +0.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Company reports  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

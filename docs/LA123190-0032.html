			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACKS DASH IS FUTURITY WINNER  </P> <P> Veteran trainer Rodney Hart called Jacks Dash the best 2-year-old he has ever  handled after the bargain gelding won the $334,000 Golden State Futurity  quarter-horse race Saturday night at Los Alamitos.  </P> <P> It was the fifth consecutive victory for Jacks Dash since he was claimed for  $12,500 at Los Alamitos on July 26.  </P> <P> "This is the best 2-year-old I've ever had," said Hart, 57, who has trained at  Los Alamitos since 1960. "He's really sound and doesn't have any problems."  </P> <P> Jacks Dash broke alertly from post seven and led all the way in defeating  Taking On The Cash, who was on the rail, by a head. Vital Sign finished third  in the field of 10. STEVE SCHUELEIN  </P></p>

			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Indian investment fund attracts Dollars 100m THE Indian Opportunities Fund, an offshore open-ended fund, has raised Dollars 100m from international investors who want to invest in the Indian stock market through a managed investment vehicle. The fund will be managed by Martin Currie, the Edinburgh-based fund management group, and Indbank, the Indian merchant bank. It was set up offshore in order to provide international investors with access to the Indian stock market without the need to pay capital gains tax or withholding tax. International investor interest in the Indian market has been stimulated by the government's economic reform programme. The Bulgarian government has backed a proposal to swap state enterprise debts for government bonds and aims to give its final approval on August 18, officials said, Reuter reports from Sofia. The proposed bonds will have a 20-year maturity, five-year grace period and 10 per cent interest on the lev credit and six-month London inter-bank offered rate on the currency bonds, both payable twice a year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Foreign Affairs Minister Velayati addressed a  session of the international seminar of the Forum Foundation in  Switzerland. Today was designated as the Islamic Republic of  Iran Day. He spoke on recent progress in the Islamic Republic  of Iran during the past 15 years and its future development  plans. He said: Unfortunately malicious propaganda has  prevented world public opinion to fully understand the realities  about the Iranian society and the position of the Islamic  Republic of Iran's system and the long strides it has taken to  revive democracy in the country and establish stability and  security in the region.    Velayati referred to the special geographical and political  position of Iran and its active role in the establishment of  regional security and stability and its assistance to resolve  regional and international crises. He said: The great  self-sacrifice of the Iranian nation in that regard,  particularly in accepting 4 million refugees from various  countries, has been ignored by the world community.    He elaborated on the Islamic Republic of Iran's stances on  regional and international political issues and said such  stances were adopted to reduce the arms race and safeguard the  soundness and security of oil exports and create mutual trust  among regional states.    Velayati also expressed the readiness of our country for the  active participation of our country in a comprehensive  initiative to reduce the production and transfer of weapons to  the Middle East.

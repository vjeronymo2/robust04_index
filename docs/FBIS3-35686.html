			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 29 TASS -- The Russian Democratic  Reform Movement said on Saturday its main task is to develop a  new concept of Russia's transition to post-industrial society.    Addressing the Second Congress of the movement that opened  in  Moscow today, its leader Gavriil Popov said the movement  prioritises the development of a "platform of reform,  alternative to the western model and ensuring the country's  transition to a post-industrial society," as well as "the  neutralisation of the most dangerous measures and laws of the  western model of reform."    He also said that the movement will seek to initiate debates  on the new concept in the parliament and make amendments to the  new constitution. In order to promote the stability of power in  the country, Popov called for reopening the constitutional  assembly and establishing a Council of Nationalities of Russia  and several other corporate organisations.    He believes the main result of the December 1993 elections  in  Russia is that Russia rejected the "post-August pro-western  stage of reform" and the shock therapy policy. The fact that  none of the political forces received the support of 15 per cent  of the electorate proves this point, he added.    The Russian Democratic Reform Movement set up about two  years  ago had rated among top ten political parties and movements in  Russia, but failed to clear the five per cent threshold at the  parliamentary elections in December last year.    Popov explained the failure by a mistake in strategy  planning. The movement had failed to foresee that the voters  would reject the post-August concept of reform so soon. "We  believed that the majority would support the presidential course  and did not put forward our own alternative," Popov said.    The movement has criticised the Russia's Choice bloc for its  inability to "pass the most elementary test of political  maturity." However, it is ready to cooperate with the "healthy"  forces of Russia's Choice and the Democratic Russia Party.  Popov did not rule out the possibility of cooperation with the  Communists and the Agrarian Party "if they embark on the path of  social democracy," but excluded any cooperation with the Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia which he described as a "party of  aggressive nationalism." There is much positive in the  platforms of the Civic Union and the Yabloko bloc, Popov said.    The Congress has begun debates on Popov's report. The  participants will also consider changes and amendments to the  movement charter and discus the establishment of its  coordinating bodies.</p>

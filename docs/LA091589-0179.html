			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RAIDERS TICKET SCRAMBLE ON IN SACRAMENTO  </P> <P> Confident that the Los Angeles Raiders will move to Sacramento, thousands of  fans are scrambling for a chance to buy season tickets to a stadium that exists  only on blueprints.  </P> <P> The rush began after Tuesday's unanimous City Council vote to use $50 million  in public funds to lure the Raiders to the capital, said Mike Seward, vice  president of Lukenbill Enterprises.  </P> <P> "The calls have probably numbered in the low thousands in the last two days,"  Seward said. "People are asking about season tickets, club boxes and luxury  suites."  </P> <P> Callers' names are being placed on a priority roster to be used if tickets go  on sale, he said.  </P></p>

The South Korean paper CHOSUN ILBO March 25 quoted "U.S.  military sources" as saying that a plan was being worked out by  the U.S. military to hurl 600,000-strong military strength  including two marine divisions, more than 200 warships, over  1,600 planes, etc. to the Korean peninsula from the U.S.  mainland within 80 days in "case of emergency."    Meanwhile, U.S. Deputy Undersecretary of Defence Slocombe  said on March 24 that a U.S. carrier task fleet was in "full  readiness for action" to cope with "a possible contingency" on  the Korean peninsula and the mobilization system of the U.S.  imperialist aggression forces in South Korea was under  reexamination.    Facts show that the U.S. warmaniacs are rendering the  situation of the Korean peninsula extremely strained. But their  attempt to frighten the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  with strength is really a foolish act.    Our people and People's Army want peace but are never afraid  of war.    The U.S. imperialists would be well advised to act with  discretion and stop running riot with proper knowledge of Korea.    Our people and People's Army, who are united closely around  the party and the leader, are keenly watching the military moves  of the U.S. imperialists.</p>

			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of Portable Computers (7): Quest for longer battery life - Research intensifies to improve power management AS PORTABLE computers have shrunk in size and weight, more attention has been focused on one of the less glamorous parts of the PC: the power supply. Almost all portable computers, except for heavyweight transportables, depend upon batteries to supply the power they require. This means that there are only a limited number of options for extending operating life between replacing or recharging batteries. Unfortunately, battery technology has lagged behind developments in almost every other sector of electronics. Analysts bemoan the fact that battery technology for portables has improved a paltry five per cent a year. Except for palmtop computers (the babies of the portable computer family), most portables use rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries. Generally, they can only provide enough power between charges to keep a notebook PC running for between one and three hours, depending upon usage. More power could be delivered by larger batteries, but this would add weight. Nickel-cadmium batteries have several other disadvantages. Chief among these is the so-called 'memory effect.' Unless they are fully discharged before recharging they gradually loose capacity - or the ability to be fully recharged. Several alternatives have been tried, but have generally either proven to be unstable or have shown little power-to-weight advantage over NiCad cells. Lithium cells pack four times as much energy into a given size and weight than NiCad batteries but can be very volatile - one Japanese businessman's lithium-powered portable telephone reportedly exploded while he was using it. So far, the most promising, and safer, alternative has been nickel-metal hydride powerpacks initially developed in Japan by Sanyo. NiMH batteries have recently started to appear in new portables including those from Toshiba and Dell. Manufactures claim they can extend normal use operating time over NiCad batteries by up to a third and have the added advantage of being more environmentally friendly. Some indication of the expected demand for these new powerpacks is given by Matsushita, one of the big four Japanese battery-makers, which began producing NiMH batteries in late 1990 and said in November that it expected to quadruple production by the middle of this year. However, the limited progress in battery technology has forced portable computer manufacturers to turn to other solutions to extend operating life between charges. Until recently, most attention has focused on software implemented power management and on reducing consumption by using low power components like the CMOS chips - which made the first laptops possible  - or highly integrated components. Toshiba pioneered software power management systems by introducing features like auto-resume, pop-up battery power indicators and battery-backed 'hard RAM.' Other power manage ment systems switch off power-hungry components such as screens and disk drives when they are not being used; some also monitor battery recharging. Software-based power management solutions can enhance battery life, but some risk introducing compatibility problems, and more fundamental solutions are required to achieve the substantial power savings which portable PC users are beginning to demand. More complex power management systems therefore depend upon a combination of hardware and software features. The most dramatic recent development in power management has been the complete redesign of the 80386 chipset by Intel to produce the power-saving Intel 80386SL chipset unveiled at the end of 1990. The first notebook computer to take advantage of the new Intel chipset was the Zenith MastersPort 386SL launched last July to popular acclaim. Other manufacturers including Toshiba, Sharp, Compaq and Dell have now launched 386SL-based notebooks. Dell's machine, the System 325NC, is a colour notebook using the 386SL 25Mz chipset and a Dell-developed power management application specific integrated circuit (Asic) resulting in battery life of up to three hours of normal use - longer than many monochrome machines. Zenith itself has launched a faster, second generation machine, the MastersPort 386SLe running at 25Mz. The US-based company, which is now a subsidiary of the French Groupe Bull, reached the market first because it had worked closely with Intel during the design phase and had a head start in designing the operating system necessary to take advantage of the SL's special features. The SL chipset is actually two chips replacing 11 components in the standard 386 design, but the real key to the way it saves power is its ability to switch sections of the computer off when they are not being used and run them slower when peak performance is not required. The use of an in-built 64k processor cache also helps by reducing the need to provide the standard RAM (random-access memory) with more than a drop of power. 'What is special about the SL is not the power it uses, but the power it does not use,' says a Zenith official. What is more, the sophisticated power-management systems are mostly 'transparent', so the average user does not even need to be aware of them. Using the chipset, the Zenith MastersPort SL machines have three power modes: in use, standby (which is equivalent to dozing), and sleep, which is like being in a coma but not quite dead. When the machine is running flat-out with disks whirring and screen on full brightness, there is little if any power-saving over the standard 386 chipset. But when the machine switches to the standby-state, its power consumption drops to about 15 per cent of the peak rate. In this state most of the essential functions are kept alive and some of the hardware runs very slowly, but moving a mouse or touching the keyboard is enough to arouse it. By contrast, in a 'coma' almost nothing runs and power consumption falls to just 0.5 per cent of the peak rate. In this state the processor slows to 1Mz, essential data is stored safely away and the machine is all but switched off. But it can be revived almost instantly either by pressing the power button or by a timer utility and returns to exactly the same place and function as when it powered down. Using a setup facility in ROM (read-only memory), the power switch can be configured either to trigger the sleeping state, or to turn the computer off in the normal way. The setup facility also provides user access to the machine's other power-saving features. Zenith is properly cautious about making exaggerated claims for its machines; however, in 'coma' mode, the batteries would last about a month. More importantly, powered-up and in normal use, they should last six hours or effectively a full working day, even when running 'Windows.' Toshiba, which launched its rival T3300SL 25Mz machine with NiMH batteries last month, said the SL chip offers 'power management facilities similar to those pioneered by Toshiba on previous portable PCs,' and will give a battery life of up to four hours. Some analysts are already predicting that shipments of SL chips will overtake shipments of standard 386SX chips in the notebook market segment within a few years. But Intel is unlikely to have the market all to itself. Intel's arch-rival, AMD, has developed microprocessor technology which it claims will double the battery life of a portable PC without compromising processor performance. The new devices, which follow the Intel's DX and SX architecture, are designed to operate at 3.3 volts instead of the normal 5v and thereby also allow the use of low-cost alkaline batteries.</p>

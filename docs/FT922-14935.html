The president named, late on Wednesday, Ms Ruth de Krivoy, a respected economist and the first woman to hold the job, to head the central bank. Mr Rodriguez, who only took the post in late February, was the main architect of the highly unpopular economic reform programme the Perez government initiated three years ago.</p>

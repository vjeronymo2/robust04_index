			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A credit to all concerned I am not an accountant, just an interested amateur. I refer to your Q&amp;A answer 'Income tax query' on January 15. Should it not be Pounds 10,000 at 20 per cent (and not Pounds 8,000 at 25 per cent)? If I am right, I am astonished. The credit at 25 per cent on Pounds 8,000 was based upon the assumption that by his phrase 'investment (equities gross) of Pounds 10,000,' the reader meant 'Schedule F income of Pounds 10,000' - viz, UK dividends of Pounds 8,000 plus their 25 per cent tax credits. The reply was sent to him by post before Christmas and, as he had not come back to us, we assume that was indeed what he meant. Because UK dividends have been paid gross for the past 20 years (except for dividends on building society shares, which have had tax deducted from them since April 1991), it is often difficult for us to be sure what a reader means when he or she talks about his or her 'gross' income from UK equities. So, we do the best we can. Correction In the same reply, the figure Pounds 6,225.75 should have read Pounds 6,215.75; similarly, Pounds 4,225.75 should have been Pounds 4,215.75. But these misprints did not affect the final tax bill of Pounds 571.00 - viz, 20 per cent of Pounds 2,855. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

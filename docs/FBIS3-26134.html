			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Sun Weiben, secretary of provincial party </F> committee, at a provincial rally to mark Mao Zedong's centenary:  "Advance Courageously Along the Socialist Road With Chinese  Characteristics"]    [Text] Comrades:    Tomorrow we will mark the centenary of Comrade Mao Zedong.  We  hold this ceremonious rally here with a feeling of respect to  cherish the memory of Comrade Mao Zedong. Comrade Mao Zedong was  a great Marxist and the principal founder and leader of the  Chinese People's Liberation Army and the PRC. In remembering  Comrade Mao Zedong, we should not only express our feeling of  observance of and respect for Comrade Mao Zedong, but more  importantly, we should uphold and develop Mao Zedong's thought  under the new historical conditions, guide our various fields of  work with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism  with Chinese characteristics, and realize the unfulfilled wish  of Comrade Mao Zedong on building a socialist, modernized, and  strong country.    Over half a century before and after Comrade Mao Zedong's  birth were the years during which the Chinese people conducted  repeated trials of strength and acute struggle with strong  imperialist elements of foreign countries and feudalist elements  at home. A great era will inevitably create outstanding figures  and outstanding figures will, in turn, promote the advance of  history. Comrade Mao Zedong was a great and outstanding figure  who emerged in our country during the great changes of history  of over a century. During the most difficult time of the Chinese  revolution, he was the first one to find a correct road for the  revolution. Many times he saved the party and the country from  crises, and enabled China's revolution to succeed after facing  many difficulties. Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong,  the Chinese Communist people finally overturned the "three big  mountains" after conducting heroic, indomitable, and successive  struggles; ended the Chinese nation's history of humiliation of  allowing themselves to be trampled upon for over a century; and  stood up firmly in the eastern part of the world. After the  victory of the new democratic revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong  also led the Chinese people of various nationalities to win a  great victory in socialist transformation through great efforts  and struggles, and turned a new page of the socialist revolution  and construction. Just as it was pointed out in the decision of  the sixth plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee:  Comrade Mao Zedong was a great Marxist and a great proletarian  revolutionary, strategist, and theoretician. Reviewing his  entire life, although he committed serious mistakes during the  "Great Cultural Revolution," his contributions ranked first  among all. He made indelible contributions to our party and the  Chinese People's Liberation Army, to the victory of the  liberation cause of the Chinese people of various nationalities,  to the founding of the PRC and to the development of our  country's socialist cause. He made great contributions to  liberating the world's oppressed nation and to the cause of  human progress. History and the people will always remember the  great historical contributions of Mao Zedong.    At the time when we commemorate the centenary of Comrade Mao  Zedong, the people of Heilongjiang will never forget the time  when Comrade Mao Zedong inspected our province after he visited  the Soviet Union. During his inspection tour, Comrade Mao  Zedong went to plants and workshops to hold cordial talks with  the broad masses of cadres and the people, proposed the  historical task of transforming the consumption city of Harbin  into a production city, and wrote brilliant inscriptions  "study," "struggle," study Marxism and Leninism," "develop  production," and "never be tainted with the bureaucratic work  style" for them. These directives and inscriptions have always  stimulated and inspired the broad masses of cadres and the  people across the province. During the past 40 years and more,  the previous provincial party committees and governments led the  people across the province to follow the directives of Comrade  Mao Zedong, strived to study Marxism and Leninism, promoted the  work style of arduous struggle, made all-out efforts to develop  production, to build the barren northern border areas into the  major commodity grain base, major industrial base and open  forward front of the whole country, and achieved great progress  and development in all undertakings in the whole province.    The greatest contributions of Comrade Mao Zedong were his  unceasing efforts to pool the wisdom of the entire party during  the protracted practice of the revolution, to successfully  combine the universal principle of Marxism with the specific  practice of China's revolution, to realize the first historical  leap forward by combining Marxism with our country's practice,  and to form a scientific guiding ideology that suits China's  situation--the Mao Zedong thought. Mao Zedong thought is not  only a brilliant banner guiding China's revolution to turn  defeat into victory and to move from victory to victory, but  also a powerful spiritual weapon for recognizing and  transforming the world. Being proved by practice as the correct  theoretical principle and a summary of experiences, and the  application and development of Marxism in China, the Mao Zedong  thought was, is, and will be our guiding ideology in the future.    Following Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Deng Xiaoping led the  Chinese Communist people to act in accordance with the basic  principle of the Mao Zedong thought, summed up the positive and  negative experiences, recognized the objective law of building  socialism, and proposed the theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics. This theory has quite systematically  answered a series of questions, such as how to build socialism  and how to consolidate and develop socialism in a country such  as China where the economy and culture are fairly backward;  inherited, enriched, and developed the Mao Zedong thought with  new ideologies and viewpoints. It is China's Marxism of the  present age.    Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out: "Marxism is like a  banner." During its early period of establishment, the Communist  Party of China earnestly wrote Marxism and Leninism on its own  banner. After the Yanan rectification of incorrect work style  and the seventh party congress, it also earnestly wrote the  ideology which combined Marxism and Leninism with the practice  of the Chinese revolution--the Mao Zedong thought--on its own  banner. Beginning with the convocation of the third plenary  session of the 11th CPC Central Committee and through the 12th,  13th, and 14th party congresses, our party also solemnly wrote  the theory of Comrade Deng Xiaoping on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics on its own banner. This is a great  banner for developing the socialist cause and a powerful  spiritual pillar for national regeneration and development.  During the past 15 years, thanks to our efforts to hold aloft  this banner, our party and our country succeeded in overcoming  all sorts of difficulties, and making economic construction, the  comprehensive national strength, and the level of living of the  people jump to a higher and big stage. Under the situation of  drastic changes in world situation, the socialist system of  China has experienced all sorts of severe tests, showed great  vitality, and made great achievements of worldwide attention.  History and practical experience have repeatedly showed that  upholding the theory of Comrade Deng Xiaoping on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics means upholding and  developing Marxism, Leninism, and the Mao Zedong thought. Our  party has used the Mao Zedong thought to educate the people of a  generation, and enabled us to win the victory in China's first  revolution of establishing the people's political power.  Likewise, if we use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm the whole party  and educate the people, we will surely win a victory in China's  second revolution of promoting reform and opening up, and  realizing socialist modernization.    Lenin once said: The best way to celebrate this  commemorative date of great revolution is to concentrate our  attention on the unfulfilled revolutionary task. At present and  for a considerable long period of time to come, the central task  of our whole party and the whole country is to further  emancipate and develop the productive forces, carry out  modernization construction with one heart and one mind, and  build China from an underdeveloped socialist country into a rich  and strong democratic and civilized socialist country. For this  reason, we must accelerate the establishment of the socialist  market economic system, and push economic construction to a new  stage better and more quickly. We should fully recognize that  difficulties and opportunities will coexist in realizing this  task. The "decision of the CPC on some issues concerning the  establishment of the socialist market economic system" adopted  at the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee  is a grand blueprint for realizing the transition from old  economic systems into new ones and the program of action for  guiding the whole party and the people across the country to  spare no efforts to accelerate reform and development. The  issuance of the "decision" has created a favorable environment  and conditions and provided historical opportunity for  fundamentally solving the in-depth contradictions that restrict  our province's economic development. At the same time, it will  also make our province meet some new problems and difficulties.  Through deeply studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping, we should unify thinking, seize the  opportunity, accelerate the establishment of a new system and  new order of the socialist market economy, promptly solve all  sorts of contradictions emerged in the course of reform, and  enable our province to enter the path of sustained, speedy, and  sound development.    Comrades: Under the new situation of reform, opening up and  socialist modernization, let us continue to uphold and develop  the Mao Zedong thought, rally closely around the Party Central  Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the nucleus under the  great banner of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, uphold the party's basic  line, work with one heart and one mind, be keen on reform, work  in a down-to-earth manner, engage in arduous struggle, and  advance courageously.</p>

			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FORSTMANN TO GET GENL. INSTS. FOR $1.6 BILLION  </P> <P> Forstmann Little &amp; Co., a leading leveraged buyout concern, said today it  will buy General Instruments Corp., cable TV and gaming equipment maker, in a  deal it valued at $1.6 billion.  </P> <P> The buyout is one of the biggest merger transactions in a relatively dormant  year for takeovers, and is especially unusual because leveraged buyouts of big  public companies have become a rarity.  </P> <P> In a leveraged buyout, a private group acquires the public stock of a company  and replaces it with debt.  </P> <P> Forstmann entered into the definitive merger agreement to buy General  Instruments Corp. for $44.50 a share cash, a premium over its $36.25 closing  price on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.  </P> <P> The stock in the transaction is worth $1.2 billion, and, with the assumption or  refinancing of existing debt, the buyout is worth about $1.6 billion, Forstmann  Little said.  </P> <P> The transaction is fully financed and not subject to any financing conditions.  </P> <P> Forstmann Little, led by the outspoken junk bond critic Ted Forstmann, has  remained active in the leveraged buyout field while others have dropped out.  </P> <P> Forstmann has continued to buy companies by using more traditional types of  financing. Most recently, the firm bought Gulfstream Aerospace from Chrysler  Corp. for $825 million.  </P> <P> The market for junk bonds, high-yield, speculative corporate bonds, meanwhile,  has been in disarray for more than a year, after a number of junk-bond-financed  takeovers failed. Forstmann's chief rival, Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.,  has turned its efforts to refinancing previous junk-bond funded deals like RJR  Nabisco, instead of completing new ones.  </P> <P> General Instruments, which has grown steadily by selling high-tech systems for  cable television, lotteries and betting parlors, has seen its stock languish in  recent months.  </P></p>

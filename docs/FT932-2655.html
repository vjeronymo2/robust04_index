			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Ticino (2): A haven for rich Italians - Lugano as a financial centre TICINO'S main claim to fame in the post-war period has been its position as a financial haven for rich Italians. Lugano is the third-largest banking centre in Switzerland after Zurich and Geneva and boasts no fewer than 56 banks operating within its confines. Because most of the business of these banks is in private banking - that is, managing the fortunes of rich people - there are no hard statistics about the magnitude of the funds held. But there are some indications. It is believed that Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC), since acquiring control of Banca della Svizzera Italiana (BSI) last year, has overtaken Union Bank of Switzerland as the largest bank in Ticino, with something close to SFr60bn under management. Credit Suisse, the third-largest, recently revealed that 18 per cent of its funds under management in Switzerland are in Ticino branches, even though only a tenth of its personnel is there. No one denies that the lion's share of the funds placed in Ticino banks comes from Italy. 'After the war, Italian industrialists did not have confidence in their own financial system, so they came to Ticino,' says Mr Claudio Generali, chairman of Banca del Gottardo, itself a post-war creation which is now controlled by Japan's Sumitomo Bank. Mr Generali and others do point out, however, that the Ticino banks provide not only fund management services but also commercial banking for Italian companies. Fiat, for example, has a large financial subsidiary based in Lugano with assets of some SFr3bn, and many Italian companies organise export finance through Lugano because the service is better than that available from Italian banks. Mr Luigi Butti, general manager of BSI, notes that the Italian banking industry 'lost a generation of expertise' when capital export controls were introduced in 1976. 'Certainly, they will catch up, but it will take a very long time in the provinces.' Managing the fortunes of rich Italian individuals has not always left Lugano with the best image, either in Switzerland or in Italy. Lugano bankers got a particularly bad reputation in the late 1970s and 1980s following the prohibition of capital exports from Italy. Everyone knew that in the subsequent years all sorts of sharp schemes were being devised in Lugano and elsewhere to enable rich people to get their money out. In the past two years since Italy removed exchange controls the criticism has eased somewhat. However, as Mr Generali puts it: 'It is still not considered exactly proper in Italy to put your money in Switzerland.' The bad smell has re-emerged in recent months with the Tangentopoli political scandals in Italy. UBS, in particular, has had to face a lot of bad publicity over the tantalisingly-named 'protezione' account (that was the password needed to gain access to it) in its Lugano branch. The account was used for funneling pay-offs from state-owned industry to politicians. But Lugano bankers point out that the protezione account was closed as long ago as 1981 and that they have all become much more careful in recent years about who they deal with. Also, Switzerland's legislation on money laundering and dealing with criminals has become much tougher. 'I think the banks understand now that they do not have any interest in going after questionable business,' says Mr Dick Marty, Ticino's governor and a former chief prosecutor famous for investigating money-laundering cases. 'In any event, there is enough good business for them to go after,' Mr Marty says. Indeed, by all accounts, the inflow of funds in the past few months has been very brisk because of the political instability in Italy, and the outlook appears good. Mr Butti sees new opportunities in Italy because so much of the Italian government's huge deficit is almost entirely financed by domestic bonds. Both the government and individual investors urgently need to diversify their portfolios, he says. Ticino bankers are aware that it is only a matter of time before Italian banks become more competitive in fund management and other services, so they are putting a lot of effort into training and generally improving standards. 'The system grew very quickly in the past 30 years with a readily available market, and so the development of organisations was rather anarchic with some important gaps in education,' says Mr Rene Chopard, director of the new Centro di Studi Bancari (CSB). The CSB was set up three years ago by the Ticino Association of Bankers, which groups 23 of the banks representing 90 per cent of the employees in the sector, with a view to providing post-secondary courses for member bank employees. It now offers a general four-week first year university-equivalent course in banking and economics and a nine-week course spread over three years for senior managers. The centre also generates research and sponsors seminars that are open to the public. The relatively stable structure of Ticino banking was rocked last year when SBC moved in on BSI, turning it into the core of its group of small private banks in Switzerland. BSI's commercial and retail branch network north of the Alps has been shut down; in Ticino, even though it claims officially that it will remain a universal bank, commercial and retail business is being de-emphasised. Last year, 430 jobs, a third of the bank's workforce, were eliminated. Mr Butti says further reductions will take place only through natural attrition. The remaining big question in Lugano is over the future of Banca del Gottardo. Rumours have raged for months that Sumitomo Bank, which bought 51 per cent in 1984 for SFr212m, would like to sell. The argument is that Sumitomo, like most Japanese banks, is in need of capital. Moreover, the Swiss capital market is no longer as active for Japanese issuers as it used to be. Sumitomo has consistently denied any intention of selling Gottardo, but bankers in Lugano suspect that this stance has a lot to do with face-saving. A sale now would be a sign of weakness. If Sumitomo did sell, it would present an opportunity for the Ticinese themselves to take control of one of the top banks. At the moment, no significant bank in the canton is locally owned. But the betting in Lugano is that UBS will be the purchaser.</p>

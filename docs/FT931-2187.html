			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Danish doubts on Maastricht DANISH voters are increasingly doubtful whether to vote for the Maastricht treaty and Denmark's opt-outs agreement in the May 18 referendum, according to a Gallup poll published yesterday, writes Hilary Barnes. The poll indicated 47 per cent would vote yes, compared with 54 per cent in favour in a poll in early February. Some 25 per cent said they would vote against, unchanged from February. The 'don't knows', however, increased from 13 to 24 per cent.</p>

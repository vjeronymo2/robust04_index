			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / McAlpine attacks Major's campaign Mr John Major's handling of the European election campaign was bitterly attacked yesterday by Lord McAlpine, who was Conservative party treasurer during Baroness Thatcher's premiership. However, Mr Major's concept of a multi-speed Europe was given full backing by Mr Michael Heseltine, a leading cabinet member of the Tory pro-European wing. Lord McAlpine, writing in The European newspaper, said Mr Major's criticism of beggars would go down as a 'minor classic in the annals of political nastiness'. The comments had been made to win votes, not because they were sincerely believed. 'This is a form of politics that I detest,' he said. 'I consider myself to be on the rightwing of British politics. These words uttered by a Conservative leader fill me with shame at being a Conservative.' Mr Heseltine said his view of the future of the European Union was 'exactly the same' as that spelt out by Mr Major: 'You can be at the heart of Europe  -and we should be at the heart of Europe - but the outcome of negotiations can be multi-tiered and multi-speed.' Mr Heseltine said the opposition parties were prepared to 'sign up to almost any idea called Europe without checking the details'. He added: 'We believe it is worth having a hassle over the details before you sign up to the principle.' His comments suggest that the party's pro-Europeans are likely to cloak their distaste for the prime minister's Euro-sceptic rhetoric - intended to encourage core Conservative supporters to vote - until after polling day on Thursday. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, told businessmen in Birmingham that the government was seeking a 'decentralised, de-regulating and competitive Europe'.</p>

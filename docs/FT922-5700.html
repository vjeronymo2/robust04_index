			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Water sector The opening brace of water company results provided an object lesson in practical regulation. South West Water won permission last year from Ofwat to pass on to consumers some of the costs of additional long-term capital spending; North West Water has found a neat solution to its unforeseen requirement for Pounds 360m of extra spending. A deal with Ofwat means its customers will be spared even bigger price rises, while the company has the incentive of an agreed 7 per cent real rate of return on the investment. Perhaps more importantly, the arrangement will be kept separate from the industry's price review in 1994. That reinforces the impression that the companies as a group are doing their best to limit Ofwat's ability to squeeze the price formula. In part that involves judicious control of profits via restructuring provisions or a greater interest burden. It will be rather harder to avoid scrutiny of operating margins in the basic water business which, in the case of the most efficient companies, are creeping towards 50 per cent. But South West and North West have persuaded Ofwat to accept a long-term view. Shareholders should not expect the rest of the sector to enjoy similar treatment.</p>

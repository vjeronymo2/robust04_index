			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Luis Baez Delgado] </F>   [Text] No matter how hard they try, the computers of the  CIA and the Pentagon cannot decipher the code that has prevented  the Cuban Army from losing its combat readiness and succumbing  to instability and even disintegration (as has happened in other  parts of the world), despite the devastating blow it has  suffered as its state funding has been slashed to unprecedented  levels, for reasons known to all.    The imperialists know that without an army, there is no  country, and they daydream of the fabulous possibilities. What  they do not know is that long before the Special Period, the  Revolutionary Armed Forces (FAR) began working, step by step, on  a savings program. They began looking for alternative sources of  energy, ways to make more rational and efficient use of  resources, and other options for supplying the troops and  feeding the population.    When other state institutions made plans to operate with 75  percent of their fuel allotments, the FAR planned on 50 percent.  When the other institutions went to 50 percent, the FAR began  preparing to maintain and even expand their operations at only  25 percent.    When there was talk of a possible zero option, the Army that  inherited the legacy of heroism from our mambises  [Cuban rebels during Spanish domination] and the combatants of  the Rebel Army and the underground period did not cringe or  panic. It had been preparing for this eventuality for years.    Today the results can be seen in Military Unit 1640 of the  Eastern Army. Nothing has been left to chance; no one has rested  on his laurels.    This is the only explanation for the fact that this military  unit has continued to fulfill -- even to exceed, in some aspects  -- its assigned tasks with just 19 percent of the fuel and 40  percent of the electricity it received in 1989. Reducing the two  to their common denominator, this means it has saved 70 percent  on energy. And these are not inflated figures; we went to the  field and saw it with our own eyes.    The innovations include the use of solar heaters,  translucent  roof tiles, animals for hauling, and biogas; sugarcane husks and  residue as sources of energy; emulsion and magnetism in training  units and rear-guard services; bicycles in various activities;  and wind energy and compressed air technology.    All of this has made it possible to maintain a high training  capacity and combat readiness with the absolute minimum amount  of fuel. This fact merits special mention because of what it  means for the country's defense.    One of the many examples that back up this assertion can be  found in what has come to be known as "Red Bat," a kind of radar  adapted to the warlike conditions that the entire nation faces.  It used to require 10 trucks and more than eight hours for  deployment. Now, after having been remodeled, it requires only  three trucks for transportation and it can be set up in just 30  minutes. Moreover, it is even more effective.    In addition, when a young sharpshooter demonstrated his  excellent skills and was asked about the accessories he used, he  explained that they are exclusively designed and manufactured in  Cuba.    If the imperialists managed to capture those images with  their satellites -- and surely they must have because they spend  every minute spying on us -- they would be doing those in Miami  who still clamor for an armed confrontation with the revolution  a great favor by showing them those images.    The imperialists also do not know, and are incapable of  imagining, how these Military Councils of the Revolutionary  Armed Forces take place.    Suffice it to say that the nature of these councils was made  clear when, at the end of the presentation by the unit  commander, the first words of the minister of the FAR were:  "Come on and ask some questions. The purpose of the councils is  to spark debate."    The way the exchange took place and the topics that were  discussed also revealed how this institution cuts to the heart  of the matter and solves problems. The council lasted 13 hours,  and eight of those hours were spent touring sites to observe the  actual implementation of the savings program. An important part  of the program is aimed at achieving self-sufficiency and  feeding the population.    And when Commander of the Revolution Juan Almeida Bosque  asked several questions to determine the reliability of the  figures cited, various members of the audience (who were  attending these meetings for the first time) commented, in  typical Cuban style, how "they really take off the gloves and  get down to brass tacks" in these councils.    During these stormy times of cynicism when some people are  so  materialistic and shortsighted that they have stopped believing  in true values, in these times of collapsing societies, morally  destroyed armies, shattered dreams, and forgotten martyrs, what  Armed Forces could maintain their operations and even expand  them with scarce resources unless they were forces of the  people? What Armed Forces could continue to search constantly  for formulas that allow them to improve the living conditions  and diet of everyone, unless they were forces of the people?    What people, unless they were one and the same as the Armed  Forces, could continue fighting with such tenacity to maintain  the country's -- their country's -- defense capabilities,  cognizant of the fact that the day we become incapable of  defending ourselves will be the day we will be absorbed, in a  second, by the eagle that has been coveting us for more than a  century, but not without first staining the soil of the  fatherland with the blood of millions of Cubans?    The Military Council was not the only extraordinary thing.  Even more extraordinary was the realization that, in spite of  all the difficulties, the defense of our children's lives and  future was guaranteed. The most extraordinary thing has been  seeing practical examples of all that we can do to maintain  ourselves and to make progress, even during the Special Period.    The most extraordinary thing -- not because we have been  unaware of the courage of this incredibly extraordinary people,  but because of the chance to bear witness to it once again --  has been seeing even more compelling evidence of the conviction  that victory lies only with us. Anyone who doubts that should  go to Unit 1640.</p>

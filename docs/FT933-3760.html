			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Insurers who need insurance - Diary of a Private Investor I BELIEVE in insurance. My family has medical insurance, car insurance, disability, injury and accident insurance, house and contents insurance, retirement annuity insurance, a whole range of life assurance policies, and insurance linked to various savings plans. We even have legal expenses insurance so we can sue anyone who fails to meet their obligations to us - including insurance companies. But recent events have made me wonder how many of those with which I have done business will still be around in their present form 10 years from now. Last month, I commented on the problems at Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire assurance society. I would not be surprised if a few more companies announce various 'difficulties'. Some appear to be managed incompetently and one wonders what horrors await to be discovered. Will their property holdings suffer the same fate as those of the Church of England commissioners? If there is a sudden market downturn, how many will be able to bail out quickly enough to prevent huge write-downs in the value of their portfolios? How many make losses on foreign currency speculations? Hopefully, my policies are with companies that are safe and secure. But even solid, respectable names have given me cause for some disappointment with the slashing in value of bonus rates on with-profits policies. In January, for instance, Equitable Life estimated that the maturity date payment under one of my policies would, with final bonus included, be Pounds 14,600. By April, that had fallen to Pounds 13,577. Although still a good performance, it was obviously not as good as I had hoped. Many companies have expanded their activities into offering other types of investment product, such as unit trusts. Again, their track record has been mixed. My two daughters were given Pounds 750 and Pounds 500 worth of units in Equitable Life's special situations trust in August 1986. In August this year, with income re-invested, the units were valued at around Pounds 1,005 and Pounds 670 respectively. While this performance is not as bad as many other unit trusts, it is still disappointing, even taking into account that a trust investing in 'special situations' is likely to be much more speculative than one investing in a more general spread of investments. At least it demonstrates the need for careful consideration in choosing investments rather than assuming that, if a company turns in a good performance in one area, it will necessarily do so in others. The insurance market is becoming increasingly competitive. In July, the Treasury ruled that insurance companies would have to tell prospective policy-holders how much commission the sales agent was getting. This should help those mutual assurance companies which do not pay commission to agents. Most do, however. A 25-year mortgage endowment policy with a premium of Pounds 50 a month could produce up-front commission of Pounds 500 to the salesman. Payments this size (and more) could well make many people think twice before choosing an insurance product as a way to save - especially when prospective customers will also have to be told more explicitly about the size of penalties which the company will impose for early surrender. I expect some companies will change some of their commission structures to attract publicity for certain products. But there is little point in choosing a company which pays little or no commission if its operating costs eat away similar sums and/or if its overall investment performance is poor. Also to be considered is the general level of staff competence. If a policy-holder has to wait weeks for a company to sort out its mistakes with his policies or payments, then the cost of the time wasted could easily amount to more than the difference in monetary performance between the company concerned and one of its rivals. The Maxwell affair brought increased attention to the role and duties of pension fund trustees. More independently-minded people and employee representatives are likely to be appointed as company pension fund trustees, and they will be taking an increasingly close interest in the performance of their fund managers. This could lead to a greater movement of funds between insurance companies. It used to be that whichever company was used to set up a pension scheme remained as that fund's manager. But now, if a fund manager fails to perform, the trustees are more likely to consider the possibilities of moving the scheme's management to another company. What effect would this have on some of the smaller companies? If managed funds worth hundreds of millions of pounds were taken away suddenly, what would this do to their cost structures? How many would be prepared to cut staff and costs? And what effect would this have on the bonus rates of mutually owned companies? I expect to see an increase in the number of small mutuals merging with one another or 'de-mutualising' and perhaps being taken over by other companies. In 1989 London Life, with which I have several policies, merged with the Australian Mutual Provident. Another mutual where I have a policy, Scottish Mutual, was taken over by Abbey National in 1992. There has also been a variety of mergers and takeovers in other companies and I expect there will be many more. Unfortunately, these shake-ups do not seem to have made much difference to the attitudes of several mutuals. Boards still seem to be 'self-selected' with policy-holders, who 'own' the companies, getting little opportunity to influence major decisions. Indeed, many of the mutuals do not even bother to send their policy-holder owners copies of their annual reports and details of the annual general meeting. Mutuals should be obliged legally to provide as much information to their owners as public companies must do to their shareholders. While I welcome wholeheartedly the proposals for greater disclosures of commission rates and surrender values, the insurance industry could still do with a bit more shaking up.</p>

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Top bankers by royal appointment: How the Queen helped monetary conference delegates 'walk on air' 'Nice one, knight,' said the chief executive of an American bank to Sir Dennis Weatherstone, the British chairman of the US bank JP Morgan. Sir Dennis was walking down the aisle of a coach full of bankers as it prepared to leave Buckingham Palace, where they had met the Queen. In his speech at the dinner that followed, under the Rubens ceiling of the Banqueting House in Whitehall, Sir Dennis said the assembled heads of the largest banks in the world were 'walking on air' after being greeted by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh on Tuesday night. Few passers-by would have realised that the 300 occupants of the five coaches which had swept down The Mall from the palace were soinfluential. The annual meeting of the International Monetary Conference was on another leg of a discreet journey round the world's financial centres. Last year Stockholm, this year London, next year Seattle. The heads of 103 of the world's largest banks use their annual meetings as an opportunity to discuss their industry and to hobnob in private discussions and at dinners. As they control several trillion dollars in assets between them, they are also used to being treated royally. In Madrid in 1989, they were received by the King and Queen of Spain. The reception at Buckingham Palace was generally held to have topped that. The conference is a meeting for bankers' spouses, too. In practice this means wives, since the heads of the member banks are all male. The partners have a chance to gain some excitement from their marital link to what many privately say is a boring industry. Thus, on Tuesday evening, the chairmen of two European banks were to be found sipping champagne in a palace stateroom, jocularly comparing notes on which bank had a higher return on equity. Their wives were standing nearby discussing the best shops in the world to buy pearls. In spite of its growing international membership, the conference has an American feel, owing to its roots as an organisation formed in the early 1950s by American bankers to educate others in the profession about international finance. The conference has remained a favourite meeting for senior bankers because of its small size. It is easier for heads of banks to find and chat to each other in corridors and at lunches than at the vast annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. The last formal session was chaired by Mr Richard Thomas, chairman and chief executive of First National Bank of Chicago. Like others, Mr Thomas was in a cheerful mood yesterday in spite of the fears over the future of banking expressed during the week. This was because bankers were in a more optimistic frame of mind about their economies than last year although he did not discount the effect of the 'very special' visit to Buckingham Palace. 'I contrast the tone with a year ago, when everyone was very down about unemployment in Europe,' he said. It will not just be Buckingham Palace that may linger in bankers' minds, but a subtle British effort to persuade them that many UK traditions are worth keeping. That was reinforced in a song by the King's Singers, composed for the occasion and sung to the bankers on Tuesday. 'Glory be to the Deutschemark, and to the Yen, but mostly to the holy pound. As it was in the beginning, before all this talk of a single European currency, is now and ever shall be, Amen,' sang the group. The German and French bankers laughed gamely at this harmonised propaganda.</p>

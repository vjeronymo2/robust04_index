			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Zimbabwe's new budget aims to appeal to voters Zimbabwe was presented yesterday with a pro-investment, pro-growth and pro-voter budget that cuts taxes, introduces incentives and narrows the deficit but proposes no significant revenue measures. The budget deficit in the fiscal year to the end of last month was cut to 7.9 per cent of gross domestic product from 11 per cent the previous year. Mr Emmerson Mnangagwa, standing in for Dr Bernard Chidzero, finance minister, who is ill, predicted a further reduction to 5 per cent in the current year. This has been achieved largely by leaving some ZDollars 2.5bn (Pounds 209m) of accumulated parastatal losses off the balance sheet, including ZDollars 1bn needed to finance the country's strategic grain reserve. If these losses are included, the 1993-94 budget deficit rises to some ZDollars 5.5bn or 14 per cent of gross domestic product. The government expects revenue to increase by 21 per cent in the current year to June 1995 and spending by 13 per cent, or less than the likely inflation rate. Despite money supply growth of 40 per cent in the first five months of 1994, the minister was confident that inflation will fall from 23.6 per cent last month to 15 per cent by the end of the year and 10 per cent by mid-1995. He predicted economic growth of 4.4 per cent this year, against 2.1 per cent (revised) in 1993 and 5 per cent next year. Tax changes include a reduction in company tax to 37.5 per cent from 40 per cent (with effect from next April), abolition of import duties on all capital goods imports, a cut in the import surcharge on all items from 15 per cent to 10 per cent, and the first significant attempt to adjust personal tax rates for inflation. The only tax increases are higher duties on opaque (traditional) beer and soft drinks, although Mr Mnangagwa said he would widen the 10 per cent sales tax to cover all services other than exempt activities to be announced later. Business will welcome creation of a cabinet committee on privatisation charged with moving swiftly to privatise or commercialise parastatals, and the announcement that the government expects to earn extra revenue this year from the sale of unspecified assets. Less encouraging is the failure to cut defence spending, despite promises by President Robert Mugabe. It will rise by nearly 11 per cent this year, but its share of the total budget falls slightly to 9.5 per cent from 9.7 per cent. Education takes the lion's share of the budget with more than 20 per cent, while interest charges will absorb 18 per cent. For the first time, too, a Zimbabwe finance minister acknowledged the country's debt trap problem. Mr Mnangagwa said the country was now in the 'paradoxical' situation of having to borrow to meet interest payments. While there is much in the budget that is positive, the fiscal situation remains unhealthy with national debt rising 28 per cent in the last year alone to Dollars 3.5bn.</p>

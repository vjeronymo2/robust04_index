			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 14 (YONHAP) -- The Korea Maritime and  Port Administration (KMPA) has decided against opening a direct  regular sea route between South and North Korea for the time  being, a KMPA official said Saturday.    The official said, "we do not have to hurry in establishing  a  regular sea route directly connecting South and North Korea, and  we don't have any reasons either. Unless the North Korean  authorities guarantee the safety of South Korean ships and crew,  we won't allow the establishment (of the route)."    Seoul and Pyongyang agreed earlier that inter-Korean sea  routes are not between two different nations but within one  country, he said.    "It is a cabotage route. So we will prohibit foreign  shipping companies from operating on the route," he said.    Under the decision, domestic shippers which operate joint  ventures with foreign companies plying between South and North  Korea should change the ventures to domestic corporations,  according to the KMPA officials.    Companies which are pushing for new sea routes to and from  North Korea will have to concentrate on non-regular routes  transporting common cargo, not on regular routes carrying  containers, the officials said.    "A regular inter-Korean route should be established after  South and North Korean authorities agree to adopt systematic  safety measures. That is the government's policy. If North  Korea officially guarantees the safety of South Korean ships and  crew, the establishment of a direct and regular sea route to  North Korea will become possible anytime," an official said.    But South Korean ships can still depart for North Korea on  non- regular direct routes authorized by the National  Unification Board and the KMPA, according to the official.    "The government will actively support cargo transport to  revitalize inter-Korean economic exchanges," he added.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 18 KYODO -- Another five House of  Representatives members quit the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)  on Monday to launch a new parliamentary group aimed at  reorganizing the political structure in Japan.    The defections bring to 11 the number of lower house members  who have quit the LDP in four days.    Those who defected from the LDP on Monday are Koji Kakizawa,  Seiichi Ota, Shokei Arai, Taku Yamamoto and Shizuo Sato.    The five told a news conference they plan to set up a new  parliamentary group soon with two independent lower house  members.    Riki Nakamura, an independent, dissolved a parliamentary  affiliation with the LDP to join the group and another  independent, Sanae Takaichi, is also planning to join them, they  said.    "We decided to quit to accelerate the current development by  our action," Kakizawa said at the press conference. Kakizawa  and the other four who quit the LDP on Monday have backed former  Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe as a replacement for outgoing  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who announced on April 8 he  will resign over a financial scandal and a Diet stalemate.    Kakizawa said the seven will call on other LDP lawmakers to  join their group so as to realize their policies together.    Five other LDP lower house members who quit the party  Friday,  formed a new party Monday called New Party Mirai (Future).    Another LDP lower house member, Kenji Kosaka, also left the  party Monday, saying he will join Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party], a key party in the coalition.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "sm": "Installation Constructers Hope for </F> Large-Scale Orders"]    [Excerpts] Bonn, 31 January -- Economic relations will be  the focal issue of a four-day visit to Germany by Indian Prime  Minister Narasimha Rao to begin on Wednesday [2 February].  German companies hope this visit will support their efforts to  get large-scale orders from India. In return, Rao is working  for German investment on the subcontinent.    One of the central issues of the talks in Bonn is the  participation of German companies in expanding the power supply  in India. This involves orders worth double-digit billion sums.  Yesterday, Indian Energy Minister Salve explained to leading  German installation constructors in Bonn his government's plans  for expanding the energy supply. According to him, new  construction is planned of seven conventional power stations  with a capacity of 5,500 megawatts and an investment of 12  billion German marks. In addition, seven existing power  stations are to be modernized, that is, to be equipped with  modern environmental technology. Furthermore, it is planned to  expand India's mains distribution. [passage omitted]    During his visit to Bonn, Rao will take time for a  "German-Indian economic conference," and for individual talks  with the directors of Hoechst, BASF, Mercedes, and Siemens as  well as with Volkswagen chief Ferdinand Piech.    The political talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Foreign  Minister Klaus Kinkel, and Social Democratic Party Chairman  Rudolf Scharping will focus primarily on coordinating a joint  route toward the goal of the two countries getting permanent  seats on the UN Security Council. The Germans will also be  urging India to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.</p>

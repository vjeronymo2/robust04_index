			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Forte dispute poised to resume - Two sides begin talks on who will take over the chair at Savoy THE DISPUTE between Forte and the Savoy group could resume today as the two sides begin discussions over who should take over the leadership of the Savoy's hotels. Forte is expected to resist strongly any attempt to elevate Mr Giles Shepard, Savoy's managing director, to the chairmanship when the Savoy board meets today. Forte is also expected to oppose any move to make Mr John Kemp-Welch, joint senior partner at Cazenove, the chairman. Both parties refused to comment. Mr Rocco Forte, Forte's chairman, and Mr Donald Main, the group's finance director, both sit on the Savoy board. An acrimonious 1980s takeover battle left Forte with a majority of Savoy shares but a minority of voting shares. Sir Anthony Tuke, Savoy's current chairman, is expected to retire in May next year. Both sides regard him as having been even-handed. Forte is thought to oppose the appointment of Mr Shepard or Mr Kemp-Welch on the grounds that they have been too closely associated with Savoy. Forte's favoured candidate is thought to be Sir Michael Richardson, chairman of brokers Smith New Court. The two sides are believed to be closer in their candidate to be chief executive: both favour Mr Willi Bauer, chief executive of the Wentworth golf and country club group. Mr Bauer, former general manager of the Savoy, held talks with Forte during the summer about becoming the head of the Forte Exclusive portfolio of hotels, which includes the Hyde Park in London, the George V in Paris and the Ritz in Madrid. Mr Bauer said he decided not to take the Forte job because it would have required too much foreign travel. Running the Savoy group, whose hotels also include Claridge's and the Connaught, would involve less foreign travel than the Forte job. Although Mr Forte and Mr Bauer clashed strongly during Forte's bid for the Savoy, their recent discussions are said to have been amicable. Mr Bauer was unavailable for comment. He is believed, however, to have been approached by the Savoy. He dined at Claridge's with Mr Shepard last Sunday night. Under an agreement between the two parties, Forte has said it will give 12 months notice of its intention to bid for Savoy. The right to give notice began at the beginning of this month. As it is a rolling 12-month period, it will be difficult for Forte to activate, as giving notice would probably result in an increase in the Savoy share price.</p>

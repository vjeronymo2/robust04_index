			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: How the seven wise men saw the chancellor's performance Andrew Britton National Institute of Economic and Social Research The main interest is on the public spending side. Some reforms of social security were inevitable, but the changes to invalidity and unemployment benefits will cause real hardship unless the economy expands more rapidly in the medium term than we now expect. In the short term the cuts in public spending were not properly explained, and may be hard to achieve. On the tax side the measures were well chosen, but in my view there was no need for tax increases on this scale. There is no need to eliminate the PSBR; borrowing should match public investment in an average year. Tim Congdon Lombard Research The surprise of the Budget was the large reduction in public spending numbers. The spending total for 1994/95 is Pounds 3 1/2 bn below previous plans. There are two reasons. First, the inflation assumption for 1994/95 has been reduced from 4 per cent to 3 1/4 per cent. Secondly, the Treasury has cut the 'contingency reserve' in existing plans, from Pounds 7bn to Pounds 3 1/2 bn. The tax rises announced from 1994/95 were actually less than had been expected at Pounds 1 3/4 bn. However, a number of further measures are being phased in 1995/96, bring the total increase to nearly Pounds 5bn. Overall, the Budget should be welcomed by financial markets. David Currie London Business School Mr Clarke's first unified budget is politically highly astute. He has skilfully defused the household fuel VAT row. As the London Business School predicted in October, he has taken advantage of lower inflation and the public pay freeze to cut public spending, with tough curbs on social security. This, together with the absence of measures against the pensions industry, will please the markets, but it will prove hard to hit the new public spending targets beyond next year if inflation picks up. The further reduction in mortgage tax relief, the modest extension of the tax base, the action on tax avoidance and the introduction of road charges all make good economic sense. Gavyn Davies Goldman Sachs International Although it takes some calculated risk with the recovery next year, the macro-economic measures in this Budget are quite brave and generally sensible. The overall measures represent another necessary reversal of the inappropriate budgetary easing in the second half of the 1980s. Some of the tightening comes through lower public spending, which is partly the result of declines in the contingency reserve, and will anyway be hard to achieve in a re-election period. Nevertheless, this package should ensure both that the public sector debt position is sustainable, and that the dangerous rund down in net public sector assets will end by 1997/98. Professor Wynne Godley Cambridge University I think the forecast is seriously incoherent because the projections of the financial deficit looks inconsistent with the forecast for the balance of payments and private savings. It projects a financial deficit of about Pounds 55bn this year which must be about 8.5 per cent of GNP while the balance of payments is said to be only 1.5 per cent. I think the Budget judgment is probably along the right lines because such expansion as we have seen is ill-structured and clearly based on the consumer. But I think it will bring any expansion to an end. Professor Patrick Minford Liverpool University This is a skilful Budget which has moved public spending control back to the centre of the budgetary process - justifying the unified Budget. The emphasis on public spending and reform of the welfare state is the most important element: more detail will be needed and more reforms to build on the start made here. On the revenue side it was right to defer the extra burdens to 1995-96 and to avoid raising any of the key marginal tax rates. The measures to broaden the tax base and reduce mortgage interest relief are particularly welcome. It is probable that the Treasury's PSBR projections are too pessimistic, so that it should be possible to reduce marginal tax rates before the next election. Andrew Sentance Confederation of British Industry It was a skilful Budget which reduces public borrowing convincingly without damaging short term recovery prospects. I think the particular points I would welcome are the lower public spending plans; the fairly modest short-term impact and the fact that he has avoided significant tax increases on business. However, if we take this together with the March budget the government's fiscal policy will take a lot of spending power out of the economy and it might be necessary to reduce interest rates further to sustain recovery. The lower public borrowing justifies some further reduction.</p>

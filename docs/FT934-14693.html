			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Technology: Up again from a knockout / A look at recent innovations in anaesthetics, in a series on drug discoveries A new generation of anaesthetics is helping to create a revolution in operating theatres. Micro-surgery, together with innovative anaesthetics that allow for rapid post-operative recovery, have led to a surge in the number of patients able to return home on the same day as their operation. Minimally-invasive surgery, using lasers and fibre optics through small keyhole incisions, means patients no longer have such serious wounds to heal. The rapid-recovery anaesthetics mean they are awake more quickly and feel better when they regain consciousness. Only 10 years ago, very little surgery was conducted on a same-day basis. Now, 58 per cent of general anaesthetics administered in the US are on an out-patient basis, according to BOC, the British group which is one of the leaders in this field. Among European countries, Ireland and the UK make the greatest use of day-care surgery, although its practice is a long way behind the US. Recent reforms in Germany which mean hospitals are paid by the number of patients operated on, rather than the length of stay in hospital should encourage the use of new anaesthetics, according to Zeneca, the recently floated bioscience operation of Imperial Chemical Industries. Routine surgery conducted this way includes operations to remove the gall-bladder, non-cardiac vascular surgery, gynaecological procedures, hernia repairs and operations on knees and ankles. This type of production-line surgery is fast and highly cost-effective. Roger Stoll, chief executive of BOC Health Care, explains: 'Cost containment in healthcare is taking place everywhere - the US, Japan, Europe. The cost-effectiveness of products is becoming as important as their efficacy and safety. That is having an impact in all therapeutic areas, and particularly in the operating theatre.' Andrew Bilsky, product information manager at Zeneca, adds: 'Rapid recovery from anaesthesia means fewer nurses are required for post-operative care, more operations can be conducted and patients return home more quickly. They also get back to work and are economically productive that much more quickly.' The market for anaesthetics is in transition, partly because of the change-over from the older products that caused considerable nausea and vomiting to newer ones, such as BOC's inhaled anaesthetic Suprane and Zeneca's intravenous product Diprivan. It is also being affected by the expiry of US patents for BOC's Forane, one the most widely-used gases among the older anaesthetics. Forane had a market share of about 70 per cent in the US and 50 per cent in Europe. In the first six months of 1993, the US market for inhaled anaesthetics declined by 4 per cent to Dollars 92m (Pounds 60m). Sales of Forane (the patents of which expired in January) fell from Dollars 44m for the six months to June 1992 to Dollars 27.3m. A generic version of Forane, known as isoflurane, was launched by Abbott of the US in January and has captured a 22.7 per cent market share with sales to June of Dollars 21m. Meanwhile, the US intravenous anaesthetic market was worth about Dollars 71m during the first six months this year. Diprivan, with sales of Dollars 58m, was up by 44 per cent on the same period last year; Zeneca's drug held a market share of about 81 per cent. Diprivan's worldwide sales were Pounds 95m up to June, and brokers Goldman Sachs expect them to reach Pounds 375m a year in 1996. The objectives of anaesthesia are complex. Anaesthetics must enter the brain and produce not only a profound sleep but also sedation to prevent movement and to cause muscle relaxation and analgesia - the absence of pain - at sufficient levels to leave the brain and body unaffected by surgery. The exact way inhaled general anaesthetics work remains unclear. 'It's a mystery still to be solved and there are a few Nobel prizes to be picked up for this one,' says Iain Glen, a clinical scientist at Zeneca. The problem is that there is no single target for drugs to create anaesthesia. There have been two theories about how they work. The first, which has recently been questioned by Nick Franks and Bill Lieb of Imperial College, London, was that anaesthetics produced their effect by acting on the fat layers on nerve membranes. These fat layers surround proteins that act as channels for ions to pass through the membrane. The movement of positive and negatively-charged ions is critical for electrical transmission from one nerve to another. However, Franks and Lieb have recently shown that anaesthetics have little impact on the fat levels, but rather directly bind with the proteins. To prove this, they experimented on North American fireflies. Fireflies contain a class of proteins known as luciferase enzymes which are both light-emitting and susceptible to anaesthetics. After administering anaesthetics, the fireflies stopped flashing, demonstrating that the drug was working directly on the protein. Luciferase is unconnected with anaesthesia but the experiments show that anaesthetics can bind to a protein and inhibit its biological function. The action of intravenous agents such as Diprivan is even less understood. Most probably, they stimulate chlorine channels, allowing negative ions into the cells. This prevents the cells becoming charged positively, which is required for electrical transmission between the nerves. Meanwhile, a contest is shaping up between the recently launched quick recovery products. The battleground is the market for out-patient surgery, which is equivalent to about half of the anaesthetic market by value. As for future developments, since the exact mechanism of anaesthesia is still unknown, the most immediate research is likely to use the traditional methods of screening rather than deliberate design. Zeneca looked at 5,000 compounds to find 300 with any effect, of which only one - Diprivan - was safe. Similarly, BOC tested more than 500 molecules to find Suprane. 'Since the mechanisms are so poorly understood, it is difficult to improve on what we have,' says Glen. Both Zeneca and BOC are looking for drugs that have fewer side-effects on the cardiovascular system. BOC is looking for a compound that is more effective in children - Suprane is pungent and children do not like the smell. Meanwhile, other companies are developing compounds. Glaxo is developing a short-acting analgesic that can also be used for anaesthesia. The drug, remifentanil, is in the same class as morphine and heroin, but can be metabolised rapidly. This, Glaxo believes, will allow the drug's activity to be turned on and off quickly, and so be used in day-case surgery. Remifentanil will be registered with regulatory authorities in two to three years. In 1990, Maruishi Pharmaceutical launched its inhalation anaesthetic Sevofrane in Japan where it captured 50 per cent of the domestic market. The group has licensed the product to Abbott. Whatever developments occur in anaesthesia, the speed at which surgeons operate will remain critical. In the early 19th century surgeons had to be quick because no anaesthetics were available - three minutes for an amputation was a decent record. Now, with the benefits of micro-surgery and innovative anaesthetics, they have to be quick to increase throughput and reduce costs. The series continues next month with an article on contraceptives.

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / World Trade News: US test for a 'dead fish' theory - Uruguay Round ratification brings Congress another 'crisis' As that unschooled baseballer Yogi Berra might have said, it was deja vu all over again when last week House Speaker Tom Foley warned that Congress faced 'a very real crisis' over ratification of the Uruguay Round international trade deal. Nine months ago it was the North American Free Trade Agreement that was in jeopardy. Then President Bill Clinton's administration put allits efforts into securing Nafta passage; impassioned presidential speeches, a vice-presidential debate, and a frantic round of political horse-trading ended in a stunning victory two months later. Although President Clinton's power to pull off more victories ought not be under-estimated, passage this year of the implementing legislation for the Gatt agreement now seems almost as improbable as did the Nafta victory last year. Obstacles to passage seem to be mounting instead of shrinking. Mr Foley and his colleagues see as the chief impediment the need to raise Dollars 10bn-Dollars 14bn over the next five years and perhaps as much as Dollars 40bn over the next decade to compensate for the tariff revenue lost under the Uruguay Round deal. Budget rules require this to be done either by programme cuts or taxes. The alternative is a congressional waiver to be granted on the grounds that the US would raise more revenue through increased trade than it would lose by the tariff cuts. A waiver must garner 60 votes in the Senate and a majority in the House; that alone would be a formidable but not impossible task. 'If we do a waiver, the press will instantly say the Clinton administration is abandoning its focus on fiscal discipline. The long bond will go up another  3/4 of a point,' an administration official said. Neither Republicans nor Democrats have been able to agree among themselves about whether or how to cut programmes or raise fees. So the administration sent Congress a list of possible actions which included a 4 per cent revenue tax on radio and television stations, a Dollars 3.1bn cut in farm programmes, a Dollars 600m gambling tax, a Dollars 500m tax on parking space fringe benefits and Dollars 200m for taxing chemicals under clean air rules. It is, a long-time Washington lawyer said, 'a parade of horribles, designed to get everyone mad' - or in the waiver camp. Passage of the Uruguay Round deal faces other formidable obstacles. Business has been distracted by the need to lobby over renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation trading status. Lobbyists complain about chaos in the administration's policy-making and lack of vision; the president has yet to announce if or what kind of 'fast track' negotiating authority he will seek. There are worries that the influential Congressman Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House ways and means committee, will be indicted for criminal misuse of funds and have to step aside at a crucial time for passage of trade legislation, health insurance and welfare reform. There is strong Republican opposition to Gatt's subsidies agreement that legitimises government aid for research and development, regional development and environmental compliance. Angriest of all is Missouri Senator John Danforth, who represents the aircraft manufacturer McDonnell Douglas, which has been hurt by subsidies to Airbus, the European aircraft consortium. He says he will oppose the Gatt deal unless the administration organises a side agreement, signed by the EU, Canada and Japan, which would limit subsidies. The round's most committed foes, led by Mr Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate, argue that the new World Trade Organisation, the more permanent successor to Gatt, threatens US sovereignty on trade matters. That charge cuts across the political spectrum and appeals to arch-conservatives such as Congressman Newt Gingrich, the House minority whip. A ruling this week against the US by a Gatt dispute settlement panel gives the opposition new ammunition. The decision found that US actions to protect dolphins under US Marine Mammal Protection Act are inconsistent with Gatt. 'It was helpful for Gatt to reveal its hand again and make vividly clear what is in store for US environmental and consumer laws,' said Ms Lori Wallach of Mr Nader's Public Citizen. 'Many laws will be found Gatt-illegal and then Congress must either eliminate the laws or face perpetual trade sanctions.' Mr Kantor's response to the panel decision was to complain about Gatt secrecy and demand that all the relevant documents in the case be made public. Ms Wallach issued a derisive response about 'Gatt spin control' which concluded that 'releasing the documents now is too late to affect the legal and political reality of the Gatt ruling'. Partly out of fear that opposition will just harden if there is a delay, the administration is trying to repeat its Nafta triumph. No cabinet member lets a speech go by without plugging the Gatt deal. Ms Wallach sees this as confirmation of her 'dead fish' theory. 'If you have a dead fish, you want to get it out of the sun as soon as possible before it begins to stink,' she argues. 'This Gatt deal is the biggest dead fish to hit Congress in a long time.'</p>

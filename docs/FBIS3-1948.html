			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Yang Liu (2799 2692): "China Has </F> Achieved Initial Results in the Peaceful Use of Nuclear Energy  and Ranks Among the World's Major Nuclear Technology Powers"]    [Text] A specialist in nuclear power from China has  pointed out that the development of nuclear power is the best  way to solve the problem of the long-standing power shortage in  the coastal economically developed areas of China. China is  planning to build a second nuclear power plant in Guangdong and  to carry out the second phase in the construction of the Qinshan  Nuclear Power Plant in Zhejiang. China's nuclear power  departments are also planning to build several nuclear power  plants in Liaoning, Shandong, Jiangsu, Fujian, and other coastal  areas.    During an interview with a MING PAO reporter yesterday, a  person in charge of a certain design institute in China's  nuclear industry said that his institute will help design a  third nuclear power plant in Guangdong. (It has been reported  that Lingao in the vicinity of Daya Bay has been selected as the  plant site.)    The nuclear specialist said that the second nuclear power  plant in Guangdong will use large generating units. There are  currently two different plans and views regarding the installed  capacity of Guangdong's third nuclear power plant (that is, the  Yangjiang Nuclear Power Plant). Some specialists want to  install four 900,000 kw generating units, while others think  that it is advisable to first install four 600,000 kw generating  units. The specific plan for the Yangjiang Nuclear Power Plant  has not yet been determined.    He also said that the second phase of the construction of  China's Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant includes the construction of  two 600,000 kw generating units. Most of the equipment will be  made in China, but some of it may be imported. Since it  officially started generating electricity and sending  electricity to the power grids many years ago, the 300,000 kw  generating unit of the first phase construction of the Qinshan  Nuclear Power Plant has been operating smoothly. The entire  plant was designed by Chinese specialists.    He continued to say that, at present, the electricity  supplied by thermal power plants accounts for more than 80  percent of the total amount of electricity generated.  Hydropower ranks second. The amount of electricity supplied by  nuclear power plants accounts for only a very small portion. If  the two 900,000 kw generating units of the Daya Bay Nuclear  Power Plant -- which will begin operating in June -- are  included, China's total installed capacity of nuclear power  plants is only 2.1 million kw.    Most of China's coal mines are distributed in areas north of  the Huang He, and hydropower resources in the southwest and  northwest. The eastern coastal areas, which account for more  than two-thirds of the output value of China's national economy,  have been suffering electricity shortages for quite some time.  Transporting coal from the north to the south and transmitting  electricity (hydropower) from the west to the east can only  solve part of the problem. Therefore, the development of nuclear  power is the best option; it is the most economical and causes  less pollution.    An official from the State Nuclear Accident Emergency Office  told MING PAO that stringent checks are carried out in the  selection of the plant site and on the design when building a  nuclear plant. He said that, since the first phase of the  project of the Daya Bay Nuclear Plant was put into operation,  the Hong Kong Royal Observatory and China's astronomical  departments have not observed anything abnormal in their tests.    He said that, as compared with the successful experience of  the west, China is at present one of several countries which  have mastered nuclear technology. China has many talented  people and it is only natural for it to develop nuclear power.</p>

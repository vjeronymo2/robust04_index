			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Off your bike, Mr Patten AFTER LAST week's humiliating election defeats for the government, the prime minister promised to pay more attention to the concerns of the electorate. Close to the top of Mr Major's priorities should be the fiasco over the testing of schoolchildren in England and Wales and indeed there were hints last night that Mr Major might be ready to consider a tactical retreat on this summer's tests. Two opinion polls yesterday indicated that teachers who are boycotting the tests have succeeded in winning public support for their action. A compromise is urgently needed to end the threatened confusion in schools while preserving the government's aim of improving standards through regular testing. The opinion poll results make salutary reading for ministers. One showed that 62 per cent of parents wanted this year's tests abandoned, while 51 per cent supported the teachers' boycott of the new tests. The other found that 62 per cent of all adults accepted the unions' argument that the tests are too complicated and time-consuming. Over three-quarters believed the tests had been introduced too hastily - including 63 per cent of Conservative voters. It is not that the government has lost the basic argument over tests; both polls show support for the idea of regular testing. Mr John Patten, the education secretary, therefore seems to have pulled off a remarkable coup in uniting so many against the English tests to be introduced this summer for 14-year-olds. In addition to alienating the teachers, the parents and the general public, he has lost the support of independent schools, governors and managers, and even two of his own advisers on testing. Hidden agenda Despite the breadth of opposition, Mr Patten promises to persevere with the testing timetable. He rightly accuses some opponents of having a hidden agenda which is opposed to compulsory testing. He rejects the calls of those who want the extension of testing suspended until the completion of the review of the national curriculum by Sir Ron Dearing. He says that people riding bicycles fall off if they stop pedalling, a tempting analogy but unfortunately not a pertinent one in the circumstances. For in continuing to pedal so vigorously, Mr Patten threatens to cycle over a cliff and destroy the testing bicycle altogether. With the united opposition of all six teachers' unions, there is little chance of the tests taking place in enough schools to validate comparisons based on them. Some heads and teachers will make efforts to stage the tests. So, too, will some governing bodies and education authorities. The consequence will be to sour relationships with teachers who are boycotting the tests, to little educational purpose. There may also be a further loss of confidence in the policy among parents. Tactical retreat Worse, the boycott of the tests for 14-year-olds threatens to spread to the tests for seven-year-olds. These are in their third year, and appear to be running smoothly after initial teething troubles. By refusing to call off the tests at 14, the government risks losing the worthwhile progress made on tests at seven. The most important task now facing ministers is to build a consensus on testing which can command the support of all but the most die-hard opponents of tests. It would be hard to come up with proposals for externally moderated tests which would win the support of the most militant teaching unions. But it should be possible to win back the support of the moderate Association of Teachers and Lecturers and the head teachers' unions - not to mention testing advisers, governors and, of course, parents. It is time, therefore for a tactical retreat on testing for 14-year-olds. Time is needed to devise less unwieldy tests confined to the aim of allowing parents to judge the performance of schools rather than providing nationwide comparisons of individual student performance. Ideally those tests would be ready for 1994, so that the testing timetable slipped by only one year. But more important than a timetable is the requirement for tests which command the support of most, if not all, of the constituencies with an interest in raising the standards of education in Britain's schools.</p>

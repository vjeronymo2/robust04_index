			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Rate cut hopes help Stockholm up 2.5% to peak Most of the senior markets continued their downward movement, writes Our Markets Staff. STOCKHOLM finished 2.5 per cent ahead at a record high with unusually strong demand spurring turnover to an all-time peak. The Affarsvarlden index rose 37.7 to 1,545.9 in turnover of SKr3.94bn. Mr Peter Tron of Unibank said that selective buying of index heavyweights and expectations of an interest rate cut by the Riksbank on Thursday were behind the rise. The advance was a continuation of last week's rally and followed a strong performance throughout last year. Bikuben Securities, which believes that Stockholm has the potential to be the Scandinavian outperformer this year, says that rises will be based on lower interest rates and corporate earnings growth, which is a direct result of the depreciation of the local currency. Among issues hitting new highs, Volvo B shares soared SKr31 to SKr658 in heavy trade, partly on revised earnings forecasts by brokerages and upbeat press comment. Strong US demand pushed Ericsson SKr29 higher to SKr379. Forest sector shares showed the biggest gains, backed by news that prices on several key products will be raised during the spring. MoDo, the pulp and paper group leapt SKr22 to SKr345, while Stora, Europe's largest forest products group, added SKr25 to SKr467. FRANKFURT was modestly lower across the board pressured by a 1.8 per cent loss in Daimler, down DM15 at DM805. The DAX index eased 4.44 to 2,137.38, but retreated sharply in the after market, with the Ibis indicated index losing a further 35.5 to 2,115.56. Turnover was DM8.8bn. Kleinwort Benson, in its latest European handbook, notes that it is now recommending an overweight position in France relative to Germany. This assessment is based on the view that Germany remains vulnerable to a withdrawal of US money, while French corporate earnings are less vulnerable to downgrades than German companies. Metallgesellschaft was the day's major winner, coming back DM27 or 12.6 per cent to DM241 following the successful outcome of weekend talks among the creditor banks. Another of last week's losers, Siemens, eased DM1.00 to DM720.50. Commerzbank firmed DM1.80 to DM376.50 on news of a tie-up with Winterthur Insurance of Switzerland. ZURICH finished firmer but off earlier highs after news about the Los Angeles earthquake made for uncertain trading. The SMI index added 20.5 to 3,011 after an earlier high of 3,026.7. Insurers were especially hit by news of the earthquake, with Swiss Re registered shares falling SFr14 to SFr690. However, Winterthur registered shares, which were sought on news about the venture with Commerzbank, ended SFr9 firmer at SFr786, but off an earlier high at 805. Shares in SMH continued their recovery which began late last week. The registered shares surged SFr10 to SFr210, and the bearer added SFr29 to SFr979. Elsewhere in industrials, Alusuisse registered shares added SFr11 or 1.8 per cent to SFr632 and Holderbank bearers rose SFr40 or 4.4 per cent to SFr943. PARIS weakened steadily during the afternoon in line with Germany so that the CAC-40 index ended 27.47 down at 2,234.78. Turnover eased to FFr4.5bn from FFr5.5bn. Outside of the index Eurotunnel dipped FFr2.90 to FFr50.70 on reports that UK and French construction companies are claiming up to Pounds 1bn which they claim has been unpaid by the tunnel operator. AMSTERDAM was helped higher by a substantial gain seen in Boskalis, although volume in the stock was reported to have been low, the shares rising Fl 3.00 or 6.4 per cent to Fl 49.50. The AEX index gained 2.31 to 422.93. In contrast BolsWessanen slipped Fl 1.10 to Fl 44.80 as some investors reacted negatively to results which came out at the end of last week. MILAN made a confident start to the new monthly account with the weekend announcement that elections will be held on March 27 resolving a major political uncertainty. The Comit index rose 12.44 or 2.1 per cent to 615.30. Montedison led the charge amongst blue chips, gaining nearly L52.70 or 5.7 per cent to L961.70 in massive volume of 155.7m shares. Olivetti also gained sharply, up L102 to L2,267 on speculation about its chances of winning the race for Italy's second cellular telephone licence, bidding for which closed on Saturday. Elsewhere, optimism over the IMI privatisation helped sentiment but Banca Commerciale Italiana dipped L37 to L4,738 amid arbitrage selling ahead of its planned privatisation set for late February.

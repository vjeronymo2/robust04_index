			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / US pollsters seek clues from the past: Truman and Major won from behind; why can't Bush? GOVERNOR Clinton never really had much of a chance in the election of '92. He was a bit parochial, inexperienced and taking on a reasonably popular incumbent. Some southern and border states liked him, but it was never enough. That Clinton was George, the Democratic-Republican governor of New York, the year was 1792, and his opponent was Vice President John Adams. Clinton later served two terms, from 1805 to 1812, as vice president, but the precedent of 200 years ago does not run much beyond the coincidence of surnames and gubernatorial jobs. More recent precedents are being sought for this year's race. Since the war, five seem particularly popular points of reference - the US elections of 1948, 1976, 1980 and 1988, and the British election held last April. Each hold hope, in some cases embraced by both President George Bush and Governor Bill Clinton, for this year's outcome. Mr Bush has made much of the 1948 comparison with Harry Truman's come-from-behind victory over the complacent Governor Thomas Dewey, forgetting that Truman was a Democrat and the 'do nothing' congress that was the object of his discontent was run by Republicans. But the wind was taken out of that proposition by some acid comments by Margaret Truman Daniel, the late president's daughter, who could find nothing in common between her down-to-earth father and the patrician Mr Bush. Equally, Mr Clinton has also invoked the memory of Truman and, though he may be nervous about his current lead, he is not acting complacently. 1976 has messages for both sides. The obvious comparison is between a southern technocratic Democratic governor, not initially well known, starting the home stretch well ahead of an incumbent, though unelected, Republican president but in the end managing only a narrow victory. With, presumably, a debate again in the offing, it is salutary to remember President Gerald Ford's critical mistake in a San Francisco debate, about Soviet hegemony over Poland, because he was at the time catching up fast. In 1980, Mr Carter had a Middle East triumph (Camp David) under his belt but was not generally well regarded and was saddled with the hostages in Iran and an economy in a mess, all of which except the hostages apply to Mr Bush today. But that race was very tight (which this year's is not at present) until the only debate of the campaign, in which Ronald Reagan decisively reassured a sceptical public that he was not as extreme as some of his statements implied. Mr Clinton could nail down this victory in debate in similar fashion. The lesson of four years ago is principally that character assassination can work. But the hatchet job on Mr Michael Dukakis was launched not long after the Democratic convention, whereas this year the Bush campaign, for all its assault on Mr Clinton over the draft, has been tardy in coming up with the same sort of tightly focused, negative attack advertising. The difference is that Mr Bush might have won anyway in 1988, when the objective circumstances of the election, especially the state of the economy, were far more favourable to him. Also, Mr Clinton may be an easier target on personal grounds, but is much more resilient and combative than the passive Mr Dukakis. Much has been made of this year's British precedent. The principal attraction, from a Republican standpoint, is that both the polls and the media, which had freely predicted a Labour victory, were confounded. However, the British election featured more than two main parties, which, unless Ross Perot gets back in with a vengeance, is not a complication in the US. However, there are other points of comparison. Both economies were performing badly; both incumbents led parties in power for over a decade; both opposition leaders had dragged their leftish parties into the centre and had policy proposals to 'soak the rich' through higher taxes. On the other hand, Mr John Major was a relatively new face, which President Bush is not, while Mr Clinton is and Mr Neil Kinnock was not. Mr Clinton has also had the wit to set his plans for higher taxes, whatever Republicans may charge to the contrary, at a far higher income level than the British Labour party. Still, in painting Mr Clinton as 'a social engineer' educated in that cradle of foreign socialism, Oxford University, Mr Bush is borrowing a leaf from the Tory book, while conveniently not mentioning that both he and Mr Clinton also attended Yale. The name of the game is to scare the more affluent suburban populace about the challenger. In the British case, targeting the south of England, it worked, but the US is a much bigger place. A common thread of the US electoral comparisons is the insider-outsider contrast. Harry Truman, though president, campaigned in part against the Washington establishment, as did candidates Carter and Reagan and Vice President Bush. Though he has spent the last 26 years on one government payroll or another, Mr Bush this year is also running against Washington, not only its Democrats but even its civil servants, whom he heads and whose pay he would cut if he does not fire a third of them. Mr Clinton, however, is a believer that government can, and should be, good. He may have started his long run as an outsider but he increasingly looks like the reverse, not surprisingly since government, though not in Washington, has been virtually his only career. The final point of comparison is the state of the economy in the election years. Some economists, such as Professor Ray Fair of Princeton, have political models which show that economic performance is always the greatest determinant in presidential elections. Until the summer, most of them tended to point to Mr Bush's re-election. In 1948, the state of the economy was not a decisive millstone for President Truman. In 1976 the US was emerging still slowly from the 1974-75 recession, enabling Mr Carter to coin the term 'misery index' (the sum of inflation and unemployment) - which Mr Reagan tellingly turned against him in 1980, when it had doubled. Four years ago, the expansion was still proceeding. This year recovery remains a mirage, as it was in Britain in April, and still is. In 1792, of course, nobody had the nerve to run against George Washington.</p>

			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Rogues on the run: Havens are available to fugitives with cash Whatever the outcome of his flight from Britain three weeks ago, Mr Asil Nadir looks set to go down in the history books among a long list of fugitive businessmen who have eluded the arm of the law. Ensconced in the sunlit fastness of northern Cyprus, the former chairman of Polly Peck International might ponder the experiences of others who have swapped the world of high finance for lives removed from the limelight. Jabez Spencer Balfour, a notorious 19th-century British fraudster, escaped to Argentina but was brought back to stand trial in 1895. He was given a 14-year sentence to punish what the judge called 'a long career of cold-blooded villainy by which he has ruined thousands of humble and happy homes'. Staying beyond the reach of police and judiciary requires stamina, cash and top-level contacts, as well as expert knowledge of extradition laws. A small, secretive industry of companies tracks down fugitives. The work can be risky. 'People in hiding can play hard-ball,' says one UK accountant involved in this area. 'There are some you definitely do not want to go after without protection.' 'You're dealing with sophisticated individuals,' says Mr John Conyngham, managing director of the UK arm of Kroll Associates, the New York-based corporate investigations company. Mr Conyngham says the refusal of some countries to extradite their own nationals can pose problems. Mr Ted Clements, executive director for consulting and investigations at the London office of the California-based Pinkerton's security group, specialises in unravelling cross-border financial transactions. These can be exotic: Pinkerton's UK operation is considering helping the Russian government track down 500 tonnes of missing Czarist gold. One worry for absconders is that the number of countries offering firm protection is shrinking. China, for instance, has tried conspicuously to help international justice authorities, part of its efforts to collaborate with the west. Spain's Costa del Sol used to be a favourite haunt for suspected criminals, but the Spanish authorities have now become more helpful on extradition. 'If the paperwork is put to them, they are more co-operative,' says Mr David Sherwin, head of fraud investigations and risk management at accountants Ernst &amp; Young. Yet there are still plenty of havens. Governments in the Gulf, for instance, have been reluctant to extradite individuals involved with the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Several key BCCI figures wanted by the New York district attorney's office are thought to be holed up in the Middle East. South-east Asia is a favourite place in which suspects disappear. 'If you are dealing with poor countries, where money will buy a lot, you do just that - you buy a lot,' says one Hong Kong police official. A celebrated Hong Kong case concerned the Ma family, who own the Oriental Daily, Hong Kong's biggest-selling daily newspaper. Facing drugs-related charges, the Ma brothers, Ma Shek Yu (or 'White powder' Ma) and Ma Sik Chun, jumped Hong Kong bail and fled to Taiwan as long ago as 1976. Somewhat closer to Mr Nadir's current refuge, Switzerland can offer solace for people fleeing fiscal inquiries, as it does not consider tax evasion a crime. Mr Octav Botnar, former chairman of the Nissan car importing company in the UK, was usefully in Switzerland in January last year when the Inland Revenue issued an arrest warrant for him. Another well-known Swiss resident is Mr Marc Rich, head of the eponymous commodity trading group. In 1983 he was charged in New York with racketeering, fraud, tax evasion and illegally trading with Iran. Mr Rich moved his headquarters to the tiny but extremely wealthy canton of Zug, where he and his company have lived comfortably ever since. Mr Jean Ziegler, a Swiss parliamentarian and author of a book on Switzerland's role as an illicit financial haven, suggests Mr Nadir could follow Mr Rich's lead - but underlines he should become a benefactor to the canton. 'If you do something in the interest of Zug, it will look after you,' he says. However, for Mr Werner K Rey, the Swiss financier who formerly headed the collapsed Omni conglomerate, Switzerland offered no hiding place. Charged with defrauding the group, Mr Rey disappeared early last year. He was traced in December to the Bahamas, where he has been trying to block the Swiss government's extradition demands. For many fugitive financiers, the main threat to their well-being stems not from government and judicial authorities, but from creditors. Some may be seeking both cash and revenge. Fear of reprisals has occasionally led runaways to seek protective custody. Mr George Koskotas, former chairman of the Bank of Crete, fled to Brazil in 1988 after being charged with large-scale fraud. But, concerned that his life might be in danger, he later effectively gave himself up by travelling to the US, from where he was extradited back to Greece in 1991. Mr Eugene Mastrangelo, managing director of the Pinkerton's Risk Assessment Services in the US, says the Bank of Crete story may contain lessons for Mr Nadir. 'If I was him, my least concern would be the authorities. I would worry more about the individuals who had staked me out.' He says Mr Nadir would probably be safer if he went underground in the Lebanon. 'There, he'd slip off the screen - and he could do whatever he's got to do to correct his personal situation.'

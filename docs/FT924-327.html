			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Collor fails to delay hearing THE chief justice of the Brazilian Supreme Court yesterday denied a last-minute request by suspended President Fernando Collor to delay judgment by the Senate on his impeachment, writes Bill Hinchberger in Sao Paulo. Mr Collor, suspended in September for alleged corruption, will be removed from office if the upper house convicts him today, as expected. Chief Justice Sydney Sanches rejected a suit filed by Mr Collor asking for an additional 30 days to allow his new lawyer to prepare arguments. Mr Collor dismissed his attorneys last Tuesday, on the eve of the original trial date.</p>

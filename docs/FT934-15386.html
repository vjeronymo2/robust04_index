			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / UK Company News: UB ends unhappy chapter in Spain UNITED BISCUITS, Britain's largest biscuits and snacks manufacturer, yesterday closed a long and unhappy chapter in its European expansion strategy by selling Ortiz, its Spanish toasted bread business, to the company's management. Acquired by UB in 1973 in an early fit of Euro-enthusiasm, Ortiz ran into problems soon after being taken over. Despite efforts to turn the business round, some analysts estimate that it incurred more losses than profits since then. Last year it lost Pounds 1.3m on sales of Pounds 30m. By the early 1990s, UB's management openly admitted that it had given up any hope of engineering a recovery, answering all inquiries about the business's performance with the standard phrase: 'Ortiz continues to disappoint.' UB had hoped to dismantle Ortiz by buying the biscuits operations of Royal Brands, a Spanish state-owned company, and merging the two businesses. However, the plan was thwarted when Royal Brands was sold to RJR Nabisco earlier this year. Concluding that Spanish social legislation would make the cost of closing Ortiz prohibitive, UB unsuccessfully sought a buyer for the business before deciding to sell it to management for 'a nominal sum.' UB said the deal would result in an exceptional loss of about Pounds 11.5m in this year's accounts, but would enhance group earnings.</p>

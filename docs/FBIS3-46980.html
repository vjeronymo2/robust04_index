This shortage is caused by prolonged drought that devastated  thousands of hectares of rice. During the rainy season the  province put a total area of 65,000 hectares under rice  cultivation or 65 percent of the plan.    Nearly 30,000 hectares have been harvested with an average  yield of over a tonne per hectare compared to a tonne and a half  in the previous year.    This year's rice production would be around 65,000 tonnes  which could feed the province's population of 465,000 for only  four months, says the same source.</p>

			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Currie aims for 200 handshakes an hour If you want to make Mrs Edwina Currie angry, tell her that she will probably lose to Labour in next week's European election contest for Bedford and Milton Keynes. 'What?' cried the Tory ex-minister, banging the dashboard of a battle-bus taking her around dozens of industrial estates in the heart of the constituency. ' 'Lose' is not a word in my vocabulary, dear. I am here to win, and win is what I am going to do.' Mrs Currie, bane of the British egg industry, author of a schlock novel and one of the most talked-about Tory MPs at Westminster, is running for the European parliament with the sort of determination normally seen only at British general elections. In the run-up to the June 9 poll she is undertaking an exhaustive programme of 13-hour-a-day whistle-stop tours around Luton, Milton Keynes and rural Bedfordshire. Her plan is to meet 200 voters an hour; her means a bus driven by keen but frazzled helpers in 'Edwina for Europe' sweatshirts. And her goal is to be one of the few MPs who believe that moving from Westminster to Brussels is a career move upwards. The cynics say that Mrs Currie wants to be an MEP just to remain in political life. The boundaries of her Westminster constituency of Derbyshire South are being redrawn, making that seat a Labour marginal. She is 47 and her career at Westminster has probably peaked. The cynics also say it will be a miracle if she wins this newly created Euro-seat. The Conservatives would have had a tiny majority here of 3,000 at the 1989 election. With Mr John Major's government plunging in the opinion polls, Labour is confident of victory. Yet there is little doubt that Mrs Currie's ambition is driven by real passion for Europe. She echoes statements made over the past few years when she says 'the European parliament is getting to be far more important'. She plans to quit her Westminster seat at the next election if she gets to Brussels. 'I get out of bed in the morning to fight Socialism and the real battle is taking place in Europe,' she told the Sunday Times two years ago. Unlike many Tory MPs, she is also deeply committed to European integration and has always claimed to be European. 'The basic idea of Europe was to set up a level playing field,' she said. 'But, in a number of areas - energy, transport, telecoms - the single market does not exist yet.' She has a clear interest in extending Europe's scope to legislate on social and family issues. Having campaigned for the age of consent for homosexuals to be lowered to 16 in the UK, she would concentrate on extending the European pregnancy rights directive. Mrs Currie, if elected, would devote a large part of her time selling Europe to the British public. She believes the Tory split over Britain's place in the EU reflects public uncertainty on the issue. 'I can really use my position to encourage the British to be more pro-European,' she said. The media focus on the Tory candidate infuriates Mrs Currie's Labour and Liberal Democrat rivals, Ms Eryl McNally and Ms Monica Howes. They believe that her hectic campaigning will come to nought because of the government's difficulties. But some Labour campaigners fear that their vote could be split with the Liberal Democrats, allowing the Tories a slim victory.</p>

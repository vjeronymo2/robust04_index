Tons of rock crashed down in the  early morning on the North Cascades Highway, 5 miles east of Newhalem, closing  the road to traffic. A wall of water washed out the bridge over Glacier Creek  on the Mt. Baker Highway. Rising waters also forced the evacuation of  approximately 15 people from a campground near Fall City.  </P></p>

The rising waves of the  Palestinians' intifadah, which have unprecedentedly intensified  as a result of this soul rending incident, have extended to  include the Arab countries of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon  and have sparked off unprecedented and extensive demonstrations  and protest marches.    The leaders of Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon, have suspended  the  compromise talks in Washington in answer to the people's demands  and in protest of the massacre of the Palestinians. This is  considered a major political defeat for the United States, which  tried to mitigate the impact of this incident on the compromise  talks since the incident at the Abrahamite mosque become known.    After the massacre U.S. President Bill Clinton personally  invited Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister of the Zionist regime, and  Yasir 'Arafat, the PLO chief, to go to Washington immediately to  continue the compromise talks until a definite conclusion is  achieved. The Zionist regime and 'Arafat, who opportunistically  and quickly gave a positive reply to the invitation, are now  facing a political impasse with the suspension of the talks by  Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon. Thus, Yasir 'Arafat, who claims the  leadership of the Palestinians, is facing a new political defeat  because of his haste and his over eagerness to go to Washington.  Political experts believe that possibly within the next few  hours, 'Arafat too will announce his decision to dispense with  going to Washington for talks with Rabin.    Meanwhile, the growing impact of the incident at the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque on the international level has placed the UN  Security Council under pressure to adopt a resolution against  the Zionist regime. During its previous session, which was held  after the incident, the Security Council was unable to reach a  decision on a resolution because of pressures by the United  States, which wanted them to be content with a mere statement on  the incident. However, with the growing impact of the Zionist  regime's crimes and the extensive reactions to it in various  countries of the world, as well as protests by regional and  international organizations, the Security Council has now agreed  to consider a resolution condemning the massacre of the  Palestinian worshipers.    The current developments in occupied Palestine and on the  regional and international levels during the past few days show  that the Zionist regime and its Western mentors who were behind  the recent crime have now lost the initiative despite all their  efforts and that they lack the power to confront the  repercussions stemming from this incident. This impotence is  seen especially in some Arab regimes such as Egypt which, by  suppressing the Muslims' demonstrations protesting the Zionist  regime and by continuing political links with the regime, has  come into confrontation with the popular movement. But with the  extensive wave of Islamic awakening in the region and in the  world, the policy of suppression definitely will not only be  unable to stop the raging wave of developments, but will also  further expand this wave.</p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Dart declines 19% to Pounds 965,000 A 19 per cent reduction in pre-tax profit is announced by Dart Group, the aviation services and forwarding and distribution combine, for the half year ended September 30. Profit worked through at Pounds 965,000 (Pounds 1.19m), although turnover increased from Pounds 19.1m to Pounds 21.3m. Mr Philip Meeson, chairman, said 'we have had to cut back in some areas to ensure our competitiveness, but our already tight ship has meant relatively few redundancies.' There had been a review of marketing and associated strategyat Benair and Channel Express in the distribution division, which had reinforced the strategy for growth. Channel Express Air Services, which operates freighter aircraft on UK and European contracts, had to make savings to maintain competitiveness. Earnings per share came to 4.4p (5.9p) and the interim dividend is held at 1.3p.</p>

			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STRIVING FOR TOCQUEVILLE'S AMERICA;  </P> <P> DEMOCRACY: CAMPAIGN REFORMS MAY BE NEEDED, BUT RECONNECTING WITH ONE ANOTHER  AND WITH THE COMMONWEAL IS MORE URGENT.  </P> <P> Americans have taken justifiable satisfaction from this year's triumphs of  democracy worldwide. But before hastening to tutor others about  self-government, we must reckon with Americans' discontent with our own  democracy -- a "politics of irrelevance, of obscurantism," in the words of  Walter Mondale; a democracy in which "bull permeates everything," according to  Lee Atwater. Revitalizing our democracy should be at the top of our national  agenda, but to make progress, we need to be clearer about what we strive for.  </P> <P> Our contemporary conception of democracy owes more than most observers  recognize to the Austrian economic historian Joseph Schumpeter, who emigrated  to this country in the 1930s. Impatient with idealistic theories about popular  rule, Schumpeter defined democracy as merely " . . . a competitive struggle for  the people's vote." Think of political parties as firms competing for market  share, he said, much as Cheerios and corn flakes vie for a place at our  breakfast tables today. Think of politicians as merchandisers, a modern-day  Schumpeter might say. Think of voters as manipulable consumers, uninformed  about public issues, swayable through jingles and cartoons. Think of public  policy, not as the outcome of a collective deliberation about the public  interest, but as a byproduct of private interest, the mere residue of campaign  strategy.  </P> <P> Schumpeter's interpretation of modern democratic politics turned out to be  remarkably prescient. He forecast, in effect, the central trend in American  politics of the last half-century. When we talk now about democracy and its  discontents, we focus almost entirely on political campaigns and marketing. We  worry about sound bites and campaign spending. We lament "attack ads" and  trivializing press coverage and low voter turnout. We propose public financing  of campaigns and journalistic restraint. And this inside-the-Beltway debate  about political reform follows Schumpeter's lead by mindlessly assuming that  the core of democracy is the electoral campaign.  </P> <P> But it need not be so. An even earlier European visitor to our shores, Alexis  de Tocqueville, offered a quite different view of "democracy in America."  Tocqueville's vision, admittedly rooted in the less urban, less frenetic  America of the early 19th Century, highlighted the engagement of ordinary  citizens in public affairs.  </P> <P> American democracy, according to Tocqueville, presumed a widely shared sense of  social solidarity and civic obligation. The organizational sinews of our  democracy were community associations, not electoral marketeers. Our democracy  relied on our readiness to share responsibility for common problems. Democratic  deliberation, a modern Tocqueville would say, rests on black churches and  Rotary Clubs and Mothers Against Drunk Driving and Drop-a-Dime anti-drug  crusades.  </P> <P> Democracy cannot be subcontracted to campaign strategists and focus groups.  Responsible consideration of the "big" questions of our time -- the twin  deficits, the future of East-West relations, and so on -- must grow from  practical experience in civic discussions of dozens of local issues -- school  reform, homelessness, environmental abuses -- in thousands of communities  across the land. It is no accident that recent evidence suggests that the most  effective means of combatting the plague of drugs is to engage the active  participation of neighborhood groups.  </P> <P> If the paramount issue in American politics of the 1980s was making markets  work better, the principal challenge of the 1990s will be to make democracy  work better. A new era of practical reform is urgently needed. But lasting  reform must begin at the grass roots, with Tocqueville's robust vision rather  than Schumpeter's crass and shallow view. Our schools and universities, our  civic, business and religious leaders, our press -- and yes, even our  politicians -- must join in an effort to restore vigor to grass-roots  organizations, to reconnect with one another and with the commonweal. Campaign  reforms may be needed, but a reinvigorated emphasis on public engagement and  civic solidarity is even more urgent.  </P> <P> The key to revitalizing American democracy rests not in the hands of the  campaign strategist, or even the quavering candidate, but in our own. We must  take responsibility for attacking our problems together, rather than just  pointing angrily from the sidelines at those who fail to do it for us.  </P> <P> To the extent that the recent revolutions in Eastern Europe are grass-roots  initiatives by millions of newly unfettered citizens, and that their elections  are vehicles for debating basic political principles and philosophies, these  new nations are closer to adopting Tocqueville's vision of democracy than  Schumpeter's. And to that extent, we have something to learn about democracy  from them, as well.  </P></p>

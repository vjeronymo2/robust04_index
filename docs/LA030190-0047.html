			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Fleetwood Enterprises Inc.: Third-quarter profit fell 28% to $9.1 million on  revenue of $347.4 million, up slightly from year-ago revenue of $346.8 million.  The Riverside-based maker of motor homes, travel trailers and manufactured  housing said the decline resulted primarily from lower profit margins because  of competitive market conditions and a shift to lower-priced models. Results  for 1990 also include a non-recurring loss related to the sale of two idle  plants.  </P></p>

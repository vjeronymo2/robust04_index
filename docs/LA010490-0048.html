			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HINTS FROM HELOISE: RETURNING EGG YOLKS TO NATURE PROVIDES UNIQUE WAY TO CUT  CHOLESTEROL  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: We are trying to cut out cholesterol in our diet. So when a  recipe calls for a whole egg, I use two egg whites and save the egg yolks in a  plastic bag. When the bag is full I cook the egg yolks in a greased microwave  dish and set the cooked eggs outside for the animals.  </P> <P> We live in the country in a wooded area. Raccoons, opossums and even foxes stop  by for my egg casserole.  </P> <P>  -- JULIANA, Fairview Heights, Ill.  </P> <P> DEAR JULIANA: This is a good idea, but when using the two egg whites in the  place of the whole egg in recipes for baked goods, you will need to substitute  one tablespoon of oil for 1 1/3 tablespoons of the liquid in your recipe.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: Just recently, I found a recipe that my beloved grandmother had  written many years ago. It suddenly dawned on me that possibly my grandchildren  and their grandchildren would someday enjoy having and making something for  their families that they remembered me making for them.  </P> <P> I have begun writing different family recipes on 3x5-inch cards and enclosing  them within each of their birthday cards. After I have departed this life,  won't I be smiling if at a family reunion they would each be making and sharing  those goodies in remembrance of things past.  </P> <P>  -- MURIEL, Lake City, Minn.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I don't know how many others are like me, kind of disorganized. I  keep a neat home but tend to stuff everything into my kitchen drawers.  </P> <P> After cleaning out one drawer, I found two appliance instruction booklets I got  when I purchased the appliances. That's when I decided to put all of them  together in one book. I bought a loose-leaf binder, punched holes in some  construction paper, put them in the book and pasted the back cover of each  booklet to a page.  </P> <P> Now when I need to know about my blender, stove, electric fry pan, etc., I have  a handy file system I can get to in a minute.  </P> <P>  -- JODY, Phoenix, Ariz.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: When I unwrap a new stick of butter or margarine, rather than  disposing of the wrapper, I fold it butter sides together and store it in a  zipper-type plastic bag in my freezer.  </P> <P> The next time a recipe calls for greased pans, I simply pull out one of the  wrappers, grease the pan with it and toss it in the trash.  </P> <P>  -- THERESA, Punta Gorda, Fla.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I usually buy a couple of loaves of bread at a time and keep them  in my freezer. When I run out of bread crumbs, I grate the frozen bread.  </P> <P> I usually don't have stale bread on hand and using fresh bread can be a  problem. This way is easy and fast.  </P> <P>  -- TARA, Salt Lake City  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I went to a dinner party recently and the hostess served sherbet  for dessert, but what was so nice was that she used orange halves as serving  dishes.  </P> <P> She cut the fruit in half and cleaned it out with a grapefruit knife and kept  the shells frozen, then she filled them with sherbet. They looked so lovely and  kept the sherbet cold.  </P> <P> I'm going to use her idea and make some desserts using lemon and possibly  grapefruit halves. Wouldn't sherbet look great in a half of a lemon?  </P> <P>  -- LEE, Austin, Tex.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: When making a cake, rather than drizzling icing on it, cut a  chocolate bar in little pieces and put them on top of the cake while it's still  warm.  </P> <P> It's easy, quick and inexpensive and sure has delicious results.  </P> <P>  -- MARLA, Los Angeles  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: When you have leftover ham on the bone, place the bone in a large  pot and cover it with water. Bring this to a boil and boil until all the meat  falls off, then cool and skim off the fat. Place the ham and broth into small  individual containers and freeze. These can be used to season beans, vegetables  and a whole lot more.  </P> <P>  -- B.N., Camden, S.C.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: It gets harder and harder each year to find the perfect birthday  gift for my wife. I decided this year would be different. I came up with the  following idea and thought it was too good to keep to myself.  </P> <P> My wife's birthday is on April 17. I took her out to dinner at her favorite  restaurant and presented her with a small booklet of eight tickets. These  entitled her to a dinner out for the remaining eight months of the year. Her  gift is spread throughout the year, and she has something to look forward to  each month.  </P> <P> She also says she knows that we will spend at least one night a month out  together. This may become a traditional birthday gift in our family.  </P> <P>  -- TAD, San Diego  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: If you don't have one of those fancy salad molds that unmolds  itself, I have an easy way to do it.  </P> <P> Dip the mold in hot water to loosen the gelatin and go around the edge with a  thin knife. Place lettuce leaves on top of the gelatin with the leaves folded  down around the edges of the mold. Place the serving plate (upside down) on top  of the lettuce. Now hold the mold and the plate firmly and turn the entire  thing over so that the mold is on top and the plate is on the bottom. Shake the  mold gently in a circular motion while holding the plate and the mold in place.  </P> <P> The salad should drop down and be in place perfectly on the lettuce.  </P> <P>  -- RUTH, Longboat Key, Fla.  </P></p>

They, too, are  divided on both the effectiveness of air strikes and the  seriousness of any reprisals they may provoke.    The Gulf War has no doubt demonstrated the possibility of  so-called surgical strikes, effected with sufficient precision  to reduce to a minimum the risk of "collateral damage" caused to  persons and property outside the target. But, as an officer  back from Yugoslavia is quick to point out, "the situation in  Sarajevo is very different: Here we are not in a situation of a  conflict between regular armies, and civilians are present  everywhere, as are the blue helmets and international  volunteers. The probability of error is thus considerable."  <H5>  Human Error </H5>   Furthermore, continues a specialist in artillery matters,  "two factors determine strike precision: The precision with  which the target is identified and the precision of the firing  system used to attack it. In both these cases, today's  technology allows exceptional performances, virtually down to  the very last centimeter. But despite this, you cannot exclude  a technical fault, and even less human error. Remember how U.S.  helicopters mistakenly fired on British tanks in the Gulf War."    Allowing for these reservations, experts agree that strikes  limited to the hills around Sarajevo, where the Serbs have  concentrated their artillery, "would produce good results,"  whether against dug-in pieces or mobile arms. "It is just as  mistaken to claim that the former are indestructible as to  assert that the latter are much less vulnerable," states General  Robert Close, citing the precedents of the war in Algeria and  the Second World War.    This judgment is shared by experts from the former Yugoslav  Army. "The Serbs are using old equipment," one of them  observes. "They are often towed pieces which take time to be  moved. The major Western armies have radar which make it  possible to locate artillery batteries immediately after the  first shell is fired. So it only takes a few minutes, if not  seconds, to destroy them. If the equipment and competent men  are at hand."  <H5>  Reprisals </H5>   That is no doubt the main problem. It seems that the use of  air strikes requires a strengthening of UN forces in Bosnia and  more comprehensive weaponry, both to ensure the success of the  military operations envisaged and to protect the blue helmets  from any reprisals which -- without necessary going as far as a  pitched battle -- could use the most murderous terrorist  practices.    But to go down this road is to prepare for an escalation  which the West clearly does not want. An officer pointed out  that -- while the subject of air strikes has been fiercely  debated -- NATO has never dared shoot down a single one of the  helicopters which are constantly violating the air exclusion  zone over Bosnia.</p>

			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TRIAL CHRONOLOGY  </P> <P> Here is a chronology of the Randy Steven Kraft murder trial, from his arrest  six years ago to the jury's penalty finding Friday.  </P> <P> May 14, 1983 -- Kraft is arrested on Interstate 5 in Mission Viejo. Two  California Highway Patrol officers who stop him on suspicion of drunk driving  find a dead Marine in his car.  </P> <P> Sept. 26, 1983 -- Preliminary hearing begins before Santa Ana Municipal Judge  John J. Ryan on 16 murder charges.  </P> <P> Nov. 18, 1983 -- Ryan orders Kraft to stand trial on all 16 murders.

McBride quits the case after Kraft  attacks him in a Times interview.  </P> <P> Dec. 16, 1983 -- Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown files notice with the court  that he will accuse Kraft of an additional 20 murders in the penalty phase of  the trial, including six murders in Oregon and two in Michigan.  </P> <P> Jan. 20, 1984 -- Superior Court Judge James K. Turner permits the first of more  than a dozen postponements in Kraft's trial date, stretched out over the next 4  1/2 years, almost all at the defense's request.  </P> <P> Aug. 6, 1984 -- Kraft lawyer Douglas W. Otto is relieved from the case, at  Kraft's request. Co-counsel James G. Merwin, who replaced McBride, remains. The  same week, Chief Deputy Public Defender C. Thomas McDonald resigns his post to  join Merwin as co-counsel for Kraft.  </P> <P> Aug. 30, 1985 -- Prosecutor Brown files an amended complaint accusing Kraft of  one more penalty-phase murder, making the total in the case 37.  </P> <P> May 2, 1985 -- Kraft's attorneys persuade Superior Court Judge Luis A. Cardenas  that the case is so massive that a third attorney is needed to defend Kraft.  The judge appoints William J. Kopeny, who also resigns from the public  defender's office to take the position.  </P> <P> Jan. 14, 1987 -- Over vigorous objections from prosecutors after a two-week  hearing, Cardenas permits the defense its eighth delay in the trial date.  </P> <P> Aug. 18, 1987 -- Judge Turner, after another lengthy debate over the trial  date, finds that the defense no longer has grounds to delay the trial. He  orders the trial to begin immediately after the search warrant hearings,  scheduled to end in December.  </P> <P> Aug. 22, 1987 -- Judge Turner begins a search warrant hearing that will  ultimately span eight months.  </P> <P> Dec. 29, 1987 -- Judge Turner undergoes emergency heart surgery, which puts the  trial date on hold again.

McCartin is assigned to preside  at the Kraft trial.  </P> <P> March 18, 1988 -- Turner denies the motion to quash the search warrants, which  paves the way for the trial to finally begin.  </P> <P> June 25, 1988 -- Judge McCartin denies the defense motion to separate the Kraft  case into multiple trials. Though the courtroom is nearly empty for the  hearing, the Kraft lawyers view it as the most critical day in the entire case.  </P> <P> July 19, 1988 -- The Kraft trial begins with the first preliminary stages of  jury selection. The judge warns prospective jurors during the week that the  trial could last more than a year.  </P> <P> Sept. 23, 1988 -- Judge McCartin announces he will unseal key documents,  including the complete list from Kraft's car, once the jurors have heard  opening statements.  </P> <P> Sept. 26, 1988 -- Opening statements are made at the Kraft trial, and the first  testimony begins. In addition, prosecution papers unsealed by the judge reveal  that the Kraft list has 61 entries. Also revealed for the first time are eight  additional murders -- all in Los Angeles County -- of which prosecutor Brown  has accused Kraft, even though he does not plan to use them at the trial. That  puts the total at 45.  </P> <P> Nov. 30, 1988 -- After 10 weeks of testimony, Brown completes his case.

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Jordan's wider choice narrows the debate: The kingdom's first multi-party election SIX political heavyweights from Amman's Third District faced nearly two thousand voters in the ballroom of the Philadelphia Hotel and were quizzed for three hours on their campaigns leading up to Jordan's general election next Monday. Questions ranged from women's rights to corruption, from Jordan's economic reform programme to its education system. The candidates included an ex-prime minister and three former ministers. It was a rare display of political debate in a region not noted for freedom of expression. But it is unlikely to have changed the way members of the audience vote on November 8. Most have already made up their minds. In Jordan's last elections in 1989, candidates ran as independents for the 80-member lower house of parliament. This time round more than 15 political parties and 555 candidates are officially registered to contest seats in the country's first multi-party elections since 1956. The kingdom is festooned with posters, banners and campaign leaflets. And the 1.5m voters are seemingly spoilt for choice. But there is a distinct lack of enthusiasm. Most people blame the controversial new election law - announced by King Hussein in August - which changed the rules to one person, one vote. Under the old system, the number of votes allowed equalled the number of seats in the district. Thus voters had two or three, and in one constituency, nine votes to play with. This suited most candidates because if they lobbied hard enough and obtained the support of a majority of voters, even as the second or third choice, they stood a chance of being elected. This time round they have to be the first and only choice. The effect has been a narrowing of political debate. The electoral change is purposely weighted in favour of those candidates with strong tribal affiliations and influential families, the bedrock of King Hussein's faithful. Their votes will be won out of obligation and loyalty, which take precedence over choice or preference in Jordanian society. As a result, most candidates are campaigning to widen their private network of contacts on a limited range of local and personal issues. Manifestos generally consist of little more than vacuous slogans calling for national unity, Arab unity, a free Palestine, and democracy for all. Campaigns are conducted in homes, over the telephone, and by buttering-up influential tribal and family figures. Most of the parties have chosen to sell the attributes of individual candidates rather than the party itself. The expected losers are the new political parties which are largely based on woolly ideologies rather than useful tribal connections. The exception is the Islamic Action Front (IAF), the political wing of the Moslem Brotherhood, which backed numerous candidates in the last election and won 21 of 80 parliamentary seats. This time the IAF has 36 candidates standing in 16 of 20 districts. Its leaders say the new electoral system is weighted against them. Last week they met the prime minister to complain that their campaign was being targeted by the government. Until last weekend, when the High Court over-ruled the minister of the interior, they were banned from holding large-scale public rallies, and they say that their supporters in the civil service have been forbidden to campaign for the party. The likely outcome is that the new parliament will be dominated by pro-government and tribal MPs. The expected decrease in the number of successful fundamentalist candidates would result in less opposition to government policies. And King Hussein would be able to continue with his agenda without worrying about a rowdy house of elected representatives.</p>

			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> If a New Yorker had seen it, he would have thought he had died and gone to  heaven. There they were, at least 200 cabs without passengers driving through  downtown Los Angeles during rush hour Thursday morning.  </P> <P> The independent cab drivers circled the streets around City Hall, honking for  almost an hour to protest the city's proposal to levy stiff fines against  drivers who are discourteous, overcharge passengers or otherwise provide bad  service.  </P> <P> Groused Yuri Gizersky, a 10-year veteran of the road, "They want to take food  out of my family's mouth because I have a little dust on my cab or maybe a tiny  scratch. So maybe they should all walk."  </P> <P> Even as the cabbies protested, Councilman Joel Wachs was proposing still more  rules. Wachs wants a dress code outlawing tank tops, wants taxi drivers to  attend training programs that stress "importance of courteous behavior" and he  wants drivers to hand out "courtesy cards" to solicit rider comments.  </P> <P> Wachs said he developed the proposal after receiving complaints from the  public. When pressed on just where these complaints were coming from, Wachs  said, "My mother."  </P> <P> There's something about an Aqua Velva man.  </P> <P> Just ask Suellen Governale, who has been spending spare time searching what  seems by now to be every drug store, shopping mall and grocery store in Los  Angeles, looking for Aqua Velva's menthol mist shaving lotion for her husband,  Chuck.  </P> <P> Chuck, a 50-year-old computer magazine writer, even put an ad in the newspaper  offering to pay $4 a bottle. You see, Beecham Products of Pittsburgh is  discontinuing the menthol line. He even called the company, begging them to  keep making it. But they told him that it is not a "big mover." They suggested  calling distributors. Distributors told him they were sold out.  </P> <P> If Governale sounds a bit desperate, it's because he's been using the lotion  for more than 30 years. "I don't even like Aqua Velva Blue, and I hate all the  new lotions. They smell too strong. Musk, yech!"  </P> <P> So far he's gotten three bottles to stockpile. So what's he going to do after  he uses the last bottles?  </P> <P> "I am seriously thinking of growing a beard," he said.  </P> <P> It was almost like in the movies. The runaway train boxcar was barreling down  the tracks and the lawman maneuvered his trusty steed next to it, hopped on and  saved the day by applying the breaks.  </P> <P> Except this happened in real life to Sgt. Andrew Blodgett. The LAPD motorcycle  officer was on duty when he heard the radio call about a lumber-filled boxcar  out of control on tracks in South-Central Los Angeles near Western and Slauson  avenues. The sergeant saw the car and sped into action. Because he had ridden  freight trains as a kid and is still a train buff, he knew where the brakes  would be -- on the back, halfway down the side. But, he added, it wasn't quite  as romantic as it sounded. "I'm stuck with what really happened," he said,  explaining that he didn't just jump from his motorcycle to the train ala Tom  Mix. "I followed the boxcar and when it slowed down going up a rise, I parked  my motorcycle and then climbed on."  </P> <P> So who says all California kids know how to surf?  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Department of Beaches and Harbors is holding Surf Camps  to teach kids ages 12 to 17 how to ride the curl, repair surfboards and be safe  in the ocean. The sessions, which cost $105, are scheduled from 8 a.m. to 4  p.m. Aug. 14-18 and Aug. 21-25. Enrollment is first-come, first-served. Jim  Cole, spokesman for the beaches department, admitting that he had never learned  how to surf, said wistfully, "I wish they'd had this when I was a kid."  </P></p>

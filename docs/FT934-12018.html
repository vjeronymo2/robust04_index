			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: Bildt urges early Renault sale MR Carl Bildt, the Swedish Prime Minister, said yesterday there was an urgent need to privatise Renault, the French automotive group which is to be the dominant partner in a proposed merger with Volvo's car and truck operations. Mr Bildt, responding to mounting criticism in Sweden that the merger amounts to a French state takeover of Volvo, noted there were no guarantees about Renault's privatisation. But he did not doubt the intention of the French to sell off Renault. He has no intention of intervening in the merger, which his government supported. The privatisation of Renault should proceed as quickly as possible, he said. 'Had privatisation not been contemplated, there would have been a reason to question the merger. But the French government says that it intends to privatise by the end of next year or at the start of 1995 and I do not doubt their intentions.' Volvo shareholders will vote on the merger at a special shareholders meeting on November 9. The Swedish company said yesterday it had reached agreement with the French government which eases the pressure on it to reduce its shareholding in the merged company to 20 per cent from 35 per cent in the event of a breakdown of the merger agreement. However, the French government will retain the right after privatisation to use a golden share to vet any holding over 20 per cent of the votes in Renault-Volvo, an issue which has been portrayed in Sweden as potentially forcing Volvo to reduce its holding. Most analysts expect the merger to be approved at the shareholders meeting.</p>

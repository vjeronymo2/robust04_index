			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / French Privatisation: French look for the strong, silent type - Government seeks supportive investors in sell-off WANTED: Long-term investors willing to take minority holdings in privatised companies. Any nationality accepted. Deep pockets and strong nerves essential. The French government is searching for noyaux durs, 'hard core' investors, to participate in its privatisation programme. These are companies which take minority stakes in another and then act as a stable, supportive shareholder to shelter it against the storms of the private sector. Noyaux durs played a prominent part in the last French privatisation drive in 1986 and 1987. However, those sales took place at a time when the Paris stock market was soaring and corporate profits were rising. It may be more difficult for the present government to unearth loyal investors in the current climate when many companies are strapped for cash and the stock market is sluggish. The concept of noyaux durs is indicative of France's ambivalent attitude to capitalism. Although these shareholders act as strategic partners for the company, they are alsoexpected to serve as a source of support for the board in the event of a hostile takeover. This contradicts of the prevailing Anglo-Saxon view that the threat of takeovers makes senior management more efficient. 'What is it that you French have got against takeovers?' asked an incredulous American banker at a privatisation conference in Paris last week. The answer is that the French have nothing against takeovers per se, but prefer continuity of ownership. This is understandable in a country such as France where many large companies are controlled either by the state or by their founding families. The few that fall outside those categories tend to be protected by complex webs of cross-shareholdings and sweetheart deals. Against this backdrop it is scarcely surprising that when the new French government started to plan its privatisation drive it resurrected the concept of noyaux durs as a way of offering some protection to the companies on its hit list. In theory the government faces a tougher task in rustling up compliant investors in the present unfavourable economic environment. And some French companies may be wary of alienating the US and UK shareholders that have in recent years invsted heavily in the Paris stock market. In addition, the performance of some of the 1986 and 1987 privatisation candidates has been poor. For example, the share price of Suez, the industrial and financial group, is now trading below the offer price But in practice there seems to be no shortage of prospective noyaux durs for the next round of privatisations. Some groups have expressed interest in investing in companies with which they have strategic links. Matra-Hachette, the defence electronics group, has declared its interest in Renault, the motor group with which it produces the successful Espace van in a joint venture, and Aerospatiale, the aerospace concern. Alcatel-Alsthom, the electronics company, has said that it would be prepared to invest in France Telecom, even though it is not on the privatisation list. Other would-be noyaux durs have different motives. Societe Generale, the banking group, has said that it plans to participate in the privatisations as 'advisor, vendor and investor'. Its rivals interpret this as a thinly-disguised bid for lucrative advisorships from the French government. There are even signs of interest from foreign investors. IFIL, an Agnelli family holding company, has said it sees the French privatisation programme as a way of expanding beyond its native Italy. There are also hopes of investment from Japan, where the concept of a long term, silent-partner investment seems far less foreign than in the US or UK. The critical question is whether the concept will still work in the modern Paris stock market. It did in 1988 when the recently privatised Societe Generale rallied its noyaux durs to stave off a raid by Mr Georges Pebereau, the French financier. But last year's drama when Nestle, the Swiss food group, succeeded in taking over Perrier mineral water after a long and complex battle, showed that such boardroom allies do not make companies invulnerable. Meanwhile the recent row between Suez and Union des Assurances de Paris over the former's refusal to cede control of Colonia, one of its German insurance subsidiaries, illustrates that noyaux durs are not always as mutually supportive as the French government would like to think.</p>

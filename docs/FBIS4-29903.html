			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 19 [date as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- The  anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon moves of the Japanese authorities are  under fire in Japan.    Hidenori Sasaki, Social-Democratic member of the House of  Representatives of Japan, said in a statement that the recent  illegal search by the Kyoto prefectural police, long with the  forcible search of the Osaka prefectural headquarters of the  General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon),  shows the Japanese Government's stance to incite apprehensions  over the "nuclear issue"of the DPRK among the people.    Osamuto Yadabe, Social-Democratic member of the House of  Councillors, in a statement said that the current forcible  search is a political suppression and an attempt to aggravate  the situation on the Korean peninsula under the pretext of  "nuclear suspicion of the DPRK and establish "emergency  arrangement" in Japan.    The Kumamoto prefectural headquarters of the Japan  Social-Democratic Party [JSDP], the Hokkaido Japan-Korea  Solidarity Committee of Youths and Students for Supporting the  Independent and Peaceful Reunification of Korea and other  Japanese public organisations made public letters of protest  addressed to the Japanese prime minister and the chief of the  Kyoto prefectural police headquarters. The Hyogo Prefectural  Society for Defending Human Rights of Koreans in Japan, the 60th  general meeting of the Kochi prefectural headquarters of the  Japan Social-Democratic Party and the Kagawa prefectural  headquarters of the JSDP adopted a request, a resolution and a  letter of protest denouncing the authorities' suppression of  Chongnyon. The 11th meeting of Young Women for Japan-Korea  Solidarity in Kochi prefecture adopted an appeal headlined "Let  Us Pool Efforts for Independent Japan-Korea Solidarity and the  Independent and Peaceful Reunification of Korea" and a letter of  protest denouncing the authorities' unwarrantable suppression on  Chongnyon.    The Japan-Korea Society for the Exchange of Scientific  Education in an appeal called for further strengthening  activities for friendship and solidarity with the Koreans in  Japan.</p>

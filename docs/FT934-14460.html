			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / International Company News: Sculley quits as Apple chairman MR John Sculley has resigned as chairman of Apple Computer, ending months of speculation about his departure since he gave up his post as chief executive in June. One of the best known executives in the computer industry, Mr Sculley has been with Apple for 10 years. 'Mr Sculley proffered his resignation at a board meeting that took place on Wednesday and Thursday,' an Apple official said. 'The board accepted.' He declined to elaborate. Mr Sculley's resignation coincided with Apple's year-end financial results. The company reported a 97 per cent drop in earnings for its fourth fiscal quarter despite record sales of Dollars 2.1bn, blaming the earnings decline on severe price competition. In July, Apple reported its worst ever quarterly losses, of Dollars 188m, including an after-tax restructuring charge of Dollars 199m. The company has since laid off about 2,500 employees. Mr Sculley has been succeeded as chairman of the board by Mr Mike Markkula, one of Apple's original investors and its first chairman, from 1977 to 1981. Since then Mr Markkula has been a non-executive vice-chairman. Mr Joseph A. Graziano, Apple's chief financial officer, also joined the board. Rumours that Mr Sculley would soon leave Apple had been circulating throughout the computer industry for several months, as the company's performance deteriorated and his pet project the 'Newton' personal digital assistant appeared to be in trouble. He has been widely criticised for paying too little attention to Apple's core PC business, while focusing on the nascent market for hand-held computer devices. Since the launch of the Newton 'MessagePad' in August, Apple claims to have shipped 50,000 units. However, the product has received damning reviews. In June, Mr Sculley announced he was stepping aside as chief executive, stressing that the move was at his own initiative. A very different account of events has, however, emerged in a wrongful dismissal lawsuit filed against Apple by Mr Al Eisenstat, former executive vice-president and one of Mr Sculley's closest associates at Apple. In his suit, Mr Eisenstat describes a board-room coup, in which Mr Sculley was, he claims, ousted. Apple says the suit is without merit and has disputed Mr Eisenstat's recollections as 'false'. Mr Sculley, who has been on sabbatical for most of the summer, has declined to comment. Neither did he announce his future plans. Mr Sculley has been mentioned as a potential candidate for top jobs at several US companies, including Eastman Kodak, which is searching for a new chairman and chief executive. In June, however, Mr Sculley expressed interest in starting his own high-tech company. 'That is a dream that I have for the future,' he said in an interview.</p>

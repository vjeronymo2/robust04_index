			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Arts: Maazel and the Pittsburgh - Music in London The most recent occasion that the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra attracted attention in Britain was when a BBC documentary last year revealed the huge sums paid out to secure the services of its music director, Lorin Maazel. The good people of Pittsburgh put a high price on civic pride. Although it is not one of the inner circle of great American orchestras, the Pittsburgh Symphony is good enough to hold a place on the international stage. Is it obviously American from the way it plays? Difficult to say: the brass is dominant and there is a punchiness about the playing which is certainly transatlantic, but those may just be dominating characteristics of its music director. Whatever his drawbacks, Maazel gets spick-and-span ensemble out of an orchestra. The two concerts by the Pittsburgh Symphony in the last week of the Proms followed on a series by some of the world's great orchestras and although it does not compare with the rich and cultivated sounds made by Berlin and Dresden respectively, it always knew what it was doing. The playing was decisive and remarkably clear. Maazel is less a conductor than a musical surgeon. In the first concert Rakhmaninov's Third Symphony found him scalpel in hand. He analysed, clarified and dissected the score, slowly laying out its bare bones before him. The operation was performed with impressive precision, but only because the heart was dead. This symphony has rarely seemed so cold: the slow movement had no lyrical flow, the finale was never joyous. More pleasure was afforded in this first programme from hearing the wealth of detail in the 20th-century music after the interval. Maazel's ear uncovered many precise timbres and rhythms in Ravel's Rapsodie espagnole and Julian Rachlin was no less proficient a soloist, with a big tone for one so young, in Prokofiev's First Violin Concerto. The second concert was all Beethoven: the Eighth and Ninth Symphonies, the latter a prerequisite for the Proms' penultimate night. Typically, Maazel was at his best where the emotions get least involved, as in the metronome-like tick-tock of the Eighth's second movement or the Ninth's unrelenting scherzo. Outer movements were delivered with rigorous accents, which became pedantic when Maazel decided to underline crucial turning-points in the structure. In sum, the Eighth worked, thanks to its energy and brilliance; the Ninth predictably offered no sense of the spiritual and fell short. The finale of the Ninth is a great Prom rabble-rouser, especially when it is sung by a choir as large and well-rehearsed as the Philharmonia Chorus. Gregg Baker led the 'Ode to Joy' superbly, the best of a big-voiced quartet, including Nina Rautio, Linda Finnie and John Horton Murray.</p>

			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Russians deny arms plutonium was theirs A stash of weapons grade plutonium found on a Lufthansa flight to Munich from Moscow last week threatened yesterday to provoke a serious diplomatic row between Germany and Russia. In Moscow the atomic energy ministry yesterday denied the plutonium was Russian but German experts said its analysis could pinpoint the point of manufacture in Russia. Munich police said couriers they detained last week arriving on a flight from Moscow had been carrying 300-350 grams of radioactive plutonium 239. It was the third seizure in four months of weapons-grade material from the former Soviet bloc. Moscow's atomic energy ministry spokesman, Mr Georgy Kaurov, said Russia could account for all its plutonium but a German government spokesman said this was not true. Unlike uranium 235, the other material used for making bombs, plutonium 239 does not occur naturally and has to be produced at a nuclear plant. 'Statistically speaking, there must still be a high probability that it came from here,' said a diplomat in Moscow. Chancellery aide Mr Bernd Schmidbauer will take with him the analysis of the latest consignment, currently being examined in a laboratory, when he goes to Moscow in the next few days at Chancellor Helmut Kohl's request to discuss nuclear smuggling. Mr Kaurov said the Russian authorities had conducted an inventory of all sources of plutonium 239 over the previous two weeks and had discovered no thefts or losses. Russian intelligence sources in Moscow claim the west is deliberately exaggerating the drain of nuclear material from the country in an attempt to force new controls on the domestic nuclear industry. Mr Kaurov vigorously rejected suggestions that Mr Viktor Sidorenko, the deputy atomic energy minister who was travelling on the same aircraft as the plutonium, was in any way connected with the affair.' Our minister is a deeply-respected academic. . . . he simply could not be involved in such a business,' he said. Ukraine, another part of the former Soviet Union capable of producing nuclear materials, also denied any involvement in the affair. Mr Anatoli Chernov, deputy head of the Ukrainian state atomic energy commission, said: 'We are not physically or technically capable of producing plutonium 239. This has to be from a country which produces and controls nuclear weapons. It is exclusively a Russian affair. Let them figure it out.'</p>

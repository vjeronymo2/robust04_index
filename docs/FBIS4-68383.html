			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by the City Assembly's press center: Deputies Meet </F> With Top Officials of the City Administration of Internal  Affairs"]    [Text] Deputies of the St. Petersburg city assembly met  yesterday with top officials of the city's law enforcement  organs in the Mariinskiy Palace's Blue Hall.    Arkadiy Kramarev, the chief of the St. Petersburg and  Leningrad Oblast city administration of internal affairs, told  the deputies that so far there has been no success in halting  the rising crime.    In the general opinion of the top officials of the city's  law  enforcement organs, the scale of organized crime in St.  Petersburg is quite substantial. According to Arkadiy Kramarev,  criminal structures may indirectly influence decisions of the  city authorities. In order to preclude the possibility of  criminal elements interfering with the process of city  administration, deputy Sergey Andreyev proposed that by the time  the city assembly begins its work all heads of law enforcement  organs submit a list of priority normative acts, whose adoption  will make it possible to improve the crime situation in St.  Petersburg.    Also yesterday a group of deputies petitioned Russian  Minister of Internal Affairs V. Yerin to postpone the question  of relieving A. Kramarev from his job--the rumors of his  replacement have been circulating in St. Petersburg--until the  city assembly begins its work.</p>

Gear, which last summer was negotiating a long-term  lease for all of Channel Gateway's office space, has abandoned those plans.  </P> <P> The nation's third-largest athletic shoe company has reported lower profits  this year despite higher sales.  </P> <P> Kevin Ventrudo, L.A. Gear's chief financial officer, said last week that  leasing the high-rise office building was "not advisable at this time" because  of the economic environment and changes in bank financing.  </P> <P> As a consequence, Channel Gateway developer Jerome Snyder said that in the  spring he plans to start lining up other tenants for the 314,000-square-foot  office building. Snyder has said that having long-term leases is critical to  obtaining the financing to build the office complex.  </P> <P> Snyder also is looking for financing to build the first of two 16-story  condominium towers planned for the Lincoln Boulevard site.  </P> <P> In the meantime, construction crews have been working to drive pilings that  will support the project's 544-unit apartment complex. The four-story apartment  buildings are being built with $67 million in tax-exempt financing. Twenty  percent of the units have been reserved for low-income tenants.  </P></p>

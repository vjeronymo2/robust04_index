			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Survey of World Industrial Review (11): America takes fright  -Cars and Trucks THE admission by General Motors, the world's largest vehicle maker, that it must scale down its massively loss-making North American automotive operations, has thrown into stark relief the awesome competitive challenges facing vehicle makers in the 1990s. In the face of losses on its North American vehicle operations estimated by analysts at as much as Dollars 7bn last year, GM is being forced to close 21 plants and cut around 74,000 jobs in North America over the next four years. The GM cut-backs add fuel to the protectionist flames fanned by the prolonged US recession, as pressures grow for legislation to limit Japanese car sales in the US and to force Japan to reduce its Dollars 31bn automotive trade surplus with America. The big three US car makers, GM, Ford and Chrysler, have all been pushed into heavy losses, and the US motor industry is now engaged in an intensive lobbying campaign to force Tokyo to reduce its automotive surplus which accounts for three quarters of the overall US deficit with Japan. The chairmen of GM, Ford and Chrysler accompanied US President Bush on his recent controversial visit to Japan, a move which pushed the US auto industry's woes to the top of the political agenda. In order to increase the pressure, the chairmen of the US car makers are urgently seeking a further meeting with the leaders of the Japanese auto industry. There have also been proposals in the US Congress to restrict the number of Japanese vehicles imported into the US and the numbers of vehicles built in Japanese manufacturing facilities in the US. North America was the battleground of the world auto industry in the 1980s as the Japanese invested heavily to build an extensive production presence. Now in the face of the prolonged US recession the Japanese challenge has been turned into huge losses for the big three US car makers. Following the wave of investment in assembly plants in North America in the 1980s - eight in the US and three in Canada - Japanese producers accounted for 24.9 per cent of total US car output last year, increasing their share from 21.7 per cent in 1990. Car production by the Japanese transplants in the US (including NUMMI, the Toyota/GM joint venture) increased by 1.1 per cent to 1.33m - despite the deep recession in US new car sales - in stark contrast to the 11.7 per cent drop in overall US car output to 5.36m. Meanwhile, Japanese capacity continues to expand with: Toyota spending Dollars 800m to almost double its Georgetown, Kentucky plant to 420,000 cars a year by the end of 1993 from 220,000 at present, and Nissan spending Dollars 490m to virtually double its car and light truck production capacity at its Smyrna Tennessee plant to 440,000 units a year by mid-1992. The Japanese transplants' total car and light truck production capacity in North America is planned to reach around 2.7m vehicles a year by 1993/94 following an investment of some Dollars 7.5bn. In the 1990s, however, the focus of Japanese competition is moving to Europe, where the spectre of overcapacity, already a reality in North America, looms as the Japanese establish their first wave of transplant (local assembly plant) facilities. Nissan has been producing cars in the UK since 1986. Volumes were modest at first, but this year output should reach 175,000 cars and will grow to 270,000 in 1993. Later this year production begins at Toyota and Honda's first European car assembly plants - both located in the UK. Mitsubishi Motors is also creating a joint venture with Volvo of Sweden in the Netherlands with the aim of producing 200,000 cars a year by the mid-1990s. After stumbling in 1991 world car sales are forecast to stage a recovery in 1992. World new car demand is estimated to have contracted last year by 2.9 per cent to 34.4m from 35.5m in 1990, the largest sales reduction since the 1980-81 recession. However, according to the latest DRI World Automotive Forecast Report, worldwide new car demand will regain the lost ground this year to reach 35.5m. Worldwide new car sales are forecast to resume steady growth through the first half of the 1990s to reach 40.3m in 1996. While demand is set to recover gradually, car producers and their suppliers still face a daunting array of other challenges through the 1990s. Costly regulations on exhaust emissions are being toughened while regulations governing improved fuel economy and the recycling of old cars appear unavoidable. Recent regulatory developments in the US virtually ensure that the electric car will play an increasingly important role on the roads of North America, and probably the world, before the end of this decade.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       US AUTO INDUSTRY                       JANUARY-DECEMBER  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Volume     Volume     Share (%)    Share (%)                        (Units)   Change (%)  Jan-Dec 91   Jan-Dec 90  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CAR SALES            8,176,000     -12.0       100.0        100.0 Imports              2,104,000     -14.2        25.7         26.4 Japanese makes       2,472,000      -4.4        30.2         27.8  of which US-built   1,124,000      +6.0        13.8         11.4 European makes         339,000     -26.0         4.1          4.9 Japanese derived*    2,945,000      -5.3        36.0         33.5 CAR PRODUCTION       5,365,000     -11.7       100.0        100.0  of which Japanese  US-built++          1,334,000      +1.1        24.9         21.7 CAR SALES BY  MANUFACTURER: General Motors       2,909,000     -12.1        35.6         35.6 Ford                 1,636,000     -15.8        20.0         20.9 Chrysler               703,000     -18.4         8.6          9.3 Honda/Acura            803,000      -6.0         9.8          9.2 Toyota/Lexus           742,000      -4.8         9.1          8.4 Nissan/Infiniti                        413,000      -7.4         5.0          4.8 Mazda                  222,000      -1.8         2.7          2.4 Mitsubishi             162,000      +8.3         2.0          1.6 Hyundai                118,000     -14.4         1.4          1.5 Volkswagen              92,000     -29.3         1.1          1.4 Volvo                   68,000     -24.7         0.8          1.0 Mercedes-Benz           59,000     -24.9         0.7          0.8 BMW                     53,000     -16.2         0.7          0.7 Saab                    26,000      -1.1         0.3          0.3 Audi                    12,000     -41.8         0.2          0.2 Jaguar                   9,376     -49.9         0.1          0.2 Porsche                  4,388     -52.0         0.1          0.1 Alfa Romeo               3,478      -0.1         0.0          0.0 Yugo                     3,092     -51.4         0.0          0.1 LIGHT TRUCK          4,159,000      -9.4       100.0        100.0 SALES  Imports               713,000      -5.6        17.1         16.4 TOTAL CAR &amp; LIGHT   12,336,000     -11.2       100.0        100.0  TRUCK SALES General Motors       4,320,000     -12.5        35.0         35.5 Ford                 2,867,000     -13.6        23.2         23.9 Chrysler             1,508,000     -11.2        12.2         12.2 Toyota/Lexus         1,010,000      -4.5         8.2          7.6 NORTH AMERICAN  CAR &amp; TRUCK  PRODUCTION         10,722,000      -8.9       100.0        100.0   of which Japanese   Nth.

			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A'S NELSON WAS A RELIEVED RELIEVER WHEN REUNITED WITH MISSING WIFE  </P> <P> Everyone who was at Candlestick Park Tuesday night has his own story to tell,  and A's pitcher Gene Nelson has his.  </P> <P> As soon as the earthquake struck, Nelson looked out to the field boxes, where  his family was supposed to be sitting.  </P> <P> His son, David, was there.  </P> <P> But where was his wife?  </P> <P> Dave Perron, the A's director of community affairs, told Nelson that his wife  had missed the family buses from Oakland to Candlestick for the game. Cecilia  Nelson was apparently driving to the game, which meant crossing the Bay Bridge,  part of which had collapsed when the earthquake hit at 5:04 p.m.  </P> <P> "I was pretty nervous," Nelson said. "I know how long it takes to get . . .  here and that she must've been on the bridge somewhere around 5:04.  </P> <P> "And then to go for a long period of time without knowing . . . "  </P> <P> As it turned out, Cecilia had crossed the bridge safely but didn't reach  Candlestick until after the earthquake hit.  </P> <P> "She got held up at the toll booth," Nelson said. "After the earthquake, they  wouldn't let anyone into the parking lot. My son was driven to the game in  another car and kept telling me she couldn't have been more than five minutes  behind him."  </P> <P> Once the game was postponed, Nelson and his son began scouring the parking lot  and, eventually, Cecilia was sighted.  </P> <P> "Finally, I found her," Nelson said with a sigh. "Believe me, I felt a lot of  relief." MIKE PENNER  </P></p>

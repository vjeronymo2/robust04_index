			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / International Company News: Wallenbergs sell Stora stake for SKr600m INVESTOR, the main holding company of Sweden's powerful Wallenberg family, said yesterday it had sold a 2 per cent stake in Stora, Europe's largest forestry products company, raising more than SKr600m (Dollars 85.7m) in a move it described as part of a programme to reduce group debt. The sale over the past two months of 1.88m Stora A shares followed the disposal for SKr2.94bn in late June of Investor's 7.4 per cent stake in Asea, the joint owner of the Swiss-Swedish Asea Brown Boveri engineering group. Investor raised a further Pounds 23m (Dollars 34.3m) when it sold its 7.5 per cent stake in Christies International, the UK auction house, last month. The amounts raised are in line with the scale of debt reduction Investor signalled earlier this year when it said it intended to bring down group net borrowings to SKr5bn-SKr6bn. The investment group, which has majority or leading stakes in many of Sweden's top companies, slipped to a SKr542m loss in the first quarter. Group net debt stood at SKr9.86bn at March 31. The Wallenbergs have avoided any significant erosion of their control in Swedish industry in spite of the trading difficulties.</p>

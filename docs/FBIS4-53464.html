			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, May 19 (ANEX-ANTARA) -- Indonesian Foreign  Ministry Thursday acknowledged recent reports indicating the  postponement of Moro-Manila peace talks if the Philippines  Government could not take any concrete action against a  planned-conference on East Timor issue to be held in its capital  city.    The ministry's spokesman, Irawan Abidin, told ANTARA that  Indonesia may cancel its hosting of the Indonesian-sponsored  peace talks if Manila, between today and june, could not convey  its proper response over Jakarta's displeasure over the  conference.    The Moro-Manila peace talks were originally scheduled to  resume on mid-June, after the first talks held in Jakarta last  year.    Irawan Abidin did not deny that Jakarta has expected Manila  to abrogate the conference due to take place in Philippine  university from May 31 through June 3.    "If it is still carried out as scheduled, surely we'd regard  it as "improper," said Abidin, who refused to consider his  statement as a threat.    Foreign Minister Ali Alatas has previously described the  entitled "Asia-Pacific Conference on East Timor" previously as a  political campaign against Indonesia's national integrity  instead of an academic seminar discussing about the human rights.    His statement was based upon the fact that Jose Ramos Horta,  an East Timorese figure who opposes the East Timor integration  into Indonesia, Filipino leftist Renato Constantino, and Cecilia  Jimenez were among the conference's organizers.    Commenting on the Philippine Embassy's statement that its  government would try to limit the topics to be discussed during  the conference, Alatas firmly said that it would not be enough.    "I don't see how a political discussion could be limited,"  he  added and reaffirmed that Jakarta regarded the conference as  political activities.    Spokeswoman of the Philippine Embassy in Jakarta, Sonya  Braddy, earlier told a delegation of the Indonesian Youth  National Committee (KNPI) that Manila does not want to annoy its  bilateral relations with Indonesia due to the conference.    "The Philippines would try to minimize or even to eliminate  any provocative attempts which could emerge in discussing the  substances of the conference," the KNPI chairman, Tubagus  Haryono, quoted Braddy as saying.    In the meantime, Irawan Abidin stated that he could not  receive the reason that the Philippine Government could not  cancel the conference as it is organized by a non-governmental  organization in a university that has its own autonomy.    "I'm sure that the Philippine Constitution is containing  articles, which acknowledge the government to take a certain  action considering its national interest," Abidin concluded.</p>

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: Grumman offered higher price for fast deal Northrop, which is bidding for defence group Grumman against Martin Marietta, said yesterday it was willing to increase its offer from Dollars 60 to Dollars 62 a share if Grumman was prepared to agree an immediate merger. The unusual move in the Dollars 2bn battle seemed designed to exert pressure on Grumman to change the ground rules it has laid down for an auction of the company, which Northrop says are unfair. However, Grumman later rejected Northrop's proposals and said it would continue with the auction. Grumman has called on both Northrop and Martin Marietta to submit their best and final offers by 5.00pm New York time today. It wants to spend Easter weekend evaluating the proposals and announce a winner on Monday morning - laying down an unusually short timetable for a US takeover. However, Northrop yesterday said it could not accept this timetable, arguing that to be fair a bidding procedure must be open and public, giving each bidder a reasonable opportunity to respond to the other's offer. Northrop's current hostile offer of Dollars 60 a share is Dollars 5 a share higher than the friendly bid for Grumman being made by Martin Marietta. However, Northrop said that to demonstrate its commitment to an open bidding process, it was prepared to proceed immediately to Dollars 62 a share, but this would only remain on the table until 3.00pm today. If Grumman had not accepted the offer by then, it would expire and Northrop's Dollars 60 a share offer would remain in effect. Northrop noted that if Grumman agreed its proposal,it would mean that the two bidders faced the same takeover costs. At present, Martin Marietta has a financial advantage because of a merger agreement which lays down that Grumman will pay it Dollars 50m compensation if another bidder acquires the company.</p>

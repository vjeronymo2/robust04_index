			<p>BFN     [Text] The Human Rights Coordinating Board has requested  that the Red Cross Organization verify reports of alleged  murders in the area where the Army is attacking the so-called  "Popular Guerrilla Army," the armed branch of the Shining Path  [SL], which is comprised of some 250 men armed with North Korean  AKM rifles.    The Human Rights Coordinating Board, however, disclosed  information according to which Army troops had allegedly  murdered innocent people with no clash having taken place, but  Rosa Mujica, board president, admitted that they lack  information on the exact number of victims. The Coordinating  Board nevertheless demanded that the military offensive be  suspended.    EXPRESO yesterday interviewed Ernesto de La Jara, president  of the Institute for Legal Defense, who went to the zone where  the alleged massacre took place.    [EXPRESO] What did you see?    [De La Jara] I spoke to many locals. Even we were surprised.  An incredible number of civilians have been massacred in a zone  where there are no Shining Path members. We received the direct  testimony of terrified people, who had managed to get away after  many days. I have no political interest. We couldn't believe  what they told us, we couldn't understand why this had happened.    [EXPRESO] Do you mean to say that the SL is not in that  area?    [De La Jara] The SL is not in the zone where these people  were massacred, that is, on the left margin of the Huallaga  River, in front of Anda and Aucayacu, in the villages of Moena  and Moyuna. The SL is further inland. The people are terrified  of the SL. They want them to be completely wiped out. They  say: "Go in and kill the SL members, but not us." Many people  do not even belong to the zone; they come for the harvest season  and leave.    [EXPRESO] Why would the Army attack a zone where there are  no  SL members?    [De La Jara] The head of the political-military front  believes that all the people of that zone belong to the SL,  because the SL has been through there many times. It is as if  businessmen who have paid protection fees were members of the  SL. We are talking about humble people with no resources...    [EXPRESO] Where have you been?    [De La Jara] We tried to enter the zone, but were not  allowed  to do so. But a priest, Father Gilberto Hume, did...    [EXPRESO] But who warned you?    [De La Jara] The people of the zone who managed to get away  and come to Lima, people from the church. The bishop of  Artales, Huanuco, has agreed to go now...    [EXPRESO] Don't you think the SL itself got you to go to the  zone?    [De La Jara] The SL has been defeated; it is not capable of  that. It is a matter of going to the zone to see and hear what  the people have to say. Several witnesses have talked about 40  or 50 people. Others say more...    [EXPRESO] But there might be SL members, there might have  been a battle.    [De La Jara] But there have been no clashes...    [EXPRESO] How do you know?    [De La Jara] The witnesses, the peasants said so. They say  that first they appeared with helicopters and machine guns.  Later on, Army troops destroyed and burned the huts. Those who  managed to get away by hiding were the ones who told us what had  happened.    [EXPRESO] But it might have been SL members or people  handled  by the SL.    [De La Jara] It is a question of seeing and listening to  them. They are humble people, in tears, terrified. They would  have to have been very good actors.    [EXPRESO] The nucleus of the Popular Guerrilla Army is  supposed to be there.    [De La Jara] Further inland, at a great distance. In a  completely different zone...    [EXPRESO] They might have gone through that zone. What makes  no sense is that the Army should have gone in to kill just for  fun.    [De La Jara] I repeat, there have been no clashes. They were  machine-gunned from helicopters. The plan was to kill everyone  in the zone. We have the testimony of a great number of  witnesses... Moreover, the way they kill people is atrocious,  and this was said by several people: They rip babies out of  pregnant women, they let people bleed to death, autopsies have  been practiced. We do not even want an investigation. We want  the operation to end. We have a copy of the testimony before  the Huanuco prosecutor's office of a woman explaining how they  killed her husband and eight peasants in front of her, and how  eight members of the patrol raped her and 10 raped a 13-year-old  girl. It is terrifying, unexplainable.</p>

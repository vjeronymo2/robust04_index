			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / China agrees HK harbour project THE prospects for a Sino-British agreement on the financing of Hong Kong's multi-billion dollar airport project brightened yesterday when China gave its approval for the construction of the western harbour crossing - one of the HKDollars 165bn (Pounds 13.96bn) project's nine core elements. British negotiators came away from the talks cautiously optimistic about a solution to larger issues. Mr Anthony Galsworthy, leader of the UK team, said after the meeting: 'We made real progress this morning.' UK officials later said that for the first time in a year of talks Chinese negotiators had got down to detailed discussions about financing. 'We wanted a response from them to our financial proposals and we got one,' said one member of the British team. Both sides are keeping tightlipped about the Hong Kong government's latest proposal for financing the airport authority - which will manage the Chek Lap Kok airport - and a connecting railway which will be built and run by the mass transit railway corporation. The talks are being conducted by the airport committee of the Sino-British joint liaison group. The committee has agreed to meet again by the end of this month, but British officials do not expect all issues to be settled by then. However, they took heart at Beijing's decision to approve the western harbour crossing, the franchise for which had been provisionally awarded to a consortium including Wharf, an existing tunnel operator in Hong Kong, and Citic Pacific, Beijing's listed investment arm in Hong Kong. China had been informed that the Hong Kong government would be unable to meet its June 1997 deadline for the completion of the airport and related projects unless the companies awarded the franchise won approval to proceed with the HKDollars 7bn project. The government has also informed the Chinese of another pressing deadline associated with the central and Wanchai land reclamation. Only part of this is for the airport railway. British officials hope that at the next meeting of the airport committee the Chinese will allow this project to proceed. The finance committee of Hong Kong's Legislative Council, the colony's law making body, yesterday approved interim funding of HKDollars 562m for the provisional airport authority.</p>

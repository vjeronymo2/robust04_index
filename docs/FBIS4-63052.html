			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Oleg Rubnikovich report under the "Details" rubric: </F> "Reshuffle in the General Prosecutor's Office"]    [Text] Last Saturday Boris Yeltsin issued an edict  replacing three deputies to the Russian Federation General  Prosecutor. Only one deputy -- Vildan Uzbekov -- retains his  position. His resignation request was turned down, unlike those  of Eduard Denisov, Ivan Zemlyanushin, and Vladimir Kravtsev. It  will be recalled that all four handed in resignation requests  after the example of former general prosecutor Aleksey Kazannik.    At the moment Ivan Zemlyanushin and Vladimir Kravtsev are on  vacation and will be given jobs in prosecutor's office bodies  upon their return, with their preferences taken into account.  According to some information, Mr. Kravtsev was offered a  rather high position in this same General Prosecutor's Office  even before his vacation. Eduard Denisov has since been  appointed deputy to the Moscow Oblast prosecutor.    All those resigned and newly appointed to deputy positions  have a substantial length of service with the prosecuting  bodies. Oleg Gaydanov joined the General Prosecutor's Office  under Aleksey Kazannik and headed the investigation directorate.  Valentin Panichev, who joined it under Valentin Stepankov,  retains his position of chief military prosecutor. Mikhail  Slavgorodskiy, who also joined the service under Stepankov and  was dismissed under Kazannik, is back in the prosecuting  citadel. A question to be resolved today is what are to be the  areas of responsibility of Mr. Ilyushenko's new deputies.</p>

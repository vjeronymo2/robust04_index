			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN'S KILLING A MISTAKE, IRA SAYS  </P> <P> The outlawed Irish Republican Army said Friday that a British soldier's wife  was shot and killed in the mistaken belief that she was a member of the British  armed forces.  </P> <P> Thursday night's slaying was the third IRA attack in two weeks but the first  killing of a woman civilian in years of IRA attacks on British forces in West  Germany.  </P> <P> The IRA on Friday acknowledged the killing. The Irish Republican Press Center  in Dublin said she was shot "in the belief that she was a member of the British  army garrison at Dortmund."  </P> <P> A British Army spokeswoman identified the dead woman as Heidi Hazell, a West  German citizen who had been married for two years and had no children.  </P> <P> "There is a mood of anger here that our families, not just soldiers, can no  longer go about their daily business normally," a British army spokeswoman told  the Reuters news agency by telephone from the Moenchengladbach headquarters of  the British Army of the Rhine.  </P> <P> Hazell was sitting in her parked car in Unna, near the Ruhr industrial city of  Dortmund, when a man dressed in British army fatigues approached and fired 14  rounds at her through the window, a prosecutor's spokesman said.  </P> <P> He said the weapon was a Soviet-made Kalashnikov submachine gun. The gunman  escaped in a car driven by an accomplice, he said.  </P> <P> The IRA is waging an underground war to oust British troops from Northern  Ireland and join the province to the Irish republic.  </P></p>

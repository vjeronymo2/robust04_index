			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Government Bonds: Strong gains in European notes as interest rates ease EUROPEAN bond prices rallied yesterday, buoyed by the Bundesbank's cut in the variable-rate repo to 8 1/4 per cent, and the easing of interest rates in the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark. German, Dutch and Belgian bonds all ended substantially higher on the day as dealers returned to speculation about the chances of a two-speed Europe, but other markets also benefited from the rate easing. The Bundesbank had announced a cut in its fixed-rate repo to 8 1/4 per cent on Friday, but dealers were waiting for confirmation yesterday that the new variable-rate repo would be set in line with the fixed-rate repo. The move fuelled expectations that a key interest rate reduction will emerge from the next Bundesbank council meeting, on March 18. Bund prices rose half a point, after hopes of further easing were sparked by rate cuts in the Netherlands and Belgium. THE DUTCH and the Belgian authorities acted in tandem to reduce rates, following the Bundesbank move, sparking price gains in both bond markets. Discount rates in both countries were reduced by by  1/4 point to 7 1/4 per cent. The Belgian National Bank said the move took into account the recent easing of German rates and had been facilitated by the strength of the Belgian franc. Dutch 10-year bond prices rallied  5/8 point, while 30-year bond prices rose more than a point, and 10-year Dutch bond yields ended three basis points below comparable bund yields. Prices in 10-year Belgian bonds rallied by around  3/8 point following the rate moves. THE DANISH bond market rallied strongly yesterday, adding to larger gains made on Tuesday, when the market soared ahead. The authorities cut interest rates by half a point yesterday, sparking a rally in the bond market of more than half a point. FRENCH government bonds recovered after a weak start to end half a point higher. However, the tone of the market remains rather nervous in the run up to the National Assembly elections later this month. THE GILTS market ended  1/4 point higher yesterday, boosted by news that the latest Pounds 300m gilt tap had been absorbed by the market. Dealers are now focusing on next week's Budget, with widespread speculation that this will include a move to deal with the government's mounting public sector borrowing requirement. ITALIAN bond prices recovered somewhat yesterday, after prime minister Giuliano Amato won a key vote of confidence in the Senate. Prices ended about  1/4 point higher THE US bond market traded somewhat erratically yesterday after posting early gains, although ultimately prices were little changed across the board. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/16 at 104 15/16 , yielding 6.736 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was down  1/32 at 99 23/32 , to yield 4.013 per cent. In the middle of the maturity range, however, prices were slightly weaker amid reports of selling by the German central bank. The seven-year note was down  7/32 at 104 1/4 , yielding 5.612 per cent. Prices at the short and long end of the market opened firmer, aided by continued defeasance buying by municipal funds, and some short covering by dealers. After dropping back soon after midday, prices recovered on reports that the Senate Budget Committee was looking at a plan to slash issuance of 30-year bonds by the Treasury. The Treasury secretary, however, later said there would be no dramatic change in the debt mix, and prices eased off their highs.</p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Maxwell companies and funds file fraud claims THE MAXWELL companies and pension funds have taken the first steps to file claims under some Pounds 50m of insurance policies intended to protect them against fraud, it emerged yesterday. The policies, held jointly by the companies, were taken out on the instructions of Mr Robert Maxwell. The companies contacted Willis Corroon, the policies' insurance broker, following Mr Maxwell's death in November and the subsequent discovery that about Pounds 900m of assets and pension money had been diverted to his collapsing private companies. The three policies, for fidelity, directors' and officers' liability and pension trustees' indemnity, include clauses insuring the Maxwell companies against employee dishonesty, robbery, forgery, counterfeit, and computer fraud. American International Underwriters, the US insurance group, confirmed yesterday that it was the lead underwriter for the fidelity policy, covering losses from staff dishonesty. Syndicates at Lloyd's of London are among insurers backing a directors' and officers' insurance policy. Sun Alliance is among insurers for a policy against losses from negligence by pension fund trustees. The policy does not cover a shortfall in the pension funds. It is understood that in a letter on February 15, Willis Corroon told the Maxwell risk management department that the initial notification 'lacks adequate specificity for it to be accepted as valid notification of a claim on these policies'.</p>

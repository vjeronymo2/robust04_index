Presiding Judge Koji Maki said "business deals former  executives made in the name of Marubeni are valid," fully  supporting claims by the trustees of Iida Sangyo Co., based in  Fukuoka, who demanded for payment of the outstanding sum by  Marubeni.    Iida Sangyo executives made no mistake in accepting orders  sealed and placed by Marubeni officials, as "according to the  commercial code the former (Marubeni) executives were acting as  trade employees with the powers of representation," the ruling  said.    Marubeni, Iida Sangyo and Kyowa Co., a now-defunct  steel-frame producer, signed a sales contract for steel frames  in March 1986.    From that time, Marubeni placed orders with Kyowa through  Iida Sangyo, which also advanced the money for the deals.    Marubeni refused to refund Iida Sangyo a total of 3.65  billion yen for six orders placed between April to September  1990, claiming it had not placed any new orders with the company  after August 1988.    Due to the outstanding 3.6 billion yen owed by Marubeni and  further claims amounting to 2.2 billion yen against Kyowa, Iida  Sangyo had to file for bankruptcy. The Fukuoka District Court  eventually declared the company insolvent in February 1991.</p>

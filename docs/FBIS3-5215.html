Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Tom Hubbard held himself  personally responsible for the ill-timed and misworded comments  on the South Korean security law, admitting that he was not the  appropriate person to make such remarks, Ministry officials said.    An official from the South Korean Embassy in Washington met  with Hubbard and was told the United States does not plan to  raise the issue as part of the bilateral agenda, they said.    "We believe that Mr. Hubbard made these remarks in his  capacity as deputy secretary of state," one official said.    Hubbard told a seminar on Feb. 25 that the United States  hopes South Korea will abolish its National Security Law, which  bars any unauthorized contact with North Korea or any activities  sympathetic to the communist regime.    The remarks came under immediate fire as unwelcome  interference in Seoul's internal affairs. Hubbard drew even  more criticism because he was chief U.S. working-level delegate  to nuclear negotiations with North Korea.    At the meeting with South Korean Embassy official, Hubbard  reasserted that his statements were in line with Washington's  1993 human rights report, which said the South Korean law is  subject to abuse.    Admitting his personal responsibility, Hubbard said he  should  not have made such comments in light of his capacity as chief  negotiator with Pyongyang on nuclear affairs, officials said.</p>

			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Observer: Return of the gang show When was the last time there was a really inspired choice of chairman of one of Britain's blue chip companies? Take yesterday's clutch of announcements. Sir Christopher Benson, the property developer, is going to be the chairman of Sun Alliance, Geoffrey Maitland Smith gets Hammerson Property and Thorn EMI boss Sir Colin Southgate inherits PowerGen. Where, however, are all the new faces? Sir Christopher is a chartered surveyor who has spent most of his life with MEPC, which is scarcely one of the great success stories of the property world. Much the same applies to Sears, the retailer, where Maitland Smith has been chairman since 1985. As for Sir Colin Southgate, now he has his seat on the Bank of England court, he must already have a great many demands upon his time. At least Sir Graham Day, PowerGen's outgoing chairman was different. Bearded and from Canada, he has a reputation for knocking heads together. Just imagine the excitement if the chairmanship of one of Britain's insurance companies or clearing banks was passed on to a hot-shot retailer like Argyll's Sir Alastair Grant or a successful industrialist like BTR's Sir Owen Green. Instead, it often seems that - in the City at any rate - top jobs keep on being handed out to the same type of people, who then hang on to them. The chairman of General Accident has been a director for more than 30 years and the chairmen of GRE, Commercial Union and Sun Alliance has each been a director of his respective organisation for more than 20 years. Many such organisations would surely benefit from an infusion of fresh blood. But perhaps the really successful businessmen capable of providing it are too busy already.</p>

			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL;  </P> <P> TOMCZAK PASSES TEST AS BEARS BEAT DETROIT  </P> <P> Chicago quarterback Mike Tomczak silenced some critics and impressed his coach  Sunday in leading the Bears to a 47-27 victory against Detroit.  </P> <P> Tomczak, who had completed only 40% of his passes this season, hit 17 of 25 for  a career-high 302 yards to help the Bears improve to 3-0.  </P> <P> The Bears finished with 542 total yards while holding the Lions to 305.  </P> <P> "Mike came out firing," Chicago Coach Mike Ditka said. "He gunned the ball and  the receivers caught it."  </P> <P> Tomczak is 19-3 as a starter for the Bears, 18-3 in regular-season games.  </P> <P> In leading Chicago over Detroit for the 10th straight time, Tomczak frequently  victimized cornerback Jerry Holmes.  </P> <P> "I had a great day passing-wise," Tomczak said. "It seemed like we were scoring  on every possession out there. We knew we had to put some points on the board  because they can be so explosive.  </P> <P> "It wasn't anything we ad-libbed. We sent one guy long on almost every pass  play. They got behind the defense and I was fortunate enough to get the ball to  them."  </P> <P> Jim Harbaugh replaced Tomczak for the last five minutes and got the Bears'  final score on a one-yard keeper.  </P> <P> Chicago's Neal Anderson carried 16 times for 116 yards, including a 53-yard  touchdown run, and Kevin Butler kicked four field goals.  </P> <P> Detroit's Barry Sanders, the 1988 Heisman Trophy winner, carried 18 times for  126 yards and a touchdown before leaving with a hip pointer early in the third  quarter. Quarterback Bob Gagliano ran for two touchdowns and Eddie Murray  kicked two field goals for the Lions (0-3).  </P> <P> Gagliano completed nine of 19 passes for 126 yards with three interceptions.  </P></p>

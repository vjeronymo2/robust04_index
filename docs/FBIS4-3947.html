			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 25 (CNA) -- Taiwan's reliance on the  mainland Chinese market continued to rise last year, while the  mainland's trade dependence on Taiwan declined, the government  said Monday [25 April].    The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), which sets the country's  policy toward Beijing, said exports to the mainland accounted  for 16.47 percent of Taiwan's total outbound shipments in 1993.    It was the highest ratio since the government began to tally  commercial exchanges across the Taiwan Strait in 1981, the  council noted. In 1992, mainland-bound shipments made up 12.95  percent of the island's total overseas sales.    Imports from the mainland accounted for a modest 1.43  percent  of Taiwan's total purchases from abroad in 1993, according to  MAC tallies.    Altogether, two-way trade with the mainland made up 9.32  percent of Taiwan's total foreign trade, also a new record, the  council said, quoting statistics released by local and Hong Kong  customs authorities.    Meanwhile, mainland China's trade dependence on Taiwan  declined last year for the first time since 1986, the council  said.    Indirect cross-strait trade via Hong Kong made up 4.44  percent of Mainland China's total foreign trade in 1993, down  0.03 percent from the 1992 level.    Shipments destined for Taiwan accounted for only 1.2 percent  of the mainland's aggregate overseas sales last year, while  purchases from Taiwan made up 7.3 percent of its total imports.    In addition, the council said that Taiwan has gradually lost  to the mainland in overseas markets.    "The mainland has overtaken U.S. in our two major export  markets -- the United States and Japan," a MAC official said.    Quoting statistics compiled by Taiwan and U.S. authorities,  the official said America imported U.S.$24.98 billion worth of  goods from Taiwan last year, up 1.83 percent from 1992, while  its imports from the mainland rose a hefty 23.17 percent to  U.S.$31.43 billion.    Mainland China's share of the U.S. market stood at 5.47  percent in 1993, higher than Taiwan's 4.35 percent, the official  noted. It was the second year in a row Taiwan lost to the  mainland in the American market. The mainland took a 4.8  percent share of the U.S. market in 1992, while Taiwan's share  was 4.67 percent.    The mainland has outpaced Taiwan in the Japanese market  since  1982 and the gap has widened steadily, the official said.    Japan imported U.S.$9.68 billion worth of Taiwan goods last  year, while its imports from the mainland reached U.S.$20.56  billion. The mainland commanded an 8.55 percent share of  Japan's total imports, more than double Taiwan's 4.02 percent  share.    The official noted that increased Taiwan investment on the  mainland has helped boost the mainland's exports while  undermining Taiwan's own competitiveness in major overseas  markets.    Many Taiwan-owned companies on the mainland produce goods  similar to their counterparts at home, the official explained.  Slow technological development has made Taiwan manufacturers  less competitive than their mainland counterparts, he added.    Government tallies show Mainland China remained Taiwan's top  overseas investment destination last year. Government approved  outbound investment totaled U.S.$4.83 billion in 1993, of which  65.61 percent went to the mainland. Hong Kong and mainland  estimates of Taiwan investment in the mainland are much higher.</p>

			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Tax official 'gave Nadir details to Stock Exchange': Solicitor confirms link in Revenue inquiries A SENIOR Inland Revenue official passed information about Mr Asil Nadir's affairs to the London Stock Exchange in the months before Mr Nadir's arrest, according to a solicitor acting for the official. Mr Michael Jones, a solicitor acting for Mr Michael Allcock, the suspended head of the Inland Revenue's special section 2, which deals with high profile tax investigations, confirmed yesterday that his client had been 'instrumental in the detection of Mr Nadir's affairs and the subsequent referral thereof to the Serious Fraud Office'. He said that Mr Allcock passed some of the information he had gathered from his investigation to the Stock Exchange. It is understood that the Exchange and the Inland Revenue have in the past swapped information on an informal basis. The Inland Revenue said yesterday that it was prevented by law from disclosing information on taxpayers' affairs to third parties, including the police, other than in highly exceptional circumstances. In his resignation speech on Tuesday, Mr Michael Mates, former Northern Ireland Minister, said there had been improper collusion between a senior officer of the Inland Revenue and the SFO. It appears that Mr Allcock did not deal directly with the SFO, but passed some information to the Insider Trading Unit of the Stock Exchange. The Exchange yesterday refused to comment. The political storm over the activities of the SFO also took a new twist yesterday as a senior Liberal Democrat MP made fresh allegations over the SFO's handling of a separate investigation. The accusations came straight after Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, had promised to publish letters between himself and Mr Mates, as he responded in detail to the sensational claims about the SFO's handling of the case against Mr Nadir. Cross-party concern among MPs was intensified by the revelation that an SFO official had last year forged a letter purporting to come from Sir David Steel, the senior Liberal Democrat MP, in a separate case, related to the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Sir Nicholas said he had apologised for the forgery, which he admitted was 'a very serious error of judgment, a stupid thing to do'. He described it as 'an April Fool's joke' and said the matter had been dealt with internally. Sir David said that from October 1991 he had raised with the then attorney-general the handling by the SFO of the investigation of Control Securities Ltd, whose chairman and chief executive, Mr Nazmu Virani, he knew slightly. In March 1992, Mr Virani was charged with an offence of conspiracy to defraud, and just before the first court hearing, at which the SFO opposed bail, an SFO official showed his solicitor a letter purporting to be from Sir David, saying that he would be attending the hearing. Meanwhile, Sir Nicholas's insistence that there was no basis for an independent inquiry into the charges made by Mr Mates was broadly accepted at Westminster. But the opposition is still determined that the names of the other MPs who made representations on behalf of Mr Nadir should be disclosed. An edited version of the letters about the accusations in Mr Mates's extraordinary resignation speech will be published shortly, probably today, but Sir Nicholas dealt with the main claims yesterday. On the most serious claim that the SFO had tried to put 'im-proper pressure' on the trial judge, he said the alleged conspiracy to bribe the judge was being separately investigated by the police under the supervision of the director of public prosecutions. This had revealed no 'credible evidence' implicating the judge personally. He admitted that two bags containing some privileged legal documents had been opened in error by some police officers, but said other papers and effects taken on behalf of the trustee in bankruptcy had been taken in accordance with a court order. Mr John Fraser, Labour's legal affairs spokesman, expressed scepticism at Mr Mates's claims, but shared the unease at the idea that the SFO sought to generate publicity for arrests and gave the media advance information. Sir Nicholas said he deplored this, and had repeatedly raised the issue with Mr George Staple, the director of the SFO, but that the number of people who needed advance warning of arrests meant there was plenty of scope for the media to be tipped off or to draw their own inferences. Sir Nicholas emphasised throughout that, apart from the publicity attaching to the arrests, the matters raised related to the court proceedings, and thus were essentially for the trial judge.

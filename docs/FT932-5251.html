			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / International Company News: Kaufhof expects sharp rise in earnings for year PROFITS at Kaufhof, the German retailing group, are expected to rise significantly despite the difficult economic climate in Germany, Mr Jens Odewald, chief executive, said yesterday. The group said that it planned to create 7,000 new jobs by 1995, of which 5,000 will be in Germany. Kaufhof said it would add 73 new businesses to its 1,012 branches by the end of the year. European countries other than Germany account for 20 per cent of the company's sales. Group sales in the first five months of the year increased by 6.2 per cent to DM8.2bn (Dollars 5.1bn). For the whole of 1992 sales were DM22.5bn. Results were boosted by sales in eastern Germany which rose in 1992 by 29 per cent. In comparison, sales in the western part of the country increased by 7.8 per cent. Mr Odewald did not comment on the 1993 dividend but said the company's reserves would be significantly strengthened this year. Kaufhof plans to pay an unchanged DM12 dividend for 1992. The company is particularly benefiting from its expansions beyond department stores where sales fell by 2.2 per cent to DM3.6bn for the first five months. In contrast, sales in its speciality stores, which include computer and home entertainment shops, are booming.</p>

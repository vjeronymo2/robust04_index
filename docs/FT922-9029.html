			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / How To Spend It: Plan a garden revamp - With the first burst of sunshine, Lucia van der Post has been thinking about the great outdoors ANYONE WITH a garden, however small, or a conservatory which could do with a revamp, should visit Holloways or send for the brochure. Holloways is a family-run business run from a converted oast house in the village of Suckley, near Malvern in Worcestershire, specialising in conservatory interiors and antique garden ornaments. The oast house is filled with everything the proper conservatory could possibly need - from Lloyd Loom to Rattan, from cane to wrought-iron as well as lots of smaller things such as Regency-style plant-holders and bird baths. Possibly the most enchanting section is the outside courtyard which is filled with an eclectic collection of finds gleaned from country houses and auctions all over the UK. You could come upon an ancient stone trough or cider mill, a stone bench, a sundial, an urn or figurine. It is a splendid place to search for a special present - a friend found an antique Georgian sundial which made a wonderful birthday present for his wife. Holloways is at Lower Court, Suckley, Worcestershire WR6 5DE. Tel: 0886-884665. The company will send a set of free brochures to potential customers and is happy to discuss by telephone the sort of one-off antiques that they have in stock, or to search for something particular that you might have in mind.</p>

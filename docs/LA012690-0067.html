			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: N. HOLLYWOOD CHILD MOLESTER SENTENCED TO 23 YEARS  IN PRISON  </P> <P> A 50-year-old North Hollywood man was sentenced Thursday to 23 years in prison  after he pleaded guilty in San Fernando Superior Court to four counts of lewd  conduct with children.  </P> <P> Gerald Kurtz, who has three prior child molestation convictions, was originally  charged with 12 counts of lewd conduct for performing sex acts with two  Antelope Valley boys, ages 9 and 11.  </P> <P> If he had been convicted on all counts, he could have been sentenced to more  than 45 years in prison.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Joseph D. Payne III said he offered Kurtz a plea bargain so  the victims, who are cousins, would not have to testify in a trial.  </P> <P> Kurtz was a friend of the boys' parents. He invited the children to sleep over  at his house where he then forced them to perform sex acts and take  pornographic pictures, Payne said. The encounters took place on several  occasions between September, 1988, and January, 1989.  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies searching Kurtz's apartment found four photo albums filled  with photos of Kurtz on vacations with young boys. They also found 68 pictures  of Kurtz engaged in lewd conduct with the two boys and with many other  children, Payne said. Most of the other children have never been identified.  </P> <P> Kurtz could be eligible for parole in 10 years, Payne said. After his prior  child molestation convictions, Kurtz spent time in mental hospitals, according  to court records.  </P></p>

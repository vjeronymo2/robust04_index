			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Arts: BBC Symphony Orchestra - Royal Festival Hall A favour was inadvertently paid by one orchestra to another at this concert. While the 'Towards the Millennium' festival has been marking the decade 1911-20 by performing standard musical works that we could expect to hear anyway, the BBC has really taken the plunge and scheduled a major rarity from the same years  - a vast and sprawling tone poem as lavish in its orchestral resources as it is ambitious in scope. This was Zran ('Ripening') by Josef Suk. Written in 1912-17, the work is in every way a child of the decade into which it was born. There is an extravagance in the materials used, a lack of discipline about the musical logic, that was typical of the dying embers of romanticism, before war and a new order snuffed out any last flickering desire on the part of composers to write big orchestral works of this kind more or less for good. In its layout, and often in sound too, Zran comes across as a less memorable version of Strauss's Also sprach Zarathustra. A poem by Antonn Sova provides a vague programme; the musical structure is described as fluid (or, to put it less kindly, diffuse). Out of seductive clouds of texture a distinct musical idea will from time to time emerge into the foreground; but as soon as one starts to get a hold on it, it is gone and the listener is left again with an indeterminate wash of sound. So as not to seem entirely ungrateful, it should be stated clearly that those sounds are sometimes beautiful, sometimes formidable, always imaginative. Suk clearly knew how to write for a vast orchestra on a Straussian or Mahlerian scale, replete with seven extra trumpets, piano, celesta and just about as many as possible of everything else. The BBC Symphony Orchestra under Andrew Davis is to be commended for taking up so adventurous a challenge and one imagines that they made a thoroughly professional job of it. They certainly had of the earlier items in this all-Czech programme. Janacek's Sinfonietta was decisively played, bold, rhythmical, assertive. Dvorak's Cello Concerto went with an unproblematical easy lyricism. The soloist in the latter was Heinrich Schiff, whose ability to make any piece of music turn inwards upon itself unlocked in this familiar concerto a private inner sanctum rarely revealed. There is still much in Czech music to explore as the millennium approaches.</p>

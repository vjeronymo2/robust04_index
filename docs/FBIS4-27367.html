			<p>BFN     [Text] Yun Ho-chin, the North Korean senior delegate to the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], held a news  conference in Vienna and said that the ongoing replacement of  fuel rods cannot be suspended but the locations of 40 rods have  been recorded and stored in one basket. Thus, the IAEA will be  able to measure them.    Delegate Yun Ho-chin added that the fuel rods have been  stored under water in view of an automatic surveillance camera  installed by the IAEA.</p>

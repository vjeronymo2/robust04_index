			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOM WAITS SUES FRITO-LAY, SAYS HIS VOICE APPROPRIATED  </P> <P> Singer Tom Waits testified Thursday that he was shocked, embarrassed, and  "angry -- very angry," the first time he heard a corn chip radio jingle that  imitated his voice.  </P> <P> "Somebody had studied me a little too close," Waits said on the third day of  what is expected to be a two-week trial in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "It was the equivalent of all the scars, dimples, the lines all being in the  same place. . . . It was a little spooky."  </P> <P> Attorneys for Waits are trying to persuade U.S. District Court jurors of a  novel claim: that his voice was illegally impersonated when Frito-Lay Inc. of  Plano, Tex., used a sound-alike artist in an ad campaign for a new corn chip,  the Salsa Rio Dorito. Waits has asked for at least $4 million from Frito-Lay  and its ad agency, Tracey-Locke Inc. of Dallas, because they allegedly damaged  his reputation and conducted a false advertising campaign by airing the  commercial, which sounds very similar to Waits' "Step Right Up."  </P> <P> Earlier in the trial, Steve Carter, the Texan who sang in the commercial,  testified that while doing the commercial, he deliberately tried to copy Waits'  voice.  </P></p>

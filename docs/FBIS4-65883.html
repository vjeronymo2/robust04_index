			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Francois Leotard signed </F> "mnk" and "hon"; place and date not given: "In Future Crises,  the United Nations Should Rely on Organizations Such as NATO"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [CESKY DENIK] France is  pursuing an active policy in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Your country  has dispatched the largest military contingent within the  framework of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force]. What is your  assessment of the presence of French units in the former  Yugoslavia from the point of view of French interests in the  Balkans?    [Leotard] From the beginning, France has been pursuing a  policy of active presence in the former Yugoslavia. This  involvement seems natural to us: As President Mitterrand has  said, what is happening in the former Yugoslavia "concerns us."  The people of the former Yugoslavia are our neighbors and their  problems -- ethnic, social -- concern Europe.    The stability of this complex Balkan region will partially  depend on the outcome that this conflict will eventually cause.  Therefore, the crisis merits not only our attention, but also  our active involvement. This concern compels the French  Government toward constant diplomatic efforts, the aim of which  is a balanced and lasting peace settlement.    Nevertheless, the presence of French units in Bosnia and  Croatia is not only linked to French interests in the Balkans:  The mission of the blue helmets in Bosnia is, first and  foremost, a humanitarian mission (accompanying convoys,  providing an air bridge, dropping food and medicines from  aircraft, removing mines, and renewing public services).    France could not stand ildly when confronted with the urgent  needs of such a suffering people and, therefore, our military  contingents are involved fully in these humanitarian missions,  which always carry some risk.    [CESKY DENIK] At the moment, it seems that the NATO  ultimatum  in Sarajevo has been crowned in success. In your opinion, is it  at all possible to supervise militarily the observance of other  possible protection zones?    [Leotard] It is certainly possible to supervise militarily  adherence to these ultimatums. This has been made clear,  especially in Sarajevo, where the UNPROFOR units and military  observers have not only been overseeing adherence to the  agreement, but -- on the other hand -- have also been bringing  the city to life.    This supervision, however, requires a large military  presence. Whereas the United Nations requested 10,500 troops to  guarantee adherence to the agreements -- which is the bare  minimum -- the international community could only react by  making an offer corresponding to half this number. France has  800 more men here. Under these circumstances, the United Nations  must work with the numbers it has at its disposal and must  expend a great deal of effort in providing for the most pressing  needs.    [CESKY DENIK] Mr. Minister, do you think that the West made  a  mistake in its policy toward the former Yugoslavia?    [Leotard] The activity of western countries in the former  Yugoslavia could seem hesitant or put off for too long. When  the effects of the ultimatum are considered, the question of why  it was not made sooner is often asked. We would have made it if  the situation earlier had met with political will, as was the  case in February.    It is impossible to forget that this activity is being  carried out within the framework of the United Nations, which is  responsible politically for the entire operation in the former  Yugoslavia.    The countries involved in Bosnia and Croatia have fulfilled  the mandate, a mandate that was again determined by specific  options.    The West's international and military organizations (the  European Union [EU], NATO, and the Western European Union [WEU])  do not have to be ashamed of their activity. Seven EU members  have troops in the former Yugoslavia, all the others are  providing aid, sometimes considerable aid, and they are  accepting numerous refugees. As far as the West's diplomatic  activity is concerned, it has been conducted particularly  forcefully with the aim of finding a real solution to long-term  problems.    [CESKY DENIK] Do you think that international organizations  like NATO or the United Nations have a chance -- following their  experiences in Somalia and now in Bosnia -- of resolving local  conflicts in the future?    [Leotard] We have to learn from the major crises of the past  two or three years. The UN operations in Cambodia, Somalia, and  Bosnia -- although very different -- suggest that blue helmet  missions should, in the future, intervene closer to open  conflicts or local clashes rather than merely uphold the  traditional role of supervising the suspension of hostilities.    Then, within this framework, the international community  must  formulate clear political aims and the feasibility of  supervising directly the command of the military forces in the  area of their deployment. Undoubtedly, an important  prerequisite for this is to ensure that, next time, the United  Nations or the CSCE rely on the resources of military  organizations such as NATO or the WEU, which have the  possibility of intervening with maximum efficacy. I emphasize  this point, for experience from Bosnia has shown us that there  is no purely military way out of such complicated conflicts.</p>

			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / UK Company News: King &amp; Shaxson in acquisition negotiations King &amp; Shaxson Holdings, the banking, money broking and discounting concern, turned in lower pre-tax profits of Pounds 761,908 for the six months to October 31 1993, compared with Pounds 3.09m. The directors also announced that discussions were taking place with a view to acquiring Greig Middleton Holdings, the principal subsidiary of which is a member of the Stock Exchange. The consideration would be entirely in the form of K&amp;S shares or share related consideration, involving the issue of up to 12m shares in total. The main activities of Greig, a private concern, are investment management and financial advice for clients, brokerage and research services for institutions, and corporate finance. On results, the directors explained that there were no changes in official rates during the six months, whereas a year ago the group was able to benefit 'from the exceptional turmoil surrounding the exit from the ERM'. After tax of Pounds 252,975 (Pounds 1.03m) earnings per share were 2.7p, well down from last time's 12.5p, while the interim dividend is unchanged at 4p. Greig's accounts for the 53 weeks ended July 16 showed turnover of Pounds 19.8m and, following conversion of loan notes, would show pro forma pre-tax profits of Pounds 3m and shareholders' funds at that date of Pounds 7m.</p>

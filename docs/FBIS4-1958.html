			<p>BFN     [Text] The special public security detachment under the  Shenyang City Public Security Bureau recently cracked down in  line with the report made by the mass on an appalling case of  selling and printing pornographic books and periodicals and  illegal publications. It arrested Criminal (Bian Yujie) and  seized 3,000 pornographic books and periodicals and more than  15,000 illegal publications. (Bian Yujie), worker of the  Shenyang cold-rolled steel plant, has engaged in the business of  selling pornographic books and periodicals and illegal  publications since 1989. Beginning from April 1993, Criminal  (Bian) has personally edited pornographic books and periodicals  and illegal publications in order to further reap staggering  profits in the name of the Fupin Medical Publishing House, the  China World Language Publishing House, and the Shannxi People's  Publishing House. He also colluded with (Bian Guangwen),  director of the Xinxing Social Welfare Printing House, in Heze  city of Shandong Province. The composing and printing of these  obscene books and periodicals and illegal publications were  carried out by (Bian Guangwen) with the paper provided by  himself. Then, these publications were consigned for shipment  to Shenyang. According to the confession made by (Bian Yujie),  his books and publications were mainly distributed to the  self-employed books dealers in the cities of Shenyang, Tieling,  and Anshan, as well as in the cities of Shandong Province.

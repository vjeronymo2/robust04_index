			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Arts: Rosmersholm - Theatre This is late-ish Ibsen, which means that it is horribly difficult to play now for full value. Annie Castledine's production is fluent, unfussy, dramatically well-pointed; Joan Tindale has translated the text into easy modern English - though that leaves the principals' unbrookable effusions about Freedom and the Joy of Life sounding eccentrically quaint. For Ibsenites and for theatre-lovers who want to improve their education, this Rosmersholm is seriously collectable, but some way off spot-on. A quick re-cap: Rosmer is a scholarly Pastor (now ex-), the descendant of a distinguished family in his Norwegian town. Widowed when his unstable wife flung herself into the mill-race, he has been not merely consoled by her young nurse-companion Rebekka (as the Young Vic programme insists upon spelling her), but transformed from moralising conservative to radical freethinker. He lends his name to a muckraking liberal journal, and his old Establishment friends - represented by Headmaster Kroll - are scandalised. Kroll unearths some worrying facts about Rebekka; she and Rosmer examine their relationship and their ideals in a bleak new light; tragic denouement. As so often with late and late-ish Ibsen, we can recognise that matters of elevated moral import are at stake - and on a good night, be moved by them; but the theatrical scaffolding designed to raise them high seems period-bound and dusty. To our sceptical ears, everybody sounds naively windy, or plain hypocritical. When we are meant to shudder or feel lofty thrills, we snigger. Sufficiently charismatic playing by the six-strong cast can override the hazards; here, however, six very intelligent performers are all more or less miscast. Corin Redgrave's Rosmer, persuasive in his own terms, is a crumpled teddy-bear, ready with wry, self-deprecating little smiles whilst the text insists upon his sober gravitas. No trace of the former right-thinking orator is detectable, nor therefore any reason why the town's reactionary Right should be so keen to keep him. As Rebekka - a fervently idealistic girl, brought up in the stark North by a liberal stepfather (or perhaps incestuous father) with 'advanced' books - Francesca Annis is irremediably chic, moving sensuously and self-appreciatively, and wielding an urbane, knowing chuckle. Instead of a passionate backwoods Utopian, we see a lady whom Kroll's nasty diagnosis (ambitious, calculating seductress) fits all too well. When she succumbs to it near the end, it seems a matter of facing the unedifying facts, when we ought to feel an engineered subversion of blazing ideals. Similarly, Allan Corduner's Kroll - a pompous, edgy bantam-cock, towered over by Redgrave's gentle Pastor - is so brittly fixed from the start as to devalue his pragmatic wisdom later to cheap point-scoring. Old Ibsen gives his conservative monsters a fairer leash than that. Bernard Lloyd makes Rosmer's unregenerate old tutor little more than a ruined poseur and dandy. Miriam Karlin is curiously enlisted as the Rosmersholm housekeeper: we expect more of her than the role could ever afford, and she treated her final lines (stagey reportage on the double suicide) with numb disdain. The piquant casting of a black actor, Leo Wringer - complete with Afro-Caribbean accent - as the crusading small-town journalist, gives an extra fillip of unreality to the scene. At the Young Vic, SE1, until October 31</p>

			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CARPENTER COULD GET NEW TRIAL;  </P> <P> JUDGE FINDS JURY MISCONDUCT IN TRAILSIDE KILLINGS CASE  </P> <P> A judge's finding Wednesday of jury misconduct during David J. Carpenter's  trial and conviction in five Northern California trailside killings could lead  to a new trial for the San Francisco man.  </P> <P> Despite the finding, Superior Court Judge Herbert Hoffman took no immediate  action regarding the verdict against Carpenter last May in San Diego and the  subsequent death penalty sentence for the 1980 park killings in Marin County.  </P> <P> Hoffman gave Marin County prosecutors until May 1 to file papers on why the  misconduct should not result in a new trial for Carpenter, 58.  </P> <P> Defense attorneys were given until May 22 to file their replies and then both  sides will come back to court June 1 to argue their respective positions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Three-Month Hearing  </P> <P> The judge's ruling followed a hearing stretched over three months involving  allegations that jury forewoman Barbara Durham of Julian improperly knew that  Carpenter already had been sentenced to death for two similar 1981 killings in  Santa Cruz County.  </P> <P> "I'm confident my decision is a correct one, but it does not please me,"  Hoffman said. "I think we need to proceed very carefully because I am  absolutely convinced the evidence, beyond a shadow of a doubt, shows Mr.  Carpenter is guilty.  </P> <P> "Whether this juror misconduct is something that will overturn this conviction  is something we'll have to decide."  </P> <P> The judge apologized to victims' relatives who traveled to San Diego to sit  through Carpenter's trial after it was moved on a change of venue motion  because of extensive publicity about the case in Northern California.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Judicial System Isn't Perfect  </P> <P> "This has to be something that is going to be devastating to them," Hoffman  said of the potential for a retrial. "Our judicial system is the best in the  world, but it's not perfect."  </P> <P> Besides seeking a retrial, the motion filed by Carpenter's attorneys asks that  the death penalty imposed on him last year be vacated.  </P> <P> During the hearing on the defense motion, two acquaintances of Durham testified  that she indicated in a dinner conversation that she had knowledge of  Carpenter's role in the Santa Cruz killings. The conversation occurred last  March, midway through Carpenter's six-month trial, as Durham and her husband  dined with the two at an eastern San Diego County restaurant.  </P> <P> Defense attorneys contend that left her unable to impartially consider the  evidence because of Hoffman's pretrial ruling, which barred jurors from knowing  about Carpenter's previous conviction and death sentence in the Santa Cruz  aspects of case.  </P> <P> Michael Lustig, a San Diego businessman, and his former girlfriend, Barbara  Duran, both quoted Durham as saying: "I'm not supposed to know this, but the  defendant has been convicted of doing the same thing in another county and has  been sentenced to death."  </P> <P> Durham denied she made such a statement.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Memory Was Selective'  </P> <P> Hoffman said, however, that Durham appeared extremely nervous when she took the  stand to respond to the allegations and added that he felt her "memory was  selective."  </P> <P> The judge said he would leave it up to the San Diego County district attorney's  office to decide whether criminal charges should be filed because of the  alleged jury misconduct.  </P> <P> During closing arguments Tuesday, Marin County Deputy Dist. Atty. John Posey  questioned why Lustig took several months to tell anyone about Durham's  purported statement. He claimed Lustig was trying to throw a "monkey wrench"  into the system.  </P> <P> Marin County Public Defender Stephen Berlin suggested that Lustig waited as  long as he did because of concern that he would be viewed as someone who helped  a convicted murderer get away with his crimes and the financial repercussions  that might have on his business.  </P> <P> "He's intelligent, a man of principle . . . (and) someone concerned with the  rules of the game," Berlin told Hoffman.  </P> <P> The judge agreed with Berlin, saying he found Lustig to be a "complex  personality but a credible witness."  </P> <P> "There is no reward for Mr. Lustig, given the general public's feeling about  this case. If he wanted publicity, it would have been easier to come straight  out instead of using an attorney," Hoffman said.  </P></p>

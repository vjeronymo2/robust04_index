Of brave men there is no shortage. Lieutenant-General Sir  Michael Rose and the exemplary soldiers of the French contingent  now deploying along the lines in Sarajevo offer proof of that.  But unity of purpose among the Western allies, often fragile  during this war, must be enforced with ruthless will. A few  powers still provide the military reserves to underwrite the  world's moral outrage. They need to steel themselves to hold  fast to their resolve in the face of prevarication, cunning and  bluff. Serbian guns must be removed from within 12.5 miles of  Sarajevo or placed under United Nations control before the NATO  deadline expires.    Nothing else is thinkable now. No compromise, no  half-hearted extension of deadlines, no acceptance of the  predictable excuses by Dr Karadzic, no tolerance of the whims of  General Ratko Mladic, the man who used artillery against  Sarajevo as a village butcher might wield his meat cleaver. It  is fine and welcome that the urbane Vitaliy Churkin should  descend upon Pale with a letter from Boris Yeltsin and the  promise of compliance. But to announce that 400 Russian troops  serving with the United Nations will be rushed to the area  smacks of the days when Soviet pawns were shuffled around a Cold  War chessboard, here to block an opponent's move, there to seize  an opportunity.    The Russians should briskly be invited to play their part in  the full implementation of UN resolution 638, which they  supported in its call for "all necessary measures" to help  UNPROFOR [UN Protective Forces] to fulfill its mandate. The  Serbs have feasted upon inconsistency and with skill exploited  every weak link in Western policy. We are told that the  generals and bureaucrats are now in agreement as to what  constitutes United Nations "control" of Serbian artillery  remaining within the radius. It must mean nothing less than  disabling the weapons or placing them in the custody of properly  armed UN troops with orders to fight to defend them. This  latest Russian twist makes it all the more imperative for NATO  and the United Nations to sort out the chain of command and  responsibility in former Yugoslavia.    If anyone doubted that the stakes in Bosnia now far outweigh  the intrinsic issues in this miserable contest of intolerance,  let them reflect upon the events of this week. Greece bludgeons  Macedonia and scorns its European partners. Russia strives to  recapture its role in the Balkans. Factions in Washington push  policy forwards and backwards and the great nations of West  Europe seem united only in their shared discomfort. And all the  while, from North Korea to Tehran and, yes, Algiers, sharp and  hostile eyes await the outcome of this test.</p>

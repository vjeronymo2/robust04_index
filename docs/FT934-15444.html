			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Mail order from the Prince's Trust - In a Nutshell The Prince's Youth Business Trust, which helps young people get started in business and whose patron is the Prince of Wales, has produced its first mail order catalogue* featuring the products of businesses started with the aid of the trust. The eight-page catalogue carries details of the products of a dozen companies, but the plan is to expand its coverage in future years. The items range from hand-painted earthenware vases to jewellery, ceramic-faced clocks to umbrellas with a colourful inner lining. Part of the profit made on products sold through the catalogue will go back to the trust which has provided more than Pounds 30m in loans and grants to 18,000 young entrepreneurs. *From PYBT, 5 Cleveland Place, London SW1Y 6JJ.

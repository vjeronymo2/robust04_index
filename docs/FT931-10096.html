			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Grass roots opposition threatens exchange merger THE CHICAGO Board of Trade's proposed take-over of the New York Commodity Exchange (Comex) is on the verge of being derailed by belligerent Comex floor traders who believe the deal unfairly benefits the CBoT. While clearing firms at both exchanges favour the plan for the cost savings it will provide, floor traders are angry that they have been asked to give up their membership equity and voting rights for yet-to-be determined benefits of sharing the CBoT name and an alliance with the world's largest futures exchange. Despite the increasingly institutional nature of futures trading, floor traders still wield the clout in exchange politics and their approval is crucial for the success of the merger plan. 'I think the offer is insulting, it annoys me,' says Mr Vince Zuccarelli, a Comex floor trader and one of the take-over's more vocal opponents. 'The CBoT wants to buy the Comex without putting up any funds. In fact, they want to buy the Comex with Comex funds. What is it the Board of Trade is bringing to the party?' The CBoT has proposed to employ its marketing and administrative expertise to boost Comex trading volume and use funds saved from combining operations to form a trust fund to buy out Comex seats. At a packed member meeting at Comex last week, Mr Patrick Arbor, the CBoT Chairman, was pressed for a financial commitment to the Comex, which he proved reluctant to give. Mr Arbor has since described that meeting as 'emotionally charged' and has stuck to his position. 'Nothing in this deal is carved in granite,' he said, 'but there are some things that are deal breakers.' Specifically, he said the CBOT was not prepared to cover any potential Comex losses or cost overruns. 'Quite frankly, we're businessmen,' he said. The CBoT has sent the plan to a committee of attorneys and accountants. Mr Arbor says it could take 18 months to complete the contract. In the meantime officials at both exchanges will attempt to soft-sell the plan to Comex members. Mr Richard Sandor, a derivatives executive at Kidder Peabody and the architect of the takeover proposal, will pitch the benefits of the plan to Comex traders at a meeting this afternoon. He is likely to encounter traders who share Mr Zuccarelli's belief that a merger with a New York exchange is preferable to a long-distance marriage with the CBoT. New York's five futures exchanges have a history of squabbling with one another. However, the CBoT's take-over bid could force local consolidation even if it fails. If the CBoT plan is refused, another suitor will emerge, predicts Mr Lou Guttman, chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange and a Comex member. 'Comex cannot continue independently as it has the last several years,' he said. Any exchange in the country would be willing to take Comex on the terms proposed by the CBoT, Mr Guttman added.</p>

Kemp] </F>   [Text] Messina March 9 SAPA -- Police on Wednesday fired  rubber shot at a group of African National Congress [ANC]  supporters protesting outside a stadium where National Party  [NP] leader F.W. de Klerk addressed his followers. The  protesters, who claimed they were invited by local NP supporters  to attend the meeting, had earlier toyi-toyied [protest danced]  and chanted slogans as Mr de Klerk's motorcade entered and left  the stadium.    A small group of Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC] activists  chanted the slogan "kill the Boer, kill the farmer" shortly  before the police opened fire. It could not be established  whether anyone was injured in the shooting.    Earlier, Mr de Klerk told about 300 supporters, most of them  black, the NP was a party of peace and would ensure the rights  of every South African. He accused the ANC of intimidating and  threatening people in townships. "The NP will ensure that the  policies of a new government of national unity will help build a  better life for all South Africans," Mr de Klerk said.</p>

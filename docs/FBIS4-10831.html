			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 9 Apr (PL) -- The Cuban Workers Federation  (CTC) has announced workers will continue, beginning this month,  to hold meetings to analyze measures to optimize economic  efficiency.    The proposals were made during the so-called Parliaments in  the Workplace, a process involving approximately 80,000  assemblies in which more than 3 million workers participated  between February and March in the country's workplaces.    Workers made many proposals for attaining profitability and  economic efficiency in their respective enterprises to solve  existing problems at that level.    Other ideas tied to national issues will be analyzed in the  National Assembly of the People's Government during a special  meeting on 1 May, a meeting aimed at drafting the general  outlines on measures that need to be adopted to improve the  Cuban economy.    Cuba is going through a stage of economic difficulties  following the disappearance of the European socialist bloc  (between 1989-1991) and implementation of the Torricelli Law,  approved by the U.S. Congress in 1992, to heighten the siege  against Cuba.    The continuation of these meetings will begin this month in  selected enterprises and will extend to all Cuban workplaces  during the second half of May.    The idea is to help, among other aspects, eliminate certain  severe economic problems, such as an excess in currency of  approximately 11 billion pesos (equivalent to the dollar  according to the official exchange) and a 4.2-billion peso  budget deficit.    During the May assemblies workers will analyze the  application of the proposed measures to stimulate work  productivity, methods of saving raw materials and fuels, as well  as undertake new productions or services that are of social use.    These meetings will substitute current production  assemblies,  according to a CTC report quoted by the National Information  Agency.</p>

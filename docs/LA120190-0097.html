			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: BOXING  </P> <P> A member of the New Mexico Athletic Commission said he was unaware that  super-flyweight champion Johnny Tapia had to take a drug test after a title  fight in Albuquerque. Tapia, 23, tested positive for cocaine Nov. 14, nearly  three weeks after he retained his U.S. Boxing Assn. title Oct. 26 against  Santiago Caballero of Venezuela, New Mexico authorities said. The test was  taken after Max Abeyta, events coordinator and chief deputy inspector for the  New Mexico Athletic Commission, discovered during a routine check about a week  after the fight that neither fighter had been tested.  </P></p>

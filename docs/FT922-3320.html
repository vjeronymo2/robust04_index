			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Paris criticises US over Thomson deal THE Paris government yesterday voiced concern over US resistance to the planned takeover of the missiles division of LTV, the steel and industrial group, by Thomson-CSF, the French state controlled defence electronics company, writes William Dawkins in Paris. Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, said he hoped that US desires to protect strategic military independence would not be used 'as a pretext to hamper an operation of industrial value for the companies concerned and for the American economy'. This is the first official sign of French anxiety over a potential irritant to relations with the US. A New York bankruptcy court two months ago accepted a Dollars 450m for LTV's missiles and aircraft divisions from Thomson-CSF and the Carlyle Group, a US merchant bank. Later, the committee of foreign investment in the US opened an inquiry on the security implications, after the deal was criticised in Congress.</p>

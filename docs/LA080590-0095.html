			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PICTURE IN ERROR  </P> <P> The picture you ran accompanying your story on the Jackson Drive connection to  Route 52 ("Jackson Drive Extension Stirs Debate," July 14) is totally  inaccurate. That valley is precisely where the road is not going.  </P> <P> Jackson Drive winds its way through the far western edge of the park, out of  sight and sound of this valley.  </P> <P> The valley shown is designated for overnight camping, family and group  picnicking. According to the master plan, Jackson Drive will provide access for  those unable to hike into this area, "currently the most inaccessible, and to  many people, unknown area of the park."  </P> <P> Jackson Drive has been in the park's master plan and the city's traffic  circulation plan since 1960. The project was listed as one of the 12 local road  projects that would be funded if Proposition A, the half-cent sales tax measure  passed. Proposition A did pass, and the people expect those projects to be  built ASAP.  </P> <P> Subsequent votes by the City Council listed Jackson Drive as a state  matching-funds project. The council also voted to accelerate the project so  that Caltrans will build the interchange with California 52.  </P> <P> Now there are those who say that Mission Trails Regional Park is a preserve,  not a park with active recreational uses. In fact, it is both, responding to  "the public's increasing need for 'close-in' park opportunities by providing  varied wilderness, interpretive and active recreational facilities." (Master  Plan, 1985).  </P> <P> Thus, because Jackson Drive will advance the park concept and relieve traffic  congestion on I-8, I-15 and our residential streets, and because it was  approved by the people with Proposition A, this critical connection to  California 52 must be built without delay.  </P> <P> JUDY McCARTY  </P> <P> San Diego City Council  </P> <P> District 7  </P> <P> Editor's Note: The Times mistakenly ran a file photograph of another area of  the park.  </P></p>

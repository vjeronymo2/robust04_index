			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Giorgio Giacomelli, UN deputy secretary-general  and executive director of the UN fund for drug abuse, visited  Kyrgyzstan 23-25 May. [passage omitted]    Summarizing the results of this visit, Giacomelli emphasized  that Kyrgyzstan is seriously tackling this issue. The republic  was the first in the region to establish contacts with the  United Nations in fighting the spread of drugs. Therefore the  United Nations is willing to support Kyrgyzstan in addressing  this issue.    The state commission for control over drug trafficking will  be provided with technical assistance: video films, laboratory  equipment, and a car, worth a total of $500,000. A special  program will be adopted which envisions cooperation aimed at  upgrading legislation related to drug abuse, consultations,  training of experts, and sharing information.    An office of the UN's fund for drug abuse has been set up in  Tashkent. It will also assist Kyrgyzstan.</p>

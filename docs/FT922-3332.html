			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Ukraine mine deaths fuel anger THE accident on Tuesday at the coalmine in Ukraine, which has claimed at least 55 lives, threatens to spark protests against the deteriorating economic conditions in Ukraine by the well-organised Russified miners from the eastern regions of the country. The accident, a methane gas fire, was at the Sukhodolska Skhidnia mine in Luhansk, the easternmost region of Ukraine. By late yesterday afternoon rescue workers had recovered 55 bodies and expected to find more buried in the deep mine shafts. Before the accident the miners of the Donbas region had planned to picket the Ukrainian parliament in Kiev and the disaster is likely to add to their anger. Mr Yuri Bolderov, a dynamic union leader, said that next week the miners would push their demands for greater regional economic autonomy, higher wages, and the removal of the conservative prime minister, Mr Vitold Fokin.</p>

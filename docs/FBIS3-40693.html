			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pramit Pal Chaudhuri: "GATT's Lack of Moral </F> Fibre"]    [Text] The Uruguay round of the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade has expanded world free trade. But one area  where the Dunkel draft failed was textiles. Specifically it  failed to put the slow death of the Multifibre Arrangement on  the fast track. This was a triumph of Northern vested interest  politics over economic sense and Southern demands.    The MFA was a protectionist intruder in GATT. Put together  in  1973 the MFA was supposed to provide a temporary breathing space  for a Western textile industry about to be inundated by a flood  of Third World imports. But it was renewed repeatedly. One of  the main points of the Dunkel draft was to kill the MFA by  incorporating textiles into GATT. That absorption would mean the  textile trade would be hampered only by low tariff barriers  rather than the MFA's arbitrary and restrictive quota system.    The key question was the schedule under which MFA would be  withdrawn--how long would the entire process take and what  percentage of textiles would be shifted from MFA to GATT during  each phase. Third World exporters like India and Pakistan went  to GATT urging the phase-out period end in 1997. The US domestic  textile industry preferred AD 2008. The European Union wanted  2001. In the end the Western nations negotiated among themselves  and came up with 2003.    In addition, they were able to force a three-year  "transition" period on top of this making the MFA's actual death  date 2006. The South was forced to swallow this bitter pill.    Equally unbalanced was the percentage of textiles affected  during each of the three phases. The third world had wanted 20  per cent in the first phase, 25 in the second and 30 in the  last--over 10 years. Instead the GATT treaty provides 16, 17 and  18 per cent. This means that all the way until 2006, at least 49  per cent of textile exports will be governed by nation-by-nation  quotas. Again there was little choice.    The Asian cloth kings have grumbled loudly at this act of  hypocrisy by a West that preaches the benefits of a free market  to them. But threatening the US with homemade versions of Super  301 would be the subject of good comedy, not good economic  policy. India accomplished none of its set goals, in particular  an accelerated phase-out schedule. Much of the supposed  "successes" New Delhi is touting such as an increased US textile  import quota are little more than token sops.    However, it is right when it says granting market access to  US textile exports will have no impact on India's domestic  industry. The US has had such access under the 1992-97 Indian  import policy, but sold almost nothing. Its makers cannot  compete with India's except in brand name designer labels like  "Arrow" or "Lacoste."    In addition, Mr Bill Clinton had made a Faustian pact with  US  domestic textile makers. In order to get the North American Free  Trade Agreement (NAFTA) through Congress, he promised them that  demands for a fore-shortening of the MFA's lifespan would be  resisted. Though he failed to get 15 years he was able to get  13, which was almost as good. He quite ignored the fact that the  MFA by 1986 alone was estimated to have cost the US consumer $40  billion through artificially high prices.    One reason the North had its way was the complete inability  of the South to put up a united front. Sri Lanka, for example,  preferred the MFA because its quota system guaranteed it  exports. Under a free trade GATT regime it would have to compete  with more efficient producers like India.    The unspoken truth, US and Indian industry analysts say, is  that if the MFA were banned overnight it would not necessarily  be India that would benefit the most. Compared to the  state-of-the-art textile makers of Hong Kong and southeast Asia,  Indian industry is still a few steps behind. Though 13 years is  too long, India needs a breathing space as well.</p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: Samancor sharply up at halfway Samancor, the Gencor-owned South African ferro-alloys producer, has surprised the market by reporting unexpectedly good results in the half-year to end-December. Pre-tax profit before abnormal items jumped 58 per cent to R175m (Dollars 51m) against R111m a year earlier. A 25 cents interim dividend is declared, up from 20 cents last year. The group's shares have doubled in value since February 1993, climbing 400 cents in the past month to R34 at yesterday's market close. Mr Mike Salamon, managing director, said the performance contrasted with 'miserable' demand in real terms for the group's products in most of its markets. He was confident Samancor would match first-half earnings in the second six months although he was no more than 'vaguely warm' about commodity prices improving from late-1994. The rand's weakness against the dollar and improved manganese alloy sales volumes bolstered turnover to R971.2m from R930.9m, although prices for the group's output fell across the board. Mr Salamon said ore and alloy markets were still blighted by a flood of cheap material from the former Soviet Union and China, added to poor demand in re-cession-hit Europe and Japan. A turnround at the chrome division, which suffered large job cuts in 1992-93, was the main contributor to the group's improved operating performance, with extra benefit derived from the conversion of idle ferrochrome furnaces to silicomanganese and ferromanganese production. Abnormal receipts stemming from an export allowance settlement and asset sales lifted overall pre-tax profit to R214.4m from R71.4m. A return to a tax-paying position and reduced income from associates curbed the rise in distributable profit to R164.2m from R110.8m.</p>

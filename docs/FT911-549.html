			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Arsenal FC launches Pounds 16.5m bond issue ARSENAL FOOTBALL Club's Pounds 16.5m debenture bond issue will, if successful, bring in a record amount of money to a UK football club. The proceeds will help convert Highbury, its north London stadium, into a 37,000 all-seater stadium by August 1993, at a total cost of about Pounds 22.5m. The present capacity is 44,000, of which 26,000 is standing space. Yesterday's bond launch was about two weeks ahead of the planned stock market flotation of Manchester United. Although that should also raise about Pounds 17m, less than half will be available to the club because it includes the sale of directors' shares. Arsenal has taken its cue from Glasgow Rangers, which launched an Pounds 8.5m bond issue last year that has been 85 per cent taken up. The same team from Noble Grossart, the Edinburgh-based merchant bank, is representing Arsenal. Just over 12,000 bonds are being offered at Pounds 1,500 or Pounds 1,100 each, depending on seat position. Fans have first refusal and Arsenal is making the most of its emotional appeal. The bondholder will have a named seat for up to 150 years in the new two-tier North Bank stand, the right to a season ticket, membership of a bondholders' club and a 'keepsake certificate'. Arsenal will enjoy the money interest free and without having to pay a dividend - Manchester United may distribute more than Pounds 1m a year to shareholders. The amount of money involved for Gunners fans taking up the bonds is of a different order to the Pounds 6 per match they have paid to stand this season. Their season-ticket seats will cost Pounds 240 or Pounds 195 - according to bond type - for 1993-94, although they are already facing a rise to Pounds 190 for next season's standing space. Even the cheapest way of paying for the bond - using a four-year Bank of Scotland loan at 10 per cent interest - will cost Pounds 32 a month. Arsenal stressed that the money-raising exercise would protect the resources available to the team manager, Mr George Graham, to buy players. He has, however, been relatively frugal, spending a net Pounds 1.2m in the past five years. In 1989-90, the club made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 815,000 (Pounds 1.7m) on sales of Pounds 7.65m (Pounds 6.45m).</p>

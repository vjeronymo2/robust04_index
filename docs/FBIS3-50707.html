It Is as If History Had  Stopped Here'" -- first two paragraphs are L'UNITA introduction]    [Text] San Cristobal. When Rigoberta Menchu succeeded in  escaping from Guatemala, shocked by the extermination of her  family, Bishop of San Cristobal Samuel Ruiz Garcia took her  under his care. Don Samuel not only helped Rigoberta reacquire  her psychological integrity. For over 30 years now he has been  fighting against the injustices that oppress the heart of  Mexico. Now he has written to the Vatican asking for  explanations regarding the accusations that have been made  against him: He wants clarifications concerning the charges,  which according to him are generic, making reference to an  excessive partiality toward the poor as well as mistakes in  doctrine and reduced pastoral activity. It is the prelate  himself that is making the criticisms made by the nuncio in  Mexico, Girolamo Prigione, in "indirect" relation to the coming  presidential elections in Mexico and the privatization of land  following the approval of the treaty on free trade (NAFTA).  That is what the bishop states in an article that will be  published in the next issue of the monthly NARCOMAFIE, which has  provided a leak on the text.    Don Samuel is small, dresses in white, and has an energetic  and cordial appearance. He wears a small amber cross around his  neck -- amber is one of the few riches in this extremely poor  Chiapas. While I talk to him, I cannot help thinking that it is  fossilized resin, the tear of a tree that has been fossilized  for years.    [L'UNITA] San Cristobal de las Casas is a town that was  famous for its tranquillity. It has suddenly turned from being  a faraway suburb to the center of the "global village" thanks to  the work of the Zapatist army. What is your point of view about  what is happening?    [Ruiz Garcia] I will tell you what our position is. And  this is our, not my position because it represents the opinion  of all three bishops of the State of Chiapas. We have three  dioceses here: Tapachula, Tuxtla Gutierrez which is the capital  of the State, and San Cristobal de las Casas, which is the  oldest of the three. Looking at the present and future, we  bishops from Chiapas have issued a first notice to our followers  in the three dioceses in which we show our concern over the  recent events. We regret the line of action chosen by the  Zapatist army and consider it to be the result of the anguish  and suffering of the Indians of this region and we understand  their pain and frustration. We can understand that what they  did in their anguish appeared to be the only way out of a  situation that has been going on for centuries. Over the past  500 years these native populations have come to occupy the  lowest ranks of our society. Their situation has always been  misunderstood or denied. On the other hand we consider that  there are objectively other paths that have still not been  attempted and understand that psychologically the Indians cannot  see any other way out. And this has led them to declare war  against the Mexican Army.    [L'UNITA] Don Samuel, the international press has suddenly  realized that you are the object of an attempt to remove you  from your seat. In reality, this attempt began in October, but  the news was not made known in Italy. It is also true that  until a few days ago Chiapas was not in the news...    [Ruiz Garcia] I can understand that the Vatican covered this  news up, but here in Mexico it was reported in all the press  with a wealth of detail. However, let us return to the current  situation: We bishops in Chiapas have made a second joint  communication in which we offer ourselves as mediators between  the two conflicting parties in order to initiate peace talks.  Of course we are waiting for the two sides to approve this  mediation. Yesterday evening (Monday 3 January -- L'UNITA  Editor's Note) I met with the other two bishops to establish how  we would act in our commitment to serve. We are aware of the  role that the Church can play in starting talks and we have  urged for the approval of the two parties.    [L'UNITA] Was the response a positive one?    [Ruiz Garcia] We have already received the government's  assent but we have not received a response from the guerrillas.  This does not mean that they are refusing our offer but simply  that we have no channel to communicate with them. The only ones  that can help us establish contacts are the mass media.    [L'UNITA] Today San Cristobal is well and truly under siege.  The main square and therefore the cathedral and the seat of the  bishopric are heavily garrisoned by soldiers. Don't you feel  encircled?    [Ruiz Garcia] In reality, the whole center is militarized. I  myself can enter and leave whenever I choose. All that happened  is that I once had to drive down the wrong side of the street to  park my car.    [L'UNITA] It appears that you do not have fewer enemies than  your great predecessor. The same malicious rumors, which  originated most probably with the Chiapas landowners, are trying  to present you as the fomenter of this new guerrilla warfare.  What is your reply?    [Ruiz Garcia] Just this morning I received a publication  via fax from Berkeley in the United States which carries an  interview with the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army]  members. Here any tie or relationship with the bishop of San  Cristobal de las Casas is decidedly denied, though his work in  support of the human rights of the Indians in his diocese is  recognized. And the mud slung on him by the local authorities  is denounced. The Zapatists have said: "The bishop is not  giving us weapons but at least he is not doing any injustice."  When people began speculating about guerrillas from Guatemala  taking part, the Zapatists stated: "We are all Mexicans."    [L'UNITA] More should be said about the situation that has  caused these events...    [Ruiz Garcia] All the people that travel to this area are  certainly very surprised. Here we are living in a kind of time  warp, as if time has stopped. And we can see this primarily by  seeing how the native communities live. It is a truly  depressing situation, the Indians have always been considered  the dregs of this society. One cannot avoid asking oneself what  has happened, what caused this situation. Above all, why there  has never been a substantial change, what has the Church been  doing all this time, and what official measures were really  taken to put a stop to this situation?</p>

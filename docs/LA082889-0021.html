			<p><P> August 28, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. AMATEUR GOLF CHAMPIONSHIP;  </P> <P> CLEMSON'S PATTON WINS, 3 AND 1  </P> <P> Chris Patton looks as if he should be out on the football field for Coach Danny  Ford, but the 300-pound Clemson senior proved he belongs on the golf course.  </P> <P> Patton beat Danny Green of Jackson, Tenn., 3 and 1, Sunday in the 36-hole final  of the U.S. Amateur championships.  </P> <P> "It's pretty awesome," the 6-foot-1 Patton said after winning the championship  at Merion Golf Club. "I played as good as I can play.  </P> <P> "I've played as good this week as I've played in a long, long time. There were  some real good matches. It was no cakewalk."  </P> <P> The 21-year-old Patton was two-over-par for his last 102 holes.  </P> <P> In Sunday's first 18 holes, Patton took a three-hole lead over the 32-year-old  Green, who said he helps in his father's optical shop but mostly plays golf.  Patton increased his lead to 4-up with a three-foot birdie putt on the second  hole of the final 18. Green lipped a 12-foot birdie attempt.  </P> <P> Green won the fourth hole as Patton drove off the fairway and failed to get his  second shot out of the deep rough.  </P> <P> But Patton got that back at No. 6 with a 22-foot birdie putt.  </P> <P> Green, who had trouble with his putter most of the day, won the eighth hole  with a par, while Patton drove into a trap, hit over the green, chipped back  and two-putted for a bogey.  </P> <P> Green won the 310-yard, par-four 10th with a 25-foot birdie putt, cutting  Patton's lead to two.  </P> <P> But the easy-swinging Patton won No. 11 as Green put his second shot in the  water en route to a double bogey, and conceded a birdie putt.  </P> <P> Patton, with the consistency that marked his play all week, boosted his lead to  four again at the 12th, laying his second shot close to the pin for a birdie.  </P> <P> Green stayed in the match by winning the 14th hole with a par when Patton  missed a 10-footer and settled for bogey.  </P> <P> After halving 15, Green was three holes down with three holes to play.  </P> <P> He staved off defeat by winning the 16th hole with a par while Patton drove  into the rough again and two-putted from 18 feet for another bogey.  </P> <P> But on the 222-yard 17th, Green's tee shot landed in a greenside trap snug  against the lip. He had to take a penalty stroke for an unplayable lie.  </P> <P> Then Green surrendered, giving Patton -- who was 18 inches from the pin in two  -- the hole and championship.  </P> <P> "I was in the Amateur for the first time and I'm proud of myself," Green said.  "I played real well."  </P> <P> But he did fault his putting, normally a strength.  </P> <P> "Usually I putt well and don't strike the ball well," Green said. "It was the  reverse this week. I struck the ball well and didn't putt well."  </P></p>

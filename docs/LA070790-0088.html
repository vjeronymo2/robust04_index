			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> POLICE CLEAR PLAZA OF 100 TRANSIENTS  </P> <P> Under a deadline imposed by San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos, more than two dozen  police officers rousted 100 transients out of their illegal encampment across  from City Hall.  </P> <P> Some of the homeless had lived under the trees in the plaza for years. Agnos,  who was under heavy pressure to restore the plaza to general public use, vowed  months ago to find housing for the homeless whether they liked it or not. One  man was carried away in his sleeping bag. Homeless advocate Keith McHenry of  the Food Not Bombs group was arrested and booked on a charge of interfering  with police. Other charges included misdemeanor counts of illegal lodging and  illegal distribution of food, police said.  </P></p>

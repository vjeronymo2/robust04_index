			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Arts: Gentle musings from Giuffre's clarinet - Jazz PROMOTED as a double bill alongside pianist Don Pullen's trio, it is Jimmy Giuffre's reedy deliberations that is the draw on this rare UK tour. Times and tastes change: 30 years ago, Giuffre's fragile clarinet, set against the subtle colour of pianist Paul Bley and Steve Swallow's yearning electric bass fell out of favour with West Coasters. For nearly a decade Giuffre himself withdrew from performance altogether, made tentative recordings in the 1970s and has only recently re-emerged. After 26 years absence the reformed drummerless trio's meandering melodies are finding a new audience. ECM, the sophisticated German label, has even re-released the delicate chamber jazz which in the early 1960s was said to have been the group's downfall, Fusion and Thesis. A shared peace within its gentle musings remains the key to the trio's attraction today: they do not so much improvise as intimate. Opening with a gentle flurry of notes from the clarinet which is echoed first by Swallow and then by Bley, Giuffre barely leads this dreamy ensemble, with a sound which gives the impression of a reed wrapped in muslin. Switching to alto, a relatively new choice of instrument, the gauze tone is pierced only occasionally, encouraged by the blue washed colours of Bley, who stands up occasionally to change the harmonics by reaching under the lid. Swallow, like the others white haired and dressed in tasteful shades of charcoal, gives structure with wiry plectrum-picked bass lines. Even as Giuffre, an absent minded character, changes to almost lead on soprano, the balance of the trio remains the same. Its overall effect is both soothing and engrossing because although the dynamics of this drummerless group are low, the component improvisation is full of detail. It is only to be hoped that it all reached the back of the hall  - from the comfort of the stalls it was touching. Don Pullen's more conventional trio of piano, upright bass and drums was no less easy on the ear but more likely to reach every corner of the hall. Its leader's big folky melodies - 'Richard's Tune', 'Variation on Ode to Life', and 'Indio-Gitano' - were spelled out in tart notes and backhanded sweeps along the keyboard. The alternately charged runs and then thoughtful rimshot technique of long time partner Cindy Blackman was more than a match for her leaders' own Spanish heel clicking accompaniment. Possibly better known for exciting avalanches of chords, Pullen surprised on this evening, however, with seductive and almost too poignant unfolding cadenzas. The Contemporary Music Network is sponsored by the Arts Council. The tour continues to Sheffield Crucible Theatre (Oct 18); Leeds Irish Centre (21); Manchester Royal Northern College of Music (22); Cardiff Tythe Barn (23); Birmingham Adrian Boult Hall (24)</p>

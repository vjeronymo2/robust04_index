			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / International Company News: George Weston under pressure George Weston, the Sydney-based subsidiary of Associated British Foods but quoted separately on the Australian Stock Exchange, yesterday warned that profits would be 'at best, relatively flat' in the current financial year. Mr John Pascoe, chief executive, claimed that pressure on margins remained intense, especially in the core bakeries business, and that the severe drought along the eastern seaboard was compounding problems. However, the company hoped that rising grain costs might eventually lead to greater price stability in the bread market. Weston saw net profits unchanged last year at around ADollars 52.3m (USDollars 40.3m), on sales of ADollars 1.05bn. The company also came under attack yesterday from small shareholders over its dividend policy, with representatives of the Australian Shareholders' Association claiming that minority shareholders were being squeezed and franking credits were going unused. Mr Ray Wagner, from the ASA, described last year's 16.5-cents-a-share payout as 'paltry' when retained profits stood at 14 times the dividend cost. The company, he noted, was in a healthy cash situation and could support a more liberal payout policy.</p>

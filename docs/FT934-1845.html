			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Markets Report: Dollar firms against yen The US dollar rose to a five-month high against the Japanese yen and is expected to test Y110 today, writes Conner Middelmann. The dollar strengthened to Y109.86 before closing at Y109.65, up from Y109.35 on Tuesday. It finished New York trading at Y109.76. It received a lift from Tuesday's November trade figures, showing Japan's trade surplus against the US narrowing for the first time in nearly three years, and a stream of strong US economic data at a time when the Japanese economy remains troubled. Moreover, expectations of a reduction soon in Japan's 1.75 per cent official discount rate to stimulate the economy are keeping the yen under pressure. 'With the fiscal package delayed, the onus is once again on monetary policy to help the economy, and the Bank of Japan is coming under increased pressure to ease,' said Mr Stephen King, deputy chief economist at James Capel. He expects the dollar to trade around Y121 by the end of 1994 and predicts Y130 for the second half of 1995. 'Interest rates will stay low, and when the recovery does come, it will be weak by historical standards,' he added. The US currency also gained more ground against the D-Mark on residual hopes that the Bundesbank's central bank council would cut official interest rates at its meeting today. It ended at DM1.7160, up from DM1.7135 but off the day's high of DM1.7205. It closed in New York at DM1.7172. The resolution of the Gatt world trade talks had next to no impact on the currency market, with an agreement already heavily discounted for days. 'The market is relieved all the brinkmanship of the last weeks is over and it can settle down to business as usual,' said Mr King. In the UK money market, the short-term sterling interest rate contract slid sharply on disappointment that the Bank of England did not lower interest rates following the better than expected inflation numbers. This offered an opportunity for many traders holding long positions in the contract to take profits after its recent strong run. The November retail prices index excluding mortgage interest payments rose by 2.5 per cent year-on-year, after a 2.8 per cent increase in October. The headline inflation rate came in at 1.4 per cent last month, the same as in October. Immediately after the RPI release, the March short sterling contract jumped to 95.00, but when the Bank of England's operations made it clear that there would be no immediate rate cut, the contract quickly sold off to a low of 94.81. It ended at 94.85, down 0.09 point from Tuesday. A senior money dealer commented: 'It was an overbought market, and too many people were long of it.' There are still lingering hopes that the UK central bank could announce a rate reduction later this week, although the shake-out in the futures pit indicated that those have waned significantly. Market conditions remained tight, causing money rates at the short end to firm again. The Bank of England announced a shortage of Pounds 2.65bn, which was later revised down to Pounds 2.5bn. In early operations it purchased bills totalling Pounds 1.65bn for resale to the market on January 5 and 6 at 5 13/32 per cent. In further operations, the Bank bought bills amounting to Pounds 37m, followed by another Pounds 190m in the afternoon and late assistance of around Pounds 645m. As long as residual hopes for a near-term rate cut persist, the Bank will keep a tight grip on market liquidity, said a trader. But if the Bundesbank leaves rates unchanged today and hopes for a base rate cut wane further, 'the Bank will probably ease off and money market conditions could relax', he predicted. 'I do not see another base rate cut this year - the signals the authorities have given are very, very clear,' said Mr Philip Shaw, group economist at Union Discount, one of the eight London discount houses. Sterling eased to DM2.450 against the D-Mark from DM2.550 in thin turnover. The French franc advanced further against the D-Mark, boosted by the Gatt world trade agreement and hopes of more French easing. Contrary to perceived economic wisdom, rate cuts tend to bolster the French currency on hopes that they will stimulate the sluggish economy. The franc finished at FFr3.418 per D-Mark, up from the previous day's FFr3.422 close. It hit a high of FFr3.4128 during the day, boosted by a call for lower interest rates by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. He told parliament in a speech that lower rates were a necessary condition for economic recovery in France. The French currency's continued strength indicates that even if the Bundesbank leaves rates unchanged today, there is a reasonable chance of French easing before Christmas, said Capel's Mr King. 'With the franc at this level, they must be rebuilding reserves very quickly and must be seriously thinking about lowering rates,' he added. The remaining currencies in Europe's exchange rate mechanism were little altered against the D-Mark. The Belgian franc was unchanged at BFr20.86 to the D-Mark. The Danish krone ended at DKr3.923, down from DKr3.916 on Tuesday. The Italian lira finished at L987.0 against the D-Mark, barely changed from L987.1 the previous day.  ---------------------------------        POUND IN NEW YORK  --------------------------------- Dec 14        Close  Prev. close  --------------------------------- Pounds spot  1.4785    1.4900 1 mth        1.4750    1.4866 3 mth        1.4703    1.4826 1 yr         1.4587    1.4722  ---------------------------------</p>

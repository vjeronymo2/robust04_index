			<p>BFN     [Text] Member of the Russia's Choice (RC) faction in the  State Duma, Stepan Sulakshin, says he intends to defect to the  unregistered parliamentary group known as the December 12 Union.  To be registered, the group must win over six people.    In an interview with Interfax, the group's co-chairman  Yevgeniy Bushmin said two more members of RC -- Rashid  Ismaghilov and Vladimir Yuzhakov -- are negotiating to switch  over as well. And, according to Bushmin, one or two members of  the New Regional Politics group could be expected to join the  "Decembrists" ranks. Bushmin refused to identify these.    Another leader of the December 12 Union group, Irina  Khakamada, told Interfax she was dissatisfied with the RC's  decision to show understanding if some of its members sided with  the Decemebr 12 Union group. In Khakamada's view, the RC could  have moved to help Decenber 12 devotees by campaigning for their  official recognition and rights as a group in parliament.    On Friday Gennadiy Burbulis also announced his decision to  leave the Russia's Choice group.</p>

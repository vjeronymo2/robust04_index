			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / International Company News: Picco quits unexpectedly as chairman at Eridania Mr Renato Picco yesterday unexpectedly resigned as chairman of Eridania Beghin-Say, the French agro-industrial subsidiary of Italy's Montedison, prompting a FFr59 fall in the company's shares which closed at FFr750. Mr Picco, 60, was one of the last top managers appointed by the old regime at Montedison and Ferruzzi, its holding company, under Mr Raul Gardini, who committed suicide last year. New directors took over at Ferruzzi-Montedison in the middle of 1993, after the full extent of the group's debts became clear, but Mr Picco decided to stay on at Eridania to work with the new directors as Montedison restructured. Eridania yesterday reported a consolidated net profit of FFr623m (Dollars 117m) in the first half of 1994 on sales of FFr24.8bn. In the first half of 1993, Eridania, which is quoted on the Paris bourse, reported profits of FFr614m and sales of FFr24.75bn, but it said comparison was misleading because of changes in the companies consolidated. Net operating profit was down nearly 6 per cent to FFr1.87bn from FFr1.99bn, mainly because the important sugar operations were unable to repeat what Eridania described as exceptional results in the first half of 1993, and the increased contribution of other sectors was not enough to offset this. The company said it expected full-year results to be broadly comparable with 1993, when net profits reached FFr1.34bn on turnover of FFr50.9bn. Mr Picco will be replaced by Mr Stefano Meloni, 46, director general of Ferruzzi-Montedison responsible for finance. Mr Picco was praised by the board for his 'absolute independence and managerial rectitude' which had protected Eridania from the main repercussions of the crisis which hit the rest of the Ferruzzi-Montedison group last year.</p>

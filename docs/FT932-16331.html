			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / International Company News: Miroglio takes stake in GFT GFT, the lossmaking Italian clothing and textiles group, has agreed to sell a 'significant' stake to Miroglio, its slightly smaller counterpart, via a capital increase. No financial details of the deal, to be concluded by June 30, have been revealed. However, it is expected that Miroglio, based in Alba, will buy a majority stake in Turin-based GFT, subject to detailed consideration of its trading position. GFT, owned by the Rivetti family, is Italy's third-biggest clothing group after Benetton and Marzotto, with annual sales of about L1,500bn (Dollars 940m). The privately-owned and publicity-shy Miroglio, owned by the family of the same name, has annual sales of about L1,200bn. Miroglio has been seen as the most likely investor in GFT, which has plunged into substantial losses owing to rising costs and falling demand for many of the expensive designer label clothes it produces. In contrast, Miroglio has concentrated on cheaper lines, many of which are produced outside Italy. Sasib, the precision engineering and railway signalling equipment group controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti's Cir holding company, posted a sharp fall in net profits to L41.6bn last year from L73.2bn. The company attributed the decline to lower extraordinary earnings, recession and restructuring costs at some recent acquisitions. The rapid growth of Sasib, which raised sales by 12.9 per cent to L865bn last year, has come partly though the purchase and turn-around of lossmaking operations. Adjusted for acquisitions, sales rose by 11 per cent. The profits slump triggered a L50 cut in the dividend to L180 for ordinary and preferred shares and L200 for savings stock. Sales and earnings on the railway signalling side improved substantially, but the group's food processing equipment activities had mixed fortunes.</p>

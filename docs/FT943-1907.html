			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Hyundai's car sale hopes fuel Europe's fears - S Korean company's expansion plans raise prospects of trade friction Hyundai hopes to join the world's top 10 vehicle makers by the turn of the century. South Korea's biggest vehicle maker is to invest heavily in producing cars for virtually every sector of the market, including minicars, sports coupes and multi-purpose vehicles. Its plans include greater penetration of the European market, thus raising the prospect of trade conflict. European car makers are already alarmed by the Korean industry's expansionism and angered by restricted access to Korea's markets. Late last year Hyundai, which has interests ranging from shipbuilding to electronics and a turnover of more than Dollars 60bn, announced that it planned to more than double its 1993 vehicle output of 900,000 units to 2m by the year 2000. Well on course to produce 1.16m this year, Hyundai intends to be producing a further 300,000 vehicles outside Korea by the end of the decade. Hyundai executives say this would give Hyundai 2 per cent of the global market. Added to the expansion plans of Daewoo, Kia and Ssangyong, Korea's other car makers, this would give Korea a capacity of 4m cars a year, which would take the country from sixth to fourth place behind the US, Japan and Germany. None of these forecasts take into account the declared intention of Samsung, Hyundai's industrial rival, to invest Dollars 5bn in starting up car production and which has already produced its first prototype. Thus they considerably understate the capacity Korea is likely to have by the end of the decade, according to Mr Giorgio Garuzzo, chief executive of Fiat and president of the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA). Mr Garuzzo, in Seoul recently to urge the Korean government and industry to take further steps to open Korea's vehicle markets, maintains that between now and 2000 Korea will spend nearly Dollars 10bn on creating capacity of more than 5.3m vehicles a year. Last year imports accounted for only 0.19 per cent of Korea's car market. Only 307 cars came from Europe. Although in the past few months Korea has introduced a number of market liberalisation measures, Europe's industry says they are not enough. Veiled warnings are already being issued about Europe being able and willing to work within the parameters of the new World Trade Organisation (WTO) to protect the European vehicle industry from unfair competition. 'Anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and safeguard action will become more reliable tools for legitimate self-defence within an open trading system,' Mr Garuzzo warned Korean industry leaders. Hyundai, helped by the Accent, a new small car soon to go on sale in Europe, plans to nearly double its European sales from less than 100,000 last year to 189,000 by the end of the decade. Hyundai executives expect the Accent, in which the company has invested Dollars 438m and which is Hyundai's first car to be developed without the aid of Mitsubishi of Japan, to achieve 25,900 European sales this year, rising to 62,000 in 1995. On sale in Korea since April, the Accent replaces the similarly-sized Excel model. Hyundai hopes that a replacement for the Elantra medium saloon and a new coupe to be launched in the next year or so will increase its export appeal. It will follow with a minicar and multi-purpose vehicle. They will be assisted by an increase in research and development spending scheduled to rise from the current 4 per cent of sales to 7 per cent by the end of the decade. Hyundai projects exports from 350,000 cars and commercial vehicles last year to 972,000 by the end of the decade. It maintains that most of this growth will be in developing markets elsewhere in Asia. According to Mr J H Kim, Hyundai's general manager for vehicle exports, sales to regions outside Europe and North America will almost quadruple from 150,000 this year to 562,000 by the end of the decade. Hyundai's president, Mr Chon Sung Won, and senior colleagues insist that projected sales growth in Europe should not be so high as to be a source of trade friction. However, aggressive export expansion is also planned by Daewoo, Kia and Ssangyong. Daewoo has also said it wants to be a world 'top ten' manufacturer by early next century and its Cielo and Aspera models - based on General Motors' European mainstays, the Astra and Cavalier - will go on sale in Europe early next year. Kia, already selling in Europe, will also soon be expanding its model ranges. And both it and Daewoo are having research and development work done in Europe to tailor vehicles more closely to European tastes. Also early next year Ssangyong's four-wheel-drive vehicles will make their European debut. Thus, while Hyundai insists it is more concerned to establish a production presence in China and other fast-growing Asian markets (it already has assembly operations for kits in Thailand), it is already preparing to avoid trade confrontation by following Japan's Nissan, Toyota and Honda in setting up production capacity in Europe. Daewoo has already set out modest plans for assembly in eastern Europe, while Kia's four-wheel-drive vehicles from next year will be produced for European markets by Karmann of Germany. Hyundai has begun looking into where its European base might be located - but says it will be the end of the decade, at least, before one might be needed. As a stepping stone, however, it is in the final stages of a feasibility study to set up a European research and development centre.</p>

			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Steel producers in sight of pact - US industry groups optimistic about multilateral agreement REPRESENTATIVES of steel-producing countries, meeting this week in Geneva, seem finally on the road to agreement on the multilateral steel agreement which has eluded them in almost four years of negotiations. 'The ultimate deal is still at least a month away,' said one observer close to the US negotiators. 'But that is to be expected. They are changing the way governments intervene in steel production.' It is a complex task. US producers of specialty steel are anxious for a deal. Mr Skip Hartquist, one of their lawyers, said: 'The elements are there to reach an agreement. However, I'm still sceptical that the Europeans really want a deal.' The optimism by US industry groups stems in part from the seriousness with which Washington is addressing the MSA talks. A flurry of meetings last week made clear that the Clinton administration will not tie the fortunes of the MSA - or indeed the Uruguay Round - to the whims of the big integrated steel companies. Last Tuesday a delegation of steel-using manufacturers met Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, and later in the day they went to the White House to see Mr W. Bowman Cutter of the National Economic Council. The users stated their opposition to a steel import monitoring programme requested by the big steel companies. Mr Jon Jenson, for the users' group, said monitoring was unnecessary: steel demand and prices were firm, imports stable, and capacity utilisation high. He warned that such a scheme would 'bully our trading partners into limiting shipments and raising prices of steel needed by US manufacturers to produce world competitive prices'. Furthermore, it would cripple the administration's efforts to negotiate an MSA. The steel users also expressed concern over the request by the big US producers that the administration quickly replace Mrs Anne Brunsdale, an outgoing International Trade Commissioner, with a steel industry advocate. The users, however, urged against politicisation of the ITC seat which 'would undermine the integrity of US trade law'. Later, top executives from LTV, USX and Bethlehem Steel - prominent among the 'Big Steel' producers - met Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, and Mr Kantor. They were joined, at the administration's invitation, by Mr Kenneth Iverson, chairman of Nucor Corporation, the country's largest minimill producer and an aggressive free trader. Mr Iverson's presence signalled the administration's determination to listen to viewpoints other than those of the integrated producers, and in the end the officials rejected the monitoring programme and said no decision had yet been made about Mrs Brunsdale's successor. Before the MSA talks broke off in March 1992 the negotiators had whittled the number of permissible steel aids to four: environmental, research and development, plant closing and worker retraining. US steel companies, however, refused to give up the protection they could glean from the US anti-dumping regime. In fact, they would not even agree to consultations on trade cases before they were filed. Although Big Steel was perfectly prepared to do without an MSA and seek protection under US trade laws, there were numerous US parties more willing to compromise to get an MSA, including the two largest minimill producers.</p>

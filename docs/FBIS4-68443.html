			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Arkadiy Solovyev, secretary of the FITUR </F> [Russian Federation of Independent Trade Unions] Council: "No  One Is Sorry for the People in `Communal Accomodations'"]    [Text] State apartments free of charge disappeared in  the previous era. Millions of Russian families have remained in  cramped, dilapidated, damaged housing. Does the Russian  Government intend to provide support for the disadvantaged, who  are not in a position to spend millions to improve their housing  conditions?    As we know, the new constitution of the Russian Federation  grants only our right to have a roof over our heads instead of  the traditional state "guarantee" of housing for all of us. And  achieving this now depends only on the individual himself, or  more more precisely, on his wallet. And that is sad. Half of our  society is made up of persons unable to work (pensioners, young  people, the disabled, and children), who receive fixed  allowances, compensatory payments, and stipends which are far  below the subsistence minimum. It is clear that the market in  the housing field means they are completely deprived of civil  rights and even further dependent on the local budget. But if we  are reminded that there is never any money in the budget as it  is, it is not at all clear how the new order for providing  social housing will function.    The state of affairs with respect to provision of housing  for  the 60 million able-bodied citizens is even less clear. The most  pressing question is: will the state's "housing debt" be paid to  them? After all, the line in which over 10 million families have  "stood" for many years has completely lost its outlines (vague  as they were). And the mechanism for ordinary employees of  "ordinary" enterprises to purchase housing on the market is  completely inaccessible.    In the transition to the market, the housing problem is just  as severe as the wage and employment problems. However, the  latter have counterparts in the economy of Western countries,  but the housing problem has the features of a purely Soviet  phenomenon. In this connection, I believe we need to single out  several key factors and define them more specifically in a new  housing policy. Unless the reformers want restructuring of the  housing field to become an additional catalyst for social  instability, of course...    First of all, in defining the overall economic mechanism for  stabilization, we cannot overlook the gradual expansion of  housing construction. Naturally, this is possible only with  wide-scale state protectionism. Secondly, we need to maintain  state levers for regulating the housing market. A policy of  "shock" privatization of housing facilities is unacceptable. And  thirdly, discontinuation of state subsidies for housing and  payment for communal services should take place together with an  appropriate review of the tax system and a change in the  structure of a minimum consumer budget.    I would like to discuss these key problms in a little more  detail.    The average housing per citizen is 16 square meters of total  space, which is somewhat less than that stipulated by the  Housing Code of the RSFSR--18 square meters. The housing problem  in Russia is burdened by the fact that more than 30 million  square meters of housing are located in dilapidated and damaged  structures. With the volumes of construction being forecast, it  is not hard to draw the conclusion that there are no prospects  for improvement in the situation.    The shock increase of 100 times the cost of housing and  everyday services outlined by the government program deprives  persons on the waiting list of the opportunity to acquire an  apartment under the conditions stipulated by the RSFSR Law "On  privatization of available housing in the RSFSR." Most of the  people simply will not have the funds needed to purchase housing  over the next 10 years.    There has been a decline in the volume of financing for  housing construction from all sources. The government has  practically relieved itself of this unpleasant business. The  situation that has taken shape has paralyzed movement of the  line for improved housing conditions, first of all. The FITUR's  proposals to conclude a General Agreement on Additional  Commitments for Housing Construction have not been supported in  the Russian Federation Government and were not put into a  document.    The situation with respect to development of house-building  cooperatives and individual builders is no better. There has  been three times as much recession here. In the economic  sitation that has taken shape, shifting the concern about  housing to the people's shoulders will not be able to stimulate  new construction over the next 10 years, since the population  has a single problem--survival.    A new source of financing for housing construction has made  its appearance over the past 2 years--so-called commercial and  shareholding organizations. It is being practically doubled each  year, but its proportion, as before, is not high (25 to 30  percent).    As of the beginning of this year, 10 million families were  on  the waiting list to receive housing. Almost one-third of them  are living in communal apartments, dormitory facilities, and  dilapidated and damaged structures; many have been waiting to  receive housing for over 10 years.    With the existing level of housing provided for the public  and the condition of the economy, we cannot manage without  direct assistance from the state budget and other centralized  sources.    The housing market being formed under government supervision  has become a factor in the workers' deteriorating housing  conditions and has sharply stepped up both economic and social  tension. I think that housing reform should be coordinated  without delay with all elements of social policy (primarily with  the policy of incomes and the living standard, and with the  employment policy and directed social support for disadvantaged  citizens) and subordinated to the goals of providing for the  priority constitutional rights of the individual--to housing and  property and a fitting standard of living. But the current  housing policy is openly subordinated to a single, purely  economic interest--relieving the state budget of what is left of  elementary social guarantees.</p>

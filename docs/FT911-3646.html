			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Management: A quinquennial solution to a perennial problem - Corporate governance As a mechanism for disciplining bad management, the hostile takeover has its attractions. But it can be overdone. When the market for corporate control becomes over-heated, as it did in the mid-1980s, assets are shuffled and re-shuffled for short-term gain and sound companies are damaged in the process. Can anything be done to limit the intensity of the next takeover wave? The outcome of takeover contests would be more rational if the opportunistic element were reduced and the principal actors - above all, the institutional investors whose votes are usually crucial - were forced to focus on the long-term prospects of the companies concerned. At present, as in the NCR-AT&amp;T case in the US, investors have to sort their way through a stream of one-sided propaganda, accompanied by a series of legal manoeuvres as the contestants seek to gain advantage. In these circumstances it is hard to answer the fundamental question - how well has the defendant management been doing and what is it likely to achieve in the future. One of the merits of the proposal put forward last year by two American lawyers, Martin Lipton and Steven Rosenblum*, is that it offers a more orderly framework in which takeover decisions can be taken. Directors of public companies would be judged on their performance over five years. At each quinquennial meeting they would offer themselves for re-election on the basis of a detailed account of their stewardship over the preceding five years and their plans for the next five; past performance and future projections would be subject to an appraisal carried out by an independent investment bank or consulting firm. Hostile bids could only be considered at the quinquennial meeting; directors would be free from takeover threats in the interim, but their jobs would clearly be on the line at the end of each five-year period. This approach meets the desire of managers not to be judged solely on short-term financial results, but without making their lives too comfortable. They would have to be more open and explicit about their forward plans; their ability to fulfil those plans would be exposed to rigorous public scrutiny. Institutional shareholders The usual reaction of City practitioners to the Lipton-Rosenblum paper is polite indifference: do we really need to tear up the existing system just because of a few takeover excesses? But a virtue of the proposal is that it builds on existing arrangements for reporting to shareholders. Unlike most other proposals for reform, it does not have unrealistic expectations about changing the behaviour of non-executive directors or institutional shareholders. Most institutions have neither the resources nor the motivation to become 'interested owners', monitoring companies on a continuous basis; it is not obvious that the management of those companies would be improved if they did so. But shareholders do need reliable information on which to base investment judgments. Just as the proposed accounting changes in the UK would improve the quality of financial information, so the Lipton-Rosenblum reforms would provide better insight into overall corporate objectives and performance. The proposals do involve restrictions in the free market for corporate control. But takeovers, especially those involving large companies, are important events with economic and social repercussions. It is right that contested bids should be decided only after the most careful consideration. The argument is not that the market for corporate control should cease to exist - it remains an important source of flexibility in the Anglo-American capitalist system - but that the rules governing its operation should be tightened in a way which makes bad takeovers less likely. The quinquennial proposal involves a skilful trade-off between the interests of managers, investors and society as a whole. It does so by uniting boards of directors and shareholders behind what ought to be the primary goal of the enterprise  -to maximise profits over the long term. *Outlined in the FT on June 27 1990, now elaborated in The University of Chicago Law Review, Vol 58, No 1, Winter 1991.

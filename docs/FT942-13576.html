			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / International Company News: Spanish banks mixed in first three months Argentaria, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya and Banco Santander, the three large Spanish banks bidding to acquire the Banesto financial group reported mixed first-quarter results, reflecting narrowing margins on ordinary banking business. Net interest income at Santander, the most international of Spain's banks with more than 40 per cent of profits arising abroad, rose 14.3 per cent to Pta64.7bn (Dollars 471.5m) against the first three months of 1993. Net interest income fell 2.9 per cent to Pta79bn at BBV and was little changed at Pta60.2bn at Argentaria. Argentaria lifted first-quarter pre-tax profits by 12.1 per cent to Pta31.7bn thanks mainly to strong income from fees and commissions and provision recoveries and also tight overall costs. Santander raised pre-tax profits by 9.7 per cent to Pta24.5bn and BBV posted a first-quarter pre-tax profit of Pta29.1bn, up 3.7 per cent. Santander said the quarter had been characterised by 'significant instability in domestic and international financial markets and by a general economic environment still showing signs of weakness'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Hysterics of the Warmonger"] </F>   [Text] According to reports, on 28 May, the traitor Kim  Yong- sam instigated a war mood while visiting a puppet combat  air corps, an Army unit in the eastern front line, and a Navy  fleet headquarters in succession.    Saying that it is possible to maintain peace on the Korean  peninsula only when they [South Koreans] are strong, he ordered  soldiers to be put on air-tight alertness, to make every  preparation for anti-aircraft alertness, and so on. This is a  deliberate maneuver to further aggravate the situation on the  Korean peninsula made tense by them, and plainly shows their  frenzy for a war of northward invasion.    The puppet traitor blared as if we were about to make a  sudden raid on the South, saying that this is a very dangerous  time. This is a shameless preposterous sophistry, like an act  of a thief raising a hue and cry.    Who is in fact making the situation tense and increasing the  danger of war on the Korean peninsula? It is needless to say  that it is the U.S. imperialists and the U.S. stooge, the Kim  Yong-sam puppet clique itself.    As was reported, the U.S. imperialists have brought Patriot  missiles and Apache attack helicopters into South Korea under  the pretext of our so-called nuclear issue and has now put the  aircraft carrier Independence in a location at sea from which it  may take one week or less for the aircraft carrier to arrive to  the Korean peninsula.    In the meantime, the U.S. ruling classes are making the  belligerent outburst that they should make an air raid on our  nuclear facilities for peaceful purposes or attack them with  cruise missiles. Following their U.S. master's war maneuver, the  puppets put the puppet armed forces on a state of alert and are  watching for a chance to invade the North.    What the puppets mean by peace is that they would provoke a  war of northward invasion, and what they mean by strength to be  increased is that they would further strengthen preparations for  a war of northward invasion.    These facts clearly prove that only northward threats, not  southward ones, exist on the Korean peninsula and that it is  none other than the U.S. imperialists and the Kim Yong-sam  puppet clique who try to provoke a war.    Traitor Kim Yong-sam, however, talked about being alert  against us. This shameless trick [paryomchihan sujak], like an  act of a thief raising a hue and cry, has revealed his vicious  intention to push the puppet armed forces out to a war of  northward invasion by aggravating the situation.    Traitor Kim Yong-sam, with a civilian mask, is indeed a more  vicious warmonger than military gangsters although he is wearing  civilian clothes. He takes no regard for peace or for the  country's reunification. Puppet Kim Yong-sam's instigation of a  war mood is nothing but hysterics of one who has lost reason.    As everyone knows, the puppets have been frenzied in  carrying  out war preparations while stirring up a commotion over our  nuclear issue. Our nuclear policy, however, has proved more  clearly to be innocent as days go by, while the slanderous  nature of the puppets' nuclear commotion has been exposed to the  light of day.    The South Korean people are vigorously waging the anti-U.S.,  antiwar, and antinuclear struggle, and their willpower for  independent reunification is rapidly growing.    Embarrassed by this, the puppets are trying to turn the  growing struggling spirit of the people to the South-North  confrontation by any means so that they can realize their scheme  for a war. One can guess how much he was embarrassed from the  fact that traitor Kim Yong-sam busied himself visiting puppet  units after giving up keeping appearances.    It is natural that those who have been driven into a corner  make all frenzied attempts. Such maneuvers, however, will only  expose the true nature of warmongers, splittists, and will only  result in hastening their own ruin.    Nothing can block the nation's grand march toward peace and  reunification. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique should look  straight at the trend of the time and behave discreetly.</p>

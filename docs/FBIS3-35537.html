Lieutenant Colonel Munir al-Maqdah, a former Fatah military  official who opposes the Gaza-Jericho Agreement, has stated that  Yasir 'Arafat is to blame for the Hebron massacre because he  signed the above agreement.    Al-Maqdah announced: Our retaliation to this massacre will  be very cruel. We will use all available methods. Let no one,  inside or outside the occupied territories, blame us.    Al-Maqdah called on 'Arafat not just to resign, because his  resignation is no longer useful, but to take out his pistol and  point it at his own head.</p>

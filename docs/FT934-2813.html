			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / International Company News: Borden chairman forced to resign Mr Anthony D'Amato, the 63-year-old chairman and chief executive of Borden, the US food company, has been forced to quit. His departure comes amid growing criticisms of his efforts to reinvigorate the poorly-performing group. The chief executive's role has been taken over by Mr Erwin Shames, 53, who recently joined the company as president and chief operating officer. Mr Frank Tasco, 66, a Borden director, becomes chairman. Borden is the biggest US dairy company, the world's biggest pasta producer, and the second-biggest US manufacturer of salty snacks. It is also the world's largest producer of wall coverings and one of the world's leading manufacturers of industrial adhesives and food-wrap films. During the 1980s, the company took on heavy debt to make a large number of acquisitions. Although in the short term the strategy produced profits growth, in 1990 net income started to decline. Mr D'Amato - appointed chief executive in November 1991 and chairman in March 1992 - had been trying to turn the company around. In spite of two restructurings in two years, however, profits continued to fall, and Borden's share price fell to its lowest in nearly 10 years. Mr D'Amato had been planning to announce a third restructuring before the end of this year. However, some of the company's bigger shareholders are believed to have made it known to the board that they wanted a change. The board said that it was 'in the best interests of everyone' that Mr Shames become chief executive.</p>

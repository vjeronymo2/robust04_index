			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTELLECTS AND U.S. POLITICS  </P> <P> Gary Hart's column ("Do Not Await a Messiah," Editorial Page, Feb. 17) is of  significance for its emphasis on the nonpolitical and non-ideological aspects  of the Central European revolution. These events foretell what American  politics will be like in the coming decades as people learn more about and  become impatient with the deception and corruption that permeate our political  system.  </P> <P> As Hart points out, "Can anyone imagine a political figure in either party who  writes, or indeed could write, political essays -- let alone ones that are  rich, poetic, philosophical meditations, searching the deeper meaning of  experience." Is it conceivable that U.S. voters would ever elect a playwright  like Vaclav Havel as president?  </P> <P> And yet, this is exactly what we need in America: an honest confrontation with  politicians to change their ways. No more phony political issues like Willie  Horton or the American flag to deceive the people and obscure the issues.  </P> <P> It is time that we in America learn a lesson from the Central European  revolution and reject the rigid and stultifying ideologies that have no  relevancy in the political and economic life of the American people.  </P> <P> ARNOLD MADDALONI  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / French bid to win UK TV accord MR Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the French industry minister, said yesterday he supported plans to concentrate the EC's advanced television strategy on the development of wide-screen television programmes and equipment. Mr Strauss-Kahn, in Brussels for a meeting of EC industry ministers, said he thought such an approach might win the support of Britain, which is blocking an earlier attempt to pump Ecu500m (Pounds 414.5m) of funding into high-definition television (HDTV) over the next five years. France has been one of the leading advocates of an aggressive HDTV strategy, partly because Thomson, the French electronics manufacturer, has invested heavily in the original 'Mac' family of HDTV standards promoted by the European Commission. Britain opposes funding because it believes the Mac standards are being overtaken by digital HDTV technology developed in the US. Mr Martin Bangemann, the EC industry commissioner, said last week there was no need for Europe to develop its own exclusive digital HDTV standards, because European companies - including Thomson, and Philips of the Netherlands - were already bidding to produce the US technology. Mr Strauss-Kahn agreed yesterday that European companies were playing a leading role in developing digital technology, but he said digital HDTV might not arrive before 2005. Mr Bangemann has indicated that digital HDTV might be possible as early as 1997.</p>

			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / People: Heading into the sunset Robert Sangster, 57, the millionaire racehorse-owner, is limbering up to join the race for control of United Racecourses, owners of Epsom, Sandown Park and Kempton Park. He is set to join the tiny media company Sunset and Vine, if it wins the race to buy the racecourses from the Horserace Betting Lebvy board, the statutory body which has owned them for over 20 years. Sunset, which has a market capitalisation of less than Pounds 10m, covers horse-racing and other sports for Channel 4 and is regarded as the outsider among the three contenders which put in their bids last Monday. The others are Racecourse Holdings Trust, owned by the Jockey Club, and a consortium headed by Stan Clarke, owner of Uttoxeter racecourse. Sangster's decision to join the board of Sunset and Vine suggests that its chances of wining control may not be as slender as is sometimes suggested. Sangster is reputed to be worth Pounds 130m and Richard Thompson, one of the people behind the Sunset bid, comes from another well known family of wealthy racehorse-owners. His father, David Thompson, made Pounds 300m from the sale of his stake in the Hillsdown food group and whose horse, Party Politics, won the Grand National in 1992. Lazard Brothers, the merchant bankers acting for the levy board, will announce the winner on March 22.</p>

			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Arts: The Moscow Festival Ballet - Dance We are witnessing, albeit from a distance, the worst crisis in Russian ballet since the Bolshevik Revolution. Then, for nearly a decade, ballet had to fight to survive and justify itself in a new society. That it did so, manacled by the doctrine of socialist realism, and flourished, says more for the grand aspirations of the Russian spirit than for socialism. Now, without the sanctions - or the support - of the former regime, Russian ballet must seek to retain its dignity, must adjust to new market forces, must go into the market-place, and must, ultimately, regenerate for a new era. So the great companies tour, playing their traditional repertory in ever bigger and less convincing arenas, haemorrhaging dancers and teachers, living off an aesthetic that has faded with the commissars. So smaller and opportunistic ensembles are formed, trading on the West's belief that the words 'Russian' and 'Ballet' are guarantee enough of quality. That they are not has latterly been all too clear: I have found little to admire in performances by such outfits as Moscow City Ballet, with its rickety classical stagings in tremulous performance. It is pleasing, then, to welcome Moscow Festival Ballet, returned for a third visit to smaller regional theatres. The company has 30 dancers. Its repertory offers gems from the classics - at best, the second acts of Swan Lake and Giselle - but its director, Sergey Radchenko, whom we remember with the Bolshoi, has recruited interesting soloists, and his dancers are well-trained. (None of those innocent bodies who look as if they should have been in bed - or ballet class - hours ago). The added cachet is the presence, as in previous visits, of Lubov Kunakova, a guest ballerina, a real ballerina, from the Kirov. There results an evening, as I saw at the Beck Theatre in Hayes on Monday night, which neither cheats the public nor the idea of Russian ballet. Staging is basic - the Hayes lighting was, one might say, unco-operative - but the second act of Giselle which opened the evening was absolutely credible, absolutely what it purported to be, a comment I would be reluctant to make about other stagings, both here and abroad. After the initial shock of Hilarion's entrance - he goes mad alone on stage before our very eyes - the text and the performances were serious. In the case of Kunakova, we were given an interpretation of complete authority. A sense of tradition (that mysterious quality that makes the dance seem inevitable), eloquent lyricism, showed us Giselle as it ought to be shown - by a ballerina mistress of her art. It was in many ways an 'old-fashioned' performance  - this is where tradition speaks most clearly about how each incident, each dance-phrase, must be shaped - and I thought it commanding, true. The Albrecht, Alexey Kremnyov, was promising, but still finding his way into the role. The Myrtha, Saule Rakhmedova, and her wilis, were good. The Beck stage is shallow, but the production (even with taped accompaniment) made one forget this. As in those long-gone days when I used to go to the Mercury Theatre and see ballet crammed on to a six-metre-square stage, I believed. There is no greater tribute. The second part of the evening (I saw one of two programmes which vary in their components) was given over to divertissement numbers. The Pas de Quatre looked coy - Taglioni as a nervous hostess - and a pas d'action from Esmeralda was a dark moment of the soul, but in Marina Alexandrova there was an Aurora of distinction, having a lovely seriousness for the last great duet, while as fireworks we had the Solovyov-Sedoy Gopak, and the Spring Waters duet, whose costumes (pale green chiffon outfits for him and her) suggest mad cross-dressing, but whose athleticism is of Olympic standard. One reproach: there was no indication of the casting from a list of alternative names in the programme. The public is owed this courtesy. Moscow Festival Ballet tours until May 31.</p>

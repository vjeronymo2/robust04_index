Therefore the town must be  declared a disaster area. That demand comes from Liina Maaste,  mayor of Sindi, the smallest municipality in Estonia.    The old textile factory, where all work has stopped, has  been  declared bankrupt. The people have no jobs, no money, no aid.    Families in Sindi have only meager children's benefits to  live on. Even retirees, with their miserably small pensions, are  better off. So far people are getting by. They have gathered  mushrooms in the woods and tried to raise a few potatoes and  other vegetables in small garden patches outside their houses.    "But without outside aid we will be unable to manage in the  winter," Maaste told DAGENS NYHETER.    Thanks to a little aid from Sweden last winter they can  still  provide soup for retirees in Sindi's municipal soup kitchen.  Here for one Estonian kroon (worth about 60 Swedish ore) old  people get a bowl of soup, a little bread, and, on the day of  our visit, two small pancakes.  <H5>  One Employer </H5>   The tragedy in Sindi is that the town of just 4,200  inhabitants had only one employer, Kalevs textile factory with  approximately 1,000 employees. The factory is 150 years old and  has survived many difficult periods. But when the Soviet empire  collapsed it was definitely all over for the Sindi factory too.    Before, during the wild days of planned economy, textiles  from Sindi were sent to other Soviet republics. But now Russia  is no longer paying for goods and no one in the West wants the  inferior textiles from Sindi.    Of course company fatalities have also hit the Swedish mill  community. But in Sweden there is a social safety net. That is  not the case in the poor Baltic states. To get a monthly  unemployment benefit of 180 Estonian kroon (a little over 100  Swedish kronor), strict requirements must be met. In addition  companies avoid paying this by sending employees home on  "indefinite leaves" that can last several years.  <H5>  Six Children </H5>   Liina Maaste accompanied us on a visit to one of the typical  unemployed families in Sindi.    The Peas, Arvo, 40, and Eve, 38, both worked at Sindi's  textile plant. They have six children. A seventh is on the way.  Four of the children live at home. The oldest son, 21 years old,  is married and lives with his own family in his mother-in-law's  house. An 18-year-old son lives in the country. The couple's  only income is the children's benefit for four minor children, a  total of 600 Estonian kroon a month. This corresponds to around  375 Swedish kronor. The money has to cover food, rent,  electricity, fuel, clothes for the children. It doesn't.  Therefore most people do not bother to pay the rent, mayor Liina  explained.    "If we hadn't got secondhand clothes, the children would  have  had to go naked," said Eve.    Eve and Arvo have helped farmers in the neighborhood harvest  their potatoes. They were paid in the form of several sacks of  potatoes.    "All our cupboards are full of pickled and dried mushrooms  that we gathered," Eve told us.    "We will probably have a seventh son," said Arvo, but added:    "But now we must have no more children, we can't afford it."    What was the best time for the Pea family of Sindi  financially?    "It was probably the last year of the Russian ruble when we  both still had our jobs at the textile plant," Arvo said.    What will happen to Sindi?    "The Estonian Government in Tallinn must first declare us a  disaster area and also provide financial assistance. We also  need international aid," Maaste said.    She is worried that "the wolves will plunder" what is left  of  the old textile plant in Sindi, that the machinery will simply  be sold and some of the old bosses will stuff the money into  their own pockets. That is the way things often go in connection  with "privatization" in postsocialist Estonia.    The old red directors of the state companies and kolkhoz and  sovkhoz chairmen often finagle the biggest share into their own  pockets.    There are many scandals. Rumors circulate, newspapers write  about them without properly investigating what really happens  later. The authorities intervene far too seldom or far too late.  Just now, for example, a big furniture factory in Tallinn is in  trouble.  <H5>  Person With the Most Power </H5>   Maaste herself is a child of the communist party apparatus.  She does not deny it. Liina was the person with the most power  in Sindi before, but then her title, translated into English,  was chairman of the executive committee.    She worked for some years at the communist party  headquarters  in the neighboring town of Parnu and after independence she was  appointed mayor of Sindi.    In order to get anybody to run for office in Sindi in the  local elections that were recently held in Estonia Liina had to  persuade the chief doctor, some self-employed businessmen, an  electrician, and some business people to run with her on a  15-person ticket. Just enough for a new assembly of delegates.  They were elected, there was no alternative, and Liina kept her  job as mayor.    She does not exactly get a fat paycheck as mayor: 1,340  Estonian kroon or 837 Swedish kronor, only slightly more than  the statistical average wage in Estonia.    What does she want? She wants the municipality to be able to  take over part of the bankrupt factory so it can make its own  effort to find someone who will lease the premises. Then money  will be needed to repair and enlarge the sewage system.  Otherwise everything will end up in Parnu Bay and further out in  the Baltic Sea. The heating systems in houses with central  heating have also broken down. The main street is in very poor  shape and the children need money for school.    We inspected the small clinic, Sindi's few private  businesses, and the town's pride, the old station building that  has been converted into a library. The only relatively new  building in all of Sindi.</p>

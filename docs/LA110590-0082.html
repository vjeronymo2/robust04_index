			<p><P> November 5, 1990, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> 1,000 TAKE A WALK TO RAISE MONEY FOR AIDS SERVICES  </P> <P> More than 1,000 people raised $205,000 for AIDS service providers by walking  downtown Los Angeles streets Sunday in the new "Eastside AIDS-Thon," designed  to highlight the rising incidence of the deadly disease among blacks, Latinos,  Asians and other minorities.  </P> <P> The turnout did not meet the expectations of organizers, whose goal was 5,000  participants bringing in $350,000.  </P> <P> But "it's the first year. We're very pleased," said Keith Malone of the AIDS  Healthcare Foundation, which financed the event. "There will be a second one."  </P> <P> More than 20 agencies involved with acquired immune deficiency syndrome worked  together on the walk-a-thon, conceived in part to break what they consider a  monopoly on fund raising by the more famous AIDS Project Los Angeles "AIDS  Walk." Proceeds in this year's AIDS Walk were $2.3 million.  </P></p>

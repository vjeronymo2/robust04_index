			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / GPA drops plans to buy joint ventures THE GPA Group has cancelled plans to buy in its joint venture companies to avoid bringing Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 640m) of extra borrowings on to its balance sheet. This is the first sign that the aircraft leasing company's plans are being affected by its failure last month to proceed with its planned Dollars 800m flotation. The company has more than Dollars 7bn of firm orders to acquire aircraft from manufacturers over the next three years, and some of GPA's investment bankers believe it needs to raise around Dollars 500m within six months to avoid cancelling or deferring some of these orders. According to one of its investment bankers, the company is considering raising funds through the issue of debt securities in the capital markets, the private placement of shares and a convertible preference share issue. The group would only say that it is reviewing all its options before its board meeting this month. GPA's UK pathfinder prospectus, issued in May, spelled out why the group wanted to buy the equity interests in its joint ventures. It said: 'The company believes that much of the rationale for maintaining many of the joint venture companies has diminished, particularly having regard to the higher cost and complexity of managing such enterprises.' Last year GPA's share of the profits from all of its joint ventures fell from Dollars 83m to Dollars 56m. A spokesman for GPA yesterday said: 'It is highly probable that we shall not buy in the joint ventures because we do not want their borrowings on our balance sheet.' In the year to December the joint venture companies reported Dollars 1.2bn debt and Dollars 1.9bn in assets. The joint ventures which GPA had hoped to gain control of were GPA Airbus, Irish Aerospace, GPA-ATR and GPA Fokker. As of March 31, GPA had contributed Dollars 275m to the joint venture companies in the form of equity and subordinated loans, and had guaranteed Dollars 178m of the obligations of the companies and expects to provide more in the future. GPA has already purchased equity interests in three former joint ventures - GPA Rolls, GPA Aero Citra and Air Maple - for Dollars 92m.</p>

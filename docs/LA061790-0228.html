			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ARTS GROUP TARGETS NEA STAND BY ROHRABACHER  </P> <P> Rock singer Sammy Hagar and actress Stephanie Zimbalist will soon get an earful  about U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita).  </P> <P> Zimbalist and Hagar are among hundreds of Rohrabacher's political contributors  who are being targeted in a mailing this week by a Long Beach-based group that  opposes the congressman's efforts to rein in the National Endowment for the  Arts.  </P> <P> Rohrabacher, whose district includes part of northwestern Orange County, and  other Capitol Hill conservatives accuse the federal agency of subsidizing  obscene and sacrilegious art projects. But the Long Beach group, a coalition of  artists and arts supporters, charges the conservatives with censorship.  </P> <P> "We feel like this is a way to take the debate right back to the gasoline pump  of the political process," said Michael Nash, video curator of the Long Beach  Museum of Art. "We're going to ask (Rohrabacher's contributors) to urge him to  reconsider his position and, if that doesn't work, to reconsider their support  for him."  </P> <P> Rohrabacher, a first-term congressman up for reelection this year, says the  vast majority of voters support his position. "I think the issue is helping me,  frankly," he said Friday. "I think most voters agree that standards should be  set so tax dollars aren't wasted on obscene art."  </P> <P> The mailing, by the Long Beach/Orange County chapter of the National Campaign  for Freedom of Expression, is the leading edge of an effort by members of the  art community to take on Rohrabacher in his back yard -- the 42nd Congressional  District. The largely Republican district stretches from Torrance to Huntington  Beach.  </P> <P> Playing a prominent part in the drive is the National Campaign for Freedom of  Expression, a Washington lobbying group created in April by artists and art  activists to support the endowment.  </P> <P> When the national group was formed in April, organizers said one of their first  tasks would be to encourage grass-roots campaigns against two leading opponents  of the NEA: Rohrabacher and Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.).  </P> <P> A month later, the group's Long Beach/Orange County chapter was formed. It  plans to run local print and broadcast ads criticizing the effort to regulate  the artistic content of NEA art projects and highlighting Rohrabacher's role in  that effort.  </P> <P> The local chapter says it has 50 members so far, including artists, arts  administrators, educators and others opposed to limits on the NEA. It plans to  hold a fund-raiser within a month to collect money for the advertisements,  which are being developed free of charge by artists in the group.  </P> <P> Organizers say interest in the effort is growing.  </P> <P> "This issue strikes right at the very core not only of practicing artists, but  also of individuals in society and the right to express one's self," said Bill  Viola, a nationally recognized video artist who lives in Long Beach. "Each  meeting, more people come. The energy level is really up."  </P> <P> The organizers say out-of-state NEA supporters, acting individually, are also  interested in taking the fight to Rohrabacher, a former Reagan speechwriter who  won election to Congress in 1988.  </P> <P> An example is John Payson, an art dealer based in Florida who last month sent  letters to the three Democratic candidates then competing in a primary campaign  for the right to challenge Rohrabacher on Nov. 6.  </P> <P> Payson wrote that he opposed Rohrabacher's stance on the endowment and  solicited the Democrats' views on the agency so that he could consider giving  them his support.  </P> <P> Told Friday that Guy C. Kimbrough of Huntington Beach, the apparent winner of  the Democratic primary, supports unrestricted federal funding of the art  endowment, Payson said Kimbrough can expect a $1,000 contribution.  </P> <P> "I have been very, very upset about Rohrabacher's stand on the NEA," said  Payson. ". . . If (Kimbrough) is indeed opposing that stand, I will send him  the maximum check allowed under the law to beat Rohrabacher."  </P> <P> Such sentiment is good news to Kimbrough, who appeared headed for victory over  James Cavuoto of Torrance and Bryan W. Stevens of Rolling Hills Estates last  week as the remaining absentee ballots in the tight primary contest were being  counted.  </P> <P> The 44-year-old Mt. San Jacinto political science instructor begins his general  election bid with next to no campaign reserves compared to Rohrabacher, who at  last count has saved $100,000.  </P> <P> Kimbrough, who lost to Rohrabacher in the 1988 general election, also faces a  53% to 36% Republican voter registration edge over Democrats in the 42nd  District.  </P> <P> But he said he can use the arts debate as one of several issues to pry  Republican voters -- and campaign contributors -- from Rohrabacher. Others, he  said, include abortion, which Rohrabacher favors banning, and offshore oil  drilling, which the incumbent generally supports.  </P> <P> "Many Republicans in the district are in the arts community or are patrons of  the arts," Kimbrough said. "I think there's a tremendous potential for this  issue."  </P> <P> Rohrabacher acknowledges that the arts issue could stir up some political  opposition.  </P> <P> "When I took this position, I knew it would increase the number of people  working actively against my reelection," he said.  </P> <P> But Rohrabacher says voters will be receptive to his argument that placing  artistic content restrictions on government art grants does not constitute an  attack on freedom of expression.  </P></p>

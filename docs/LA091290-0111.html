			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: CONSUMER STOCKS' RECENT DECLINE MAY LAST A WHILE  </P> <P> Consumer stocks, the stars of the '80s, suddenly are Wall Street's biggest  question mark.  </P> <P> Over the past year, and particularly over the past few months, some of the  best-known names in many key consumer products businesses have seen their  stocks devastated. The culprit has been a slowdown in sales as consumers have  tightened their belts or abandoned some former favorites for other products or  brands.  </P> <P> The casualty list includes fast-food king McDonald's, appliance maker Maytag,  the Hartmarx men's clothing firm, textile giant Fieldcrest and retailers J. C.  Penney and Toys R Us. All have seen their stocks fall far more than the 13%  drop in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index from its peak.  </P> <P> Many analysts are calling this a normal cyclical drop in the stocks, tied to a  normal cyclical decline in consumer spending that may or may not lead to  outright recession. But there's a deeper fear lurking: What if some consumer  goods and services sectors are entering not a cyclical decline but a secular  one -- a trend that could extend well into the 1990s?  </P> <P> Marshall Acuff, market strategist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham in New York,  notes that many key consumer businesses already have tumbled into deep slumps.  "We've lost the publishing stocks over the last few years, and we've lost the  hotels, like Marriott and Hilton," he says. "Some might argue that we're now  losing McDonald's."  </P> <P> The cold reality for consumer goods and services providers, Acuff says, is that  "we're not going to see the exuberant consumer in the 1990s that we saw in the  1980s."  </P> <P> Indeed, the aging of the American population, and the maturing of the baby  boomers, has long been expected to translate into slower consumer spending and  a higher savings rate over time. The argument is that the boomers, in  particular, have practically everything they need after their spending binge of  the 1980s -- everything except the money to fund their children's college  education or their own retirement.  </P> <P> No one is suggesting that consumer spending is simply going to collapse. But if  the trend over the next few years is for a greater emphasis on staying at home  and saving than going out and spending, then the growth rates of many consumer  companies may be lower than what Wall Street anticipates. The experience of  McDonald's, Hartmarx and Penney could be an early warning.  </P> <P> And for those consumers who need an extra push to exit the ranks of the  freewheelers, Congress may soon oblige: A proposal now is circulating on  Capitol Hill to impose a special federal "luxury" tax on purchases of goods  such as jewelry and boats to help reduce the government's gaping budget  deficit.  </P> <P> Some money managers, however, warn that it could be folly to speak too  generally about consumer trends. "We have a lifestyle in this country to be  pretty good spenders," says Robert Kommerstad, chairman of Pasadena-based  Provident Investment Counsel, a major investor in many consumer goods  companies. While spending may slow, he says, to assume that America in the  1990s will mimic Japan in the 1980s -- high savings, low consumption -- is  probably going too far.  </P> <P> Moreover, companies in the food and drug businesses, among other consumer  areas, sell goods that people can't very well go without, no matter what the  economy, Kommerstad notes. And many of those companies also are big players  overseas, which means they're much less dependent on the actions of American  consumers than they were 10 years ago. "I don't think anything can get in the  way of a consistent rate of growth for those companies," Kommerstad says.  </P> <P> So far, that seems true for many of the firms. For example, at an Aug. 22  meeting with analysts, Coca-Cola management "indicated that the soft drink  business is as solid and predictable as ever," says analyst Lawrence Adelman at  Dean Witter Reynolds. Recession or no, Coke is comfortable with analysts'  estimates of $2 a share in earnings this year, up 20% from last year, Adelman  says.  </P> <P> Kommerstad also notes that a spending slowdown ultimately could benefit the  strongest players in many consumer sectors, "because in tougher times the  marginal guy gets squeezed." That could leave more market share for the  strongest companies to grab.  </P> <P> Still, investors now may need to worry as much about perception as reality in  looking at consumer stocks. Retailers, food companies, apparel firms and  leisure-time companies were red-hot stocks in the 1980s, riding the consumer  spending boom. But no trend lasts forever, and when change comes it is often  unrecognized -- and even denied -- by investors until it is well along.  Remember how, in the mid-1980s, many investors refused to believe that small  stocks could have peaked in 1983?  </P> <P> If the market is suddenly perceiving that growth in consumer spending is coming  down, and likely to stay down, the consumer stocks' still high  price-to-earnings ratios could be slashed much more than they already have  been. Even the strong players could be penalized, at least for a period of  time.  </P> <P> "I don't think you can just write off these companies, but I agree that the  (P/E) multiples are too high," says Fred Astman, a money manager at First  Wilshire Securities in Los Angeles. Look at it this way: If the market decides  that, in a slower spending environment, Toys R Us should sell for 15 times  earnings rather than 20 times earnings, the stock would go from $23.50 now to  $16.75, even though it has already plunged from $35.  </P> <P> For investors who've ridden the consumer stocks' magnificent gains from the  1980s, now may be a good time to consider selling at least a portion of your  holdings, especially if your stocks still appear to be anticipating strong  growth ahead. By next spring, we all may be filling the shopping malls again,  buying like crazy. But in this market, hedging one's bet is the wiser move.  </P> <P> Briefly: The nation's regional stock exchanges are likely to merge with the  major exchanges or disappear over the next 10 years, the chairman of the  American Stock Exchange said Tuesday. In a speech in Washington, James Jones  predicted that only the three largest stock markets -- the New York Stock  Exchange, the National Assn. of Securities Dealers' over-the-counter market and  Jones' own Amex -- will survive by the year 2000. That may sound self-serving,  but Jones maintains that cost pressures are killing the smaller exchanges. . .  . Torrance-based Standard Brands Paints, the home decorating retailer, is  having a tough time in the slow economy. But Kansas City, Mo., investor John  Latshaw continues to raise his stake in the chain. Latshaw, head of Latshaw  Enterprises, bought 149,200 more Standard shares between July 10 and Aug. 30,  according to an SEC filing. He paid between $8.75 and $12.125 apiece. The  purchases raised Latshaw's stake to 811,515 shares, or 14.2%. Standard stock  closed at $7.50 Tuesday, a 52-week low. . . .  </P> <P> The Chicago Board Options Exchange is introducing the first long-term put and  call options on individual stocks, beginning Oct. 5. The options to be issued  first will expire in either July, August or September, 1992, and will cover 14  blue chip stocks, including AT&amp;T, Exxon, Boeing, IBM and McDonald's.  Options currently extend for less than one year. The new options will give  investors a long-term tool for hedging their holdings.  </P> <P> CONSUMER STOCK CASUALTIES  </P> <P> Consumer stocks have been devastated both by a real slowdown in spending and by  fears of a much worse slowdown ahead.

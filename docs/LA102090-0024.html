			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THERE'S LITTLE DEFENSE AGAINST THE USC BAND  </P> <P> Ears and brain can take only so much and I hope I never hear the USC band  again.  </P> <P> Having been totally annoyed in the past, I decided at Saturday's USC-Stanford  game to try to count the number of times the Trojan Band played all or part of  its fanfare (called "Conquest," I think). The total I got was 46 and I probably  missed a few.  </P> <P> What the USC band director forgets (or ignores) is that any mature brain begins  to filter out the constant music. And finally it is totally tuned out or the  trapped listener is driven wild.  </P> <P> HARRY PRESS  </P> <P> Palo Alto  </P></p>

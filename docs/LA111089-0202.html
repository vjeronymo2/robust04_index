			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ON THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> LONG PUTTER PUTS SENIOR AHEAD  </P> <P> Australian Peter Senior shot a 68 to grab a two-shot lead after the second  round of the Australian PGA championship.  </P> <P> Senior, using an elongated putter, finished 36-holes at 135, 9-under-par. He  kept cool in today's difficult rain-swept conditions and fired six birdies over  the par-72, 6,950-yard Riverside Oaks course.  </P> <P> Mike Harwood of Australia carded a 69 which left him at 137, tied with American  John Wilson and two strokes behind the leader. Wilson also fired a 69.  </P> <P> American Jim Benepe was in fourth, 6-under-par, after hitting seven birdies in  a sizzling 66.  </P> <P> Senior's long putter, which he tucks under his chin with his left hand and  swings with his right, was functioning at its best today. He sank 20-foot  birdie putts on the third and 10th holes and rolled in a 27-foot putt on the  15th.  </P></p>

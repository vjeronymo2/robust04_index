			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / International Company News: Mannesmann criticises ministry over deregulation The German postal ministry was yesterday accused of blocking private telecommunications operators' efforts to prepare for deregulation of the federal network. 'If private companies cannot prepare for the end of the telephone monopolies, then giants like AT&amp;T will come and roll over the German market when the day comes,' said Mr Peter Mihatsch, head of Mannesmann's telecommunications division. Calling for a time schedule for the introduction of competition, he attacked the 'lack of objectivity' demonstrated by Mr Wolfgang Botsch, the minister responsible. Mannesmann and UK-based Mercury recently won temporary injunctions preventing the ministry from awarding Germany's first in-flight mobile phone service to DeTeMobil, a subsidiary of the state-controlled Deutsche Telekom. A Cologne court found that bids from the three operators had been effectively equally competitive. The issue now seems likely to be resolved by a lottery. Meanwhile, Mannesmann, lead operator of Germany's D-2 mobile phone network, would press on with the search for new international partners, Mr Mihatsch said in an interview with Handelsblatt, the business daily. He was negotiating with several potential partners with the aim of providing global corporate communications services based on Corporate Network International, a newly-formed business. CNI was recently approved by the European Commission as being good for competition in the sector which had been the sole preserve of Deutsche Telekom. It is a joint venture between senior partner Mannesmann, Deutsche Bank and RWE, the energy-based conglomerate. Mannesmann was also looking for more partners in conventional mobile telephone services, Mr Mihatsch said.</p>

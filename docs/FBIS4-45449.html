			<p>California,   Sinaloa   <F P=102> 94WB0044B Mexico City EXCELSIOR in Spanish 20 May 94 pp  1-A-3, 4-A-3 </F>  <F P=103> 94WB0044B </F> <F P=104>  Mexico City EXCELSIOR </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rafael Medina Cruz] </F>   [Text] Yesterday, with reconnaissance, inspection, and  detection flights, the air teams from the Attorney General's  Office [PGR] discovered two marijuana and poppy plantations in  Baja California and Sinaloa States. Presumed drug trafficking  groups were growing over 200,000 drug plants on these  plantations. The confiscation of farm implements, fuel, gun  loaders, and useful cartridges was also announced. No arrests  were made.    Reports sent to Mexico City by Arturo Ochoa Palacios, the  PGR  representative in Baja California, state that, on the boundary  of the communities of Real del Castillo and Viejo Enecua, in the  municipality of Mexicali, a marijuana plantation on  approximately 15,000 square meters was discovered.    Mario Ruiz Massieu, assistant attorney for local offices and  inspection, was informed that, on that expanse, 7,500 seedbeds  were located, each with 25 plants, ready to be transplanted to  solid ground. Found on the site, adjoining the Ojos Negros  highway, were picks, shovels, hoes, machetes, axes, a jug  containing gasoline, two 22-caliber rifles, and useful  cartridges.    Continuing the investigation, agents under orders from  Rodolfo Garcia Gaxiola, the PJF [Federal Judicial Police] deputy  commissioner, also confiscated a pickup truck with state of  California registration 2JDE320, and a filled loader for a 7.62  caliber rifle. These items were left at the social  representative's disposal.    Moreover, Luis Antonio Ibanez Cornejo, the PGR's  representative in Sinaloa, reported that, in the hamlet called  Las Playitas, in the municipality of Sinaloa de Leyva, a mixed  (marijuana and poppy) plantation was located. The 21 drug crops  being grown there were destroyed manually and incinerated by  federal agents.    It was added that the community had participated in the  discovery of those crops, since it reported in a telephone call  that groups of persons acting suspiciously were often meeting on  that site. This prompted the Federal Judicial Police to  intervene, resulting in the destruction of the illicit plants.    The PJF deputy commissioner in this state, Eduardo Salazar  Carrillo, informed the force's general director, Adrian Carrera  Fuentes, that hoes, shovels, fumigation pumps, fertilizers, and  insecticides were also discovered and seized on that site.    The PGR stressed in conclusion that, in both cases, the  investigations are being continued to identify and capture the  crop owners, as well as those who provided their services to  plant and produce the drugs.</p>

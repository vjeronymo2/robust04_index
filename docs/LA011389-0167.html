			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> GENERAL CINEMA OKS $1.75-BILLION SALE OF SOFT DRINK UNIT TO PEPSICO  </P> <P> General Cinema Corp. said today it agreed to sell its soft-drink bottling  business to Pepsico Inc. for $1.75 billion in cash, reviving a deal that had  nearly been scuttled by tax concerns.  </P> <P> Late in 1988 General Cinema had agreed to sell the unit, which is the largest  independent Pepsi bottler in the United States, to Pepsico. in exchange for a  note valued at $1.5 billion.  </P> <P> However, the agreement, which was subject to completion prior to year end in  order to garner a lucrative tax break, was nullified when the Federal Trade  Commission requested more information on the deal, thus preventing completion  before Dec. 31.  </P> <P> The company said the revised transaction is subject to a definitive agreement.  </P> <P> The acquisition will increase Pepsico's direct ownership over of its bottlers  to 49% of total units produced. Combined with other bottlers in which it holds  a stake, it would have influence over 65% of its volume.  </P> <P> Analysts have said it is unlikely the FTC will seek to block the sale on  anti-trust grounds.  </P> <P> Pepsico shares fell 75 cents to $38.75 in active trading on the New York Stock  Exchange.  </P> <P> General Cinema stock rose $1.875 to $25.875 a share.  </P></p>

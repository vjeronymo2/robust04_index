			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Steel industry plans reach new impasse THE Italian and German governments' reluctance to agree production and subsidy cuts at state-owned steel mills risks plunging the European steel industry even deeper into crisis, the European Commission warned yesterday. Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, yesterday indicated that if Rome and Bonn remained intransigent they could derail the Commission's plans to help the whole west European steel industry. Mr Paolo Savona, the Italian industry minister, has raised the stakes in the long and fraught negotiations with Brussels, by threatening to press ahead with plans for privatising Ilva, the state steelmaker, without Commission approval. He told the Italian parliament on Tuesday that he would fight the Commission's strict limits on subsidies as far as the European Court of Justice, if necessary. The new impasse makes it almost certain that industry ministers will have to delay formal agreement on a series of controversial restructuring plans for Spanish, east German and Italian state-owned steel producers at their meeting next Thursday. Mr Van Miert told a news conference yesterday: 'Those who want to make this (plan) impossible are going to have to justify themselves to the industry, which will suffer if the Commission's approach fails.' Private steelmakers, which have already undergone substantial painful restructuring, such as British Steel or Usinor-Sacilor in France, will not make further capacity cuts unless they are reassured that state aid to their publicly owned competitors is under strict control. Western Europe's steelmakers have already warned that as many as 100,000 jobs could be lost in the restructuring of the industry, which is suffering from overcapacity, lack of demand and cheap competition from beyond the European Union's borders. Mr Van Miert reserved his principal criticism yesterday for the Italians, who seemed close to striking a deal with Brussels a fortnight ago. 'We went as far as we could to convince the Italian authorities that this was the end of it as far as the Commission was concerned.' However, Mr Van Miert sounded more optimistic about the possibility of altering the Treuhand privatisation agency's plan to sell off 60 per cent of the east German steelmaker, Ekostahl. He and Mr Martin Bangemann, the industry commissioner, were last night negotiating with Mr Gunter Rexrodt, German economics minister, in the hope of agreeing further capacity cuts before the ministerial meeting next week. The commissioner alleged that the Italian authorities had misled the Commission about the exact number of furnaces at Ilva's Taranto plant.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 8 (YONHAP) -- National Unification  Minister Yi Hong-ku said Wednesday that international sanctions  against North Korea should be effective and quick but gradual.    Speaking to reporters over lunch, Yi predicted it would take  two to four weeks for the UN Security Council to adopt a  resolution calling for sanctions against North Korea.    By "gradual" sanctions, he meant that during each phase the  door should remain open for negotiation depending on North  Korea's response.    No uncertainty will cloud the government's policy toward the  North Korean nuclear issue, he said. "The move to slap  sanctions on the North this time is to honor the words that the  North would hardly avoid sanctions if it continued refueling its  5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon without the presence of  international inspectors," he added.    Meanwhile, Ku Pon-tae, chief policy-maker at the National  Unification Board, stressed the nuclear issue should not be left  for neighboring countries and the international community to  resolve.    Speaking at a policy discussion meeting of the ruling  Democratic Liberal Party's central standing committee earlier in  the day, Ku noted that external pressure will understandably be  put on North Korea to pay the price if it yielded to the  sanctions of the International Atomic energy agency or the world  community.    He added that in parallel with international sanctions,  inter-Korean efforts should be made to settle the nuclear  question.    Asked about the possibility of the United States taking  sanctions on its own, he replied that Washington has so far  favored initial sanctions under a UN Security Council  resolution. After these initial sanctions, the next step would  be taken based on North Korea's response, he observed.    Ku predicted that escalating sanctions would have a  tremendous impact on South Korea's economy. In order to make  sanctions effective, the South must be prepared for all  eventualities, including a counteraction by the North.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 11 (CNS) -- Without doubt China had  to keep inflation under control and not let it exceed economic  growth, a member of the Standing Committee of the National  People's Congress (NPC) and professor at Beijing University, Mr.  Li Yining, said in an interview with this agency. He added,  however, that a rise in unemployment rather than inflation would  pose a greater threat to China.    Inflation to some extent is not inevitable for the  maintenance of economic growth, according to Mr. Li who is  attending the current session of the 8th NPC. Should the  government make proper use of four important means at the  present stage, namely savings deposits at bank for value  preservation, adjustment of wages in accordance with the cost of  living, pensions and the curbing of a price hike by  administrative means, inflation would not worsen.    Mr. Li said he believed that if people had a job and a  regular income which could support their daily needs, inflation  to some extent would not constitute a threat. By contrast,  however, a person who had lost his job would be in anxious state  and a group of unemployed persons in despair would be a  potential source of unrest to society.    It justified the thinking that reasonable economic gain  should be not only in line with the national strength and with  the market purchasing power, but also capable of providing  sufficient job opportunities for the newly increased number of  job-seekers.    Mr. Li suggested that the central government should give  priority to the handling of employment which involves job  opportunities for ten million job-seekers every year. The  important matter, Mr. Li said, lay in the relaxation of the  policy on restriction on employment and in letting people seek a  suitable job for themselves.</p>

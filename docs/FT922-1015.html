			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (15): Sir Leon cracks the whip - Prices THE UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission and the European Commission have now both combed through the vexed issue of pan-European car prices. But the results of their endeavours appear to have done little to dispel the damaging confusion that still confronts car buyers throughout the Community. When the MMC report was published in February, the UK motor industry breathed a sigh of relief. The Commission concluded that British new car prices were not unacceptably out of line with prices in other comparable EC markets. Last month, the European Commission published its own report, however, and sent a new shock wave though the industry. Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, has adopted an altogether tougher and more rigorous stance than the MMC. Car makers are still trying to make up their minds as to how they should react to the trenchant demands from Brussels for greater price transparency. They were much less troubled by the MMC report. After 18 months of deliberation and sifting through a mountain of evidence, the MMC concluded: 'British consumers, particularly private motorists, do pay more for their cars than they should.' It also said: 'A complex monopoly does exist in the case of 24 car suppliers;' and that 'some of the restrictions applied by manufacturers to their exclusively franchised dealers do reduce competition and act against the public interest.' Yet the report concluded that neither car makers nor dealers had engaged in systematic profiteering and it recommended no significant structural changes in the way the industry operates. It also appeared to accept in their entirety the industry's arguments that Britain's franchised dealer system, with its dedicated service and repair facilities and after-sales support, was necessary because of the complexity of the products sold and their safety implications. Several surveys in recent years by the Consumers Association and the Federation of European Consumer Associations (BEUC) have claimed that UK prices are substantially higher than those for comparable cars in some other EC countries. The Commission concluded, however, that 'a comparison of the price ranges in the United Kingdom with those in France and Germany, the two markets studied most similar to the UK in size and both with substantial indigenous manufacturing capacity, does not indicate a significant difference in general price levels.' This did not apply so closely to prices for smaller cars, however, where the MMC said that there were a number of model variants in France and Germany 'whose adjusted prices appear on any of our assumptions to be considerably lower than those in the United Kingdom.' The MMC said that list price differences between Britain and other EC markets were, indeed, wide, but these narrowed considerably when they were adjusted for factors such as different levels of equipment specification, exchange rate fluctuations and availability of cheap finance. Sir Leon Brittan, in sharp contrast to the MMC, has warned car makers that action is needed to reduce price differentials between different European markets. In a key letter last month to individual car manufacturers, he warned that the Commission had decided that 'action is needed at once' both to monitor car prices more closely and to reduce differentials. The controversial study prepared for the European Commission and published last month showed that there have been substantial price differences for some car models throughout the Community of more than 40 per cent in the most extreme cases. According to the EC report, five car makers - Ford, Honda, Citroen, Mazda and Audi - had at least one model with price differences greater than 40 per cent in one of the five time periods selected for study between January 1988 and January 1991. The study's findings have come under heavy attack from the motor industry, but in his letter Sir Leon has made clear that car makers must take steps to make their European pricing policies more transparent if they wish to retain the present selective car dealer distribution system in Europe. Behind all the claims and counter-claims this is the real bone of contention. In 1985 the motor industry was granted a 10-year so-called block exemption from EC competition rules, which allowed it to maintain the present franchised dealer system - selective distribution. This system restricts sales of new cars exclusively to dealers chosen by the manufacturers. Consumer groups, already critical of dealers and their service and repair performance, have called for the system to be replaced by a market 'free-for-all', with manufacturers being obliged to supply cars to virtually any outlet which wishes to sell them. In his letter to car makers last month, Sir Leon accepts that the EC car price study has not established 'beyond doubt' the linkage between large car price differences across the Community and the selective distribution system. Ominously for the car makers, he pointed out, however, that the study had made adjustments for the other most significant potential causes of the price differentials perceived by consumers. He left little doubt in his letter that the pricing issue would play a vital role in the decision-making process, at least for the competition officials. Sir Leon is calling on car makers: To publish every three months one price list on an EC-wide basis for their entire product range. Prices should be quoted both in Ecus and in local currency, and should be set out in a way that 'will enable consumers to make clear comparisons;' To make freely available every three months the prices recommended to authorised dealers for the manufacturer's five top-selling models in each market along with comparable prices for every other EC market (again in ECUs and local currency); To complete every six months an analysis of the prices recommended to dealers in each EC member state of 'one standard, low-equipment model' in each market segment. The manufacturers are to ensure in this way that they are operating within the price bands allowed by the block exemption regulation. In addition, Sir Leon has asked the car makers to write to their dealers in each market to assure them that they will supply cars ordered with specifications for another market (for example a right hand-drive car with UK specifications ordered in Belgium) 'within a reasonable time period' and 'at the same basic price' as for normal supplies of the comparable local model. The industry is still to respond to these requests, but it has some way to go if it is to repair the credibility gap with Sir Leon and protect selective distribution.</p>

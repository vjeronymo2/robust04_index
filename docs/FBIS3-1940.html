The Central Party Committee has set great store by  strengthening the work of RENMIN RIBAO and created good  conditions to make a breakthrough in the work of RENMIN RIBAO  after the 14th Party Congress was held. General Secretary Jiang  Zemin and other members of the Standing Committee of the  Political Bureau gave a lot of important instructions to RENMIN  RIBAO on propaganda work and newspaper office construction and  set very high demands on the RENMIN RIBAO. At the forum, Shao  Huaze conveyed to participants important instructions and  guidelines given by key leading comrades of the Central Party  Committee not long ago after they had listened to the work  report of the RENMIN RIBAO as well as the work plan on  publishing local editions and further running RENMIN RIBAO well.  Shao Huaze said: In order to more specifically publicize the  party line, principles, and policies in a more timely fashion,  and to more effectively provide comprehensive information for  local economic construction and social development, the Central  Party Committee has consented to RENMIN RIBAO's proposal of  publishing local editions. On 1 January, the RENMIN RIBAO East  China edition will be first published in Shanghai, which is an  important step in reforming the official party newspaper. Shao  Huaze said: Preparations for publishing the RENMIN RIBAO East  China edition have just begun, time presses, the tasks are  arduous, there are a lot of difficulties, and we need strong  support and help from leaders and the broad masses of Shanghai  Municipality and of various provinces in East China. Shao Huaze  extended heartfelt thanks to party committees, governments, and  concerned departments of Shanghai Municipality and of various  provinces in East China for their enthusiastic support of RENMIN  RIBAO over the years.    Gong Xinhan, deputy head of the Propaganda Department of the  Central Party Committee, attended the forum and delivered a  speech. He said: RENMIN RIBAO has done a good job after the  14th Party Congress was held, and leading comrades of the  Central Party Committee fully affirm the work of RENMIN RIBAO.  The fact that RENMIN RIBAO is going to publish an East China  edition in Shanghai can more closely link up guidelines laid  down by the Central Party Committee with real conditions of East  China, thus helping the propaganda of RENMIN RIBAO draw closer  to reality, to the masses, and to life. This is a  ground-breaking measure which propaganda departments of Shanghai  Municipality and of various provinces should fully support.    Chen Zhili, deputy secretary of Shanghai Municipal Party  Committee, also made ebullient remarks at the forum.    Zhou Ruijin, deputy editor-in-chief of RENMIN RIBAO,  presided  over the forum, which was attended by over 100 people in  Shanghai Municipality, including leading party and government  comrades, leaders of concerned commissions, offices, bureaus,  prefectures, and counties, leaders of key news and propaganda  units, and leaders of some noted enterprises.    In addition, on the afternoon of 24 February, Wu Bangguo,  member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and  secretary of Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, and Huang Ju,  mayor off Shanghai, met Shao Huaze, director of RENMIN RIBAO,  and his party, and supported and welcomed the Central Party  Committee's approval of the publication of a RENMIN RIBAO East  China edition in Shanghai, saying that they would vigorously  give all kinds of support.    Chen Zhili, deputy secretary of Shanghai Municipal Party  Committee; Gong Xinhan, deputy head of the Propaganda Department  of the Central Party Committee; Jin Binghua, member of the  Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Standing Committee and head  of the Shanghai Municipal Propaganda Department; Ding Ximan,  editor in chief of JIEFANG RIBAO; and others were also present  at the meeting.</p>

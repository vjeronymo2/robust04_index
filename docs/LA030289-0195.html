			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DISCOVERY: TOURING IN TANDEM IN COUNTY'S OLDEST AREA  </P> <P> Gil Jones is the man to see in San Juan Capistrano when you don't want to go  very far and you're in no particular hurry to get there.  </P> <P> Jones deals in slow. He reasons that the best way to drink in the atmosphere of  Orange County's oldest neighborhood is to glide through it no faster than a  pair of gently urged 2,300-pound horses will walk when they're in a lazy mood.  </P> <P> That's just the sort of tour Jones provides each weekend and on several  weekdays through San Juan Capistrano's Los Rios Historical District: He fills  up a hay wagon full of people, hitches up Duke and Dan, his two Belgian draft  horses, and plods off at a pace just slightly faster than that of a glacier.  </P> <P> Jones operates his business, Carriage Services Ltd., out of a cluster of  typical board-and-batten structures on Los Rios Street, the centuries-old San  Juan neighborhood just across the tracks from the red-brick depot. There he and  his wife, Millie, maintain their small house, a ramshackle office, a small  collection of farm animals, a porcelain-painting business and a tiny pony farm.  </P> <P> But the centerpiece of the operation is the hay wagon pulled by Duke and Dan, a  matched pair that are easily the two most recognizable and possibly the most  beloved animals in the area. Usually twice a day on weekends and often on other  days of the week, Jones painstakingly tacks up the horses and hitches them to  the wagon for the 35-minute or 1-hour trip around the district.  </P> <P> His passengers are often children attending a birthday party but, he said,  adults often reserve the wagon for the first half of a barbecue outing. (Jones'  facilities include a fire pit and barbecue area with picnic tables.)  </P> <P> The Jones family moved to San Juan Capistrano 9 years ago, said Jones, "and our  idea was always to have horses." At first, said Jones' daughter, Jennifer  Baldridge, the family had saddle horses for hire, then began offering carriage  rides for bridal couples. Four years ago, she said, the business evolved into  hayride tours.  </P> <P> "I'd always wanted the big horses," said Jones, "ever since I lived on farms in  Oklahoma when I was young. When I saw these two, it was love at first sight."  </P> <P> Duke and Dan are 13 and 14 years old, respectively, and enjoyed a measure of  fame before taking up residence in San Juan Capistrano. Baldridge, who narrates  the tours from the back of the hay wagon, said the animals were used in  episodes of the TV series "Little House on the Prairie" and "Father Murphy," as  well as in the film "Beastmaster" and the miniseries "The Thorn Birds." They  also pulled the Main Street horse cars at Disneyland.  </P> <P> Today, they devour mountains of hay and at least two large bags of carrots each  day. But, Jones said, they do pay their freight, albeit very slowly. And the  ride is one of the best ways for any visitor, foot-weary or otherwise, to  become familiar with the neighborhood that was home to the original settlers  and builders of the nearby Mission San Juan Capistrano.  </P> <P> "It's not a real exciting pace," said Jones, giving Dan's rein a lazy flick,  "but the kids, particularly, really love it. It's real rewarding to see their  faces, because there are a lot of them who've never seen anything like this."  </P> <P> </P> <P> CARRIAGE SERVICES, LTD., AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> Where: 31791 Los Rios St., San Juan Capistrano.  </P> <P> Services: Birthday Special -- Children's birthday party for groups numbering 30  and under, available weekdays only at 11 a.m. or 4 p.m. Includes a 35-minute  hayride and 90-minute use of facilities, $100.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "(km)": "Baudys Has Admitted That the Army </F> Infringed the Screenings Law"]    [Text] Prague--Defense Minister Antonin Baudys yesterday  admitted that the Screenings Law was infringed in the Army in a  few cases. According to him, fewer than five people are  involved. Baudys made this admission just a week after it was  made public that there are positively screened generals or  colonels in some senior posts in the Army.    The minister refused to say, however, in what way and by  whom  exactly the law was infringed. It was only apparent from his  statement that the law was infringed in the case of soldiers  serving in posts held by colonels. "Certain inconsistencies  were found, which, however, have already been cleared up. These  were really individual cases and did not involve any army  general. Nevertheless, this was a certain infringement of the  law," he said, without specifying what has been done to remedy  the situation.    Only a week ago, however, the minister denied that  positively  screened officers were serving in the Army. The director of the  Defense Ministry's Personnel Department, Jaroslav Cuhra, also  said that the Screenings Law was not infringed in the Army.  Baudys had unequivocally discounted the possibility that anyone  with a positive screenings certificate could currently be  serving in a colonel's or general's post.    In connection with Generals Karel Pezl and Rostislav Kotil,  who, according to some of the media, had been assigned false  screenings certificates, the minister yesterday maintained that  the two men comply with the conditions for executing their  duties and that they have been accused wrongly.</p>

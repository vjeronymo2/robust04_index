			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / US Mid-Term Elections (November 8): From roguery and villainy to an ideological battleground - Two Maryland races, one on unfamiliar ground Maryland has two important state-wide elections this year. While the one featuring two nationally known names - for the US Senate - has been something of a damp squib, that for governor, between candidates whose recent careers have been spent in the relative obscurity of local government, has turned into an ideological fireworks display. The second race pits Mr Parris Glendening, 52-year-old chief executive of Prince George's County in the Washington suburbs, against Mrs Ellen Sauerbrey, 57, once a biology teacher and for most of the last 20 years a Republican state legislator. He is a conventional progressive Democrat, she is the new pin-up candidate of the Republican right. The contrast with the Senate race could hardly be more marked. In the Democratic corner stands Senator Paul Sarbanes, seeking a fourth term, and in the Republican Mr Bill Brock, once a senator from Tennessee and previously US trade representative and chairman of the national Republican party. Both are running as the souls of relative moderation, in Mr Brock's case to the point of half-renouncing a staunchly conservative political past. Maryland's political history may be littered with rogues and villains - two former governors, Mr Marvin Mandel, a Democrat, and Mr Spiro Agnew, the Republican who became vice president, both faced criminal charges - but it has never been known as a battleground for political ideology. Its first settlers from Britain in the 1630s were Roman Catholics sent by Lord Baltimore to escape Puritan repression and it was the first colony to establish in law the principle of religious tolerance. Today, the mayor of Baltimore, Mr Kurt Schmoke, is black, the outgoing Democratic governor, Mr Donald Schaefer, endorsed President George Bush in 1992, and the state has tough laws against guns and protecting the right to abortion. Its suburbs form part of the Washington metropolitan area and Annapolis, its picturesque capital and home of the US Naval Academy, perches on the Chesapeake Bay, but its heart and soul remains the revived industrial port city of Baltimore. Its economy is diverse and, some pockets of inner-city and rural poverty excepted, prosperous. Mrs Sauerbrey is in many respects an unlikely candidate for Maryland. She was not even expected to be on the ballot next week, but in the September Republican primary upset Congresswoman Helen Delich Bentley, no mean conservative herself, for the right to oppose Mr Glendening, who enjoyed a much easier passage. She did so primarily on the back of her proposal to cut state income taxes by 24 per cent over the next four years and to freeze spending on virtually everything. As the campaign unfolded she also promised to roll back environmental regulations and to divert tax revenues to private schools. With the apparently successful tax-cutting example of Governor Christie Whitman of New Jersey fresh in the national mind, she became the instant darling of the conservative movement. This being 1994, the year of the uncivil elections, Mrs Sauerbrey and Mr Glendening, who has Mrs Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, eldest daughter of Robert F Kennedy, as a running mate, were soon mincing no words, in commercials and in debates. She slammed him as as yet another 'tax and spend' Democrat, while he hammered her as outside the Maryland mainstream. The polling evidence is that Mrs Sauerbrey's assault is not working. A Washington Post poll two weeks ago gave Mr Glendening a 53-37 per cent lead, with 10 per cent undecided. Another Post survey published yesterday found him ahead by nearly nine-to-one among black voters, nearly 25 per cent of the electorate. This is far in excess of the usual Democratic margin and was attributed to his successful 12-year management of Prince George's County, the most racially diverse in the state. Mrs Sauerbrey held a 46-44 lead among whites but had not shown signs of breaking out of her base in the Baltimore suburbs and in conservative rural areas. On the Senate side, Mr Sarbanes held a 57-32 point edge over Mr Brock in a Baltimore Sun poll two weeks ago and is generally reckoned comfortably ahead. A Sarbanes campaign is normally low-keyed but in common with the times he has accused his opponent of being a carpetbagger, of a poor attendance record while in the Senate and of taking on Japanese companies as clients as soon as he finished his stint as trade representative in the Reagan administration. Mr Brock, who ran a legendarily dirty campaign in Tennessee to oust Senator Albert Gore, father of the vice president, in 1970, has seemed passive in response, excepting conventional attacks on the Sarbanes record as a big spender. His hopes of being the first senator to represent two different states this century hang by a thread.</p>

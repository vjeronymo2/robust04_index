			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Package proves wider than expected - Low income measures The package of measures to help low income households with the higher heating bills which will follow the extension of VAT to fuel and power was extended more widely than many critics had expected. In addition to providing extra payments for those on the lowest incomes who receive means-tested benefits, the package includes an unexpected boost to the basic state pension paid to almost all retired people. More than 15m people will be included - including some relatively affluent pensioners. The package was also sweetened with a new national savings investment for pensioners which will provide them with a guaranteed - if unspecified - monthly income over five years. Cold weather payments, paid to pensioners, families with young children and disabled people on income support during sharp spells of cold weather, will rise from Pounds 6 a week to Pounds 7 from next winter and to Pounds 7.50 the following winter. And an extra Pounds 35m a year is to be put into the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme which provide grants to insulate homes and instal energy-saving devices. The scheme, currently limited to those on income support, will be extended to all pensioners and disabled people. The cost of the package will be Pounds 416m in 1994-95, following the imposition of VAT on domestic fuel at 8 per cent on April 1 1994. When the rate rises to the full 17 1/2 per cent level on April 1 1995, the cost of the compensation measures will increase to Pounds 897m, and will reach almost Pounds 1.3bn in 1996-97. These figures are at the top end of estimates of what Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, would win from the chancellor. The aid package was welcomed by some charities for the elderly, but Age Concern warned the extra money would not be enough to compensate for higher fuel bills. Scottish charities and pressure groups have already claimed that VAT on fuel will particularly hit north of the border and that the poorest 10 per cent of the population will be hit seven times harder than the richest 10 per cent. At the heart of the package are increases in social security benefits in advance of the higher fuel bills. Normally, benefits would rise only after a year of higher bills, in the annual uprating in line with prices. All single pensioners will get an extra 50p a week from April 1994, in addition to the normal uprating. Married couples will get 70p a week. A year later, there will be the same increases again when VAT on fuel rises from 8 to 17 1/2 per cent. The same increases will be paid to widows and those on invalidity benefit. And people on means-tested income support who are not pensioners will also receive higher increases in April 1994 and 1995 to compensate for higher fuel prices.</p>

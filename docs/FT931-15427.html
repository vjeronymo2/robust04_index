			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Guinness announces Scotch shake-up GUINNESS, the brewing and spirits group, is to cut 700 jobs in its United Distillers' Scotch whisky production operations as part of a cost-cutting and modernisation programme. The group, which employs 5,000 people in Scotland, will close five distilleries - a move that will also help to restore the balance between the industry's output and estimated demand during the 1990s - and three bottling plants. Mr Tony Greener, Guinness chairman and chief executive, said: 'The investment in new technology requires significant reorganisation to achieve improved productivity, efficiency and profitability,' he said. Trade union officials described the decision as 'devastating'. Senior shop stewards, who claim job losses are likely to be more than 800, are to meet in Glasgow tomorrow. Mr Bob Thomson, Scottish secretary of the GMB union, said: 'We will be demanding a meeting with the Guinness board to reverse the decision.' Guinness will continue to operate two grain distilleries at Cameronbridge and Port Dundas, and 26 malt distilleries, including Blair Atholl, Cardhu, Dalwhinnie and Talisker. Efforts will be made to minimise the impact of the job cuts through voluntary redundancy and early retirement. Exceptional operating costs of Pounds 125m, covering the redundancies, closures and reorganisation, will be charged in the 1992 accounts. Guinness also announced that it plans to accelerate reorganisation at its Cruzcampo brewing operations in Spain to improve productivity. The programme is expected to include further job losses. Though the group has increased its market share, the Spanish beer market, previously one of the fastest-growing in Europe, fell 5 per cent last year and a doubling of the excise duty on beer is expected to depress consumption again this year.

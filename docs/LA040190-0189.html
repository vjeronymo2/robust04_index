			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A GROWING APPETITE FOR BISTROS IN THE CITY OF LIGHT  </P> <P> Bistro-mania continues to sweep France. Such noted chefs as Roger Verge on the  Cote d'Azur, Francis Garcia in Bordeaux and Michel Rostang and Guy Savoy here  in Paris have launched bistros, supplementing their well-known formal  restaurants. More recently, when Jacques Maximin opened his elaborate Maximin  restaurant in Nice, he installed the modest Bistro de Nice next door.  </P> <P> And in Paris, traditionally the bistro capital of France, new examples of the  genre have lately been inaugurated by Andre Genin, proprietor of Chez Pauline  (and, like Michel Rostang, one of the French-based chefs who cooks and consults  on a regular basis for Fennel in Santa Monica); by veteran Parisian  restaurateur Claude Terrail (uncle of Ma Maison creator and proprietor Patrick  Terrail), and by Jean-Pierre Vigato of Apicius, which is one of the hottest  serious restaurants in Paris today.  </P> <P> The virtues of the bistro -- its modest scale, its informality, its reasonable  prices, its comforting style of food -- are appealing to the public for obvious  reasons. For famous chefs and restaurateurs the appeal lies in quick turnover  of customers and lower expenses -- it's fast money. Bistros are also places for  chefs to hang out, something they can't do in their formal restaurants. And  then there's the nostalgia factor: Bistro food is, in theory, the food these  chefs grew up on.  </P> <P> But I hope Andre Genin didn't grow up on food resembling that served at his Le  Rond de Serviette ("The Napkin-Ring") -- and, frankly, I can't imagine him  wanting to hang out in the restaurant. The place is strangely  artificial-looking, with its walls of red cloth alternating with thin beige  paneling, its gaudy floral-patterned upholstery, its indifferent old-bistro  photo blowups.  </P> <P> It seems not so much a genuine bistro, in fact, as some American chain hotel  coffee shop in Paris that has decided to call itself a bistro. I had the  impression, the evening I was there, that everybody in the place seemed to be  looking around at their neighbors wondering if they were really in the right  restaurant.  </P> <P> On the basis of a dinner there, it was clear that they were not.  </P> <P> All three varieties of fish in the assortment of mousse-like rillettes de  l'ocean tasted alike, and were entirely too homogeneous for rillettes -- rather  like tuna salad put through a Cuisinart. A warm goat cheese salad was made with  indifferent cheese and tired greens. Hachis Parmentier, a kind of shredded  beef-and-potato casserole, was strangely flavorless, and the potatoes seemed  starchy.  </P> <P> Only a nice piece of grilled salmon with a suspicion of old-style sauce vierge  (sort of a creamy mayonnaise) was agreeable to eat -- and it was nothing  special. To anyone who has enjoyed Genin's cooking, as I have, either at Chez  Pauline in Paris or at Fennel in Santa Monica, the problems at Le Rond de  Serviette are mystifying. I can only assume that he just isn't paying attention  to the place -- and can only hope that he will soon start doing so.  </P> <P> Claude Terrail most obviously is paying attention to his bistro, Rotisserie du  Beaujolais. The place is plain, with terra-cotta floors, uncluttered walls and  a crowd of little white-dressed tables spilling out onto the slightly sloping  sidewalk. The menu is minuscule, offering no more than four or five appetizers  and a like number of main dishes daily. The kitchen is skilled, but it sticks  to the basics. The food is hearty and good. The style here is resolutely  Lyonnais -- the great French food and wine capital of Lyon being more or less  the Vatican of the bistro genre.  </P> <P> Terrail brings all of his cheeses and sausages in from top suppliers in that  city, in fact -- reportedly the same ones that provision Paul Bocuse. And  almost the only wines available are those of Georges DuBoeuf, whose bailiwick  is Lyon's neighbor, the Beaujolais region.  </P> <P> Though the menu changes daily, a typical selection might include tomato salad;  hure (pork headcheese); saucisson de Lyon (Lyonnais sausage, firm, medium-dry  and thinly sliced), or leeks vinaigrette to begin with, and then quail or veal  chops roasted on the eponymous rotisserie; grilled onglet (flank steak) with  shallots, or a traditional Lyonnais dish called sabodet rotie au Beaujolais --  a coarsely ground and highly flavorful pig's-head sausage, cut into thick  slices and oven-roasted in Beaujolais. Vegetarians and dainty eaters need not  apply.  </P> <P> The cheeses offered are always the same: a selection of first-class chevres  from both Lyon and Beaujolais, and a Lyonnais specialty colorfully dubbed  cervelle de canut or "silk weaver's brain" -- fresh white cheese mixed with  chives, salt and pepper and white wine. (The cheese was supposedly a favorite  snack of the silk weavers who were once so plentiful around Lyon.) There is  usually a superb apple tart -- a quintessential bistro dessert if ever there  was one.  </P> <P> Traditionalists might very well argue that Jean-Pierre Vigato's Manufacture --  so named because it is located in an old but beautifully renovated tobacco  manufacture (manufactory), just outside the Paris city limits in  Issy-les-Moulineaux -- isn't really a bistro at all. Indeed, it looks like a  contemporary full-scale restaurant in a sort of trans-Atlantic style, with  exposed structural-beam ceilings, white cinder-block walls, big paintings hung  here and there, Post-Modern furniture and high-design Andree Putman Royal  Limoges china.  </P> <P> The menu is hardly in the old-school bistro idiom, either. But there are some  bistro dishes offered (e.g. a Burgundian-style salad scattered with lardons or  chunks of bacon and topped with an egg poached in red wine, or a simple  presentation of eggs soft-scrambled with smoked haddock) and the menu is full  of offal and cheaper cuts of meat, potatoes, pulses (lentils, white beans,  etc.) and little salads -- all typical of bistro fare. Best of all, though, the  prices are genuinely bistro-low.  </P> <P> The imagination behind the dishes and the quality of the cooking aren't  bistro-ish at all. Categories aside, Manufacture is simply one of the best new  restaurants of any kind in Paris. As evidence of that claim, I offer a  gelatin-based terrine of baby rabbit or lapereau, delicate but full of flavor,  offset by a perfect little lentil salad; a whole small pate encased in a light  pastry shell -- meat loaf for grown-ups -- served with a Provencal-style salad  of mixed bitter greens; a filet of daurade grise, a remarkably delicious  variety of sea bream, covered with still-firm diced vegetables and soaking in a  light olive-flavored broth; a combination of filet and joue or jowl of beef,  grilled and cushioned with split-pea puree.  </P> <P> To clinch the case, I must mention Manufacture's selection of wickedly good but  yet somehow not quite excessive desserts -- among them a wisp of caramelized  pate feuillete with a slice of French-style gingerbread and a scoop of  gingerbread ice cream, a kind of collapsed chocolate souffle with very dark  chocolate ice cream on the side, a rich and chewy praline-chocolate tart, and a  specialty called simply riz croquante -- which suggests a cross between rice  pudding and creme brulee.  </P> <P> Desserts of this sophistication, of course, might well be taken as definitive  proof that Manufacture is not, in fact, a bistro after all. But when the food  is this good, and this reasonably priced, who, in fact, cares?  </P> <P>  Manufacture, 20 esplanade de la Manufacture (30 rue Ernest-Renan),  Issy-les-Moulineaux.

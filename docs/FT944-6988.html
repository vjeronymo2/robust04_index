			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Toronto frustrated by worldwide shudders - But fundamentals are strong The Toronto stock exchange should be booming. The mainstays of the Canadian economy - metals, forest products and the automotive industry - are storming ahead. Corporate profits are climbing steeply, with many companies also boosting dividends. Inflation is non-existent. The US Federal Reserve's latest interest-rate hike caused only a modest hiccup in credit markets north of the border. The brunt of the adjustment has fallen on the Canadian dollar, giving exporters another reason to cheer. However, the TSE has not been able to escape the shudders which have jolted equities markets around the world. The TSE-300 index lost 66 points in the first three days of this week. Although Thursday saw a 37-point rally, the index, which closed at 4,085, remained 11.4 per cent below last March's record 4,609. Professionals are puzzled. 'When things are acting contrary to good and valued assumptions, it's hard to find concrete reasons,' says Mr David Mather, senior vice-president at Elliott and Page, a portfolio-management house. 'The fundamentals for Canadian equities, especially the resource-based stocks, are as good as they've been in a long time.' The anomalies are glaring. Abitibi-Price earlier this month announced its fourth newsprint price rise of the year, and the company should also benefit from the recent slide in the Canadian dollar. But its share price has slithered from a 1994 peak of CDollars 20.62 in late September to just over CDollars 17. Similarly, shares of most Canadian gold producers are lower than they were when gold bullion was last trading around USDollars 385 an ounce. Canadian bonds are an unusually attractive investment now. Although domestic interest rates have not risen much in recent weeks, yields in real terms are among the highest anywhere. The yield on 30-year government of Canada bonds, adjusted for inflation, is at present over 9 per cent, compared with 5.25 per cent on comparable US Treasuries. Money managers pinpoint the US bond market as the main culprit for Toronto's equity woes. Many are nervous that the 75-basis point rise in the Fed funds rate on November 15 will not be the last. Climbing interest rates already threaten to brake the recovery in both the US and Canada, reverse the boom in metals markets and choke corporate earnings. Canadian economists have lowered their growth forecasts. Most expect that real growth will slow to about 3.5 per cent in 1995 from 4 per cent this year. In addition, with Canada's biggest companies listed in both Toronto and New York, the turmoil on Wall Street has sideswiped the TSE. For instance, Northern Telecom has lost 8 per cent of its value so far this month, closing last Thursday at CDollars 44.88. Most analysts remain confident that the recent slide in share prices is a relatively brief correction. Nesbitt Burns, a Toronto-based securities dealer, forecasts that the TSE-300 will bounce to a new record of 4,700 within the next 12 months. 'As bond yields tread water and earnings jump, confidence should rise in both the length of the profit expansion and the height of the cyclical peak,' says Mr Ben Joyce, Nesbitt's portfolio strategist. A downward push of interest rates to keep the recovery on track would reinforce the bullish case. Mr Frank Hracs, chief economist at RBC Dominion Securities, told an investment conference this week that 'with the onset of the New Year, we will not be surprised to see an aggressive investor response to interest rates that have not made fundamental sense for some time now'. Mr Mather favours metal and gold producers, and forest products companies, especially those geared to pulp and newsprint. On the other hand, he has shied away from sectors sensitive to volatile interest rates, such as utilities. Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion, a Montreal-based firm, says in its latest market commentary that the outlook is brightest for the oil and gas sector. 'We believe that the market has not fully discounted a return of oil prices above USDollars 20 a barrel in 1995 as a result of new secular demand from the emerging countries of southern Asia and Latin America,' the firm says. But while some analysts may see the correction as a buying opportunity, a note of caution comes from Mr Murray Taylor, vice-president for marketing at Great-West Life, one of Canada's biggest insurance companies which also manages 13 investment funds. Mr Taylor, an actuary, warns that investors - especially those without instant access to breaking news - take a big risk by attempting to time buy-and-sell decisions according to up-and-down bumps in the market. Average investors have only a one-in-four chance of getting their timing right on a simultaneous sale and purchase. The odds on being successful twice in a row drop to about 6 per cent, according to Mr Taylor. On the other hand, he calculates that anyone who has bought shares on the Toronto stock exchange at any time since 1924 and has hung on to them for 30 years, would have done substantially better than investing in fixed-income securities. On that basis, plunging into the market now should offer far better rewards than buying just before the big crashes of 1929 and 1987.</p>

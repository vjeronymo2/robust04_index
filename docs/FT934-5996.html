			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / International Company News: Israeli bank offering postponed until January Israel yesterday said it would delay a public offering of 10 per cent of the shares in Bank Leumi, the country's second largest bank, after the flop earlier this week of a 10 per cent offering in Bank Hapoalim. The finance ministry said the offering, which was scheduled for next Monday, would be postponed until January but that the government was determined to press ahead with the sale of leading banks. The move followed the failure of this week's sale of a 10 per cent tranche of Bank Hapoalim, which was massively undersubscribed after investors criticised the government for abolishing the maximum price on share issues, leaving out underwriters and not attaching options or warrants. The government also said that only 53 per cent of the Hapoalim shares had been sold, not 69 per cent as originally reported. The correction was made after it was revealed that a Shk900,000 (Dollars 306,000) order for shares by General Bank had mistakenly been written down at Shk90m. The issue raised Shk314m, not Shk403m as originally announced. The government's decision to postpone the offer was also taken after Bank Leumi shares, which were sold earlier this year, fell on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange to one point lower than the minimum price of the government's offer. Mr Aharon Foegel, director-general of the finance ministry, said the government was determined to learn the lessons and press ahead with its bank privatisations. He said the market had shown that it wanted shares to be sold in a different manner with prior sale to institutional investors and attaching options or warrants.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Commemorative report" by Choe Yong-hae, chairman of the </F> League of Socialist Working Youth of Korea Central Committee, at  a meeting marking the 34th anniversary of the 19 April uprising  of the South Korean people held at Pyongyang's Central Workers  Hall on 19 April -- recorded]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The United States is not  fulfilling the DPRK-U.S. joint statement which was agreed with  us. Moreover, it overturned the steps of simultaneous action  [tongsi haengdong chochi] which was agreed upon at the DPRK-U.S.  contact in New York, aborted the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks  by giving unreasonable excuses, and is scheming to isolate and  stifle [apsal] our Republic under the name of the United Nations  by laying our nuclear issue before the UN Security Council and  instigating some insidious officials of the International Atomic  Energy Agency.    On top of that, while babbling that it will not rule out a  preemptive military attack against North Korea, the U.S.  bellicose class is bringing in nuclear war equipment, including  Patriot missiles, to South Korea. Also, it is concentrating  nuclear aircraft carriers and many military vessels around our  country's neighboring waters.    This clearly shows that the United States does not have the  will to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula  through peaceful means, and that it is trying to resolve it  through force.    The hostile policy toward Korea by the U.S. imperialists is  being all the more promoted by the South Korean nation-selling  traitors and is bringing about a more grave situation.

			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Polls in Boston showed that Rep. Barney Frank's constituents still strongly  support him, despite revelations about the congressman's relationship with a  male prostitute. A poll conducted for the Boston Globe and WBZ-TV showed that  65.3% did not think Frank should resign, while 22.3% said he should. At the  same time, a survey by the Boston Herald and WCVB-TV showed that 56% said Frank  deserves to be reelected, while 29% called for his ouster. The state Republican  Party has also called for the Massachusetts Democrat's resignation, charging  that Frank, 49, showed a "profound lack of judgment." However, political  observers predicted that the fifth-term congressman, who publicly acknowledged  his homosexuality in 1987, would survive the scandal.  </P></p>

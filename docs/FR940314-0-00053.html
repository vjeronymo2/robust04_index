			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter recommended that the Postal Service reduce or eliminate the 50-piece minimum for qualifying 3-digit mail as a way to reduce the residual volume. This mailer proposed that the Postal Service eliminate the 3-digit qualifying minimum for automated mail if it is prepared in trays on SCF pallets and reduce the minimum to 10 pieces for mail that is 100 percent delivery point barcoded. The result, according to this mailer, would be a significant reduction in the amount of residual mail requiring processing at the origin plant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Relaxation of the 50-piece minimum for qualifying 3-digit mail under package-based preparation is not being considered at the present time. Under tray-based preparation options, second- and third-class mail in SCF trays is not required to meet a 50-piece minimum for a 3-digit area. However, this rule gives mailers an option to prepare the residual portion of package-based mailings by 3-digit area with no minimum package size.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Limit Residual Preparation to Full AADC Trays  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggested that the Postal Service test the feasibility of limiting the preparation of residual mail to full AADC trays. Residual mail that remained after full AADC trays were prepared would not require sortation. The commenter contended that this limited approach might solve the processing problems caused by residual mail volumes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Limiting residual preparation to full AADC trays would not adequately address the problem of excessive volumes of working residual mail at origin. Most AADC areas contain five or fewer 3-digit ZIP Code areas, making it very unlikely that full trays of residual mail could be prepared for these AADCs given that 3-digit packages must be prepared at 50 pieces. In order to relieve the problems associated with processing residual mail at origin, a more substantial presortation of the residual portion of a mailing than that suggested by this commenter is necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Allocate Barcode Sorters to Residual Mail Processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggested that each of the 10 processing and distribution areas set up a centralized facility for processing residual mail. Under this scenario, origin processing plants would divert the residual portion of automation rate mailings to this centralized site for processing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Equipment deployment decisions are based on originating and destinating volumes for all classes of mail within a processing and distribution plant's service area. Allocating equipment based on originating residual volumes of second- and third-class letters would result in sub-optimal utilization of automated equipment. The Postal Service believes that presortation of residual volumes, as described in this rule, is a reasonable and effective way to deal with the processing problems caused by piece processing of residual mail.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following is a summary of the changes, by preparation option in DMM Module M.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> ZIP+4 Presort and Barcoded Tray-Based Mailings (DMM M812 and M814)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule will require presortation of the residual portion of second- and third-class mailings by AADC area.

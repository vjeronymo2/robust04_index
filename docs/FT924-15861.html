			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Bombay Securities Scandal: Bhupen Dalal, antithesis of the average Bhupen Chapaklal Dalal is one of Bombay's best-known brokers, with a background in stark contrast to Harshad Mehta's. A formidable player in the government securities market, Dalal is the antithesis of the average Bombay stocker, and would look more comfortable in Wall Street. Bhupen Dalal's Champaklal Investment and Finance Corporation has handled some of the country's largest and most prestigious equity offerings, and the man sees himself as something of a philanthropist and business tycoon. Deeply religious, the suave broker would spend many hours in jail doing his prayers and rituals, and resents the fact that he is not allowed to leave Bombay while on bail to visit a temple town in South India. Dalal insists he had no dealings with Standard Chartered, and was only brought in when they discovered the mess, to help sort it out. The Reserve Bank suspended the securities trading permit of his firm after Standard Chartered accused Dalal of fraud in its criminal complaint. According to the investigators, a large number of transactions have been put through in the account of one of Dalal's firms, Bhupen Champaklal Devidas, though Dalal pleads not guilty.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article including interview with Lars </F> Chemnitz, deputy leader for politics of the Atassut Party: "The  Solidarity Party Is Not Finished With the EU"]    [Text] The party thinks that Lars Emil Johansen, the head  of the provincial government, has gotten the EU [European Union]  stuck in his throat.    Nuuk -- Why should Greenland's negotiations with the EU  follow a single track just because Lars Emil Johansen, the head  of the provincial government, has gotten the EU stuck in his  throat?    This question is asked by the top leadership of Atassut  [Solidarity Party] that has just come together for its first  meeting after the turbulent convention in which many of the  party's top leadership were moved out. Solidarity's Landsting  group also participated at the meeting.    Greenland is faced with the coming renewal of the fishing  agreement they had, with what was first the EC and now is the  EU, that has been in effect ever since Greenland resigned its  membership in the EC in 1985.    The fishing agreement expires 31 January 1995, but  negotiations as to an extension of the fishing agreement for the  next six-year period are under way.    Today the fishing agreement means an annual income for  Greenland of 270 million kroner.  <H5>  Several Possibilities </H5>   The Solidarity Party's top leadership is dissatisfied with  the fact that the provincial government one-sidedly is  concentrating on a continuation of the fishing agreement, which  in return for the 270 million kroner will grant EU fishermen set  fishing quotas in Greenland's waters.    "The Solidarity Party thinks that the provincial government  in parallel negotiations should investigate other alternative  affiliations to the European Union, the EU," says Lars Chemnitz,  the party's political deputy leader, to GRONLANDSPOSTEN. The  Landsting and the people have the right to be informed on  whether the tremendous increase in the amount of money in the  EU's guaranteed funds, among other things, will upset old  considerations of the advantages and disadvantages of remaining  outside the EU.    [GRONLANDSPOSTEN] Are we then to have a renewed debate as to  Greenland's membership in the EU?    [Chemnitz] Not at the present time, but we want a thorough  investigation and evaluation of the current conditions of  [membership in] the EU. We have resigned from the EU, but that  is not unchangeable. Development both in the EU and in Greenland  since we resigned in 1985 has been very strong, and we will  always consider the new situation. Countries like Norway,  Sweden, Finland and Austria are knocking on the EU's door, and  an expanded market might have far-reaching consequences for  Greenland's fishing agreements, duty-free status, and trade  agreements with the EU.  <H5>  New Situation </H5>   [Chemnitz] A further consideration is Greenland's location,  which has become more significant in recent years. After the end  of the Cold War, Greenland was no longer located midway between  the two superpowers, the Soviet Union and the United States, but  on the outskirts of the world.    At present nationalists are rattling their sabers in Russia,  and again there is tension between East and West. Therefore  Greenland, because of its strategic location, is once again of  consequence as a partner for the Western world, and we will take  advantage of the possibilities of this new world order.    Moreover, the EU and the new free trade agreement between  Canada, the United States, and Mexico will play a more important  role in the future. Greenland is at risk of being squeezed  between these two powerful trade blocs if we continue to remain  outside the EU.  <H5>  EU Funds </H5>   [GRONLANDSPOSTEN] What is your personal opinion?    [Chemnitz] The Solidarity Party maintains that full  membership in the EU will be the most advantageous thing for  Greenland. To begin with we would like to have a dialogue with  the EU, not only about fishing, but also about many other  subjects.    [GRONLANDSPOSTEN] Why is it so important for the Solidarity  Party to get Greenland to join the EU?    [Chemnitz] Because we think it will offer many advantages to  become a member. We built the two large airports in Nuuk and  Ilulissat with support from EU funds, but we were alone in  building the hydroelectric power stations in Buksefjorden. Now  we are faced with the demand of new capital investments in the  form of many airstrips on the West Coast. Why not apply for  regional support from the EU for this large construction project  as a readmitted member instead of taking on large foreign loans  that would burden our economy.    [GRONLANDSPOSTEN] Is not the Solidarity Party afraid of  interference in internal Greenland affairs?    [Chemnitz] Today we have a fully developed trawler fleet  that  can compete on an equal footing with those of other nations.  That was not the case 10 years ago, and that is why we saw many  EC trawlers in Greenland's territorial waters the first few  years of home rule. Moreover, today we are much more dependent  on free access to markets for our fish products because we no  longer export mineral natural resources.    [GRONLANDSPOSTEN] And you do not think that there will be a  problem in entering [the EU] again.    [Chemnitz] That is not up to us, but we are a member of a  commonwealth with the EU country Denmark, and this commonwealth  might give us an admission ticket.  <H5>  Poor Election </H5>   [Chemnitz] The Solidarity Party brought Greenland's  relationship with the EC into the election campaign before the  Landsting election in 1991. The Solidarity Party did very poorly  in the election, partly because Akulliit Partiiat [Center Party]  did very well in the election and partly because of people's  resistance to a renewed membership in the EC, now called the EU.    The Solidarity Party will not make a proposal regarding  renewed membership in the EU either for this or the coming  Landsting meeting, but we cannot avoid including this question  in the coming election campaign before the Landsting election  next year.    [GRONLANDSPOSTEN] Are you not afraid of another poor  election  showing?    [Chemnitz] No, because we learned much from the election of  1991. We came on too strongly with our EC proposal and people  were frightened. The other parties misunderstood our proposal on  purpose and drew a frightening picture of the EC in Greenland.  That will not happen this time.</p>

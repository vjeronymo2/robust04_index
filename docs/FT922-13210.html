			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / Observer: Out-numbered Besides provoking continued axe-grinding about 16th-17th century English poets who understood algebra, Observer's numeracy-style quiz decided a week ago seems to have punctured a mathematical legend. The particular point in question is what is unique about the number 1,729. Legend - enshrined in no less than the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations  - has it that the Indian mathematician Ramanujan instantly identified 1,729 as 'the smallest number expressible as a sum of two cubes in two different ways' (13 + 123 on the one hand, and 103 + 93 on the other). In that case, Ramanujan was wrong, says Jonathan Mapley of Royal London Insurance. The far smaller number 91 can be formed as the sum of two cubes in two different ways, although in one instance the cube is negative: 33 + 43 = 91, and 63 + - 53 = 91. Fortunately for poor old 1,729, two other readers who entered the quiz have come up with something else about it that looks to be truly unique. It is the biggest number with prime factors (including 1) which each differ from the next by the lowest positive perfect number, 6 (1 x 7 x 13 x 19).</p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Peres would meet Jerusalem Arabs MR SHIMON Peres, the Israeli foreign minister, said yesterday that he would not object to talking to Palestinians from east Jerusalem, agencies report from Jerusalem. The Clinton administration in the US has proposed that Israel accept Mr Faisal Husseini, a prominent east Jerusalem Arab, as head of the Palestinian negotiating team in order to coax Palestinians back to negotiations, set to resume in Washington on April 20. Mr Peres stressed on Israeli army radio that excluding Arab negotiators from Jerusalem was a policy of the previous, right-wing Likud government in Israel, which had argued that to talk with such people would mean conceding Israel's claim to rule the city. Mr Peres added that he has 'never ruled out Faisal Husseini.' He said: 'On the ground, Faisal Husseini heads the Palestinian team. The Americans are speaking with him. We are not deaf or blind.' Mr Husseini, who has close ties to the Palestine Liberation Organisation, has been denied a formal role in the talks because Israel has objected to sitting down with Arabs from Jerusalem.</p>

			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Minister unveils M6 widening plan THE government expects to spend Pounds 570m widening 57 miles of the M6 motorway between Birmingham and Manchester. Mr Robert Key, roads minister, yesterday announced the government's detailed plans for easing congestion on one of the UK's busiest motorways. He immediately ran into charges from Friends of the Earth, the environmental group, that the widening would create more traffic problems. Speaking in Knutsford, Cheshire, Mr Key said that the government would publish next year the draft statutory orders for the road. But he was vague about when work would start, other than saying 'the mid-1990s' and 'within a few years'. He added: 'My ambition is that it should be open by the time of the Manchester Olympics.' The city is bidding to hold the Olympic Games in the year 2000. So far the government has made no budgetary provision for the motorway work. The plan is to widen the motorway from three lanes to four lanes in each direction. At present the M6 carries 90,000 vehicles a day (including 25,000 heavy trucks) through Staffordshire and Cheshire. The Department of Transport expects the widened motorway to carry 120,000 vehicles a day by the year 2015. The plan is complementary to proposals for privately run toll motorways around the Birmingham-Black Country conurbation. The southernmost point of the widened M6 would be at the junction with the orbital roads. Construction work on the M6 would be on land next to the existing carriageway, allowing traffic to move during the work. This technique, called parallel widening, has been used to enlarge the M5 near Worcester. Friends of the Earth, a consistent opponent of the government's road-building programme, warned the Department of Transport that the worst congestion problems were in the cities. 'Unless we deal with these, expanding the motorway network will encourage further traffic growth in congested bottlenecks like Birmingham and Manchester,' it said.</p>

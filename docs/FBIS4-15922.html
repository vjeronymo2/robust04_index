			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin ordered including  support of Sevastopol into the Russian national budget, the city  council Chairman Viktor Semyonov said at a news conference on 12  April.    On a visit in Moscow on 5-10 April Semyonov handed Yeltsin  an  estimate of the city's needs in supporting the infrastructure  and social sphere of the Black Sea Fleet.    According to the Sevastopol Statistical Agency, nearly  33,500  Black Sea Fleet officers and warrant officers resided in the  city. The fleet supported 75,000 employees and their families.  In effect, every fourth Sevastopol resident was directly  dependent on the Black Sea Fleet.    Semyonov believed that it was Russia's duty to contribute to  the city's infrastructure and social sphere.    According to Sevastopol economists, Russia must allot the  city 1,072,912 Mn [million] karbovantsi, or about 52 Bn  [billion] rubles.    Semyonov said that talks with Yuriy Dubinin, Russia's chief  negotiator on the Black Sea Fleet, convinced him that Russia  stood by the protocol of the Massandra summit.    Semyonov believed that a Ukrainian-Russian commission on  evaluating the assets of the Black Sea Fleet should be composed  of civilian defense industry engineers because personal  rivalries between military officers of the two countries made  this task impossible.    Semyonov said that the Moscow City government would allocate  Sevastopol 500 Mn rubles to finance the festivities marking the  50th anniversary of liberating the city from the Nazis.</p>

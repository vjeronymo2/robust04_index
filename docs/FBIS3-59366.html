			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by GUOJI SHANGBAO reporter Zhang Haiyang: "EDI </F> Customs Clearance System Makes Paper-Free Trading Possible" --  Interview of Yang Guoxun, Director of General Administration of  Customs Information Center]    [Text] Recently, our reporter called on Yang Guoxun,  Director of Information Center of General Administration of  Customs on the use of EDI in the customs system.  <H3>  Necessity To Popularize Use of EDI Customs Clearance System  in China </H3>   Right now, China's practice in reforming its economic  structure and gradually forming the pattern to open up to the  world in all directions has doubled the amount of supervisory  work of China's Customs. The increasing number of preferential  policies for various regions and lines of business has made the  work of the customs even more complicated and further delayed  the procedure of customs clearance. According to statistics  compiled, the total value of China's imports and exports  increased by 398 percent; the total volume of imported and  exported cargo rose by 281 percent; the amount of customs duties  collected increased by 441 percent; the amount of tax collected  or levied on behalf of other departments rose by 2,747 percent;  and the number of applications to pass goods through the customs  increased by 398 percent during the ten years between 1982 and  1992.    In order to keep pace with these changes, we must make  things easy for the exporters and importers to legally pass  goods through the customs, while strengthening our control. This  will not work by relying on the manpower alone. We must depend  on other means of advanced science and technology to quicken the  pace for customs clearance. The customs offices in various  localities have adopted some measures such as the system of red  and green passages for cargo clearance, the use of different  measures for screening, checking and releasing goods for imports  and exports under different conditions and the utilization of  subsequent centralized customs declaration. The EDI customs  clearance system is able to effectively provide the technical  support in the implementation of these measures and make things  convenient for the declarant.  <H5>  Specific Contents of EDI Customs Clearance System </H5>   China's EDI customs clearance system is aimed at utilizing  EDI technology to automatically exchange and process forms and  documents for customs clearance, and make full use of the  customs computer system to timely and automatically complete the  entire customs clearance procedure between the customs and the  declarant.    According to Director Yang Guoxun, the establishment of this  system involves the design of software for the EDI customs  clearance procedure, the purchase and installation of mainframe  computers and a network, the setup of the organization in charge  of the EDI customs clearance system, the improvement of the EDI  customs clearance system and its relevant rules and regulations  and the standardization of relevant forms and documents. The EDI  customs clearance system consists of clearance of goods,  supervision and control, taxation and release of goods. With the  customs as the center, this EDI customs clearance system deals  with declarant, banks, warehouses and transportation units; and  automatically processes and examines declaration forms, levies  taxes and releases goods.    The development of the EDI customs clearance system is  mainly aimed at achieving automation and standardization, and at  completing the entire customs clearance procedure with speed and  in strict accordance with regulations. In many cases, there is  no need for the declarant to send people to the customs office  to apply for customs clearance in person. The customs office  only needs to stress the essential points in checking  declaration forms, levying taxes and checking and releasing  goods. It may further simplify the customs clearance procedure  and let the EDI customs clearance system automatically handle  the arduous administrative work.  <H3>  Prospects and Plans for Development of EDI Customs Clearance  System </H3>   Since the 1980's, some developed Western nations have  adopted the EDI form in doing trading. They have also adopted  the EDI system in their customs offices. For example, the U.S.  Customs adopted the EDI form for customs clearance in 1992. The  British Customs has established a complete administrative  information system. In 1992, 90 percent of the 13.5 million  customs declaration forms in Britain were processed by the EDI  system. At the end of 1992, 96 percent of the customs  declaration forms in Australia were processed by the automatic  customs clearance system, of which 90 percent of the forms were  processed and goods released automatically by EDI technology.    The methods, measures and experiences of the customs offices  of these countries have provided China's Customs with important  data to develop its EDI customs clearance system.    In the development of the EDI customs clearance system,  China's Customs has designated 1993-1994 as an experimental  stage, during which the relevant customs clearance system will  be mainly revised, the use of EDI in filing applications to pass  goods through the customs be permitted and preparations for the  establishment and improvement of this system be made. It has  designated 1997-1998 as a stage of popularization, during which  it will promote the use of the EDI system.    China's Customs will closely cooperate with all functional  departments and help coordinate their actions to recommend the  use of the EDI customs clearance system and let "paper-free  trading" become a reality in our country.</p>

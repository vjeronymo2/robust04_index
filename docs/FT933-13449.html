			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Microsoft may face court order THE US Federal Trade Commission is scheduled to convene on Wednesday to consider the results of a near three-year anti-trust investigation of Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company. Investigators from the FTC's bureau of competition are believed to have recommended that the commission seek a federal court injunction against Microsoft. They allege that the company has improperly used its monopoly position in the market for PC operating system software to disadvantage competitors. Throughout the investigation, Microsoft has denied any wrongdoing, insisting that it is 'co-operating fully with the FTC investigation'. In February, the commission's attempts to make a recommendation reached deadlock, with two commissioners voting in favour of taking action against Microsoft, and two voting against. A fifth commissioner, claiming a conflict of interest, excused himself from the case. At this week's meeting, the commission will be presented with a much simplified and narrowed case against Microsoft, according to Ms Wendy Goldman Rohm, author of a soon-to-be published book called The FTC versus Microsoft: The inside story. The revised case focuses on allegations of 'technological tying' of Microsoft's widely used Windows program to its MS-Dos PC operating system, according to Ms Goldman Rohm. Microsoft has been accused by competitors of attempting to raise false concerns among customers that its Windows program does not work properly with operating system programs sold by competitors. There are also complaints that it has linked product warranties to the use of its MS-Dos operating system. If the commission reaches deadlock again on the Microsoft case, the US Justice Department, which also has jurisdiction over anti-trust enforcement, may take up the matter, Ms Goldman Rohm says. 'There is considerable political pressure being brought on the commissioners not to just drop the case.' Yet even if the revised case against Microsoft is pursued by the FTC, the outcome could be 'commercially insignificant', Ms Goldman Rohm predicts. She says the FTC is unlikely to seek 'structural remedies', such as breaking up Microsoft into two separate companies. Instead, the Commission may simply issue a 'cease and desist' order against the company.</p>

The pollutants emitted at each of the facilities in the gasoline distribution network are essentially the same. These emissions consist of a mixture of organic compounds (essentially all of which qualify as VOC under the Agency's definition). Section 112(b) of the Act contains a list of HAP's for which the Agency has been directed to set national emission standards. A comparison of profiles of normal gasoline vapors to the HAP list reveals several compounds common to both. Benzene, toluene, hexane, ethylbenzene, naphthalene, cumene, all three chemical orientations of xylene (para, meta, and ortho), n-hexane, and 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (iso-octane) appear on both lists.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 211 of the Act contains provisions that will affect gasoline composition in the 1998 base year and, therefore, the HAP emissions from gasoline distribution sources. This section of the Act requires that fuels purchased and sold in nonattainment areas contain higher levels of oxygenates (reformulated and oxygenated fuel programs). While the focus of these fuels programs is the reduction of both tailpipe (combustion) and evaporative emissions of CO and air toxics (benzene, 1,3-butadiene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and POM) emissions from gasoline vehicles, the intent of today's proposed rule is to reduce major stationary source evaporative HAP emissions from gasoline distribution facilities. Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) is projected to be a major source of oxygen that will be added to gasoline to meet the oxygenate content requirements for the reformulated gasoline and oxygenated fuels programs. MTBE is also listed in Section 112(b) as a HAP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

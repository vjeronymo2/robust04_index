			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Roman Shpek, minister of economy, by </F> Volodymyr Krasnodemskyy; place and date not given: "Our Bridge  to Europe -- How Soon Will We Be Able To Use It?"]    [Text]    [Krasnodemskyy] Well, Verkhovinskyy, Rakhivskyy, Putylskyy  and other rayons will soon receive the status of mountainous  rayons. How will this improve the socioeconomic situation in  the mountains?    [Shpek] In my opinion, the Carpathian rayons should receive  the status of mountainous rayons. But the situation will not  improve without an effective state policy directed at the  development of this particular region.    What do we have there currently? To my regret, nothing  serious. We should openly admit that due to the irrational  economic policy and wrong activities, the economy of the region  is generally socially unattractive, ecologically harmful, and  economically ineffective. Economic contacts are disrupted;  unemployment is climbing upward; the gap between the living  standards of people who are living in valleys and mountains is  increasing; the demographic situation is approaching a critical  point; the unique nature of the region is in danger; the  historic and cultural monuments have been neglected. Some of  these negative tendencies are being intensified at the time of  transition to market relations, when new economic mechanisms  are being set up. A state program is only a way to halt these  tendencies, to provide progressive economic changes, social  development of the territory, and ecological protection.    [Krasnodemskyy] As far as I remember, in late May of last  year, the Cabinet of Ministers adopted a decree to draft such a  program. What has been done?    [Shpek] We are just at the beginning but some quite useful  work has been done. A group of researchers headed by Professor  M. Dolishnyy from the Institute of Economy within the Ukrainian  Academy of Sciences in Lvov studied proposals of local  administrations, ministries, departments, research institutes,  and high establishments, and drafted a concept for socioeconomic  development of the Carpathians. The key principles of this  concept were discussed at the international conference "The  Carpathians Are a Ukrainian Bridge to Europe: Problems and  Prospects" in September of last year, and in general they were  praised by its participants.    The state program for socioeconomic development of the  Carpathians is being drafted on the basis of this concept.    [Krasnodemskyy] Participants in an international conference  called the "Carpathians a Ukrainian bridge to Europe."  Obviously, this was not accidental.    [Shpek] Really, this is an apt and a broad symbol. However,  in the context of the Ukrainian foreign policy, the geopolitical  location of the Carpathians always eased the entrance of Ukraine  to various European economic, public, and political structures.  By the way, we currently observe this in international  developments, for example, in the process of setting up an  association "Karpatskyy Euroregion" for international  cooperation which officially began working in February 1993,  after signing a Joint Declaration of Foreign Ministers of  Poland, Hungary, and Ukraine, as well as constitutive documents  of this association.    [Krasnodemskyy] The negative cases and tendencies which are  ever more pressing in the Carpathians are, no doubt, the  heritage of the previous economic policy. However, many  mistakes were made in the post-communist period, particularly,  in the way the economic and structural reforms were implemented.  In the opinion of scientists and politicians, lack of a rigid  regional policy in Ukraine led to the current state of the  Carpathian economy.    [Shpek] The program of the regional socioeconomic  development  should unite the state and regional interests on these  territories, and should provide for sensible compromises between  them. Admittedly, regional interests demand that job  opportunities and the employment for the local population be  raised. At the same time, the state cannot do away with sulfur,  timber, coal, and other mineral raw materials that the mountains  are rich in. Can a compromise be found? Of course. But the  two parties should gain profits. Therefore, a compromise  between local and state interests should be based on fair and  equal relations between the state and the region. The state  regional policy should guarantee a competent regional policy in  provinces. Only then a policy could be a success, if the rules  of the game are not violated.    A strategic goal of the prospective territorial development  is based on the optimal use of all local resources to set up an  efficient market economy that will grant material welfare to the  population, and ecological security to the region.    [Krasnodemskyy] What directions in the regional  socioeconomic  policy, in your opinion, are of primary importance?    [Shpek] First of all, it is necessary to implement a  socially  oriented structural reconstruction of the economy by shifting  the impact to the mountainous territory. Almost three quarters  of the labor force there work in the production sphere which  certifies the socially unfavorable character of the local  economy.    In the Carpathians, we have some 800 springs of medicinal  mineral waters of virtually all balneology types, among them  such rare waters like Truskavetska and Skidnitska "Naftusya,"  Morshyn brines, Transcarpathian carbonates, and others. We have  considerable reserves of mud and ozokerite; around 34,000  hectares are occupied by health resorts where people improve  their health. Eventually, in every season, the Carpathians  could be a paradise for tourists. Thus, the entire region should  become a big recreation and tourist center for our state with a  corresponding infrastructure. In addition, it should become a  basis for training Ukrainian sportsmen in various winter sports.  By the way, only 10 percent of the present recreational  potential of the region is being used.    It is necessary to set up a highly developed market  infrastructure and transform this region into a specific  training ground for attracting foreign investments in the  Ukrainian economy, for the development of mutually beneficial  cooperation with European states. By the way, potential foreign  investors will first of all be interested in setting up joint  medical and tourist businesses. The cost of land plots for  building and natural resources -- to be used during the process  of exploitation of these sites -- could become the Ukrainian  share, aside from its direct financing.    The next important issue is that market reforms will start  working efficiently only when a region becomes more independent  in introducing the state economic levers in its economy.    [Krasnodemskyy] Already two years ago, one third of all the  unemployed registered in Ukraine lived in the Carpathians. The  situation in the mountainous regions is very tense. How can the  state assist us this time?    [Shpek] It is necessary to change the investment policy:  Capital investments should be planned beforehand. To be more  exact, the network of small businesses that are flexible and  able to invest in recreation sites in the time of transition to  the market should be set up in agricultural regions and townlets    Municipal services are an Achilles's heel of the region. In  this area, we are lagging behind the industrially developed  countries. For example, setting up a network of private shops,  bars, hairdresser's, small hotels, and car repair shops will  ensure jobs for thousands of the mountaineers. I mean the  setting up of a network of traditional handicraft industries  such as embroidery, weaving, carving, etc. It is necessary to  develop and upgrade various forms of employment (the state,  stock holding, cooperative, or custom production); and various  organizational forms (part time jobs, work at home, etc.).    [Krasnodemskyy] The Carpathians have always attracted  tourists by Gutsul handicraft industries and fresh air. People,  including schoolchildren and students, came to Kosov, Vorokhta,  Yaremcha, Kryvorivnya to breathe fresh air. They are still  coming today. However, my colleague-journalist returned from  Yasinya and said regretfully: Mountain skiing bases are almost  empty.    [Shpek] It could be explained by climbing prices for rest  there. In addition, the ecological situation in the Carpathian  region leaves much to be desired. By all means, it is not as  dangerous as in the Transdniester region or Donbass, but we have  problems. According to the degree of the air pollution, our  region ranks fourth in the state, but our soil is likely to be  the most contaminated with pesticides and mineral fertilizers.    Felling trees is harmful to our nature in general and  recreation zones in particular. Mountains become bald and this  leads to an increase in landslides, and floods in the  mountainous rivers.... All this triggers changes in the  microclimate. As a result, the health-giving properties of our  recreation zone decrease.    [Krasnodemskyy] Therefore, it is necessary to urgently  formulate an ecological policy on a principally new basis.    [Shpek] You are right, but we should be realistic. Our  activities should be based on the objective estimation of our  real chances. For example, the cardinal resolution of  ecological problems could be achieved only on the basis of new  technological and structural changes in the economy. This  demands enormous assets and much time. We have neither the  first, nor the second.    Nonetheless, we should pay attention to some other factors.  Only the resolution of specific problems could regulate the  mechanisms and methods ensuring an efficient nature protecting  policy. If done otherwise, the processes can go out of control,  and we cannot allow this to happen.    [Krasnodemskyy] What should be done in the nearest future to  protect the natural resources of the Carpathians?    [Shpek] We will shift from a policy of eliminating results  of  pollution to the preventive activities, and we will fight with  reasons and not with consequences. We should check out the  ecological safety of production sites, means of communication,  etc. to minimize the chances of ecological accidents. We should  eliminate conflicts between businesses and ecology and ensure  their close cooperation. We should always remember that  economic reforms should improve the ecological situation, not  worsen it.    [Krasnodemskyy] The region which we are speaking about has  the densest network of historic and cultural monuments in  Ukraine. It is just enough to recollect that around 7,000  places of interest -- that is 14 percent of all Ukrainian  historic and cultural heritage -- are protected by the state.  Here, in the Carpathians, the rich spiritual culture --  original customs and rites, local household chores, wooden  churches and houses of Gutsuls, Boysks, Lemsks -- has been  preserved. Is it not for these very reasons that Gnat  Khodkevich, the founder of the Gutsul theater and the author of  one of the most wonderful plays about the Gutsuls reminisced:  "I opened my mouth in admiration when I came to the Gutsul  region and continued living there with my mouth open for the  next six years."    [Shpek] People who come to the Carpathians are fascinated by  its nature, colorful landscapes, and its spirit of freedom.  Mountainous vicinities of Krinorivni where Ukrainian cultural  leaders used to walk, the art of Kosov craftsmen, Kosmach poems  and embroidery, where, according to epics, legendary Dovbush  died -- all this should be properly kept, alive in our memory  and soul, and be actively used for the development of our state.    Until now, the Carpathians have been compared with our  neighbors -- Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia -- as having an  insufficient amount of museums. Therefore, at first, we should  open a museum of specific trades which are characteristic to our  region; a museum of local lore, history and economy; an  ethnographic, art, and memorial museum. Castles, palaces,  ancient buildings of an exquisite European style which are being  irrationally used now, could house these museums.    It is necessary to set up well-equipped restoration shops in  oblast centers and their branches in other regional towns and  rayons to restore historic and cultural heritage -- ancient  palaces, cultural buildings, and old quarters of our cities.  If, for example, this is done in Kosov and Kolomyya, it will  increase the opportunities for restoration work several times  over.</p>

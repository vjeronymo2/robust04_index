			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Why it pays to motor around - There are ways of keeping down your car insurance bill MOTOR insurance premiums have been rising steadily over the past two to three years, as motor insurers adjust to large increases in accident and theft claims. Equally, competition in the industry has increased to such an extent that, more than ever, it is worth shopping around. It is no longer necessarily the case that there is a standard rate for all cars and drivers. Insurers work out their premium rates with reference to a rising number of factors - ranging from the age and type of motor to the age and record of the driver. By the end of this month most companies will have introduced a new system of rate banding set out by the Association of British Insurers last year. Instead of nine insurance bands, cars are being grouped into 20 bands. The old system, which dates from the 1960s, does not take into account the range of models now available on the market. The effect will be to penalise the 'hot-hatches' - small cars with powerful engines - that are perceived as high risk because of their speed and the high probability that they will be stolen. For example, the new band for the Volkswagen GTi is 14 instead of 6, for the Peugeot 205 1.6 GTi, it is 12 instead of 5, while the Ford Fiesta XR2i, which was in band 5, is now in band 14. 'As a rough rule of thumb, cars that have doubled their rating band should be in the same position,' said Eileen Kimber of the ABI who estimates that nearly a third of motorists will be worse off as a result of the new system, a third better off and the rest should see no change. 'In the long run, the new ratings are sensible because we now have so many cars with differences in their performance on the market,' said Noel Privett of the Automobile Association. The beneficiaries will be family saloon cars such as the Vauxhall Cavalier 1.6L. Its new rating is a modest 6 instead of 4. Cars such as the Ford Orion 1.6i which shared the same insurance band as the Ford Fiesta XR2i will move into band 9 instead of 14 for the Fiesta. Competition among insurers is increasing, as more insurers choose the direct route to the customer, using mass media advertising to attract potential custom and then evaluating risks and selling policies over the telephone. The smaller brokers, the insurance industry's equivalent of the corner shop, are losing out and are being forced to respond to the threat by deploying their own packages and technology. Companies such as Directline, direct insurance arm of the Royal Bank of Scotland and Churchill, direct motor insurer set up by Switzerland's Winterthur, have cornered around 15 per cent of the market. Some of the composites, such as Eagle Star and General Accident have also got in on the act by setting up direct sales services. 'Most of the big companies have had very bad losses and are having to increase premiums,' said Martin Long, chief executive of Churchill. 'The costs of setting up were high but we are now trading profitably. By cutting out the middleman we have lower costs and can attract business more cheaply.' While direct sales insurers are cheaper for many drivers, they are not a good deal for some. Their strategy is to write policies for low risk drivers only. 'We don't quote for young drivers in performance cars and we are not attractive in most inner city areas,' said Chris McKee, director of Directline, the first direct sales company, set up in 1985. This strategy has ensured profits at a time when the big composites are facing losses on the motor insurance side because of a rise in claims, partly as a result of an increase in motor theft. The ABI said last week that motor insurance underwriting losses amounted to Pounds 1.2bn last year. Andy Miller, development manager at Norwich Union, predicts that the cost advantage of the direct insurers will diminish when the process of networking, by which intermediaries are linked directly to the composite insurers through the electronic marketplace becomes widespread in 1994. Other profitable sections of the motor insurance market are some of the Lloyds syndicates which can offer rates equally competitive with the direct insurers. Barry Hulbert, of Hill House Hammond, the retail insurance broker owned by Norwich Union, says that by using the range of the market, brokers can quote premiums that are 10 to 15 per cent cheaper than that of the direct writers. The table shows clearly the substantial differences in motor insurance quotations. Rates can be up to 65 per cheaper than those shown since we have excluded no claims bonus discounts. Motorists who install safety devices are also likely to obtain lower quotes. Premiums are expected to increase by an average of 25 per cent in the next year but if you do not fall into the high risk category, comparing quotes should ensure that your motor insurance bill does not rise by this amount.</p>

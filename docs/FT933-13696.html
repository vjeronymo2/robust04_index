			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Losses at Apple hit technology sector Wall Street US SHARE price movements were governed by the release of corporate quarterly results yesterday, and a sell-off in the technology sector triggered by disappointing figures from Apple Computer had a particularly savage effect on the Nasdaq market, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 22.64 at 3,528.29, pulling away from its record levels. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off 3.47 at 445.75, while the Amex composite lost 1.51 at 436.47, and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 8.96 at 699.73. Trading volume on the NYSE was more than 264m shares and declines outnumbered rises by 1,000 to 896. Meanwhile a report of weak consumer confidence lifted treasury prices. In late trading, the treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was up  7/32 at 107 19/32 , yielding 6.538 per cent, while the one-year note was unchanged to yield 3.956 per cent. The University of Michigan's early reading on its July consumer sentiment index reportedly showed a decline to 76.9 from 81.5 in June. Liz Claiborne was one of the biggest losers of morning trading. The stock plummeted Dollars 6 5/8 to a 52-week low of Dollars 23 after the women's apparel maker posted second quarter earnings of 38 cents a share, down from 47 cents a year ago, and forecast a 30 per cent slump in full year earnings for 1993. Shares in The Limited, a chain of women's apparel stores, edged Dollars  1/4 lower to Dollars 21 1/8 , and The Gap, another specialty retailer, fell Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 28 7/8 . Heavy third quarter losses at Apple Computer took a toll on the entire technology sector. IBM lost Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 45 5/8 . Texas Instruments fell Dollars 4 to Dollars 71 7/8 in spite of unexpectedly strong second quarter earnings and Storage Technology dropped Dollars 4 3/4 to Dollars 28 1/2 , adding to its Dollars 7 7/8 loss on Thursday on the back of disappointing results. Shares in Apple plunged Dollars 8 1/4 to Dollars 27 1/2 in heavy Nasdaq trading. News that the company had lost Dollars 188.3m in the quarter, after a pre-tax charge of Dollars 320.9m, was released after the close of trading on Thursday. Among other Nasdaq technology stocks PictureTel dropped Dollars 6 1/8 to Dollars 19 1/2 after the manufacturer of visual communications systems reported second quarter net income of 17 cents a share. Canada TORONTO stock prices ended solidly lower in relatively quiet trading. According to preliminary figures, the TSE-300 index was down 29.48 points, or 0.75 per cent, to 3,901.79, for a loss on the week of about 26 points. Losing issues were ahead of winners by 280 to 434, volume slowed to 44.694m shares from Thursday's 65.046m and trading value was CDollars 510.2m against CDollars 732m.

			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP BEAT: O.C. BLUES DUO FINDS SUCCESS AFTER FINDING ITS OWN STYLE;  </P> <P> WILL BRADY AND JODI SIEGEL GAIN ACCLAIM AFTER GIVING UP AN UNCOMFORTABLE,  HYBRID MUSICAL PERSONA AND DOING WHAT COMES NATURALLY?  </P> <P> For a while during their 10-year musical partnership, Will Brady and Jodi  Siegel tried to be songsmiths, crafting would-be hits that they imagined being  recorded by big-name pop stars.  </P> <P> There also was a time when they would play Beatles songs, figuring that was  what the people in the Orange County pubs and restaurants they played wanted to  hear.  </P> <P> Eventually, though, Brady and Siegel decided that they had to please themselves  before they could be a hit with anybody else. The way to do that was by playing  the blues.  </P> <P> "We were trying so many styles. We were doing whatever it took to keep the  gig," Siegel said as she and Brady sat in a Laguna Beach restaurant Tuesday  night, recounting how Brady &amp; Siegel turned from an uncomfortable hybrid  into an assured electric-blues duo. "People could see it wasn't true to who we  were. They know when it's not authentic, or when you're not liking it."  </P> <P> "You become non-recognizable, lose your identity," Brady chimed in without  missing a conversational beat. Brady and Siegel have been working together long  enough for their speech patterns to become as well-synchronized as their  interwoven guitar lines.  </P> <P> Brady, now 45, and Siegel, 34, found the answer to their musical identity  crisis while noodling around between sets during those unsatisfying pop-hybrid  days. Every time they had a few minutes to kill, they would unthinkingly start  playing the blues.  </P> <P> If that's what came naturally, the two guitarists decided, that's what they  would be best off doing all the time. It was a smart decision: In the six or  seven years since it was defined by the blues, Brady &amp; Siegel has evolved  into an uncommonly fiery act that can reach back to the country blues tradition  of Robert Johnson or leap forward into modern modes that echo such blues-based  rockers as Little Feat, Bob Seger and Chuck Berry.  </P> <P> Playing the blues didn't turn out to be a bad career move either. Instead of  having to worry about keeping steady gigs, Brady and Siegel have settled into a  regular routine on the local bar scene. Every Thursday night, they play at the  Old Dana Point Cafe -- a gig they've held for 2 1/2 years -- and every Tuesday  night for the past three months, they've been appearing at the Marine Room  Tavern in Laguna Beach. In 1989, Brady and Siegel jumped into a Hyundai and  took their blues around the country on a five-week tour, an experience that  Brady said "gave us a feeling that it is possible to make all this happen" --  namely, stepping out of the small rooms of Orange County and onto a national  stage.  </P> <P> Opening for Albert King recently at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano,  Brady, a tall, affable man with a furrowed, balding pate, and Siegel, with a  tight tangle of flaming-red hair framing sharp facial features, proved that  they can win a crowd of deep-blues aficionados. When they were introduced,  silence greeted the two guitarists' names. It was Freebo, their sideman for the  night, who drew a ripple of applause in recognition of his past tenure as  Bonnie Raitt's bass player.  </P> <P> Before long, though, the audience was hollering approval for Brady's clean,  stinging Telecaster solos, delivered with back-arching body English, and for  Siegel's unfettered raucousness on slide guitar. Between liberal solo  trade-offs, both members showed a convincing, intense way with a blues vocal.  </P> <P> "You can't play little, polite blues," Brady said of the duo's aggressive  method. "You have to go in there slugging. It keeps you honest."  </P> <P> "You can't fake the blues," Siegel echoed. "Either you can play it or you  can't. It has to be part of your makeup. I get up on that bandstand, it's my  fun zone. I'm on vacation."  </P> <P> Siegel grew up in Chicago, the world's blues capital, where Duane Allman's  signature solos for the Allman Brothers Band inspired her to take up slide  guitar. But most of her public performances as a teen-ager centered on folk and  pop.  </P> <P> She moved to Orange County at 19 to attend Orange Coast College. Gravitating to  the local club scene, she ran into Brady. The guitarist had been in on the  ground floor of the Orange County music scene, running the lights at the Golden  Bear in Huntington Beach during the folk boom days of 1964-65, when Roger  McGuinn and David Crosby would drop in to play. In the mid-1970s, Brady played  bass for three years with Honk, the only Orange County rock band of that era to  make a national name for itself. (He still takes part in Honk's periodic  reunion shows.)  </P> <P> The two played together occasionally, then struck up a close musical  partnership when Siegel and her blues-aficionado husband, Sid Shultz, took a  top-floor apartment in a Laguna Canyon house where Brady was the downstairs  neighbor.  </P> <P> After years of performing together, the duo's first bid for wider recognition  was its 1989 debut album, "Beer &amp; Donuts," which was produced by Freebo and  financed largely by Patrick Farrah, a wealthy benefactor who would show up at  Brady &amp; Siegel gigs offering $100 for every Jimmy Reed song they would  play.  </P> <P> The album, available at Brady &amp; Siegel shows, includes only one original  song. Entitled "She Takes What She Wants," it's a saucy number that allows  Siegel, a temperate, low-keyed woman offstage, to step into the hot and rowdy  onstage mode she often favors.  </P> <P> "The next (album) will have a lot more original songs," Siegel said. "If you  want to make it in the blues world, you've got to have some originality, your  own sound that distinguishes you from everyone else."  </P> <P> As a redhead who plays a mean, traditional-sounding blues slide guitar, Siegel  knows that it will take some effort for her to establish a distinct identity.  </P> <P> "People come up to me and say, 'Bonnie Raitt, right?' " she said. "I say, 'No,  I'm not Bonnie Raitt.' I guess it's inevitable. I'm honored to be compared to a  four-time Grammy winner, but I don't want people to think I'm trying to be her,  because I'm not. Any female blues player who grew up in the '70s (had to be)  influenced by her. But I was just as much influenced by Freddie King and Duane  Allman and Etta James."  </P> <P> While waiting to take their next career step, Brady, who still lives in Laguna  Beach, supports himself primarily as a guitar teacher; Siegel, now a Dana Point  resident, works days in a record store.  </P> <P> The point, Siegel said, is to play for the enjoyment of it and let any future  career ascent flow from that. "We'd be doing this anyway," she said. "We'd be  doing it for our own personal therapy."  </P> <P> "Any musician has a dream about being recognized by your peers and making  enough money so you can relax a bit and not worry about where your next dime is  coming from -- which is the way it's been all my life," Brady said. "But I'd be  doing it if I were on a desert island."  </P> <P> Siegel's deadpan response: "That's our next gig. I got a call from Gilligan."  </P> <P> Brady &amp; Siegel's next gig is tonight at 9 at the Old Dana Point Cafe, 24701  Street of the Golden Lantern, Dana Point. Admission is free. Information: (714)  661-6003. The duo, augmented by a three-man band, also plays every Tuesday  night at 8 at the Marine Room Tavern, 214 Ocean Ave., Laguna Beach. Admission:  $2. Information: (714) 494-3027.  </P> <P> OFF-TANGENT: A show next Wednesday by Agent Orange, the Swamp Zombies and  Medicine Rattle will be the finale for Club Tangent, the weekly  alternative-rock showcase at the Marquee in Westminster.  </P> <P> However, Kitty Bash and Octavious, the two young promoters who have been  putting on Club Tangent shows since last summer, appear to have found a new  outlet: Starting next month, pending final agreement on a deal they have  negotiated with owner Ray Camacho, they will book Thursday and Friday night  shows at the Pink Cadillac in Anaheim under the moniker Tangent Productions.  </P> <P> Club Tangent's four-month run at the Marquee is ending because it wasn't  generating enough money, according to L. Trojan Tabak III, co-owner of the  452-person-capacity club.  </P> <P> Bash said the Marquee's identity as a haven for hard rock and heavy metal made  it difficult to draw fans from the alternative-rock scene. Lacking a budget for  advertising, she said, Club Tangent was not able to reach a potential clientele  that normally wouldn't think of going to a heavy-metal club. Tangent drew an  average of 80 to 100 concert-goers at the Marquee, Bash said, although in  recent weeks, shows by Tender Fury and Caterwaul had boosted attendance to 180  or 200.  </P> <P> "We usually broke even, with sometimes a little extra (profit)," Bash said.  </P> <P> From a club-owner's perspective, Tabak said, the Tangent crowd had a serious  drawback: an inadequate thirst for bar drinks.  </P> <P> "We served more water than anything else," he said, noting that the  alternative-rock fans spent an average of $4 each on drinks, only half of the  per-customer bar revenue on other weeknights. Tabak said he is considering  offers from other promoters who have proposed booking blues acts, hard-rock  bands or deejay dance nights on Wednesdays.  </P> <P> Bash said Camacho invited the Club Tangent team to help him promote shows at  the Pink Cadillac even before they learned that they were losing their slot at  the Marquee. The Pink Cadillac already has established an alternative-rock  identity with shows by some of the same bands that Club Tangent featured.  </P> <P> "I'm kind of sad, because I think the Marquee was a really neat venue, but  we're going to be picking up where we left off," Bash said. She said that she  and Octavious expect to sign a contract to book Thursday nights in August at  the Pink Cadillac, then expand to Thursdays and Fridays at the end of the  month, beginning with an Aug. 31 concert by Firehose.  </P> <P> COLOR IT ORANGE: Club Tangent's last concert will mark a homecoming for Agent  Orange, which hasn't played its native county since a 1987 show at Night Moves.  Now based in Los Angeles, the band features a splendid new lineup, with  founding singer Mike Palm backed by Brent Liles and Derek O'Brien, the  bass-and-drums team from Social Distortion's early days.  </P> <P> According to manager Moss Jacobs, Agent Orange has negotiated a long-sought  release from its recording contract with Enigma Records. "We're going to  examine a lot of possibilities and look at taking the band to the next step,"  said Jacobs, who is general manager of Avalon Attractions. As part of its  severance agreement with Enigma, Agent Orange will record a live album of songs  previously released on the band's studio albums and EPs. The recording takes  place Saturday night at the Roxy in Hollywood, where Agent Orange will play two  shows with the tape rolling.  </P> <P> T.S.O.L. GETS L.O.S.T.: Also cut free from Enigma -- but not nearly so happy  about it -- is T.S.O.L. The long-running local hard-rock band was among the  acts whose contracts were dropped in a major shake-up last week at the Culver  City label.  </P> <P> "It was quite a shock to all of us," said T.S.O.L.'s manager, Mike Zoto. The  band's current album, "Strange Love," was to have been the first in a  multi-album deal reached last year. "After you let it sink in and release your  emotions, it could be OK," Zoto said. "You can't sit and dwell on it. You've  got to go out and make something happen. But it's something very new and has to  be pondered for a while." Currently on a national tour, T.S.O.L. is scheduled  to play Aug. 11 at Jezebel's in Anaheim.  </P> <P> The Enigma shake-up has producer Jon St. James feeling nervous about the  possible impact on Bardeux, another Orange County act on the label's roster.  "It doesn't affect our (recording) deal, but it affects everyone at Enigma" in  terms of the label's ability to promote current releases, St. James said. "I  understand (Enigma) cut the staff considerably," he said. With a new Bardeux  single, "Shangri-La," surfacing with dance-club play, he said, "I hope the  company is there to back it up."  </P></p>

The authority citation would continue to read as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  2 U.S.C. 431(8), 431(9), 432(c)(2), 437d(a)(8), 438(a)(8), 441a, 441b, 441d, 441e, 441f, 441g, and 441h. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Part 110 would be amended by revising section 110.11 to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;110.11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Communications; advertising. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Definition <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section only, ``direct mailing'' includes any number of substantially similar pieces of mail but does not include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) a mailing of fifty pieces or less by any person; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) mailings by a corporation or labor organization to the corporation's or labor organization's restricted class under 11 CFR 114.3 or 114.5. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)(1) (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General Rule <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Except as otherwise provided in this section, whenever any person makes an expenditure for the purpose of financing a communication that expressly advocates the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate or that solicits any contribution, through any broadcast station, phone bank, newspaper, magazine, outdoor advertising facility, poster, yard sign, direct mailing or other form of general public political advertising, that communication or solicitation shall clearly state who paid for it. If authorized by a candidate, an authorized committee of a candidate or an agent thereof, but paid for by some other person, the communication or solicitation shall clearly state that it is authorized by such candidate, authorized committee, or agent. If not authorized by a candidate, authorized committee of a candidate or its agent, the communication or solicitation shall clearly state that it is not authorized by any candidate, candidate's committee, or agent. For purposes of this paragraph, it is presumed that a communication or solicitation by a political committee that refers to a clearly identified federal candidate contains express advocacy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Exceptions <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section do not apply to: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) bumper stickers, pins, buttons, pens and similar small items upon which the disclaimer cannot be conveniently printed; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) skywriting, watertowers or other means of displaying an advertisement of such a nature that the inclusion of a disclaimer would be impracticable; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) checks, receipts and similar items of minimal value which do not contain a political message and which are used for purely administrative purposes; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) communications by a corporation or labor organization to the corporation's or labor organization's restricted class under 11 CFR 114.3 and 114.5. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) For a communication or solicitation paid for by a party committee pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 441a(d), the disclaimer required by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section shall identify the committee that makes the expenditure as the person who paid for the communication, regardless of whether the committee was acting in its own capacity or as the designated agent of another committee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) A solicitation other than one covered by paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(D) of this section by an unauthorized political committee that does not refer to a clearly identified federal candidate need only state who paid for it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) For purposes of paragraphs (b)(1)(i) of this section, the term ``expenditure'' includes a communication by a candidate or party committee that qualifies as an exempt activity under 11 CFR 100.8(b) (10), (16), (17), or (18). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Placement of Disclaimer <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The disclaimers specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section shall be presented in a clear and conspicuous manner, to give the reader, observer or listener adequate notice of the identity of the person or committee that paid for, and, where required, that authorized the communication. A disclaimer is not clear and conspicuous if it is in small type in comparison to the rest of the printed material, or if the printing is difficult to read or if the placement is easily overlooked. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The disclaimer need not appear on the front or cover page of the communication as long as it appears within the communication, except on communications, such as billboards, that contain only a front face. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Each communication that is included in a package of materials but that is also intended for separate public distribution shall include a disclaimer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Newspaper or magazine space <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . No person who sells space in a newspaper or magazine to a candidate, an authorized committee of a candidate, or an agent of the candidate, for use in connection with the candidate's campaign for nomination or for election, shall charge an amount for space which exceeds the comparable rate for the space for non-campaign purposes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) For purposes of this section, ``comparable rate'' means the rate charged to a national or general rate advertiser, and shall include discount privileges usually and normally available to a national or general rate advertiser. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: September 30, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Trevor Potter, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Chairman. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;24622 Filed 10&hyph;4&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6715&hyph;01&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

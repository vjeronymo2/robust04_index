			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar drops on housing starts THE DOLLAR sank to a new three-month low against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges yesterday on news of a bigger than expected monthly drop of 17 per cent in US housing starts for April, writes James Blitz. The US unit was trading at a low of DM1.5865 shortly after lunchtime in European markets, as dealers feared that the sharpest monthly fall in housing starts for eight years would force the Federal Reserve to ease interest rates again. When the rate cut failed to materialise at yesterday's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the dollar regained some ground and closed in London  1/2 pfennig down at DM1.5905. Dealers said the dollar had been propped up by heavy bidding just below DM1.59 by two large German institutions and life insurance companies in Tokyo. In New York it ended at DM1.5903/10. However, analysts believe the case for a cut is much stronger following the housing figures, and could come today, when the FOMC meets again. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist of Yamaichi International in London, said: 'The balance of probabilities is for the Fed easing.' He does not believe that the dollar weakness will last but thinks the currency could yet bottom out at DM1.56. The dollar also lost ground yesterday morning to the yen on news that Japanese machine orders for March were up 14.6 per cent from the previous month. The figure brought a strong reaction from the markets, coming one day after news that the Japanese trade surplus in April was 13.4 per cent higher than for the previous month. However, the Fed's decision not to cut rates gave the US currency a temporary respite and it ended a little firmer at Y129.10, and later closed in New York at Y129.12. The D-Mark continued to perform strongly in the wake of Monday's news that a large industrial strike had been avoided. Its best gain was against the French franc as traders took profits following last week's bullish performance by the French currency. The D-Mark finished at FFr3.3634, up about  1/2 franc. Sterling's recent rise against the D-Mark also seems to have petered out as traders give up hope that the pound might cross its central rate against the German currency. The pound closed  1/4 pfennig down at DM2.9250. One London dealer suggested that the pound's decline against the D-Mark may have been due to profit-taking in sterling/dollar trading, after the UK currency reached a high point of Dollars 1.8425 in London yesterday. The Swiss franc made new gains following Switzerland's decision to formally apply for EC membership. The Swiss currency ended about  1/2 centime stronger against the dollar at SFr1.4600.</p>

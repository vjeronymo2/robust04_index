The bank is now looking for appropriate fields to which  export credits could be applied for the country, President  Mitsuhide Yamaguchi told a press conference.    He added quickly, however, that the step is conditional on  smooth implementation of economic adjustment policies in the  country.    Yamaguchi said Russia's economic reforms need to advance to  a  level where it is entitled to receive stand-by credits under an  economic stabilization scheme by the International Monetary Fund  (IMF).    In October 1991, Japan pledged to provide to Russia 200  million dollars in export credits by the Export-Import Bank of  Japan as part of a 2 billion dollar program to promote trade and  economic activity in the country.    Yamaguchi voiced hope that Russia will be fully eligible for  the IMF's special facility set up for Russia and other nations  struggling to shift to a market economy.    Stand-by credits can be extended only under the new  facility,  called the Systemic Transformation Facility (STF).    Russia has already received 1.5 billion dollars in the first  portion of the STF that the IMF pledged last June.    Talks are now under way over disbursement of the remaining  portion of the credit, which does not demand strict criteria as  imposed under ordinary loans, such as inflation control and  budget deficit cuts.</p>

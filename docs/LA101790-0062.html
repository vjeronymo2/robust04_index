			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CAMARILLO;  </P> <P> SENIORS BAND TOGETHER IN NEW MUSICAL GROUP  </P> <P> It is a dance band with more saxophones than any other instrument, a band that  accepts beginners but is mostly retired professional musicians, a group that  includes a banjo player strumming along on all the big band favorites.  </P> <P> The Camarillo Senior Band, newly formed and ready for its debut concert Sunday  at the Camarillo Fiesta, accepts anybody who wants to play.  </P> <P> "We don't care what instruments show up. We've never told anybody they can't  play with us," said bandleader John Herman at a recent rehearsal. The only  stipulation is that the musician be at least 55 years old.  </P> <P> The group was formed in August under the auspices of the Camarillo Senior  Center and allows members to keep their musical skills fresh, said pianist Will  Zens, as he searched for the music to "Stardust" on his piano.  </P> <P> Indeed, the band's rendition of "Moonlight Serenade" provided a trip back in  time as the melody echoed in the empty halls of a former officers' club at  Camarillo Airport, where the group rehearses every Monday.

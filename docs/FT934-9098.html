			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Japanese paper magnate held in corruption probe MR RYOEI SAITO, the magnate who led the Japanese charge into world art markets and jokingly said that he wanted to be buried with his Van Gogh and his Renoir, was keeping less salubrious company last night after his arrest as part of a crackdown on political corruption. The arrest of Mr Saito, 77, honorary chairman of Daishowa Paper, the country's second largest paper manufacturer, follows allegations that he authorised a Y100m (Pounds 630,000) payment to a provincial governor who approved the development of a Daishowa-linked golf course and housing complex. During 1990, Mr Saito boosted art prices by paying Dollars 160.6m for a Renoir cafe scene and Van Gogh's Portrait of Dr Gachet. He then bought a version of Rodin's The Thinker statue for Y1.5bn. His family has links far beyond the paper industry. His brother Shigeyoshi, former governor of Shizuoka, south of Tokyo, is married to a Toyoda, of Toyota Motor fame, while a son, Toshitsugu, is an MP for the opposition Liberal Democratic party. But Ryoei Saito is lord of the clan, and his detention, along with that of Daishowa's vice chairman, Mr Taira Kiyosawa, raises doubt about the future of the company and has stirred fears over who will be the next to fall in the public prosecutors' drive against corruption. Until now, executives at five large construction companies have been arrested, along with a few local politicians. Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the former LDP powerbroker at the centre of the governing coalition, is under pressure to give evidence in parliament about a Y5m donation from a contractor. The allegations against Mr Saito involve Y100m paid to Mr Shuntaro Honma, the former governor of Miyagi, north of Tokyo, who in 1991 said exceptions should be made to planning regulations blocking the construction of the Natori Greenport golf course and housing complex. Mr Saito has come back from the brink in the past, having been forced to relinquish control of his company in 1982 to Sumitomo Bank, after accumulating an unsustainable Y500bn in debt. Four years later, he Mr Saito, bitter that the restructuring included the sale of cherished paintings, severed links with Sumitomo and returned to the helm. He has insisted that the recent art acquisitions will not be sold, even though Daishowa is again being restructured and expects to lose Y21.8bn this year. The company's health has been undermined by Mr Saito's ambitious expansion of paper production capacity and by the wayward diversification into golf course development.</p>

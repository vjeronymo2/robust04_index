			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / International Company News: Harley-Davidson shares leap SHARES in Harley-Davidson, the only US motorcycle manufacturer, soared yesterday after the company turned in a 22 per cent increase in fourth-quarter sales. Although Harley's fourth-quarter operating profits slid 2 per cent to Dollars 13m from Dollars 13.2m in 1990, lower interest and other expenses helped the company's underlying pre-tax earnings soar 289 per cent to Dollars 10.7m from Dollars 3.7m. Net income in the 1991 fourth quarter was Dollars 7.3m, or 41 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 237.7m, against earnings of Dollars 3.9m, or 22 cents, on sales of Dollars 194.3m a year earlier. Motorcycle and related product sales surged 29 per cent in the 1991 quarter. On Wall Street, Harley's stock added Dollars 5 1/4 to close at Dollars 53 1/2 . Harley, the sole survivor of the 143 US companies which once made motorcycles, has overcome Japanese competition to regain the top spot in the big motorcycle market. It now commands about 61 per cent of the 850cc class. Harley shipped 68,626 motorcycles in 1991, up 10 per cent from 1990, with most of the growth coming in the fourth quarter when they climbed 31 per cent to 18,839. For the whole of 1991, operating profits fell 18 per cent to Dollars 68.6m from Dollars 83.4m, while earnings before tax and extraordinary items slowed to Dollars 58.1m from Dollars 62.6m. Net income for the year was Dollars 37m, or Dollars 2.08, against Dollars 37.8m, or Dollars 2.12. Sales grew 9 per cent to Dollars 939.9m from Dollars 864.6m. Mr Ronald Glantz, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, was disappointed by Harley's flat underlying fourth-quarter earnings on strong sales, but he remained bullish about Harley's prospects. 'What other consumer durable company is making money and apologising to dealers for not being able to meet demand?' he said. In the 1991 quarter, Holiday Rambler sales rose 19 per cent to Dollars 51m. The improvement, however, was led by lower margin vehicles and the business suffered a greater operating loss of Dollars 6.9m, against Dollars 1.9m in the 1990 quarter.</p>

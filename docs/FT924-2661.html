			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Arts: Today's Television Television, we are told, is an ephemeral thing. My predecessor on the FT even called his book of collected television criticism 'The Ephemeral Art'. Yet at 7.30 tonight you can see the latest episode of Coronation Street, the series which gets the biggest single audience in Britain, currently more than 19m, and which started 32 years ago this week. How un-ephemeral can you get? At 7.40 comes another edition of What The Papers Say, running since 1956. Later you will find the British movie Children Of The Damned enjoying its umpteenth screening. An SF frightener adapted from John Wyndham's book, it was made 28 years ago (12.10 C4). It is followed by an episode from The Twilight Zone which was made in the US between 1959 and 1964. Also this evening you can watch such long established television personalities as David Frost in the embarrassing 'game' Through The Keyhole, John Cleese presenting Prisoners Of Conscience, Esther Rantzen with the syrupy Hearts Of Gold, and Terry Wogan with his Friday Night. If this lot are ephemeral, heaven preserve us from the implacably entrenched.</p>

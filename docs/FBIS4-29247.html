			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 15 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  carries an article headlined "Glorious Course in Which Most  Brilliant Era has Opened in Building of Our Party" on the lapse  of 30 years since the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il began to  work at the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea  [WPK].    Comrade Kim Chong-il has led the WPK over the past 30 years,  taking upon himself the work of all domains of party building  including the organisational, ideological and leadership  departments.    The article says the history of his leadership over the  party  building is a history of unfailing loyalty in which he has  firmly defended the lineage of the party established by the  leader and glorified the party as a great revolutionary party,  and a brilliant history in which he indicated the fundamental  questions of the revolutionary party building with his  extraordinary intelligence and comprehensively completed the  theories of building of a working- class party in the present  era.    The article goes on:    Expounded in the theories of the party building which have  been historically developed by the dear leader in depth are all  the principled questions of party building, including the basic  principles of party building, the idea and theory of building  the party in a prospective way, the guidelines for strengthening  the party ranks organisationally and ideologically and  intensifying the party's leadership over the revolution and  construction, and the ways of achieving close unity with the  masses.    The past 30 years of his leadership to our party is also a  proud history in which he has fundamentally changed the looks of  the party with his surprising organisational skill and  leadership ability.    He has changed fundamentally in a historically short period  all domains and units of the party work from the question of  improving the party members' mode of thinking and style of work  to the question of traits of cadres, from the intra-party  affairs to the external activities of the party.    Comrade Kim Chong-il has performed immortal feats  unprecedented in the history of the revolutionary party building  in the course of his glorious 30 years of leadership to the work  of our party.    The greatest feat performed by him in realizing the cause of  building of our party is that he has laid solid organisational  and ideological foundations for strengthening and developing the  party into a revolutionary party of chuche united in one mind  forever.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has said:    "The top echelon of the party has been built up, the  organisational and ideological foundation of the party laid as  firmly as a rock and its guidance system solidly established so  as to carry on the ideas and leadership of our party. This is a  brilliant success and a great victory in the building of our  party."    A great victory worthy of special record in history has been  won in the organisational and ideological building of our party  under the guidance of the dear leader over the past 30 years.    In our party now, the ranks of cadres who constitute the  backbone of its organisational and ideological foundation have  been built with staunch revolutionaries who are sharing life and  death with the party in any adversity. All our party members  are vanguard fighters following the leader only with loyalty and  filial piety.    In the aspect of ideological building, our party has become  a  pure ideological entity in which only one idea, the chuche idea,  prevails.    Any heterogeneous idea or unsound trend contrary to the  ideology and intentions of the leader cannot intrude into our  party.    Great feats performed by Comrade Kim Chong-il in the cause  of  building a revolutionary party of chuche also lie in that he has  strengthened and developed our party into a powerful general  staff of the revolution leading the revolutionary cause along an  ever- victorious road with his invincible leadership ability.    In the course of his leadership of the cause of party  building the party's leadership system has been established in  our society on the highest level whereby to firmly ensure the  party's leadership over all the domains and units of the  revolution and construction.    Having strengthened and developed the party into an  invincible revolutionary party linked to the masses by the  strongest, close bonds of kinship is a great feat performed by  Comrade Kim Chong-il in the cause of building the revolutionary  party of chuche.    He has established throughout the party a revolutionary  trait  of working as demanded by the Chongsanri spirit and the  Chongsanri method, thus turning the party into a revolutionary  party always sharing the same destiny with the masses at all  times in one lineage, a party without bureaucratism and abuse of  power, for the first time in the history of the communist  movement.    Having strengthened and developed the Workers' Party of  Korea  into indestructible militant ranks never seen before in the  ideological and organisational aspects and in relations with the  masses and set a model of the times in building a revolutionary  party holds the most brilliant place in the revolutionary feats  performed by the dear leader.</p>

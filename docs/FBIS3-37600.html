The event did not take place and the speech was postponed until  24 February. Sergey Filatov, leader of the Presidential  Administration, gave your KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent the  reasons for the postponement: "First, Boris Nikolayevich does  not feel well and, second, there have been many telephone calls  from the leaders of the territories asking for the dates of the  president's speech and the enlarged session of the government,  which was scheduled for 25 February, to be brought closer  together. Otherwise they would have to fly to Moscow too  often," Filatov explained.    The head of state's state of health is no trifling matter:  It gives rise to a host of rumors and suppositions, and it is  the prerogative of the attending physician to dispel them.  However, it could be suggested that the ailment was most  opportune. It enabled the president to take a time-out from the  Bosnia crisis and postpone the explanations with  parliamentarians on that matter.    Recent events in parliament show that mutual relations  between the president and the State Duma are becoming strained.  It is too soon to talk of a conflict, but.... After some  reflection the president cast doubt on the legitimacy of the  lower chamber speaker's election. In reply the parliament  almost denounced the Belovezhskaya Forest agreements (they were  30 votes short). And as previously promised it created a  parliamentary commission to investigate the events in Moscow in  September-October last year. Only 46 people voted against this  (in other words, it was also supported by deputies from Russia's  Choice). Unlike the criminal investigation instituted into the  mass disorders on 3-4 October, the results of the parliamentary  investigation will carry a political assessment. It may be  variance with the Prosecutor's Office investigators' findings.  So a return to this question (albeit at the level of  parliamentary hearings) is hardly what Boris Yeltsin wants.    The parliamentarians decided to move from the City Hall  building offered by Yeltsin to one of three other places: the  White House, Staraya Ploshchad, or...the Kremlin. "How  practicable is this decision?" I asked the initiators of the  idea. "We will elevate the document to the rank of a law,"  Anatoliy Lukyanov replied. Whether this influenced the  president's team or not is hard to say, but Sergey Filatov came  to the latest session of the Duma Council (a body which includes  the leaders of the factions and the speaker) and offered the  lower house of parliament the former USSR State Planning  Committee building on Okhotnyy Ryad Street where the Russian  Federation Economy Ministry is presently located. The Council  agreed, but whether the Duma will agree is another matter. The  building is in need of capital repair which could take as long  as the deputies' entire term of office.    There is a reason for the parliamentarians' show of  autonomy.  The Duma clearly does not like the bit-part which Boris Yeltsin  has assigned to it. At the moment mutual relations are typified  by the unsophisticated formula: "I adopt the decisions, you  ratify them." The deputies' factions received the text of  Russia's treaty with Georgia the very day before the signing,  when there was no longer any point in discussing it. They had  missed the boat. Hence the problems with ratification.... The  president's moves always take deputies by surprise. The Duma  does not have 20 people to set out the Boris Yeltsin's position  on this or that question, let alone lobby for his ideas.    But what about Russia's Choice? It is distancing itself  increasingly from the president. Added to that is the clear  absence of factional discipline. Burdened by their political  weight, many of the Russia's Choice people are steering clear of  routine parliamentary work. This is clearly visible from the  balcony -- from the right, crew-cut ranks of the Communists, the  Cgrarians, and the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. From the  left -- the preserve of People's Choice -- the vast open spaces  of empty seats. What is the point of lobbying there?</p>

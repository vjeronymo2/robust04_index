The eight-member mission will visit places such as the  Croatian capital of Zagreb, the besieged Bosnian capital of  Sarajevo, the Serbian capital of Belgrade and Skopje in  Macedonia before returning to Japan on January 17, the officials  said.    The members will meet Yasushi Akashi, head of U.N.  peacekeeping operations in the former Yugoslavia, U.N. High  Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata, as well as other U.N.  officials and government officials of Croatia, Macedonia and  Slovenia, they said.    The Japanese team is headed by Shunji Yanai, director  general  of the ministry's Foreign Policy Bureau, who played a key role  in realizing Japan's legislation on cooperation in U.N.  peacekeeping missions which enabled the Self-Defense Forces  (SDF) to join U.N. operations in Cambodia in 1992.    Foreign Ministry officials have described the aim of the  mission as simply to "grasp the local conditions" to study  possible Japanese contributions, brushing aside speculation that  the mission might pave the way for sending SDF there.    Akashi has repeatedly called for Japanese contribution to  U.N. peacekeeping forces in the former yugoslavia.    Japanese officials have cited difficulties in sending SDF  troops there because of the absence of a cease-fire agreement,  unlike that in Cambodia. Japan is expected to send an assistant  to support Akashi.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yefim Shvratsman] </F>   [Text] Sevastopol March 30 TASS -- The Black Sea Fleet  dispute can be resolved only by the presidents of Russia and  Ukraine, according to Fleet Commander Eduard Baltin.    In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday, Baltin's  spokesman Andrey Grachev said the commander hopes that President  Boris Yeltsin and President Leonid Kravchuk will solve the  problem soon and find the only correct decision reflecting the  military, political and economic possibilities of the two  countries.    Baltin believes that the dependence of military and  political  tasks on the economic situation is crucial for solving the Black  Sea Fleet problem. Russia and Ukraine have no big  disagreements, while those that exist can be solved by political  means, the spokesman quoted Baltin as saying.    The fleet commander considers himself subordinated to both  presidents and agrees all his decisions with them, Grachev  continued. He voiced concern about unilateral decisions  concerning the Black Sea Fleet by the Ukrainian Defence  Ministry, stressing that the Russian side remains adherent to  the Massandra Agreements which must be observed.    Commenting on Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov's proposal to  Ukraine to withdraw its troops from the Crimea, Grachev said  that should such a decision appear, the Black Sea Fleet  commanders will provide Moscow, Kiev and Simferopol with firm  guarantees of the security of their southern frontiers.</p>

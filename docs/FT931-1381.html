			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / French refuse to slam door on Le Pen: The centre-right's landslide has failed to damage the National Front in the south THE electoral tide that will carry France's centre-right parties to government next week has rolled down the Rhone valley. But there are two rocks of resistance which it has not completely washed over, at least not until the results of Sunday's run-off parliamentary election are in. The biggest reef which the neo-Gaullist Republican Rally (RPR) and the Union for French Democracy (UDF) liberals have hit is the National Front. Mr Raymond Barre, the centrist ex-prime minister, who by a narrow margin was elected outright in last Sunday's first ballot, said he had never thought to see the Front do so well. In fact, the far-right party of Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen scored a relatively low 17 per cent in Mr Barre's Lyons constituency. Elsewhere it was more successful. Five years ago, only one of its candidates reached the second round in the Rhone department's 14 constituencies; on Sunday it will have seven candidates in the run-off to contest the 12 seats which remain open. One of them is Mr Bruno Gollnisch who came top in his constituency with 24.5 per cent of the vote. Attracting the support that had gone to a dissident Gaullist who was eliminated in the first round is Mr Gollnisch's main hope of keeping first place in the run-off - and he is convinced that the Front is now firmly embedded as the region's second political force. Married to a Japanese whose language and civilisation he teaches at Lyons university, Mr Gollnisch does not fit easily the xenophobic image of the Front, even though he is a member of its national executive. But he does expound on the threats of immigration and Aids. 'This is why people listen to us - we were the ones to break the taboos on talking about these issues,' he says. Like Mr Le Pen, his leader, Mr Gollnisch has no inhibitions about attacking the press and pollsters for consistently underestimating his party. 'The polls are run by crooks or idiots who should know by now that people are more hesitant about professing their support for the Front than for other parties,' he says. He believes that pollsters should build a correction factor into their estimates of support for the Front. The other point of resistance to the prevailing tide is less a reef than an outcrop, since it consists of one man - Mr Michel Noir, the embattled mayor of Lyons. Once a rising star of the RPR in whose last government he served as trade minister, Mr Noir formed a breakaway reformist movement a couple of years ago. It went nowhere. Yet the RPR would probably never have dared take on the mayor of France's second largest city, had they not scented weakness. The smell was indeed obvious to all, from the moment Mr Noir became embroiled last year in the 'Botton affair'. Mr Pierre Botton, once a prominent Lyonnais businessman who is still Mr Noir's son-in-law, is in jail on charges of milking his companies of money that he put to various uses, including free holidays for a prominent TV anchorman, but also the illegal funding of Mr Noir's 1989 mayoral campaign which he managed. Mr Noir's effort to wipe off the mud were made no easier when earlier this month Mr Botton leaked to the press copies of a letter Mr Noir had written in 1989 detailing how he would be repaying the money to Mr Botton. But somehow Mr Noir seems to have convinced a number of Lyonnais that he is the innocent victim of a family vendetta. In his attempt to keep his parliamentary seat (which in France can be combined with that of mayor), Mr Noir was less than one percentage point in the first ballot behind Mr Alain Merieux. Mr Merieux is the official RPR candidate and scion of Rhone-Poulenc's Institut Merieux, which is a world leader in vaccines. In a Tuesday night radio debate, Mr Noir exploited Mr Merieux's tactless suggestion that a Noirist Lyons would find itself isolated in an RPR-run France, by claiming that his city was being victimised as well as himself. On Sunday Mr Noir will not be able to count on support which in the first round went to Socialist or green candidates - those parties have told their voters to stay out of the Noir-Merieux mudfight. But he has one thing going for him - hatred of the local National Front, which has filed lawsuits against him for blocking their use of municipal meeting places. The Front's defeated candidate in the constituency, Ms Anne Richard, has called on her supporters not to vote for Mr Noir, and said she will vote for Mr Merieux. The latter is desperately stressing that he has never solicited her backing, but with friends like the Front he may find himself with too many enemies to stay top in Sunday's poll. The outcome will be an important test of how respectable the Le Pen party is now considered in today's France.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Plan for Hadrian's Wall trail criticised The government has approved the Countryside Commission's controversial plan for an 81-mile national trail for walkers alongside Hadrian's Wall, Chris Tighe writes. The commission believes the route, along the former northern boundary of the Roman Empire from Wallsend in Tyne and Wear to Bowness on Solway in Cumbria, could bring more than Pounds 1m a year into the local economy from visitors. But yesterday Mr Peter Atkinson, Tory MP for Hexham, said that the trail would bring chaos to land and livestock management and questioned how much economic benefit it would generate. Archaeologist Professor Peter Fowler of Newcastle University condemned the plan to create a 'pedestrian motorway' through a designated World Heritage Site. Announcing the decision, Mr Robert Atkins, environment minister, said the government was satisfied that the commission had taken full account of the implications of establishing the path alongside the world heritage site.</p>

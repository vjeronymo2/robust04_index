			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Discussion between studio anchor Tamar Landau and political </F> correspondent Udi Segal at Tel Aviv University -- live]    [Text] [Landau] A legal opinion presented to Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin today stipulates that if there is a grave  violation of the accord with the PLO, the agreement is null and  void. If relatively minor violations occur, Israel may impose  sanctions such as closing off the Autonomy areas and canceling  the safe passages from Gaza to Jericho. Udi Segal has more  details:    [Segal] Senior security officials said today they believe  that the Palestinian authority wishes to prove it is able to  control the territory and -- according to estimates by the  Palestinian police -- if it wanted to, it could foil many terror  acts. At the same time, the senior security sources made clear  that if the Palestinians fail to provide security, Israel will  have to do this itself. The remarks were made to reporters in a  meeting with the media to explain the various aspects of the  Gaza and Jericho agreement. On the one hand, the sources  present a positive picture: We have a partner for dialogue,  they say. The activists in the field show that they seriously  mean to implement the agreement and prove their ability to do  so. For example, the police units that arrived in Gaza show  certain control abilities, and even their spic and span uniform  shows a degree of authority and seriousness.    On the other hand, we heard a long and detailed briefing  about the difficulties that outnumber the positive aspects. The  sources mainly referred to the fact that there is no money on  the ground, not even for salaries and so called everyday  management. There is a shortage of food, gasoline, and other  basics of logistic support means are lacking in both the  activities of the Palestinian police and the civilian offices  which were handed over to local directors. In the meantime,  until 'Arafat appoints the Palestinian authority, there is no  one to run the area.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 25 May  carries a similar report adding: "Our correspondent Shlomo Raz  reports that in a meeting with correspondents, the sources said  PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat has to change his decisionmaking  process, otherwise shock waves can be expected in the  organization's leadership. They said they do not believe him,  but added that if they had to negotiate with the local  leadership in the territories, things would have been much  harder."]    Speaking before students today, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  said that although the policemen are not receiving salaries,  their performance is better than we had expected. They still do  not fully understand their responsibilities or active duties,  but we have a partner there. Some policemen there have been out  of Gaza for the past 20 years, but their attitude is positive.  Rabin then added: I am not referring to their chief chatterer,  meaning 'Arafat.    Rabin addressed himself to 'Arafat's decree yesterday  canceling military orders, saying violation or not, this is  nonsense. His remarks are meaningless.    A legal opinion presented here today states that if the PLO  significantly breaches [hafara mashma'utit] the agreement with  Israel, the agreement would be null and void or, alternatively,  Israel may announce it is suspending the agreement for as long  as it wants.    [Landau] Does this condition apply to a reverse hypothetical  situation in which Israel violates the agreement in some way?  What is a gross violation [hafara hamura]?    [Segal] A gross violation means a breach of a clause without  the existence of which the offended party would not have signed  the agreement to begin with. That is to say that there may be  insignificant violations of the agreement which, according to  international law, apply to both parties. 'Arafat's acts over  the past several days constitute insignificant violations of the  agreement. According to international law, Israel may legally  make a reciprocal violation that would equal the first  violation. For example, Israel may make take such steps as  banning the Palestinian residents of the Gaza Strip and Jericho  from entering Israel; canceling the safe passages of  Palestinians between Gaza and Jericho; avoid employing laborers  in Israel; close the air space; or many other steps.    In the meeting, official analysts spoke about three tests  'Arafat must face now: Providing the Palestinians with security  -- that is the test of control. The need to unify enough  Palestinian bodies to run daily life -- that is, making the  civilian system, that is not yet working well, operational. The  third, which is a precondition for the other two, is the ability  to work with budgets, meaning collecting funds from two sources:  taxes, and the sources doubt that they will be able to collect  taxes at this time; and the international community which so far  has not shown that it is willing to finance the autonomy's  everyday life.    All the security officials who spoke here today said that it  is too early to unequivocally determine whether the agreement is  working or not. After all, these are the initial days. It will  take a few more weeks before we are able to judge what is really  happening in Tunis, Gaza, and Jericho.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1505 GMT carries a  similar report by Shlomo Raz adding that in his meeting with  reporters today, Prime Minister Rabin said that "he is worried  that Jericho might become a focus of sharp confrontation, unless  the orders of the Central Command commander are strictly  observed." Rabin further said that the Israelis involved in the  incidents yesterday "were not exactly naive." Rabin said that  Kibbutz Netzarim in the Gaza Strip was evacuated by the  Religious Kibbutz Movement "in a big rush, and they even asked  for 3 million shekels, and received the money." The place was  later inhabited by Gush Emunim activists, but "if this is a real  settlement, I'll be damned." Raz goes on to say that "in his  address today, Rabin elaborated on his expectations from the  agreement with the PLO. Anyone who portrays the agreement of  principles as peace is wrong. It is a major step toward peace,  but it is not peace." "'Arafat lacks experience in the conduct  of a community's everyday life or in managing budgets, and he  has no desire to do so, Rabin stressed. The Palestinian  policemen are already suffering from this: they have no  salaries, food, or logistics syupport for their activities. At  the same time, Rabin pointed out, their attitude so far has been  positive. It is also positive that the policemen came from  Iraq, Sudan, and Algiers and did not experience the intifadah,  thus they do not feel hatred toward us as the Palestinians in  the territories do."]</p>

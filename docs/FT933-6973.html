			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / The land issue that divides a united Germany: Those who are challenging the 1990 unification treaty's rule that they cannot get their property back ALL OVER the world there are families who can recount stories of legendary battles over land: how one son was favoured over another; how siblings refused to talk to each other after a parent's will carved up property; or how one child got nothing. In the re-united German family, a growing controversy over whether property should be returned to its former owners is generating its own legends. When Soviet forces occupied eastern Germany in 1945, about 14,000 families farming 13,000 sq miles were ordered to leave their properties within 48 hours. Some were imprisoned on the island labour camp of Rugen, in the Baltic Sea. Others had to keep a 20-mile distance from their properties. Most fled to western Germany, and were compensated in the 1950s. Three years ago the unification treaty created one nation out of the two Germanys. On property questions, the treaty states that 'expropriations on the basis of Occupation Law (when the Soviets occupied eastern Germany between 1945-1949) are irreversible'. This means that former property owners during this period cannot get their land back - unlike those who can seek restitution or compensation for property confiscated between 1935 and 1945, and between 1949 and 1990. Through the federal constitutional court, several former landowners challenged the unification treaty's restrictive clauses on 1945-1949 on the basis that property was not being treated equally before the law. But the court upheld the treaty on the grounds that the Soviet Union and the former German Democratic Republic had made the ban on restitution a precondition for unification. 'This is absolute nonsense,' said one constitutional lawyer. 'Those who are seeking to have their property returned to them can prove that no such precondition existed,' he added. Lawyers claim that documents recently obtained from Moscow show that the Soviet government never specifically made unification contingent on the 1945-49 land issue. They say the word of the then West German government is the only evidence to support this view. 'On the one hand, passing the buck to the Soviet Union was a convenient attempt by the Bonn government to avoid paying compensation to former landowners. On the other, (Lothar) de Maiziere (the last prime minister of East Germany), was able to prevent 'the Junkers', or landed gentry, from coming back,' the lawyer said. The ruling by the constitutional court, however, has not discouraged an unlikely cross-section of individuals and institutions from challenging Bonn's interpretation of the treaty. They include the Dutch government, Daimler-Benz, the Duke of Saxony-Anhalt and a German lawyer. Each claim a legal right to restitution or substantial compensation. The Dutch government, which is acting on behalf of three families, is arguing that land owned by foreigners could not have been nationalised or expropriated by the Soviet authorities during this time. 'Under the Allied Control Council, property owned by foreigners could not be sold or expropriated or property rights transferred,' said a Dutch diplomat. For years, Dutch government tried unsuccessfully to negotiate with the former East German regime the return of this land to its original owners. Dutch diplomats thought the matter would be quickly resolved after unification. But after two 'verbal notes' to the foreign ministry in Bonn, the Dutch government has still been unable to get the property back. 'Bonn says we have to be patient. It has to work out the legal aspects,' a Dutch diplomat said. 'We said OK. But a solution which does not return the property, or grant compensation, is unacceptable to us,' he added. Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest industrial holding, had huge investments and property in the former East Germany. It is now arguing that it has a right to reclaim this property. 'We will claim about 14m sq yards of land throughout eastern Germany,' the company said. 'We are doing it on behalf of our shareholders.' The Prince of Saxony-Anhalt, who is the great great grand nephew of Catherine the Great, is also trying to reclaim his property of more than 24,700 acres. And Mr Albrecht Wendenburg, a lawyer who has no aristocratic, industrial, or diplomatic connections, is also trying to reclaim his small holdings in eastern Germany. 'People have this view that those whose property was expropriated between 1945-1949, were either raving Nazis, or else they want the property back so that they can kick out the present owners,' said Mr Wendenburg. 'We are trying to establish the principle of justice and truth: that property should be treated equally before the law, and that it was Bonn, not the Soviet Union, which chose to ban any restitution,' he added. Constitutional lawyers believe that Bonn may be forced to make concessions. 'This problem will not go away. The belief that it was the two German governments, and not the Soviet Union, which decided on this ban on restitution is gaining momentum. Until this matter is settled once and for all, property rights in eastern Germany will never be satisfactorily resolved, and investors will always be cautious,' a lawyer said.</p>

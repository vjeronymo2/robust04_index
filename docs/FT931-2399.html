			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / GM told to return to Finland GENERAL MOTORS, the US car maker, is to be forced to resume car production in Finland, at least temporarily, as a result of a German court order won by its former Finnish partner Valmet, the majority state-owned paper machinery and engineering group. The two companies are locked in a legal conflict following GM Europe's transfer of Finnish production of its Opel/Vauxhall Calibra coupe from Valmet's plant at Uusikaupunki to one of its main German plants at Russelsheim, near Frankfurt. The district court in Darm-stadt, Germany has issued an interim injunction in favour of Valmet ordering GM to resume production in Finland. GM said the court ruling involved only a preliminary order and was 'not a final decision on the merits' of the case. The US carmaker said it believed the order was 'wrong' and that it would 'appeal and pursue all available legal remedies to protect its legitimate interests.' Under the terms of the order GM would have to produce 30 per cent of its Calibra output at the Valmet plant. It said that under German law the order took 'immediate effect'. In order to comply with the order it was 'studying the matter' and would advise Valmet of its proposals to restart production in Finland. Calibra sales were currently running at around 3,000 a month across Europe, it said. GM ceased all production of the Calibra in Finland in mid-December. It moved the Finnish assembly to Germany to improve capacity utilisation at the Russelsheim plant and to avoid the added cost penalties of production in Finland. Output of the Calibra began in Finland in March 1991 at a time when GM needed extra capacity in western Europe with new car demand at a record level, but sales have since begun to fall dramatically and GM is being forced to take several measures to cut costs. The assembly agreement with Valmet was not due to expire until the end of 1996. GM halted the production in Finland in December after it failed to agree an assembly fee per car with Valmet following several months of abortive negotiations. GM claimed that it was suffering a DM5,000 (Pounds 2,118) per car cost penalty for production in Finland versus production in Germany. The loss-making Valmet group produced 34,556 Opel/Vauxhall cars in 1992 and 21,532 in 1991.</p>

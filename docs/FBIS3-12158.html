The ministers raised proposals for the prime  minister's attention and consideration. These proposals will be  worked out by the prime minister and then raised for discussion  at the cabinet meeting on 27 February. One proposal was to  remove dangerous residents if there is evidence that they are  Kakh members. Another was to pay compensation to the casualties.  A third proposal was to establish a national inquiry commission.    Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer told our correspondent  Karmela  Menashe that the government is determined to accelerate the  peace process. Minister Amnon Rubinstein noted that for the  first time, a closure was imposed also on Jewish residents in  Hebron and Qiryat Arba' and that they cannot move without  permission.    At the end of the meeting, Police Minister Moshe Shahal said  that the police are currently operating in 12-hour shifts.  Units were reinforced in all sensitive places, particularly in  Jerusalem. The police minister added that the attorney general  raised several proposals during the meeting, including removing  Jewish residents from their homes, a move which according to the  attorney general, has a legal basis.    Our correspondent Moti Amir reports the closure was expanded  to encompass the whole of Judaea and Samaria, and to close down  the Cave of the Patriarchs for 48 hours. The closure on the  Gaza Strip, imposed this morning, as well the curfew imposed on  Hebron and Bethlehem following the murder, are continuing.</p>

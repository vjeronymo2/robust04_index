			<p>BFN     [Text] The Army Ministry has been following the charges  being made about the involvement of police and members of the  judicial and legislative branches in the numbers game scandal.  The ministry does not dismiss the possibility of intervention in  Rio de Janeiro if the state government requests, and the  president of the Republic so determines. General Gilberto Serra,  who is Army Minister Zenildo Lucena's spokesman, said: "We are  following the situation, as our constitutional duties tell us  to." The Army leadership believes the possibility of an Armed  Forces' initiative would not have the explicit characteristics  of an intervention, but of assistance.    Chamber of Deputies President Inocencio Oliveira admitted  the  possibility of creating a numbers game Congressional  Investigating Committee to look into charges being made against  deputies. In Congress, the legislators did not hide their fear  that the scandal will affect the institution. In Rio de Janeiro,  Deputy Jorge Bittar -- Workers Party leader in the Chamber of  Deputies -- announced that he will ask for Mayor Cesar Maia's  impeachment [preceding word in English].</p>

			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Three nations to build warship FRANCE, Italy and Britain have signed a memorandum of understanding to develop and produce a new warship. The common new generation frigate will be the first big maritime collaboration between the three nations and aims to reduce each country's budget by sharing costs. It is an extension of a planned Anglo-French frigate which has been discussed by London and Paris since 1990 and received the go-ahead the following year. Italy joined the programme earlier this year. The UK Defence Ministry said that although a commitment to take the project to the production stage had been signed, the programme 'is still at a very early stage'. The frigate, which should be in service within seven years, is intended to replace the Royal Navy's Type 42 air-defence destroyers, which were at the forefront of the naval campaign in the Gulf war.</p>

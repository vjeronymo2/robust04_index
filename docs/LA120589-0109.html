			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 'TIS SEASON FOR THIEVES TO SMASH CAR WINDOWS AS GLASS SHOPS THRIVE  </P> <P> During the holiday shopping season, leave Christmas gifts unattended in the  back seat of your car, and, Pete Newberger says, you're bound to receive at  least two unexpected visitors.  </P> <P> "A thief and me," says Newberger, district manager for five U.S. Auto Glass  Centers in San Diego County.  </P> <P> During the Christmas months, thieves and vandals are out in force "busting  windows, nabbing Christmas gifts, clothing and purses" left inside cars,  Newberger said. The result: repair work on auto windows "just skyrockets" for  Newberger and the dozens of other San Diego auto-glass shops.  </P> <P> Work on side and back windows -- thieves' main points of entry -- accounts for  more than 60% of the 150 repairs conducted daily by U.S. Auto Glass' five  county service centers during the holiday shopping season, Newberger said. This  time of year, his fleet of 20 radio-dispatched service trucks is kept busy  answering the distressed calls of windowless car owners throughout the county.  </P> <P> But the holiday season isn't the only time of the year that proves lucrative.  An escalating crime rate has fed repair shops' growth year-round. Moreover, the  rising number of vehicles traveling San Diego's roads as a result of the  county's booming population have resulted in more accidents and stone-chipped  windows and thus more business for auto-glass shops.  </P> <P> San Diego has about 100 auto-glass repair shops, but Newberger says there is  plenty of business to keep nearly everybody happy.  </P> <P> In fact, Newberger says, the combined revenue of San Diego's five U.S. Auto  Glass service centers has grown at a compounded annual rate of 20% over the  last two years and should exceed $4 million in 1989. In addition to the San  Diego service centers, U.S. Auto Glass, a subsidiary of closely held,  Chicago-based Globe Glass and Mirror Comp., operates 12 other Southern  California outlets.  </P> <P> "The No. 1 reason for our growth is more people moving into the county, which  means there are more vehicles out on the road," Newberger said. "That means  more accidents, more stone bruises."  </P> <P> Besides replacing shattered windows, most service centers repair "stone  bruises," which occur when flying debris, including pebbles kicked up by  trucks, strike the windshield. Stone bruises are repaired by filling the crack  with a polymer, which makes the window "structurally as good as new," Newberger  said.  </P> <P> He added: "And, where ever you see population growth, vandalism is going to  follow suit. The bigger the city, the higher the crime rate."  </P> <P> Crime statistics compiled by the San Diego Police Department supports  Newberger's claim.  </P> <P> Although such statistics do not specifically track the number of car windows  broken by thieves or vandals, police records do monitor the number of "car  prowls" -- which include any type of theft from a vehicle, either through  forced (breaking windows or locks) or unforced entry (unlocked door). Car  prowls also include theft of car batteries and tires, said Donna Guevara, a  spokeswoman for the department's crime analysis unit.  </P> <P> From January to November of this year, more than 27,475 car prowls were  recorded by San Diego police, up 10% from 24,925 posted during the same period  last year. "With the number of car prowls increasing each year, it's reasonable  to assume that window break-ins are increasing as well," Guevara said.  </P> <P> Insurance companies have noticed the trend as well.  </P> <P> Theresa Bedoy, an Allstate Insurance spokeswoman, says that in recent years her  company has received an increasing number of glass claims from various causes,  including accidents, theft and vandalism for the Southern California region.  Through the first 10 months of the year, Allstate alone has processed 9,345  glass claims for its Southern California policy holders.  </P> <P> "And that's not including November and December, which are typically our high  months," Bedoy said. "Our claims people say there is a definite increase in  those months because of an increase in windshield damage due to sand storms and  vandals striking during the holiday season."  </P> <P> Paying for new windows during the holiday shopping season could mean fewer  presents under the Christmas tree.  </P> <P> The following suggested list prices were published in the National Auto Glass  Specifications (NAGS), a list that auto-glass repair companies use to help set  prices: a windshield for a Mercedes 190 costs $484.70, an Oldsmobile Cutlass  windshield costs $249.25 and a windshield for a Ford Ranger costs $255.25.  Front door windows cost: $165.40 for the Mercedes, $113.35 for the Oldsmobile  and $190.45 for the Ford.  </P> <P> But auto-glass repairers say such prices vary greatly from shop to shop because  most offer discounts of 20% to 55% and have different arrangements with various  insurance companies. Volume of business and availability also significantly  affect the actual price consumers pay for new windows.  </P> <P> Tom A. Gapen, general manager of San Diego-based All Star Glass, says he has  noticed a rise in business during the holiday season as well. But, Gapen adds,  the boost isn't always because of vandalism.  </P> <P> "Lots of people, say those who get their windows broken earlier in the year,  will hold off getting it fixed during the holidays because they rather spend  their money on Christmas gifts," Gapen said. "But, as soon as the weather gets  bad, when it starts raining, those plans get altered and they start coming into  our shop."  </P> <P> In addition to its San Diego service center and corporate headquarters, All  Star Glass operates four outlets in the county, in Chula Vista, El Cajon,  Escondido and Oceanside. Since All Star Glass opened in July 1978 with two  service centers, it has added eight outlets, including three in Los Angeles and  two in Orange County.  </P> <P> "Kids hitting baseballs through windshields, tourists getting their cars broken  into at the Zoo or Sea World, vandalism . . . we're pretty busy year-round,"  Gapen said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> INS URGED TO HALT HIGHWAY ARRESTS;  </P> <P> TRAFFIC DEATHS OF ALIEN PEDESTRIANS NEAR BORDER CITED  </P> <P> Citing the high number of deaths of undocumented pedestrians near the U.  S.-Mexico border, two advocates Friday called on the U. S. Border Patrol to  cease making arrests on or along three major roadways in southern San Diego  County.  </P> <P> In a letter to Alan Nelson, commissioner of the U. S. Immigration and  Naturalization Service, they also called on federal authorities to stop  vehicular chases on the main roadways -- Interstate 5, Interstate 805 and  California 905 -- in San Ysidro and Chula Vista.  </P> <P> "We just want them to do everything they can to prevent these deaths," said  Claudia E. Smith, regional counsel for California Rural Legal Assistance, a  nonprofit group that works with migrants.  </P> <P> The hope, said Smith, is that eliminating the enforcement activity will reduce  the likelihood that fleeing migrants will be hit by vehicles.  </P> <P> But a U. S. Border Patrol official immediately said it would be impossible to  comply with the two requests. "We're sworn to arrest those people in violation  of immigration law," said Armand Olvera, assistant chief Border Patrol agent in  San Diego, who stressed that patrol agents are careful to avoid injuring anyone  while making arrests or chasing suspect vehicles.  </P> <P> The letter is the latest in a campaign to cut down on the number of fatalities  of undocumented pedestrians in southern San Diego County, where hundreds of  thousands of illegal immigrants enter the United States each year. Many cross  the grid of highways that converges at the border; others stay near the  relatively dark highways to avoid detection.  </P> <P> Last year, according to the California Highway Patrol, 28 undocumented people  were killed crossing highways in San Diego, most of them within a few miles of  the border. Many are victims of hit-and-run drivers.  </P> <P> In response to the problem, the California Department of Transportation has  installed a sign near the intersections of Interstates 5 and 805 warning  motorists that pedestrians may be on the road. State officials plan to take a  number of other steps, including the installation of increased lighting and the  pruning of highway brush along highway green areas, where many migrants take  cover. Other remedies are also being considered, including a reduction of the  speed limit, officials said.  </P> <P> The letter, sent Friday, was signed by Smith and Roberto Martinez, border  representative for the American Friends Service Committee, social action arm of  the Quaker church.  </P></p>

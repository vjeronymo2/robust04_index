			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / International Company News: Eastman Kodak prepares for a new image - The chairman has persuaded the company to embrace change wholeheartedly The announcement by Mr George Fisher, chairman of Eastman Kodak, that the group would sell its healthcare and household products businesses delighted Wall Street for a simple reason: many analysts and investors doubted that the new Kodak chief had the guts to do it. Ever since Mr Fisher took over the helm at the struggling photographic products group last December following the resignation of his predecessor, Mr Kay Whitmore, Wall Street has waited for the new chairman to outline his strategy for turning around Kodak, which has been heavily criticised for its lacklustre financial performance. Most analysts were hoping Mr Fisher would choose to sell off Kodak's non-core operations so that it could concentrate on its photographic products and imaging business. But few were sure that he would be able to engineer such a dramatic shift at a company renowned for its stodgy corporate culture and resistance to change. After all, Kodak had made five attempts in the past 10 years to restructure its businesses and generate better earnings, and all had failed. Why, critics asked, would it be any different this time? Yet, judging by the planned restructuring, Mr Fisher - who made a name for himself as a brilliant technologist and manager while chairman of Motorola - has persuaded Kodak to embrace change wholeheartedly. Under the divestment plan unveiled yesterday, the group will sell its pharmaceutical and consumer health products unit Sterling Winthrop, its personal care and household products business L&amp;F Products, and its Clinical Diagnostics division. Between them, the three businesses generated almost a quarter of Kodak's 1993 revenues of Dollars 16.4bn. When the divestment is complete - and Mr Fisher would not be drawn on whether the operations would be sold to another company or spun off in a public share issue - Kodak will be reduced to two main components. These are its imaging business, and its Health Sciences division, a unit which, with its X-ray film and electronics-based medical, cardiology, and dental diagnostic businesses, is regarded as a vital part of Kodak's imaging strategy. The first impact of the divestments will be to improve dramatically the group's financial condition. Kodak is labouring under Dollars 7bn in debt, and the proceeds from the sale of the healthcare operations could eliminate the bulk of the group's debt at a single stroke. Kodak paid Dollars 5.1bn for Sterling in 1988, but that purchase was completed when US drug stocks were at their peak, so it is unlikely the unit will sell for quite as much today. The restructuring will also allow Kodak to concentrate on developing its imaging business. Most of Kodak's photographic earnings are derived from its traditional film products, which uses a chemical process - the sensitivity to light from silver halide salts. Yet this business is threatened by the rapidly growing market for digital, electronic imaging. Mr Fisher has taken steps to protect and develop Kodak's core business, including the recent formation of a new unit to lead the group's involvement in electronic imaging. Further, similar measures are likely soon; as Mr Fisher said yesterday, the divestments will allow Kodak to 'attack a broader array of imaging opportunities around the world.' First, however, Kodak must dispose of its non-core businesses. The group should have little trouble finding a buyer for Sterling Winthrop, given the wave of merger activity in the pharmaceutical industry. In fact, within hours of Kodak announcing its restructuring, the German drugs group Bayer expressed an interest in acquiring Sterling. Mr Fisher, however, said yesterday the French company Elf Sanofi, a partner with Kodak in a worldwide drug sales venture, would get the first right of refusal to buy part or all of Sterling.</p>

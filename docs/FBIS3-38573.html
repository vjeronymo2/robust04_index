During a demonstration of the  European Movement in Switzerland, the head of the Federal  Department of Foreign Affairs said Tuesday evening [1 February]  that there is "no realistic political alternative" to the  European Union [EU] and that Switzerland should participate in  it.    Increasingly, Europe is having to confront problems which  extend beyond national borders. International crime, drug  trafficking, and trade and environment policy cannot be resolved  at regional or national level, the Federal Councillor said.    The EU is still far from perfect, he acknowledged,  mentioning  a bureaucracy which is still too dense and the failure of the  negotiations on the Yugoslav conflict. Nevertheless, it is a  stabilizing factor called upon to play a central role.    The future of the EU lies in a structure which respects  minorities and which functions in a decentralized and federalist  manner. It is here that Switzerland can make its contribution,  Flavio Cotti stressed. A greater commitment by our country will  not lead to the weakening of the Swiss identity. On the  contrary, in greater Europe, Switzerland will continue to make  decisions on its future itself. Moreover, it will become more  sure of itself and more open to the world, he said.</p>

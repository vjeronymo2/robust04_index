			<p>BFN     [Text] As we said earlier, the political day was  characterized by two events: the final effort on the part of  Silvio Berlusconi to form the new government and the reactions  to the motion warning against fascism approved by the European  Parliament. However, now let's see how Berlusconi's political  day went. Mario De Scalzi reports:    [De Scalzi] Berlusconi is a little closer to reaching his  goal, and perhaps the decisions concerning the appointments in  the new government could be only a few hours away. However, as  far as the most delicate question -- who will be in charge at  the Interior Ministry -- is concerned, the prime  minister-designate must place his trust in the mediation of  President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. This was the explicit request  made by Umberto Bossi, who tomorrow may go and meet the  president.    Today it was Berlusconi's turn to meet the president.  Officially the visit was made in order to update Scalfaro on  the progress of his negotiations to form a government. The  meeting lasted over two hours, so it is difficult to believe  that the subject of the Interior Ministry was not touched upon.  A number of rumors are circulating in the press; one maintains  that the Interior Ministry will be given to Berlusconi on an  interim basis, and another says that this most delicate post in  the government will be assigned to a technocrat. The name of the  head of the police, Vincenzo Parisi, has been mentioned.    Late this evening Berlusconi denied that he had ever  bartered  with the Northern League on the question of the ministries. He  also assured Bossi, who fears that any government would be  chosen solely by the prime minister.    [Begin Berlusconi recording] As far as I am concerned, I  will  do all I can to make sure that we have the best government  possible in this situation. Naturally, we must be realistic and  take into account the fact that the chosen government will have  to obtain the approval of the Chamber of Deputies and the  Senate. In other words it will not be a government made up of  the prime minister's men, as some have suggested. We must form  a government which obtains a consensus, and which is able to  convince the allies of the Freedom Alliance of its capabilities.</p>

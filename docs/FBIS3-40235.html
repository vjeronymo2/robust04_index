			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by staff reporter He Jun: ``Nation Must Assess </F> Situation and Choose an HDTV System'']    [Text] With China's growing determination to develop its  own HDTV, the primary task ahead is to choose which hi-tech  systems to emulate.    Since China is not technologically or financially capable of  developing its own HDTV system, choosing the proper system is  essential, said Feng Jichun of the State Science and Technology  Commission (SSTC).    He said only one thing is certain now -- China's HDTV will  be  a fully digital system.    In the last 20 years, developed countries have invested a  lot  of time and money in HDTV research. Currently, three systems are  under development: the analogue systems of MUSE in Japan, HD-MAC  in Europe and the full-digital system of America.    Although only a few years old, the U.S. full-digital HDTV  system is now the most advanced and the future of the HDTV world.    Both Japan and Europe are devoting greater efforts to  developing their own full-digital HDTV systems.    But developing HDTV in China is not as simple as copying  another HDTV system. Different conditions in China must be met  first, said Ma Changhua, director of the HDTV research project  of SSTC.    Ma is also the former director and now the technical adviser  of the Institute of Broadcasting Science of the Ministry of  Broadcasting, Film and Television.    ``It is not only a matter of adopting a set of new and  advanced technologies for making television,'' Ma said. ``We  must consider all kinds of technical problems as well as the  current status of the Chinese television.''    A decision has to be made whether or not the current  production lines of Chinese TVs are to be abandoned in favour of  the better, clearer sets from the West, Ma added.    The world has three colour TV systems: NTSC in U.S., Japan  and Asia, PAL in West Europe and China, and SECAM in East Europe  and France.    Because of the ``internal relations'' between HDTV and  current television, Ma said, it is possible to use present-day  sets while replacing the conventional TV with HDTV.    But if China uses a system totally different from current  televisions, all its TV station equipment and production lines  may become obsolete.    Meanwhile, Ma said, there are many technical problems. For  example:    Using the PAL system for its conventional TV, China's TV  channel bandwidth is 8 megahertz (MHz).    If China uses the U.S. and Japan bandwidth of 6 MHz, which  is  likely to be used in the U.S. full-digital television, it is  easier for programme exchange, but more difficult to re-allot  the existing channels. So the country plans to use 8 MHz to get  better picture quality.    But the difference among future HDTV systems will be smaller  if all the countries adopt the full-digital style, Ma said.    By using digital technologies, television communications  will  be much easier in an HDTV world.    ``I think the future HDTV sets can receive programmes from  any country if a common standard is adopted,'' Ma said.    Though scientists dream of a world television system, the  future HDTV is not likely to use a universal system.    For all the political and economic concern, the slogan ``For  the World Peace'' that has appeared at so many international  HDTV seminars is turning out to be wishful thinking.    Each country has to consider their own specific situations  and make their own choice, Ma said.</p>

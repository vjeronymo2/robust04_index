			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Protest at Argentine Oscar Site: About 200 Argentine film industry workers,  protesting against tax exemptions for foreign films, staged a noisy  demonstration outside a theater in Buenos Aires where winners of two Hollywood  Oscars were announced early Tuesday. While Charlton Heston and Argentine  actress Norma Aleandro read out the winners of the best documentary categories,  outside the Colon Theatre film workers handed out leaflets which read: "Oscar  pays no taxes. Today television shows a black-tie Argentina to the world,  hiding the reality of a devastated industry, with thousands of unemployed  artists and technicians." BETH KLEID  </P></p>

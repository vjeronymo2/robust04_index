			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BALLROOM BOUTS: 1ST ROUND IS BLACK TIE;  </P> <P> BOXING: AFTER TWO TRIAL RUNS, PROMOTERS WIN DECISION FROM LONG BEACH PLANNING  COMMISSION TO STAGE FIGHTS AT HOTEL.  </P> <P> This is not boxing at the Olympic Auditorium where you step in gum and throw  beer. This is crystal chandeliers, ringside cocktails and gourmet hot dogs.  </P> <P> This is not a fight, it is "an evening." Never mind that at the end of the  evening somebody might leave with a face that resembles raw meat.  </P> <P> This is civilized boxing by the sea and it has come to the grand ballroom of  the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Long Beach.  </P> <P> "Most people's idea of boxing is live from the Olympic Auditorium when they  used to have riots and throw beers and referees got hit in the head with  bottles. This is back to the days of Tunney and Dempsey and Madison Square  Garden, when people got all dressed up to go to the fights," said Jerry  Westlund, an auctioneer and first-time boxing promoter at age 24.  </P> <P> In recent years, boxing has been moving from the sweaty, smoky arena to the  grand ballrooms of suburban hotels throughout the country, where ring girls  prance around in tasteful bathing suits with cards to help spectators keep  track of the round.  </P> <P> Last week, the city Planning Commission gave Westlund and John Boyd Hall, a  31-year-old local furrier, permission to stage monthly bouts at the Hyatt for a  year. That makes Long Beach the second city in Southern California to offer  ballroom boxing with small purses, genteel crowds and young talents.  </P> <P> Matches so far have included the state middleweight championship, and  up-and-comers like Steven Mwema, a bantamweight from the Kenyan Olympic boxing  team who "a lot of insiders feel will be a world champ someday," according to  Hall.  </P> <P> Promoters have tried before and failed to bring "yuppie boxing" to Long Beach.  Last year, a match scheduled at the Golden Sails Hotel on Pacific Coast Highway  collapsed under the weight of numerous permits the city requires. The event was  publicized, then canceled.  </P> <P> Promoter Don Fraser tried five years ago to put on matches under the wing of  the Spruce Goose. Although he went on to make monthly fights a raging yuppie  success at the Irvine Marriott -- the only other site of high-class hotel  boxing in Southern California -- he threw in the towel in Long Beach.  </P> <P> "It did OK, then we broke for the summer, and it never did get going again," he  said. "At that time, there was no demand for boxing in Long Beach."  </P> <P> Then along came Westlund and Hall, a couple of businessmen who sit on the  boards of directors of local charities -- a noticeable departure, they say,  from the classic fight promoter with "greasy hair and gold chains who chews his  cigar."  </P> <P> They obtained licenses from the California Athletic Commission, then traveled  from Las Vegas to Mexico scouting fighters. The city granted them special  permission to put on two trial matches at the Hyatt, one in November and the  other last Thursday night, while the Planning Commission decided whether to  make Boxing by the Beach a permanent attraction.  </P> <P> Both matches were near-sellouts, the promoters report. Former heavyweight  legend Ken Norton and two local city councilmen were there. The goal may have  been tuxes and gowns, but there also were plenty of T-shirts and tennis shoes.  At the first event, however, about 25 people from the Civic Light Opera did  show up in black tie and sipped cocktails while 10 men in five bouts slugged  each other over a 2 1/2-hour period.  </P> <P> "It just attracts a certain kind of crowd, a cut above the norm, a lot of  yuppie action," said Tim O'Connor, a Los Angeles diamond dealer who attended  both matches, tooling into town in his Arctic-blue BMW, sipping Perrier from a  ringside seat, then heading on to his oceanside home in Laguna Beach. "It has  that Las Vegas feel."  </P> <P> The ring girls -- in one-piece bathing suits to preserve dignity -- flashed  their cards and the one who elicited the loudest hoots was pronounced the  winner of the ring girl contest.  </P> <P> "The guys love 'em," Hall said. "Their swimsuits are very tasteful. You have to  keep it tasteful. It's not like you have a ring in a parking lot. This is a  ballroom."  </P> <P> The Planning Commission gave its unanimous approval to the idea after  Commissioner Pat Schauer was disabused of the notion that the boxing crowd is a  sweaty, smoky brawl waiting to happen.  </P> <P> "Will there be an exhaust system to handle the body heat and smoke?" she wanted  to know. "How do you protect against butts going onto the carpet? Will there be  extra police? Will liquor be sold at halftime?"  </P> <P> Not only are these nonsmoking events, the commission was assured, but some say  they will go a long way toward attracting the after-hours crowd the city badly  needs to wake up its ailing downtown commercial district.  </P> <P> All that remains to be seen now is whether yuppie boxing will knock Long Beach  out.  </P> <P> "Long Beach is a big sports town," Westlund said wishfully, noting that he once  saw people lined up outside a sports bar at 8:30 Sunday morning to watch a Rams  game.  </P> <P> The next boxing match is scheduled Feb. 13. The March match, date unknown, will  feature the state heavyweight title bout, Westlund said.  </P> <P> Tickets range from $20 to $40. The best seats are ringside with cocktail table  service and the worst are no more than 48 feet from the action, Westlund said.  </P></p>

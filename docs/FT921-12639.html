			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Hi-Tec Sports launches Pounds 10.3m rights issue HI-TEC Sports, the designer and distributor of sports footwear, is launching a one-for-five rights issue to strengthen its balance sheet and fund further expansion. The rights issue of 7.14m new ordinary shares is priced at 150p per share and is aimed at raising Pounds 10.3m net of expenses. The amount will go initially to reducing its debt burden of Pounds 20m at the end of January, and gearing of 82 per cent. Hi-Tec's shares yesterday closed down 3p at 179p. This is the first time the group has come to the market to raise money since its flotation in 1988. The initial impact of the right issue would be to reduce borrowings to about Pounds 10m and gearing to just under 30 per cent. Eventually, the group plans, on the basis of its strengthened balance sheet, to expand further in North America and Europe, two of its stronger markets last year. Mr Frank van Wezel, the group's chairman who controls just under 70 per cent of the shares, and other family members who control another 5 per cent, are not taking up any of their rights. As a result of the issue, Mr van Wezel's stake will fall to 56 per cent while the remaining family's will be reduced to about 4 per cent. Hi-Tec also forecast a 10 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the year to February 2 to Pounds 9m from a previous Pounds 8.2m. Earnings per share are forecast to rise to 15.78p (14.75p) and the board expects to recommend a final dividend of 3.85p (3.5p) on the enlarged share capital in the absence of unforeseen circumstances. This brings the total to 5.5p (5p).</p>

			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> VICTIMS SOUGHT IN OHIO BRIDGE COLLAPSE  </P> <P> Helicopters hovered over a tributary of the Ohio River searching for an  undetermined number of people whose vehicles plunged into the rain-swollen  waterway when a temporary bridge collapsed shortly before it was to be closed  to traffic. Powerful currents prevented authorities from finding any victims or  their vehicles. The American Red Cross said at least seven people remained  unaccounted for. Officials are uncertain how many vehicles fell when a 100-foot  section of the bridge near Cincinnati gave way. Eyewitness accounts differed  but authorities believed at least two vehicles disappeared into the Great Miami  River's rushing, muddy water. County engineers said the bridge had been ordered  closed because of debris that was pinned against it, but the collapse occurred  before workers could arrive.  </P></p>

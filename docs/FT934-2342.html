			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Pacific Basin climbs again with string of new highs Investors refrained from trading due to mounting uncertainty over the stability of the seven-party coalition government, and the Nikkei average closed just marginally higher, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. Volume totalled a mere 210m shares, down sharply from Friday's 600m, the settlement day for December futures and options contracts. The 225-issue index gained 69.90 at 17,237.33 after a day's low of 17,123.81 and high of 17,563.36. Advances outscored declines by 594 to 400, with 174 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 5.43 at 1,462.14, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 1.19 to 1,201.52. The Nikkei declined soon after the opening on arbitrage unwinding; it gained ground in the early afternoon on a rise in the futures market, but late profit-taking eroded most of the advance. Traders said attention was focused on the negotiations within the coalition government over the partial lifting of Japan's rice import ban. The Socialist party, which depends on the rural vote, has threatened to leave the coali-tion if the government decides to agree formally to the Gatt compromise plan, and some investors feared that the worst case scenario would be a break-up of the coalition. Investors also awaited further details of the expected additional fiscal package to be floated in the press. The government is likely to release the details of the budget for the next business year start-ing March, along with a stim-ulatory fiscal package after Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, reaches a dec-ision over the rice issue. Foreigners led buying in export oriented high-technology stocks. Sony rose Y140 to a year's high of Y5,340, as did Aiwa, up Y20 at Y1,840. East Japan Railway gained Y5,000 at Y422,000 and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone added Y5,000 at Y735,000. Other telecommunications-related issues were also strong, with Fujitsu, the day's most active issue, climbing Y20 to Y835 and NEC advancing Y24 to Y904. Brokerages were easier on profit-taking, with Nomura Securities losing Y10 to Y1,840 and Nikko Securities declining Y20 to Y1,110. Large retailers were strong on hopes of firm sales in the gift-giving season. Mitsukoshi moved forward Y15 to Y805 and Tokyu Department Store Y22 to Y600. However, supermarket chains lost ground, Daiei shedding Y20 to Y1,430 and Ito-Yokado Y10 to Y5,570. In Osaka, the OSE average was 68.01 firmer at 19,322.79 in volume of 79.7m shares. Roundup The region built on last week's gains, and produced six new record highs in the process. HONG KONG added modestly to last week's outstanding rise, the Hang Seng index ending 20.48 higher at 10,248.59 in spite of a renewed Chinese broadside against Governor Chris Patten's plans to push through his democratic reforms for the colony. Turnover was estimated at HKDollars 9.23bn, still strong but down from Friday's record HKDollars 11.94bn. The most active blue chip, HSBC, advanced HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 96.50. SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index moved ahead 24.87 to end at a new closing peak of 2,245.27 for the third straight trading day on a record turnover, driven by retail and institutional buying. Volume was a record 736.7m shares valued at SDollars 1.60bn, against the previous high of 717.8m shares worth SDollars 1.46bn set on October 28. KUALA LUMPUR hit its new high on speculative and institutional buying, which took the KLSE composite index up 14.50 to 1,090.35, volume rising from 754m to 939m shares. MANILA's brokers, full of enthusiasm, said that equities were building up for a bull market in 1994. Yesterday's 65.92 gain to a new high of 2,579.21 left it more than doubled from the 1993 low of 1,270.68 on January 4. KARACHI, continuing to put political stability ahead of a weak cotton crop, managed its record peak on settlement day, climbing sharply as local traders followed buying by foreign funds. The KSE index strengthened 30.69 to 1,888.24. BOMBAY ended higher after an early retreat, lower prices triggering a fresh round of buying. The BSE index closed 52.91 up at 3,454.81 and brokers said foreign funds were still voraciously on feed. TAIWAN made an eight-month high and turnover, too, jumped to its highest level since March. The weighted index put on 3.8 per cent, closing 178.23 stronger at 4,929.81. Turnover soared to TDollars 93.87bn, from TDollars 49.68bn in Saturday's shortened session. Foreign interest in financials boosted late buying across the board. SEOUL, the prime exception, was dragged lower by profit-taking and institutional selling, the composite index fin-ishing 16.85 down at 850.03. Securities houses face a government order requiring them to liquidate holdings beyond 60 per cent of their equity capital by the end of the year.</p>

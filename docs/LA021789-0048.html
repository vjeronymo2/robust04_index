			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REHNQUIST LIFTS STAY BUT SECRETS PLAN SNAGS NORTH TRIAL  </P> <P> Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist withdrew his order Thursday that had halted  the trial of Oliver L. North, freeing the trial judge to resume proceedings  against the former White House aide.  </P> <P> But U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell, preoccupied with closed-door  discussions on how to protect U.S. secrets in one key area of North's defense,  put off a decision on when to restart the trial. The jury has been selected but  not sworn in.  </P> <P> Rehnquist's action came at the request of Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, who asked  the chief justice to lift an "administrative stay" that the Justice Department  had sought last weekend because of disagreement over how classified material  would be handled in the court proceedings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Provision on Veto Power  </P> <P> Thornburgh, however, said Wednesday that he is satisfied a new plan offered by  independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh would protect Justice Department  interests by giving the attorney general veto power over what sensitive data  may be disclosed during testimony. Earlier in the week, Gesell had ruled that  Thornburgh would have no direct participation in the trial.  </P> <P> Walsh's aides contend that the revised procedure abides by Gesell's ruling. But  North's lawyers attacked the plan in court papers Thursday, charging that it  would "cripple" court proceedings by giving Thornburgh too much leeway to  interrupt the trial. Walsh denied this.  </P> <P> Gesell sidestepped the issue Thursday but scheduled more closed-door  discussions for this morning. He and lawyers for both sides will try to develop  a formula at the session for use in court to protect the identities of U.S.  allies who helped arm Nicaragua's Contras, one of Thornburgh's concerns. The  earliest the trial could resume would be next Tuesday, after the three-day  federal holiday weekend.  </P> <P> Legal sources said that Gesell believes he must resolve the so-called  "third-country" dispute or the attorney general, exercising his power under the  1980 Classified Information Procedures Act, might order all related government  documents withheld. That action could lead to dropping some of the remaining 12  felony counts against North. Last month, Thornburgh filed an affidavit that  resulted in the dismissal of key charges of conspiracy and theft because of  fear that top-secret information would have to be disclosed.  </P> <P> North's lawyers, calling the issue crucial to their case, have told Gesell they  want to tell jurors that top officials of former President Ronald Reagan's  Administration, including Reagan himself, approved solicitation of aid for the  Contras from third countries at a time when Congress had banned direct U.S.  assistance. In addition, Reagan and his top aides attempted to conceal the  operation from Congress and the public, North's lawyers have charged in court  papers.  </P> <P> Government prosecutors, on the other hand, have told Gesell that they need to  protect the names of the 13 countries in question for fear that their  disclosure would cause foreign nations to be reluctant to undertake future  covert operations with the United States. North's attorneys have asserted that  the Reagan Administration offered unspecified "CIA assistance" to those nations  in return for their cooperation.  </P> <P> The sticking point in the closed-door talks apparently is that North's lawyers  want specific details presented to jurors, including evidence that Reagan  himself ordered concealment of the third-country operation. The Justice  Department, however, wants to develop a more generalized description of this  operation to present to jurors without disclosing actual names.  </P> <P> Open congressional hearings in 1987 revealed that Saudi Arabia, Israel, South  Korea, Taiwan and Brunei were among the countries involved.  </P></p>

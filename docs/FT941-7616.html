			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Two-year house price rise forecast House prices will rise faster than general inflation over the next two years, says a report by brokers' firm UBS. In the medium term it expects prices to stagnate in real terms. The report says economic and demographic factors should 'prevent a return to an 80s-style boom' and predicts that between 1996 and 2000 house prices will rise broadly in line with general inflation, 'implying little hope of real capital gains'. The report warns that the number of first-time buyers would fall over the next five years. A cautious approach to lending by building societies and banks, the overhang of debt and fears of potential buyers that history might repeat itself would also inhibit demand. In the short term the brokers expect house prices to rise by 7 per cent this year and the same amount in 1995.</p>

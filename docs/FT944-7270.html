			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Arts: Nagasaki low on dramatic pressure - Musical If a humane message and an expertly professional score were enough to put bums on seats, Out of the Blue might keep the Shaftesbury Theatre full for a long time. I fear it is dead in the water. This is a 'musical drama' (no jokes, no light relief) about Nagasaki - or more precisely about five schematic characters, Japanese and American, who were there. It is sung all through, looks good in extremely economical sets, and takes just two hours; but it butters no parsnips. The show was 'conceived' by Shun-ichi Tokura, a leading commercial composer, and then 'developed' by its English director David Gilmore, with a libretto by Paul Sand. The year 1945 is the time of most of the story, told in flashbacks; the present day - 1970 - merely provides the occasion for telling it, and for releasing old griefs. Somehow, in the course of the conceiving, developing and writing, nobody noticed that in that form the story is fatally low on dramatic pressure. Back then, young Marshall was an American prisoner of war, roughed up by the officer Hayashi (whose parents had died in the Tokyo bombings), but kindly treated by Dr Akizuki and protected by Hayashi's sister Hideko. After the Nagasaki horror and the Allied victory, he married Hideko; but soon radiation sickness carried her off, and while he was visiting home a letter from Hayashi told him (falsely) that their baby had succumbed to it too. Now, he has taken Holy Orders in America and never returned. Dr Akizuki, on a lecture tour for Peace, runs into Father Marshall and persuades him to revisit. Meanwhile the flashbacks keep filling us in on 1945. The only 'now' suspense lies in how Marshall will face his long-lost daughter Hana, and the revelation of Hayashi's lie soon smoothes that. By way of a late kick-start, we get another revelation: Marshall served seven years in prison for a certain mercy-killing (though the Church seems not to have minded). Ah so, that was why Hayashi was so cross] - but the drama evaporates at once amid general reconciliation. Except for the deceased Hideko and the ageless Doctor, each character is played by two actors, younger and older. The only Oriental in the cast is baby Hana (non-singing), who grows up to be the coffee-coloured Paulette Ivory (pleasantly poignant). The 'Japanese' men do, however, wear their hair black and combed back. Like Michael McCarthy's Doctor, both the Marshalls boast fine musical-comedy voices; if James Graeme offers little more than stateliness-under-stress, Greg Ellis makes something strong and affecting of his younger self. The Hayashis, David Burt and Simon Burke, fulminate nicely, and Meredith Braun's Hideko warbles sweetly from her hospital bed. The composer has assimilated the techniques of current American musicals with quick intelligence. If the often Sondheim-ish score tends toward blandness - too many of the songs are about vague, wistful feelings - it does not lack variety; there is, however, more genuine Japanese music in The Mikado. (Here Bernstein, Mussorgsky and even Faure peep through.) Paul Sand's succinct lines rhyme and scan assiduously, and Tokura follows suit exactly. In the programme-book there is a heartfelt plea for nuclear disarmament from the Mayor of Nagasaki.</p>

			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Survey of Zambia (12): Kaunda considers a comeback - Michael Holman examines the political scene It was from Zambia's copperbelt that Frederick Chiluba launched his successful challenge for the presidency, but today it is in this mining and industrial heartland that the government is facing one of its toughest tests. Come the next general election, due to be held by 1996, will copperbelt voters stay loyal to Mr Chiluba and his Movement for a Multiparty Democracy (MMD) despite the impact of an economic reform programme which has seen formal sector jobs cut by anything from a third to a half? Or will they accept that there was no alternative, see light at the end of the tunnel, and give Mr Chiluba a second five-year term in office? Much will rest on the reaction of the country's labour aristocracy, the 50,000 workers on the copper mines. The government is set to privatise the state-owned Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), an exercise which is likely to see the existing work force cut by at least 10,000 - possibly twice that. It was during in the late 1970s that Mr Chiluba emerged as a potential challenger to founding president Kenneth Kaunda, drawing on two overlapping constituencies. As leader of the Zambia Congress of Trade Unions, he indirectly represented the workers on the copper mines, the sector responsible for more than 90 per cent of export earnings. But the copperbelt is also the stronghold of the Bemba people, one of Zambia's largest tribes. It was Mr Simon Kapwepwe, once Mr Kaunda's deputy, who was to lead opposition to the one-party regime until his death in January 1980. Mr Chiluba, himself a Bemba, assumed Mr Kapwepwe's mantle when he and a handful of businessmen and politicians founded the MMD in April 1990, a coalition which transcended ethnic divisions and embraced leaders from north and south. The coalition soon broke the one-party rule of Mr Kaunda's United National Independence Party (Unip), and won a sweeping victory in the October 1991 general election, Zambia's first multi-party poll for more than two decades. The MMD captured 125 seats in the national assembly, with Unip winning the remaining 25. Three years later, the coalition is severely strained. The south is increasingly associated with the opposition while the MMD's standing has been undermined by a spate of resignations and dismissals. Several of the ministers have fallen victim to allegations of corruption, and of drug trafficking sedatives for the lucrative South African market. This sleaze factor apart, the MMD is also paying the price of imposing long overdue, but painful, economic reforms. The impact on the copperbelt, which in theory should be the party's stronghold, has already been severe. The formal sector workforce has been cut by at least a third as some companies have gone to the wall, and the biggest have reduced their payroll by as much as a half. The toughest cut is yet to come, as ZCCM prepares for privatisation. The mining union and the company have reached agreement which will see the mines' workforce reduced by 10,000 by mid-1996. This may not be enough, however. Industry experts believe the new owner or owners of the privatised mining group will make further cuts. Mr Chiluba has vigorously defended the programme, reminding Zambians that the MMD came to power on a platform of economic as well as political reform. Painful as the economic reforms have been, the most serious damage to the government's reputation has come from the infighting within the administration, and the poor performance of many of the cabinet and senior government officials. Two cabinet ministers resigned in the first nine months, and the ministers of agriculture, finance, mines and education were dismissed in April 1993. Next to follow were the Vernon Mwaanga, foreign minister, Nakatindi Wina, community affairs minister, and Sikota Wina, parliamentary deputy speaker, who resigned in the wake of allegations involving drug trafficking. Last July, vice-president Levy Mwanawasa and Ludwig Sondashi, legal affairs minister, also resigned, bringing the tally of ministers who have resigned or been dismissed to 13. Few of those that remain in office have the confidence of the donor community. On the face of it, the strongest challenge comes from the National Party, which earlier this year elected Mr Baldwin Nkumbula, 35, son of the late Harry Nkumbula, leader of the now defunct African National Congress, as its president. Mr Nkumbula has been striking a populist note, urging that the mines be kept in state hands. Opposition also comes from another, unexpected source, however. The tribulations since 1991 have done what might once have been thought impossible: created a climate of opinion which has allowed Mr Kaunda to seek to revive the fortunes of Unip. The party had seemed irredeemably discredited by its autocratic style and its economic mismanagement during 27 years in power, although it may yet rise from the ashes. Today, Unip is led by Mr Kebby Musokotwane, a former finance minister, but Mr Kaunda, now 70, does not rule out a return to the presidency. Few Zambians rate his chances very high. Yet it is a measure of the country's mood that its former president is sufficiently encouraged by the public response to his meetings around the country to consider attempting a comeback.</p>

			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / International Company News: Philips sells bulk of its test unit PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, is selling the bulk of its test and measuring equipment business to John Fluke, the US electronic testing company, in exchange for cash and an unspecified number of additional shares. Philips holds a 7.5 per cent stake in Fluke, based in Everett, Washington. The two companies have a product development and marketing alliance under which each has sold the other's test and measuring equipment (T&amp;M) in their home markets since 1978. 'It has become apparent to both companies that a unified management structure, aligned under a single mission, would accelerate our growth and success,' said Mr Bill Parzibok, Fluke's chief executive. With the deal, Fluke will return to the European theatre after its five-year hiatus with a full sales, production and service operation. The Philips units will add some Dollars 125m to Fluke's annual sales of roughly Dollars 240m, making it the third largest player in the world market after Hewlett Packard and Tektronix. Philips will retain T&amp;M operations in Belgium (power supplies), Denmark (professional TV testing units) and Sweden (timers and counters). It refused to quantify the annual sales of these units but said 550 of its existing T&amp;M employees would remain after the transfer to Fluke. Philips declined to put a firm price on the transaction or reveal the exact number of additional Fluke shares it would take. It insisted the deal was contingent on due diligence and shareholders' approval but said it would remain a minority shareholder. Both companies expect the deal to be finalised by November.</p>

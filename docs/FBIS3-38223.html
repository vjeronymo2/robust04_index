After a one and  one-half hour talk with Chancellor Vranitzky, Ciampi said on  Monday [31 January] that Italy has always supported Austria's EU  membership.    Ciampi stressed Italy's interest in intensifying the  struggle  against international crime and came out in favor of ever closer  cooperation with Austria in this area. He particularly stressed  the problem of money laundering.    Vranitzky said that, before borders are abolished within the  European Union, it must be ensured that the combating of  international crime will continue. He added that the Austrian  National Bank is already checking the influx of money from  abroad and this has proved its worth so far. Vranitzky told the  Austria Press Agency APA that more far-reaching steps, such as  the abolition of the anonymity of savings accounts, are not  under discussion.    After the talk with Ciampi, Vranitzky stated that membership  negotiations with the European Union must be concluded  completely by the end of February and individual items must not  be removed and negotiated at a later date. At a press  conference with Ciampi, he affirmed Austria's full commitment to  the European Union's Maastricht Treaties. In the Italian  delegation it was stressed that Ciampi had emphasized to  Vranitzky that there will "not be any exceptions" for new EU  members. A second Denmark is out of the question for Italy.    Ciampi and Vranitzky also discussed south Tirol's protests  against the new Italian election law, which excludes the South  Tirolean People's Party from the distribution of a quarter of  the parliamentary seats because of a 4-percent clause.  Vranitzky said that Ciampi proved to be "greatly flexibile" on  this question, and he assumes that the problem will be solved  after the forthcoming parliamentary elections.    The war in the former Yugoslavia also received broad space  in  the talks with Vranitzky.    After the meeting with Vranitzky, Ciampi was received by  President Thomas Klestil and then went to Parliament, where he  was welcomed by Nationalrat President Heinz Fischer. After a  lunch with Vranitzky, Ciampi returned to Rome by plane in the  afternoon.</p>

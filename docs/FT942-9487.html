			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / International Press Review: A death to prompt French regrets  -British Politics It is very rare for the death of a politician to be commemorated in an editorial on the prestigious front page of Le Monde, the bastion of the French political press: all the rarer if the deceased was foreign, not French, and in opposition. Yet Le Monde's leader writers decided that John Smith merited such a tribute and summed up their conclusions about the consequences of his sudden death in the headline - 'British Disarray'. Mr Smith himself was described in a separate story in the flowery style characteristic of French journalism as 'a devout presbyterian and opera lover. . . his sober appearance and heavy physique, hiding a surprising intellectual agility'. Le Figaro, the conservative daily, devoted nearly a page to 'John Smith: Convincing and Competent'. It also alluded to the more raffish side of the former Labour leader by noting, approvingly, that it was he who had ordered a bottle of champagne on the night before he died at the end of a meeting on the European elections with Mr Michel Rocard, the French socialist leader. Liberation, the left-liberal daily, also made reference to the champagne interlude. It quoted a Rocard aide as describing Mr Smith as having been 'on good form, relaxed, cheerful, but also alert' on that night. Mr Rocard himself was generous in his praise when reflecting upon Mr Smith in a French radio interview. 'It was John Smith who convinced me that there could be a Europe with Britain,' he said. The Japanese media generally reported the death of Mr Smith as a significant blow not only to the Labour party but to UK politics as a whole. The TV Tokyo network said the loss of Mr Smith, whose personal popularity was seen as a significant factor behind Labour's recent favourable ratings, has left the party in a difficult position. Mainichi Shimbun, a national daily - whose headline 'Party Leader Smith Dies Suddenly' is printed above - foreshadowed the battle within the Labour party to succeed Mr Smith: 'The death of Mr Smith is likely to have an effect not only on the Labour party but on British politics as a whole. 'The Conservative party chose Mr John Major as leader, after it was led by a very strong leader, Mrs Margaret Thatcher, and is always struggling with the problem of internal dissension. Similarly, it is questionable whether the Labour party will find a leader as strong as Mr Smith and it is possible that both the Conservatives and Labour will enter a leaderless period.' The UK Press Association headline, 'John Smith's death stuns the world', may have been understandable, but it was also hyperbolic, at least as far as the US media was concerned. The main TV network Thursday evening news programmes all recorded Mr Smith's death, but relatively briefly and in the second half of their 30-minute broadcasts. The leading newspapers treated the story respectably. Both The New York Times and the Washington Post did not start their coverage on their front pages beyond putting little boxes there drawing attention to stories in their foreign news sections. The Times ran two items from its London bureau - a straightforward news story on the details of Mr Smith's death and reactions to it, plus a more analytical piece on the political consequences for the Labour and Conservative parties. The Post combined both elements in a single piece. In general, the recent twists and turns of UK politics are not followed minutely in the US media, perhaps understandably so. This stands in sharp contrast to the UK press's fascination with every minute and salacious detail of President Clinton's private life. Not one of the 46 national and regional newspapers in Germany spared any editorial space for the former leader of the Labour party on the day after his death, focusing instead on an uneventful two-day visit by President Boris Yeltsin, the affairs of the new Italian government and interest rates. The only UK event to stir interest on Friday was a few lines on 'mad cow' beef in the Schwabische Zeitung. Most papers merely recorded Smith's death, sometimes on inside pages. 'The best prime minister Labour never had,' was how the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung put it, drawing the parallel with Hugh Gaitskell's sudden death in 1963. 'While he may not have been a brilliant speaker, the Scottish lawyer radiated statesman-like authority which one often misses in his opponent, John Major.' The left-leaning Frankfurter Rundschau made most of how Smith had added colour to the party: 'He infused the party with his own quiet self-confidence; his humour, his advocate's intellect and strict morality presented Labour with an attractive advertisement for the 90s.'

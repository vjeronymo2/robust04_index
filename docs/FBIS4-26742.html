			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Views on Economic Life" column article by staff reporter </F> Pi Shuyi (4122 2885 5030): "How To View the Joint Ventures  Launched by State-Owned Enterprises and Overseas Firms"]    [Text] There are two forms of joint ventures launched by  state-owned enterprises and overseas companies. First, the  state-owned enterprise provides part of its assets to establish  a new enterprise with the overseas investor, and the state-owned  enterprise -- being one partner of the joint venture --  continues to exist. Most joint ventures launched by state-owned  enterprises and overseas investors have adopted this form.  Second, the state-owned enterprise contributes the whole of its  assets to form a joint venture with overseas investment, and the  original state-owned enterprise does not exist independently  after being merged into the joint venture. Not many  Chinese-foreign joint ventures have adopted this second form yet.    Using external capital is a major measure for accelerating  the process of modernization in our country, and further  increasing the use of external capital is also an invariable  policy laid down by our government. The joint ventures launched  by state-owned enterprises and overseas investors will promote  the reform and development of our state-owned enterprises. In  general, joint ventures are set up according to the modern  enterprise system, and they will provide useful experience for  the reform of the state-owned enterprises. Some state-owned  enterprises are facing "two systems," and directly feel the  competition pressure from the joint ventures so that they have  accelerated the transformation of the management mechanism. The  use of foreign capital also will play a role in prompting  state-owned enterprises to make technological progress, enhance  the management level, and upgrade products. Therefore, it is  necessary to continue to support the joint ventures launched by  state-owned enterprises and overseas investors.    At present, using external capital to accelerate development  has become the consensus of all the people, and state-owned  enterprises in all localities have great enthusiasm for  launching joint ventures. Some localities even proposed that  foreign investment be grafted onto all state-owned enterprises,  thus turning them into joint ventures, and some localities  offered excessive favors to the joint ventures in order to  achieve quick results, and the loose management over the joint  ventures led to the loss of state assets. In the course of using  external capital, should all state-owned enterprises be turned  into joint ventures? How should we prevent the loss of state  assets? We need to understand these questions correctly and  approach them seriously.    Continuing to expand the use of external capital and to  support the joint ventures launched by state-owned enterprises  and overseas investors does not mean that everything has to be  based on a joint venture. Still less does this mean that all  state-owned enterprises have to be turned into joint ventures.  The market economy we are pursuing is a socialist market  economy, which will continue to maintain the predominant  position of socialist public ownership. Of course, this does  not mean that state-owned enterprises will monopolize all trades  in all localities without discrimination. Rather, this means  primarily that the public assets will account for a predominant  proportion in gross social assets and that the state-owned  economy will control the lifeline of the national economy and  play a leading role in economic development. This is explicitly  expounded by the decision adopted by the Third Plenary Session  of the 14th CPC Central Committee. We should try to use as much  foreign capital as possible, but it is unnecessary and also  impossible for us to turn all state-owned enterprises into joint  ventures. We should continue to expand the scope of foreign  investment, but this does not mean that we will completely open  all sectors of the economy -- especially the lifeline of the  national economy -- to foreign investment. Some industries may  be completely opened to foreign investment, some industries may  be opened with certain limits, and some industries may not be  opened at all. Some localities and enterprises are anxious to  seek external investment and set up joint ventures because they  think that they may spend money to "buy a good mechanism." In  fact, launching joint ventures is not the only way to invigorate  state-owned enterprises. As long as we quicken the reform of  the state-owned enterprises, establish a modern enterprise  system, and further transform their operational mechanisms,  state-owned enterprises certainly will increase their vigor and  dynamism, and will play a great role in economic development,  especially in the lifeline scope of the national economy.    The joint investment made by state-owned enterprises and  overseas companies should be made positively and also prudently.  Attention should be paid to preventing the loss of state  assets. It should be made clear that the joint investment  itself does not mean the loss of state assets. No matter  whether the state-owned enterprises provide part or all of their  assets for the joint ventures, being shareholders, they will  continue to earn dividends. The development of the joint  venture also will increase state assets. Even if the original  state-owned enterprises are merged into the joint ventures in  the form of auctions, the state assets involved will simply  change from materials into monetary value and the quantity of  state assets will not decrease. The Chinese side may have  monetary income through the auctions and may make reinvestment  in other enterprises. We must pay attention to preventing any  loss of state assets in the process of launching joint ventures.  Some localities gave excessive favors to external investors in  violation of the state policies, as they were anxious to set up  more joint ventures. They sold land at low prices, offered  repeated tax exemptions and reductions, and failed to evaluate  or underestimated the value of the Chinese side's assets. On  the other hand, some external investors overestimated the value  of the equipment they invested or took equipment of poor quality  as advanced equipment, thus encroaching on the Chinese side's  assets. Such things must not be allowed to happen. It is  necessary to more effectively manage the work of inviting  external investment, to establish perfect regulations, and to  enhance the quality of investment invitation work. Equality and  mutual benefit is a basic principle in our use of foreign  capital. The legitimate rights and interests of external  businessmen should be protected; the legitimate rights and  interests of the Chinese side must not be harmed either.</p>

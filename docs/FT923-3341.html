			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / National Savings receipts fall NATIONAL Savings receipts last month fell to only Pounds 126m compared with more than Pounds 481m in August, the Department for National Savings reported yesterday. It explained that the drop was attrributable partly to the withdrawal from sale of some products including fixed-interest certificates for three weeks. The July figure was inflated by funds attracted to the First Option bond.</p>

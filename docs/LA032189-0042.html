			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A federal judge, turning aside a plea for "desperate measures" against  drug-related violence, temporarily barred Washington from enforcing a curfew  aimed at keeping most teen-agers away from open-air drug markets late at night.  U.S. District Judge Charles B. Richey, in issuing a 10-day temporary  restraining order at the request of the American Civil Liberties Union, ruled  that the overnight curfew law could unfairly penalize thousands of youths and  result in "permanent and irreparable injury" to those detained unfairly. The  District of Columbia Council's emergency law would have banned youths under the  age of 18 from gathering on city streets after 11 p.m. Sunday through Thursday  and after midnight Friday and Saturday. The curfew would have ended at 6 a.m.  daily.  </P></p>

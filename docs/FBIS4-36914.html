Information obtained by AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT says that Colonel  Muhammad Salih al-Ahmar, half brother of the Yemeni president  and commander of the Air Force and Air Defense, was behind the  official invitation sent to the five Russian engineers, as  mentioned in the original version of the invitation document  sent by the General Staff in Sanaa.    Sources say that Yemeni Embassy officials in Moscow pointed  out to the Russian experts that there was no means of transport  to Sanaa as a result of the fighting, but the experts surprised  Yemeni diplomats by saying they would go to Sanaa by a special  plane -- which confirms the existence of direct contacts between  Sanaa and the Russian experts without the Yemeni Embassy's  knowledge. The sources add that northern military [officials]  visit Tashkent to purchase various types of weapons, especially  fighter aircraft.</p>

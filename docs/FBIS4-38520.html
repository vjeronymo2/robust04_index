			<p>BFN     [Text] Simferopol, May 30 (RIA)--"The hope now appears for  peaceful and smooth solution of the Crimean issue", Lieutenant-  General Valeriy Malikov, first deputy chairman of the Ukrainian  Security Service, told the RIA correspondent. For nearly one  month Malikov has been staying on the peninsula. His hopes lie  with the visits to the Crimea coming this week by chairmen of  the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet and the Ukrainian side of the joint  group of the Ukrainian and Crimean Supreme Soviets for settling  the conflict.    Malikov added that at his recent meetings with Ukrainian and  Crimean politicians he witnessed their desire to resolve  problems in the negotiating process in a civilised way. When  the desire to reach agreement becomes more insistent with every  day, extraordinary turn for the worse can hardly be expected.    As to the Security Service in the Crimea, which is under  Kiev's jurisdiction unlike the forces of the Interior, the  service will act in keeping with the Ukrainian Constitution as  long as the present legality exists. If another decision is  taken following the negotiations, the Security Service will  obey, he said.</p>

			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / International Company News: Den norske Bank cuts loss by 50% to NKr3.1bn DEN NORSKE BANK, Norway's biggest bank, yesterday announced a reduction in net losses of almost 50 per cent to NKr3.07bn (Dollars 450.2m) from NKr6bn a year earlier, and warned of heavy job cuts later this year. Mr Ole Lund, DnB's chairman, said that although losses had been cut he considered the bank's result unsatisfactory. DnB's improved operational performance was helped by substantial foreign exchange gains which doubled to NKr1.03bn last year from NKr551m in 1991. However, net interest income fell to NKr4.675bn from NKr4.810bn. Group operating income increased to NKr2.69bn from NKr2.1bn while credit losses fell to NKr4.85bn from NKr6.780bn. DnB was forced to charge 1992 accounts with a NKr815m loss on assets compared with a charge of NKr631m in 1991. The bank explained the write-off was mainly due to loss provisions for Scandinavian Banking Partners, a consortium in which it participates with Sweden's Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken and Union Bank of Finland. The group reduced net operating losses to NKr3.058bn from NKr5.842bn in 1991. DnB said that non-performing loans had increased to NKr11.36bn from NKr10.2bn during the course of 1992, and that by the end of the year it had repossessed property valued at NKr2.74bn and spent nearly NKr2bn on finance and operations costs for non-performing assets. 'Although loan loss provisions are on the way down, the road to recovery is still long for the Norwegian corporate customer sector,' said Mr Finn Hvistendahl, chief executive. According to a survey undertaken for the bank, an estimated 41.3 per cent of Norway's 88,199 companies, or some 36,400, suffered an operating loss or broke even in 1992. An estimated 17.4 per cent operate with zero or negative equity capital, the survey revealed. DnB's figures were weakened significantly by the UK operations, which increased net losses more than three-fold to NKr785m from NKr207m as credit losses nearly doubled to NKr617m from NKr325m. DnB said its shipping business operated at about break-even in 1992, but credit losses by the sector rose sharply to NKr392m from NKr179m in 1991. Prior to last year, the bank's shipping operations had generated annual operating income of an estimated NKr500m. Group operating expenses were reduced by NKr566m to NKr4.763bn in 1992 and assets were pared back to NKr187.9bn from NKr195.8bn in 1991.</p>

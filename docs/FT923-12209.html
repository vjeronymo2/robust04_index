			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Romania's ex-king nominated One of Romania's leading political parties has nominated Michael of Hohenzollern, the former king, as its candidate for president in elections due on September 27, Virginia Marsh writes from Bucharest. Mr Radu Campeanu, leader of the National Liberal party (NLP), said the party was nominating the former king because he was the only person capable of beating President Ion Iliescu, who is standing for a second term. A delegation would this week visit Switzerland, where ex-King Michael, 70, has lived for more than 30 years, to ask him formally to be the NLP candidate.</p>

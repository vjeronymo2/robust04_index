I cannot give  you his name right now because he is afraid for his life and  that of his close relatives living in Lithuania.    The visitor brought me Saturday's issue of the city  newspaper  KLAIPEDA (issue no. 38, 26 February). On page one the newspaper  carried a photograph of Colonel Vitaliy Yegorov, former chief of  the political department of the Baltic Fleet's coast defense  division, when he was in Klaipeda. The comment under the  headline "'Enemy of the People' Detained?" read like this: "It  has been learned from unofficial sources that Vitaliy  Leonidovich Yegorov, former chief of the political department of  a USSR division stationed in Klaipeda, was detained in Klaipeda  yesterday.    "A. Grublis, chief of the Klaipeda department of the  Lithuanian Republic's security service, stated that nothing of  the kind has happened. Nevertheless, when the newspaper had  been prepared for the press, those same unofficial but reliable  sources gave another guarantee that V.L. Yegorov had been  detained and taken to Vilnius where he will be charged with  antistate activity during the putsch in August 1991. If these  facts are confirmed an international scandal can be expected  because V.L. Yegorov is a Russian citizen who is backed by some  fairly influential politicians."    "Vitaliy Leonidovich rang me late at night and said that he  had been forced to hide because they wanted to arrest him. He  asked me to go right to the president to request protection for  a Russian officer and citizen," my visitor told me.    Colonel Vitaliy Yegorov has served a number of years in the  coast defense division and I have often had occasion to meet  with in the course of my work.    Criminal proceedings were instituted against him and Major  General Ivan Chernykh, former division commander, two years ago  after the events of August 1991. In April 1992, division  commander Ivan Chernykh was unlawfully arrested by the  Lithuanian prosecutor's office but was released that same day  after firm actions by the Russian military and diplomats. I  took part in the talks and the newspaper gave a detailed account  of this unlawful act by the Lithuanian authorities. Now, three  years later, Col Vitaliy Yegorov, another Russian serviceman,  has been declared an "enemy of the people" in Klaipeda.    Of course, this comment in the Klaipeda city newspaper might  have passed unnoticed. But the point is that it appeared right  after the parliamentary address by Russian President Boris  Yeltsin in which it was stated that Russia has in its possession  a great many facts proving that our fellow countrymen are being  subjected to discrimination in neighboring states. And it is  Russia's duty not just to talk about ending such practices but  to do something about it. This publication also appeared after  the State Duma adopted the decree on the amnesty which applied  among others to the participants in the events of August 1991...    Clearly someone had good reason for creating this fuss over  the Russian President's statement and the State Duma's decision.  They chose for this a target which has become customary in the  Baltic region -- a citizen of the Russian Federation and a  colonel in the Russian Army. It bears a familiar hallmark...</p>

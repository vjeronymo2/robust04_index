			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] There may be a new element in the inquiry into  the attack in which the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi lost  their lives on 6 April. LE MONDE has revealed that former  Captain Barril, the former commander of the GIGN [National  Gendarmerie Intervention Unit] is reported to have the black box  from the Rwandan presidential plane. [passage omitted]    The French foreign minister is not aware of the existence of  this black box. This is what he said this evening to our  colleagues at Europe Numero 1:    [Begin Juppe recording] I do not know where the black box  is.  Like you, I read LE MONDE this evening, and I discovered this  piece of news. You pointed out that the attack in which  President Habyarimana lost his life took place on 6 April. On 7  April, that is, the following day, I ordered France's permanent  representative at the United Nations to call for an  international inquiry into the circumstances of President  Habyarimana's death. On our initiative, the Security Council  asked the UN secretary general to start an inquiry into the  attack. The French Government was at no time informed of any  private initiative to start an inquiry into the circumstances of  this tragedy, nor, of course, was it informed about the results  of such an inquiry. [end recording]    To round off the story about this black box, it must be  pointed out that the company which used to carry out the  maintenance of the Rwandan president's plane have said that they  never saw any black box on that plane in the course of yearly  service.</p>

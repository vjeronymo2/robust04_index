			<p>BFN     [Text] The meeting on national defense work and the  consolidation and building of the armed forces for the first  half of this year, held under the chairmanship of Comrade  Lieutenant General Choummali Sai-gnason, Political Bureau member  of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party Central Committee and  national defense minister, has concluded with glorious success  after five days of energetic work.    In his address reviewing the meeting's success, Comrade Lt.  Gen. Choummali Sai-gnason hailed the high sense of  responsibility displayed by all delegates in attendance. They  diligently contributed views to the meeting's draft report  reviewing national defense work in the first six months of this  year as well as work orientations for the consolidation and  building of the armed forces in the second half of the year.    The delegates unanimously assessed that despite numerous  difficulties in the first half of 1994, our armed forces --  together with the multiethnic Lao people -- have managed to  thwart every sinister scheme employed by bad elements, thereby  keeping the situation basically peaceful throughout the country.  Moreover, consolidation of the organizational, political, and  ideological aspects of all Army units has also made firm  progress. Firm economic foundations have been laid to improve  the living conditions of all soldiers.    Despite these strong points, our armed forces are still  encountering certain obstacles. Political training is still  failing to catch up with political organization and practical  deeds. The translation of the party's policies into reality has  not yet been fully realized. A considerable number of cadres  and party members have failed to set up model patterns and  practical organizational methods to lead armed units in  efficiently performing their work. Negativism still prevails  among our cadres and combatants.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with PLO Executive Committee Member Mahmud 'Abbas </F> (Abu-Mazin), by Muhammad 'Ali al-Qulaybi in Tunis; date not  given]    [Excerpts] [Al-Qulaybi] What is your answer to the  opposition's criticism of the Oslo agreement?    ['Abbas] We will not answer those who copy the ideas of  others, speak for others, or express the wishes of "certain  parties concerned," nor will we pay any attention to those who  do not read things and would not understand if they did read  them, and if they did understand, they would only understand  what agrees with their preconceived positions and decisions.  [passage omitted]    [Al-Qulaybi] The agreement only applies to the West Bank and  Gaza and covers only one third of the Palestinian people. It  speaks briefly and in a very few words about the need to solve  the problem of the refugees.    ['Abbas] The international terms of reference on which the  Madrid, Washington, and Oslo negotiations were based are  Resolutions 242 and 338. In 1988 the [Palestine] National  Council [PNC] accepted commitment to these terms of reference as  the basis. The Fes summit conference also committed itself to  the international terms of reference and right of all states in  the region to live in peace within secure borders. These two  resolutions are what the negotiators uphold.    One article in Resolution 242 speaks of "a just solution to  the refugee problem." In the past the Israelis tried to  interpret the word "refugees" as covering the Jews who came from  the Arab states to Israel. Its aim was to keep the resolution  -- which actually was about the Palestinian refugees -- fluid.    The U.S. letter of assurances said that the refugee problem  could be discussed in the multilateral as well as bilateral  negotiations. That is why we raised it in the three  multilateral rounds of negotiations in Ottawa, Oslo, and Tunis.  [passage omitted]    So the refugee problem was discussed most extensively in the  multilateral negotiations. As regards bilateral negotiations,  since Resolution 242 was unequivocally and without any ambiguity  confirmed as the term of reference and as it was confirmed that  the refugee problem would be one of the main issues to be  discussed in the final stage, which would be no later than two  years after ratification of the agreement, that meant that the  words covering that issue in the agreement, though few, were  clear. [passage omitted]    [Al-Qulaybi] The agreement seeks an end to the intifadah and  could lead to inter-Palestinian conflict.    ['Abbas] The intifadah broke out against the Israeli  military occupation and escalated whenever Israeli repression,  persecution, imprisonment, deportations, and curfews  intensified. [passage omitted]    The intifadah got material, moral, and political support  from  abroad. It was possible to supply it with the means necessary  for its continuation, through the PLO at the official level and  the Palestinian masses who lived in the Gulf states. It also  earned the sympathy of parties, peoples, and states throughout  the world. [passage omitted]    The Gulf war, however, deprived the intifadah of all these  resources, as 400,000 Palestinians who could support 1.5 million  Palestinians inside and outside the occupied territory left  Kuwait. As a result, we have a million Palestinians living  below the poverty line. The PLO's resources ran out and it  stopped its subsidies to the various institutions, societies,  and individuals including the families of the martyrs, the  wounded, and the detainees. The international community, angry  at our position during the Gulf war, turned its back on us. So  the intifadah stood alone in the battlefield.    Anyone who asks about the question of ending the intifadah  or the need for its continuation should think first and foremost  about securing the factors that would ensure its continuation  and about the people who are suffering from the occupation and  poverty at the same time, and should ask himself, why did the  masses come out in the streets to express happiness and rejoice  at the agreement? Has it occurred to those calling for the  continuation of the intifadah what it means to go six years  without schools, universities, or work?    The intifadah broke out against the occupation. If there is  a glimmer of hope that the occupation will end, why should the  people not turn to starting a new phase in their life to build  their future and the future of their children and of future  generations? The intifadah was not an end in itself. [passage  omitted]    [Al-Qulaybi] The signing of the agreement was a recognition  of Israel with no commitment to the creation of an independent  Palestinian entity. In fact, it will lead to a feeble,  subservient entity lacking in sovereignty. Perhaps the  Gaza-Jericho option is in essence the end of the road.    ['Abbas] On the question of recognizing Israel's legitimacy,  I would like to say so much about this matter but there is no  room for that here now, so I will try to be as brief as possible.    First of all, the recognition of Israel occurred at the 1988  19th session of the PNC, the highest Palestinian legislative  authority. Therefore, the Oslo agreement represented nothing  more than the start of practical implementation of that program,  which was the culmination of many years of dialogue and many  years of Palestinian struggle and many years of history and wars  in the region and international conflicts linked to the region.  [passage omitted]    The Arab world accepted the legitimacy of Israel's existence  when it accepted Resolution 242 reinforced by Resolution 338,  which gave Israel the right to exist within secure and  recognized borders. Then came the Camp David agreement to  create some kind of diplomatic relations between the biggest  Arab state and Israel.    Then came the 1982 Fes summit resolution embracing a plan  which provided for the recognition of Israel's right to exist.  That summit gave Israel's existence full legitimacy in the name  of the entire Arab nation.    Furthermore, the Arab states' acceptance of President Bush's  1991 initiative and the initiation of their negotiations with  Israel at bilateral and multilateral levels, involving 16  states, confirmed that legitimacy before any Arab party  concluded any agreement or treaty. Then there was the  Jordanian-Israeli agreement on the agenda or declaration of  principles and that was followed by the Palestinian-Israeli  agreement. [passage omitted]    We do not claim that we signed an agreement of principles  creating an independent Palestinian state, and there is no  article that clearly says so. We must admit that we agreed on  interim autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza. In principle, the  so-called Gaza-Jericho option does not mean that the Palestinian  authority will be confined to that, because such an  interpretation of the Declaration of Principles would be a  considerable distortion of the truth and would indicate some  political myopia. If we examine the agreement we would see that  Article 4, for instance, stipulates that the two sides consider  the West Bank and the Gaza Strip to be a single territorial unit  whose unity and security should be maintained throughout the  transitional period. [passage omitted]    When discussing the issue of sovereignty we should take into  consideration the nature of the negotiations and the  Palestinian-Israeli conflict. It is a unique conflict and  sovereignty has a special meaning. The sovereignty being  discussed is a relative sovereignty of a special nature linked  not so much to the principle of national rights of sovereignty  as to the creation of a national entity that was not there  before. The mechanism for the implementation of the agreement  will lead to the progressive emergence and crystallization of  the elements of sovereignty until they are fully achieved.  [passage omitted]    The geographical jurisdiction of the Palestinian authority  is  clear and includes these occupied territories. The fact that  Israel is trying to keep some territory is a matter of conflict.  The texts are in our favor, and we have the two states which  sponsored the agreement and the possibility of arbitration and  so on, but we will not forfeit one inch of it.    [Al-Qulaybi] The agreement does not fulfill the Palestinian  people's legitimate rights which were upheld by the  international community. These rights have been the subject of  bargaining in bilateral negotiations away from the UN authority  and resolutions. The mutual recognition is neither complete,  balanced, or just.    ['Abbas] Perhaps the detailed meaning of the legitimate  political rights was left to the negotiations, but that phrase  did appear in more than one place. The introduction spoke of  the "recognition of the two peoples' political and legitimate  rights." The third paragraph of Article 3 of the Declaration of  Principles agreement stipulates that "the elections will be an  important preparatory transitional step toward the fulfillment  of the Palestinian people's legitimate rights and just demands."    As we are talking about a declaration of principles and not  a  detailed agreement, we believe that this issue was given due  attention particularly as the agreement is fundamentally based  on international legitimacy and its fulfillment. [passage  omitted]    The fear of Israeli domination of the Arab economy that some  people are talking about actually reflects a disgraceful sense  of failure or inferiority on the part of the people who talk  like that.    The Arabs have been talking about an Arab common market  since  the early sixties, about the same time Europe started talking  about a European common market. Why has Europe now achieved  economic union while the idea of an Arab common market remains  just an idea in some people's minds? And finally, why is it  that the volume of trade among 22 Arab states does not exceed 4  percent of these states' trade with the outside world? [passage  omitted]    [Al-Qulaybi] Israel supports a confederation with Jordan,  not an independent state, because an independent state would  prevent the annexation of some West Bank and Gaza territory,  would prevent control of the water resources, and would not  accept the annexation of Jerusalem.    ['Abbas] Israel seeks to annex parts of the West Bank and  the Gaza Strip and will try to control the water resources and  maintain its annexation of Jerusalem regardless of whether the  solution is going to be an independent or confederal state, but  we must clarify a point which many people seem to find  ambiguous, namely the word confederation. In international law  there is only one definition of confederation. It is that "a  confederation is a contractual agreement between two or more  independent entities." This means that confederation and the  independent state are not mutually exclusive. A confederation  emanates from independent states. There is no other way. That  is why we should not link Israel's wishes of annexation and  control to the option that will ultimately materialize, namely  confederation. Whatever the option, it is our duty to struggle  until Resolution 242 is fully implemented so that there is full  withdrawal from all the territories occupied in 1967 and so that  the Palestinian entity is in control of all its resources,  including water.    [Al-Qulaybi] There are risks in postponing the discussion of  Jerusalem, the settlements, sovereignty, the borders, and the  refugees to the final phase, that is five years.    ['Abbas] It was clear from the beginning that a number of  issues would be postponed until the final phase which was  supposed to begin with or during the third year. That explains  why representatives of Jerusalem and the diaspora were excluded  from the Madrid and Washington negotiations. It was also clear  that the first phase would be that of interim Palestinian  autonomy and that there would be no room in it for discussion of  sovereignty and independence, which would come after the  implementation of the first phase.    However, to eliminate some confusion from people's minds we  say that the transitional period will not exceed five years  (Article 1 of the agreement). In other words it could be a  little less, or much less than that. [passage omitted]    It is known that Jerusalem was annexed to Israel by a  Knesset  decision but the mere fact that it was put on the agenda for the  final phase means, from the Israeli point of view, that it is a  disputed issue and that the annexation decision was void. We  must realize, however, that these matters require great efforts  and much time to resolve. We need to struggle and be patient.  There are risks. There have been no agreements in history  without risks.    [Al-Qulaybi] The real significance of the Oslo agreement is  that Israel wants the PLO to play the part of the Village  Leagues in return for big financial promises and greater  influence in return for some oral concession made deliberately  ambiguous to obstruct the negotiations. There is a belief that  the system of government in the occupied territory would neither  be democratic nor elected and that [the government] would be  appointed by the PLO because Israel does not want democracy  there.    ['Abbas] If we want to talk about abstract Israeli wishes  in isolation from the objective circumstances then all that is  being said is true because, to begin with, Israel was founded on  Herzl's theory: "A land without people for people without a  land." [passage omitted]    I have cited all these historical and real points to say  that  if the matter was left to Israel it would not have recognized  anything and would not have accepted any solution. At one stage  of the Palestinian national struggle it created the Village  Leagues and then abandoned them when they failed to justify  their existence and after they were rejected by the people. It  is not right to draw a parallel between that and the Oslo  agreement which speaks of the Palestinian people's legitimate  political rights, withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, complete  transfer of power with the exception of external security,  executive, legislative, and judicial powers, general elections,  and other things.    Why should we assume that the regime in the West Bank and  the  Gaza Strip would not be democratic and that [the government]  would not be elected but appointed by the PLO? And if Israel  wanted it to be that way, why should the PLO accept that, when  it has been insisting on the principle of elections, on which  there was an appendix? And even if, hypothetically, the PLO  accepted that, who could force the people to accept it?  [passage omitted]</p>

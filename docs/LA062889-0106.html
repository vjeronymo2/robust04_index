			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: INS SETS UP HOT LINE FOR CHINESE IN U.S.  </P> <P> Saying they wanted Chinese students in this country "to know that we support  the democracy these young people are protesting for," federal immigration  officials in Los Angeles announced Tuesday that a toll-free hot line will begin  operating today to aid Chinese nationals who want to remain in the United  States.  </P> <P> "We suggest that they come forward to us if they have any questions or want to  change their status," said Harold Ezell, the U.S. Immigration and  Naturalization Service's western regional commissioner. "But if they don't,  they will not be sent home."  </P> <P> Operators fluent in Mandarin and Cantonese will man the hot line, which can be  reached by dialing (800) 448-4994. Ezell estimated that 30,000 of the 80,000  Chinese who are in the country on a temporary immigration status live in the  Los Angeles area.  </P> <P> Guidelines recently issued by U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh allow Chinese  students or visitors who entered the country before June 6 to remain until June  5, 1990. Those who wish to apply for permanent residency can seek political  asylum, said INS Los Angeles District Director Ernest Gustafson.  </P></p>

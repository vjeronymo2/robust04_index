			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Metals slide on economy fears ALL METAL prices fell yesterday on the London Stock Exchange amid growing fears that the sluggish state of worldwide economic activity would continue for some time. There was relatively heavy selling of copper, zinc and nickel but traders said the aluminium market, where prices were already very low, was very quiet. 'There has been a bout of liquidation of metal in response to the general economic situation,' said Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group. Copper for delivery in three months fell by Pounds 25.75 to close at Pounds 1,399.50 a tonne last night and the price fell again in after-hours dealings. However, this price weakness merely represented a correction of the sharp gains in June and July, suggested Mr Wictor Bielski, analyst at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, part of the Banque Indosuez Group. He expected the copper price to rise strongly again in the final quarter of 1992, a time of seasonally strong demand. In a special report on the copper market, Mr Bielski suggested renewed economic growth in the US and Japan next year should boost copper demand by 2.5 per cent in 1993. Consequently, he looked for a supply deficit of about 200,000 tonnes in 1993 following one of 75,000 tonnes this year. This should trigger some sharp price 'spikes' through 1993.</p>

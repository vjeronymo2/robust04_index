			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Jakarta investment to fall: Domestic capital approvals may be down 30% CAPITAL investment in Indonesia is set to drop sharply for 1992 following last year's government decision to tighten money supply and in the wake of a downturn in Asian economies, a government official has warned. Mr Sanyoto Sastrowardoyo, chairman of the government's Investment Co-ordinating Board, said domestic capital investment approvals for the first six months of the year reached about Rupiah13,500bn (Pounds 3.5bn). He estimates approvals for the year will total Rupiah28,500bn, or 30 per cent below 1991. Foreign investment approvals are also likely to decrease from Dollars 8.8bn (Pounds 4.6bn) last year to Dollars 8bn, although this could be even lower if the government fails to authorise several large projects. The government is under pressure to restrict capital intensive projects to reduce its current account deficit, expected to reach Dollars 4.8bn this year. Indonesia enjoyed an investment boom between 1990-1991 when domestic approvals totalled Rupiah101,000bn and foreign approvals reached Dollars 17.5bn. Although many approved projects do not proceed, a surge in actual investment has been behind a doubling of non-oil and gas exports since 1986 to Dollars 17.5bn last year. Mr Sastrowardoyo said the economic downturn in countries such as Japan, Hong Kong and South Korea, which have been among the leading investors in Indonesia, had significantly contributed to the fall in foreign approvals. He blamed the fall in domestic investment on the government's decision last year to tighten money supply. This has resulted in bank lending rates of about 26 per cent and a sharp reduction in credit growth. 'We hope the reduction in investment will be only temporary, because the government has started to ease its tight monetary policy,' Mr Sastrowardoyo said. International donors signalled their confidence in the economy last week and pledged Dollars 4.94bn in aid for the current financial year ending next March, up from Dollars 4.75bn last year. Japan remained the leading donor, pledging Dollars 1.32bn in aid and a further Dollars 500m through its export-import bank for project loans in sectors such as electric power and telecommunications.  -------------------------------------------------------           INVESTMENT APPROVALS (Dollars bn)  -------------------------------------------------------                       Domestic        Foreign 1988                    8.2             4.5 1989                   10.9             4.7 1990                   31.5             8.7 1991                   20.7             8.8 *1992                  14.0             8.0  ------------------------------------------------------- * Estimate Source: Investment Co-ordinating Board.  -------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL ADOPTS ZONE CHANGES FOR SANTA ANA ARENA  </P> <P> The proposed 20,000-seat indoor sports arena inched closer to construction  Monday with the City Council's approval of zoning changes that will allow the  arena to be built in an area once restricted to office and commercial space.  </P> <P> Several residents and a lawyer for a group calling itself Citizens Against the  Arena criticized the proposed sports facility that developers hope will be home  to a professional basketball or hockey team.  </P> <P> Attorney Peter A. Seidenberg said his clients fear that a new arena will mean  an increase in crime, along with new parking problems. He said the arena has  "the potential to decrease property values."  </P> <P> Although Seidenberg said a lawsuit against construction is possible, he said  hisclients will "exhaust all administrative efforts."  </P> <P> Sheila Gates, a homeowner near the proposed arena site, said the area is  supposed to be a center for "business excellence. Now we are going to ruin it."  </P> <P> The council's approval of the zoning amendments seemingly puts the Santa Ana  arena ahead of a similar facility proposed for Anaheim.  </P> <P> However, both cities still are negotiating with private developers to see how  much of a public subsidy will be involved and the extent to which each city  will share in the profits, if at all. The Santa Ana arena is to be privately  built, operated and owned. The Anaheim arena is to be privately built and  operated, but ultimately it would be owned by thecity.  </P> <P> In a unanimous vote, the Santa Ana council approved three amendments, including  one to the city's general plan, that would allow the arena to be built at the  Santa Fe Realty's PacifiCenter Business Park.  </P> <P> Before Monday's action, the city's general plan would not have allowed a  facility as large as the arena to be built in the area. The Planning Commission  approved the zoning amendments last week.  </P> <P> Both Santa Ana and Anaheim have approved environmental impact reports for their  arenas, but Anaheim's report has been challenged in lawsuits filed by the Los  Angeles Rams, Anaheim Stadium Associates and a neighboring mobile home park.  Pending trial on the lawsuits, construction and grading for the Anaheim arena  are prohibited by court order.  </P> <P> Unlike Anaheim, Santa Ana is moving toward the start of the construction phase  for its $75-million arena. The developer, Orange County Arena Partners, hopes  to begin construction by fall.  </P> <P> The arena would include 120 luxury suites, 1,000 preferred seats, a food court,  and a restaurant club.  </P> <P> The Santa Ana facility developers now must submit a building plan to the  Planning Commission. Once the council approves the building plan and a  financial agreement, construction can begin.  </P> <P> The arena, which would be at Edinger Avenue and Lyon Street, is scheduled for  completion by 1992.  </P></p>

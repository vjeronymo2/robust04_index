			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 17 Jun (EFE) -- Ernesto Zedillo,  Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) Mexican presidential  candidate, does not believe his criticism of Manuel Camacho  Solis was the reason for Camacho Solis' resignation as  commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas. "My  reaction parallels that of the Mexican people," Zedillo told the  Monitor radio newscast when he rejected Camacho Solis'  insinuations that Zedillo's criticisms prevented him from  continuing as peace commissioner.    On Sunday, Zedillo said the Zapatist guerrillas' rejection  of  the government's offers to solve their demands showed that the  negotiations had been a failure and not a success, as Camacho  Solis had led the Mexican people to believe.    The rebel Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) decided  to  reject the proposal the government presented between 23 February  and 3 March in the dialogue in San Cristobal de las Casas, 700  km southeast of Mexico City.    Camacho Solis resigned last night, considering that  Zedillo's  opinions were a vote of censure against his actions as peace  commissioner. After announcing his resignation, Camacho Solis  indicated he will withdraw from politics during the rest of the  Carlos Salinas de Gortari administration.    Zedillo said Camacho Solis' decision to resign was  "personal," indicating he does not know the "political  objective" of involving him because days before, Camacho Solis  had said he would soon end his role as commissioner. "It is  incomprehensible that suddenly, he turns around and does what he  said he would do, linking it to my remarks," Zedillo said.    Regarding the Chiapas insurrection, Zedillo said that in his  opinion, "the important thing at this time is to continue urging  the government of the Republic and those who are discontent in  Chiapas to spare no efforts to reach a permanent and just peace  for all sides."    According to the PRI presidential candidate, the Chiapas  conflict deserves "political and social attention." Zedillo  added: "The only way to resolve the problem is through a social  policy that will deal with the people's demands."    The Indian insurrection broke out on 1 January when the EZLN  violently seized four cities in Chiapas, in a conflict that left  more than 200 dead in 12 days of fighting prior to a cease-fire  to negotiate a political solution which, after the EZLN's  rejection, has slowed down.</p>

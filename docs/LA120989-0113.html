			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FEARS OF INSECT INVASION COME TRUE FOR NEIGHBORS  </P> <P> Laura Miyoshi had been chatting with neighbors just two nights ago about the  possibility that a Mediterranean fruit fly could make its way to their block.  </P> <P> They were worried that if a fly were found, the whole area could be infested,  putting their back yard lemon, peach and orange trees in jeopardy.  </P> <P> On Friday, Miyoshi found out her fears were warranted. County agriculture  officials announced that they had discovered a infertile female fruit fly in  Miyoshi's middle-class neighborhood, near the intersection of Garden Grove  Boulevard and Edwards Avenue.  </P> <P> The neighborhood is 10 miles south of where the only other Medfly has been  found in Orange County.  </P> <P> "I'm shocked," said Miyoshi, 29. "We were all concerned about our fruit."  </P> <P> Miyoshi's concern reflected the reactions of neighboring residents, many of  whom thought that the fly wouldn't travel as far south as Westminster. But most  were in favor of eradication efforts, including the possibility that malathion  pesticide spraying would begin in their neighborhood.  </P> <P> Agricultural officials for now haven't announced spraying for the area, opting  instead to wait and see if any more flies are found. Some residents were  resigned to accept the spraying, even if it might be a nuisance.  </P> <P> "I guess we'll have to have it," Judy Saylor, 42, said. "I'm not opposed to it.  We have to save our crops. But it's going to be a mess. We're going to have to  cover our cars and all our lawn furniture."  </P> <P> Other residents said the impact of spraying wouldn't be any different than what  they breathe every day. The first priority, they said, should be to destroy the  fly.  </P> <P> "Well, if gets rid of them, it's worth it," said Ron Riquier, 28. "Some people  say it's going to give us cancer. Hey, they say bubble gum gives you cancer."  </P> <P> But Marjorie Custer, 64, was worried about what the spraying would do to her  property.  </P> <P> "What are we going to do about our cars?" Custer said. "Good God! we'd have to  get something for our (trailer) and everything."  </P> <P> Helen Collamore, 76, said she blames people who bring in fruit from out of  state for spreading the pest.  </P> <P> "That's where they're coming from -- from out of state," she said. "Some stupid  people."  </P> <P> County agriculture officials were in the neighborhood Friday setting new traps  and checking old ones. Among them was Denis Whitfill, the county agriculture  employee who, while making a routine check in Brea last month, found a pregnant  fruit fly in a trap in a guava tree.  </P> <P> Whitfill, now working 60 hours a week, slowly drove down the street in an  orange pickup truck, looking for trees with nearly ripe fruit.  </P> <P> "I've just been checking extra carefully," he said.  </P> <P> Whitfill hung one of his triangular shaped traps on a lemon tree in Adolph  Halbjorhus' lawn. Halbjorhus was willing to cooperate.  </P> <P> "A person would almost have to cooperate if they are going to do any good,"  Halbjorhus said. "And those Medflies, I understand they can be pretty bad."  </P> <P> Unlike Halbjorhus, another resident wasn't too happy about being in Orange  County at all. William Ukasick, 21, said that he's had plans to move out of  state, and with this news, he said he was even more happy about his decision.  </P> <P> "I'm moving back to Wisconsin where we don't get this sort of thing," Ukasick  said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report on a press conference by Prime Minister </F> Carlo Azeglio Ciampi in Rome; date not given: "Ciampi: `We Need  a Constituent Assembly'"]    [Text] Rome -- "If a new constitution is to be drafted,  then we need a constituent assembly. However, this has not yet  been decided." Thus Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi  answered a question from foreign journalists on the subject of  constitutional reform, during a press conference at Palazzo  Chigi [government seat]. "To my knowledge, no specific  initiative has been taken in this direction," Ciampi added.    "In this case, we would need a constituent assembly," he  repeated, "like the one after World War II. During the  constituent phase, if I recall correctly, the government also  had legislative powers, because there was no parliament, only a  constituent assembly."    "If, however, it is only a question of amending the existing  Constitution," Ciampi further explained, "the procedures are  very clear. During the previous legislature, a bicameral  commission was formed. This could be done again or,  alternatively, we could follow the procedure laid down in the  Constitution, which provides for certain steps to be taken."    In Ciampi's view, changing the Constitution will be more  parliament's than the government's responsibility. As regards a  possible reform to introduce federalism, the prime minister  said: "It is not up to me to make proposals concerning the  contents of possible constitutional amendments. We must wait  and see whether the next government will include this type of  issue in its platform, or whether it will prefer to leave the  initiative to parliament."    Gianfranco Rotondi, PPI [Italian Popular Party] Deputy, was  also proposing to set up a constituent body. In his view, "the  only feasible way to introduce very substantial amendments to  the Constitution, such as redrafting the constitutional chart's  second part in its entirety, is to set up an ad hoc body  invested with specific constituent powers, whereas the very  scope of the reform process objectively rules out the  possibility of resorting to the constitutional reform instrument  provided for by Article 138."    "Deputy Gianfranco Rotondi's proposal," a PPI circular  explained, "posits setting up an assembly in order to tackle the  constitutional reform. According to the proposal, the election  of such a constituent assembly would be carried out on a clearly  proprortional basis, in such a way as to represent all the  political forces in the field, thus ensuring that the new forms  of state and government reflect the composition of the country's  social and political fabric as faithfully as possible."</p>

			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSPECTIVE ON CZECHOSLOVAKIA;  </P> <P> HARD PATH FOR A SILKEN REVOLUTION;  </P> <P> CIVIC FORUM'S NEW LEADER, A HARD-LINE MONETARIST, PROMISES NO SOFT LANDING --  OR EVEN A SOFT TAKEOFF.  </P> <P> Two days before I arrived here, the first, velvet phase of Czechoslovakia's  revolution came to an end. The immediate cause of this was the surprise  election on Oct. 13 of Finance Minister Vaclav Klaus to the chairmanship of  Civic Forum, by a stunning margin of more than 2 to 1.  </P> <P> Revolutions have a tendency to produce shakeouts at the top within a year or  so, usually in the form of brutal power struggles. But in Czechoslovakia,  characteristically, the shakeout is being accomplished on tiptoes, with many of  the protagonists unwilling to admit that competing tendencies have emerged  within Civic Forum, let alone that one program for Czechoslovakia's future has  won out over another.  </P> <P> Vaclav Klaus is a hard-line monetarist of considerable intellectual gifts, who  favors the same kind of headlong rush to the free market as his counterpart,  Leszek Balcerowicz, in Poland. Klaus' language is uncompromising: He promises  no soft landing, or even a soft takeoff; price and rent controls will be  removed; there will be large-scale unemployment; the International Monetary  Fund will be called in, investors invited to take advantage of cheap labor,  factories placed on the auction block.  </P> <P> Klaus' ascent may have taken Civic Forum by surprise, but it has its roots in  the silken quality of the Czechoslovak revolution. When the Communist Party  collapsed last November, there were signs that Czechoslovakia might be the one  Central European country to find that elusive dream of countries in economic  transition -- the Third Way. A relatively developed infrastructure, a prewar  legacy of democratic rule personified by Prime Minister Tomas Masaryk and the  gentle charisma of Vaclav Havel all gave grounds for hope.  </P> <P> But Czechoslovakia's revolution, if such it was, may have happened too fast. In  Poland the process took 10 years and was centered on a highly organized labor  movement. In Czechoslovakia it took only a few days of crowds braving freezing  fog on Wenceslas Square. Czechoslovakia was the last to fall; by the time its  turn came, the Wall was down. The Czechoslovak Communists, always the grayest,  the stupidest, the most bereft of imagination, were not so much ousted as made  to implode.  </P> <P> Against all the lies and hypocrisies of the old regime, Havel and his Civic  Forum colleagues stood for the power of the Word, the ability to speak truth,  to name what had been unnameable. They espoused what they called anti-politics.  "We were concerned with certain values," Havel said in Prague last week, "and  not with power." In removing the Communist Party, "we did not even need to  break a single shop window."  </P> <P> But at the risk of sounding ungenerous, this may have been the problem. The  broken shop windows may be yet to come, and Klaus' economic plan may soon  provoke them. This is a peculiarly Czechoslovakian dilemma. Klaus' victory is  not the outcome of a vulgar putsch, or an act of betrayal. Much less does it  suggest that Civic Forum's leaders are corrupt men, the latest to abide by  Montesquieu's maxim that "every person invested with power is apt to abuse it,  and to carry that power as far as it will go."  </P> <P> No, the difficulty lies in Civic Forum's very conception of power. Faced with a  totalitarian system in which all institutions were rotten, opposition to  Communist power easily slipped into queasiness about political institutions of  any sort. To exercise power, or to devise an economic plan, lay outside the  competence and interest of Civic Forum's anti-political intellectuals.  </P> <P> Move outside the charmed circle of the Prague intelligentsia -- into the drab  factory towns of northern Bohemia, for example -- and all the talk is of a year  of stagnation and drift, the same idiot nomenklatura still at their posts in  the factories and cooperative farms. And Klaus? Yes, people say, we see him on  the television. He is young and forceful, he smiles, he has a clear plan. With  him we can live like the Germans.  </P> <P> The inexorable laws of power, economics and political conflict fill many  members of Civic Forum with genuine alarm. It is common to hear them talk of  last November -- or even of the communist period -- as the happiest time of  their lives. For then there was unity against a common enemy. For Havel  himself, the rise of Klaus portends grave difficulties. The temptation, as  president, will be to place unity above all other considerations. The  alternative is to admit that anti-politics and power are, in their essence,  incompatible. And if Klaus and Havel should go their separate ways, to which of  them will we in the West show our most enduring loyalty?  </P></p>

			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Government Bonds: Bank cuts tap stock price to sell entire Pounds 800m issue THE Bank of England cut the price for the Treasury 9 per cent stock due 2008 to sell the entire Pounds 800m tranche yesterday. The tap stock has been overhanging the market for several weeks as market-makers were reluctant to pay the minimum tender price of 94 1/4 when the existing stock has been available in the market for up to 2 percentage points less. The Bank of England sold the stock at 92 1/8 (to yield 9.96 per cent) yesterday to a small number of market-makers thought to include Barclays de Zoete Wedd and SG Warburg. Some of the smaller market-makers expressed dissatisfaction at the way the sale was handled. One pointed out that the stock - which is part-paid - had traded down to the equivalent of 92 3/16 , and therefore questioned the Bank's decision to sell the entire tap at below the market price to only a few market-makers. The Bank said it took advantage of a bounce in the government bond market to offload the stock. It is now expected to press ahead with a busy funding schedule. Overall, the short end of the gilts market edged up, while the longer maturities fell during the day. The benchmark 11 3/4 gilt due 2003/07 opened at 110 9/16 but fell to 110 5/16 by late afternoon. US TREASURIES recovered their morning losses to trade modestly higher yesterday afternoon following news of respectable demand at the Treasury's 10-year note auction. Morning trading was depressed by residual worries about the Treasury's quarterly refunding auctions following unexpectedly light demand at the three-year note sale on Tuesday. But prices recovered on news that demand had held up at the Dollars 11.75bn sale of 10-year notes, which had an average yield of 8.07 per cent with no tail. In late trading, the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was up  5/32 to 1/16 , yielding 8.22 per cent, after sliding  5/32 in morning trading. Shorter-dated maturities were unchanged to  1/32 higher. The Federal Reserve did not intervene in the open market for a second consecutive day, and Fed funds, the rate at which banks lend to each other, changed hands at the 5 per cent level through most of the day. The bond market continued to focus on new supply in the absence of any economic news. Many analysts had expected Tuesday's sale of Dollars 13.5bn in three-year notes to draw the strongest demand of the series of auctions in the Treasury's Dollars 37bn quarterly refunding. Although the average yield of 7.09 per cent was in line with expectations, the bid-to-cover ratio of 2.5:1 suggested unexpectedly lacklustre demand and prompted fears about the reception of yesterday's Dollars 11.75bn auction and of the Dollars 11.75bn of 30-year bonds to be sold today. GERMAN government bond prices weakened yesterday as investors sold futures contracts to buy the latest 10-year bund issue. In the tender yesterday, the government sold DM4.39bn of the 8 3/8 per cent 10-year bund at an average price of 99.95, to yield 8.36 per cent. The government had already sold DM3bn to the bank consortium on Tuesday and has kept DM2.61bn to help with market regulation. Traders said that the new bund was being used for arbitrage purposes as it was the cheapest bond deliverable into the bund futures contract in London. The Bundesbank accepted bids for DM22.1bn at this week's tender for 35-day securities repurchases, allocating funds at a fixed rate of 8.60 per cent. This means that a net DM1.6bn is being drained from the market, which traders said suggested no change in monetary policy. The Bundesbank refused to comment on rumours that Mr Karl Otto Pohl, Bundesbank president, would resign. JAPANESE government bond prices slipped yesterday after the disappointing performance of the US Treasury market on Tuesday. Hopes of a cut in the official discount rate in Japan have faded, also contributing to weaker prices.</p>

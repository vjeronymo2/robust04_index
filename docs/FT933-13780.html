			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / The Japanese Elections: Mr Middle Japan wants change - Robert Thomson meets Tokyo voters for whom personalities come first AFTER two weeks of haranguing by passing loud-speaker vans and of quiet contemplation, Mr and Mrs Middle Japan have firmly decided on their votes for tomorrow's general election. But Tadaaki and Toshie Koizumi suspect that the trip to the polling station will be repeated, as the results will set the scene for another election within a year. Tadaaki, 48, who works as an engineer at East Japan Sugar Industries, linked to the Mitsubishi family of companies, admits that he still does not have 'much detail on the parties' policies', but wants to put fresh politicians in the Japanese parliament. Toshie, 45, a part-time assistant at the local school in Chiba, on the fringe of Tokyo, has always voted for the Japan Socialist party - or, as it is now known, the Social Democratic party. She is sad that the party appears set for a beating at this election, but it will not get her vote. 'I think their era really ended when Ms Doi was replaced as leader,' explains Toshie, referring to Ms Takako Doi, who lost the leadership two years ago after appearing ready to drag the left-wing party towards the centre and, perhaps, into government. With the SDP having wasted past opportunities, both Tadaaki and Toshie will vote for the Japan New party, formed last year by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, a popular provincial governor. 'It's funny, but I don't really know what the details of the JNP's policies are or will be, but that doesn't bother me. The important thing is to get some new politicians into the parliament and to end the old alliances,' Tadaaki says. They suspect that the election will produce an uneasy coalition government, which will be vulnerable to a no-confidence motion similar to that which brought down the Liberal Democratic party government of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa a month ago. In the time between tomorrow's election and the next poll, they expect that the JNP will be able to muster more candidates and present the LDP with tougher opposition. Tadaaki says change will come more gradually than many people expect because 'it's very difficult to get sudden change in Japan'. As for who should be the prime minister from next week, Toshie has a preference that is rather out of line with her past as a socialist supporter, but fits in with the general characteristic of personality being more important than ideology in Japanese politics. 'If I had the choice of a person, I would select Shintaro Ishihara,' she said. Mr Ishihara is a right-wing member of the LDP, who has disputed accounts of Japan's brutality in its invasion of China, and was the author of A Japan That Can Say No. In general, Mr Ishihara has a theory for every occasion and more opinions than evidence to support them. 'I like him because he has opinions. I may not agree with them all, but he has ideas. Most Japanese politicians are incoherent and weak. Mr Ishihara leaves a strong impression,' Toshie says.</p>

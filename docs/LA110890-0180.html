Baker  III had given Iraqi President Saddam Hussein an ultimatum for vacating Kuwait,  though Baker denied the reports.  </P> <P> Light, sweet crude closed $2.68 higher at $35.31 per barrel for December  delivery contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Oil had opened 28 cents  lower at $32.35 a barrel, then moved ahead by more than $3 to the day's high of  $35.45 before settling back.  </P> <P> Contracts for delivery in later months all moved higher, many by the daily  limit imposed by the exchange of $1.50 a barrel.  </P> <P> The escalating words of war on Wednesday injected new life into a crude market  that had been sluggish for more than a week.  </P></p>

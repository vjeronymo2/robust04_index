			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE VOTES TO LET IMMIGRANTS TAKE CITIZEN OATH AT INS OFFICE  </P> <P> The House voted Monday to allow immigrants to sidestep backlogged courts and be  sworn in as citizens at an Immigration and Naturalization Service office.  </P> <P> Under current law, only courts can perform the citizenship ceremony. Because of  crowded court schedules, immigrants in some cities have had to wait months or  even more than a year, according to a recent study by the National Assn. of  Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, a nonpartisan research organization.  </P> <P> "This bill is designed to help aspiring citizens attain what they have earned  and what is rightfully theirs," said Rep. Bruce A. Morrison (D-Conn.), who  sponsored the bill, which passed the House on a voice vote.  </P> <P> The measure has already been approved by the Senate, and Administration  officials said they expect President Bush to sign it.  </P> <P> "The Administration has no objections . . . " INS spokesman Duke Austin said.  "There's a feeling that it will expedite the process and eliminate waiting in  some geographical areas."  </P> <P> For permanent legal residents, who must have lived in the United States for  five years and met other INS requirements, naturalization is a two-step process  involving an INS interview and a court swearing-in ceremony.  </P> <P> An increase in naturalization applications has led to a backlog in the court  stage.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, permanent legal residents seeking citizenship may wait as long  as a year for a court date, the study showed. The longest waits are in Houston,  ranging from 11 to 18 months.  </P> <P> Under the bill, legal residents who meet all agency requirements could  immediately be sworn in as citizens at the INS office, or they could request a  court date.  </P> <P> Immigrant rights advocates hailed the change. "U.S. citizenship delayed is  democracy denied," the research group's national director, Harry Pachon, said.  "Court delays are a bureaucratic hurdle that could be eased through this  legislation."  </P></p>

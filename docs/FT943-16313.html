			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Coda share price falls 54p after Pounds 2.6m loss Shares in Coda, the Harrogate-based accountancy software group, dropped 54p to 168p after the company announced interim losses of Pounds 2.55m pre-tax against profits of Pounds 427,000. The company came to the market in February at 235p. Directors said the outcome reflected factors beyond their control, principally a 27 per cent slowdown in sales of licensed, dedicated software for Digital VAX hardware. Coda made an operating profit for the six months ended April 30 of Pounds 308,000 (Pounds 427,000) before a Pounds 2.91m exceptional charge for the employee share ownership programme included in the flotation. Losses also took account of a 93 per cent increase in research and development spending to Pounds 2.7m as Coda stepped up work on its open systems software packages which will run on any hardware. This is a market where Coda is already emerging as a leading supplier. Open system sales increased more than fourfold to Pounds 2.9m. R&amp;D spending for the full year is forecast at Pounds 5.5m (Pounds 3m), an increase of Pounds 1.5m over budget, reflecting the urgency of accelerating product development. Turnover increased 43 per cent to Pounds 13.3m (Pounds 9.32m). The cost of sales rose by 63 per cent to Pounds 412,000 (Pounds 252,000). Administrative expenses rose by 46 per cent to Pounds 12.6m (Pounds 8.64m). Coda made Pounds 3.75m on Pounds 23.5m turnover in its last full year before flotation, and this was an important feature of its prospectus. The company said except for the software for Digital VAX equipment, sales were on or ahead of forecast, with its two other licensed, dedicated software packages for HP3000 and IBM AS/400 systems respectively up 23 per cent and 60 per cent respect-ively. Losses per share were 8p against earnings of 1.2p; there is an interim dividend of 0.5p.</p>

			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VALUES AND VICTORIES;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: BELEAGUERED FAMILY LIFE TEACHER MAYA DECKER WASN'T ON THE BALLOT,  BUT SHE CLAIMS VINDICATION IN THE RESULTS. TWO SCHOOL BOARD CANDIDATES OPPOSED  TO HER SEX EDUCATION LESSONS WERE DEFEATED.  </P> <P> First, teacher Maya Decker says she was falsely accused on a religious radio  show of hypnotizing four students in her family life class at Corona del Mar  High School.  </P> <P> Next, some parents charged that condoms were passed out during one of her  lectures for students to take home -- a charge that was denied by school  officials, who interviewed students.  </P> <P> Then, there was the condom demonstration. Decker used a banana. It got the  attention of some parents, she admits, including the founder of a traditional  values group who demanded that the school board discipline her.  </P> <P> "Things really hit the fan. I've never heard the end of it," Decker said. "It  became a red herring. I don't think the banana is a big problem, especially  when people are dying of AIDS. If they want to feel victorious about getting  the banana out of the classroom, great."  </P> <P> For more than a year, Decker, 47, has been under fire by religious and  conservative political groups who maintain that the family life class she has  taught for eight years serves impressionable children "a philosophical agenda  that destroys values and divides families."  </P> <P> Her class also found its way into the school board campaign that culminated  with Tuesday's election. Although Decker's name was not on the ballot, she  clearly emerged a winner.  </P> <P> She believes she was effectively vindicated when incumbents in the Newport-Mesa  Unified School District board race defeated two challengers who wanted to  overhaul the district's sex education program, including her family life class.  </P> <P> "The board election was very important," Decker said after school one day last  week, shortly before embarking on her usual five-mile hike to relax. "I wanted  the community at large to say they supported the program, and they did."  </P> <P> Family life, an optional course at Corona del Mar High School, has been taught  for almost 20 years. Its comprehensive lesson plan now addresses personal  relationships, dating, marriage, parenting, child development, human sexuality,  contraception, abortion, abstinence and sexually transmitted diseases.  </P> <P> Decker, who is president of the Orange County chapter of the American Civil  Liberties Union and an active member and former head of the 700-member Newport  Mesa Teachers Federation, claims her critics are ignorant about her class. She  brings in a wide variety of guest speakers, including homosexuals, pro-choice  and anti-abortion advocates, contraception experts, family law attorneys and  married couples with babies.  </P> <P> District officials say the course is designed to prepare high school students  for adulthood and provide them with a broad range of information so they can  make informed decisions and cope with today's world.  </P> <P> To take Decker's class, students need permission from their parents, who can  review course materials a week before school begins. About 70 students enroll  in her two courses every semester.  </P> <P> "I feel what I teach are survival skills -- relationship survival skills," said  Decker, who has taught for 23 years, almost all of it in Room 246 at Corona del  Mar. "I get positive feedback, extremely positive feedback from parents and  students."  </P> <P> There are exceptions, however. Some parents and members of the Committee to  Restore Ethical and Traditional Education (CREATE), a traditional values group  based in Costa Mesa, want her class replaced or revamped to teach abstinence  and refusal techniques almost exclusively.  </P> <P> CREATE's literature states that Decker's family life course, as well as other  sex education classes in the district, shock or entice students "into the abyss  of an 'anything goes' world of amoral social behavior."  </P> <P> She's "an aberration of the system," said John Gustafson, a founder of CREATE.  "They say to the students, 'I know you are going to have sex, here's the  contraceptives, and you can get an abortion.' I bet Decker has not taught a  refusal technique in her life."  </P> <P> Gustafson earlier this year called on the school board to discipline Decker  when a guest speaker from UC Irvine also used a banana in her class to  demonstrate a condom. District administrators said the banana had to go.  </P> <P> In the school board election, the group backed candidates Wendy Leece of Costa  Mesa and Jo Ellen Allen of Corona del Mar, who called for an abstinence-based  sex education program and a school board that was more responsive to parents'  concerns. Both were defeated.  </P> <P> CREATE and its followers began monitoring Decker's class last spring, using  students and adult observers for three consecutive days. Some them did not have  children in the class.  </P> <P> Decker said the visits created "a three-ring-circus atmosphere" and she fought  back by taping her lectures and inviting a Newport Mesa Federation of Teachers  representative and an administrator into her classes. She said none of the  observers confronted her face to face with their complaints.  </P> <P> This week, the school board will take action to adopt a formal policy  restricting the type of visits members of CREATE have sought.  </P> <P> "They come in and pick the most titillating stuff and not the other information  which is the bulk of the course," Decker said. "They read sinister intent into  the most simple things. They have a narrow perspective that is not  representative of the Christian community."  </P> <P> CREATE's founder responded that outsiders have been turned away from her class  and the district has not honored promises to turn over class material.  </P> <P> "They are clearly ashamed of what's going on. If they were not ashamed, they  would let people in. . . . We have not been disruptive," Gustafson said.  </P> <P> The controversy surrounding Decker began last year when a student complained to  his parents that four classmates had been hypnotized in her class as well as in  a psychology class.  </P> <P> The purported incident was recounted on a radio broadcast by Focus on the  Family, a Pomona-based religious organization, in September, 1988. Included in  the program was a reading of what was taught in the human sexuality sequence of  Decker's course, which represents one of six units of course material.  </P> <P> "We don't even talk about hypnosis in the class," Decker said.  </P> <P> The students, Decker and Corona del Mar High School were not named on the show,  said Paul Hetrick, vice president of Focus on the Family.  </P> <P> The radio report was followed by the latest banana controversy, charges that  Decker's class promotes homosexuality, questions about condoms being  distributed, and demands by CREATE members and other parents that Decker drop  certain topics from her class.  </P> <P> Although she did not agree with the decision, the district removed a lecture on  human sexual response.  </P> <P> Decker, an avid bird-watcher and board member of the Audubon Society, hikes  five miles almost every day in the countryside near her Laguna Niguel home.  </P> <P> She is a theatergoer. Sometimes, she says, it reminds her of the controversy  surrounding her. Last spring when CREATE followers were clamoring to get into  her classroom, she saw the Arthur Miller play "The Crucible" at South Coast  Repertory.  </P> <P> The drama explores the infamous witch hunts that ravaged the Puritan community  in Salem, Mass., during the last decade of the 17th Century.  </P> <P> "Orange County is Salem, Mass., in 1692," Decker quipped.  </P></p>

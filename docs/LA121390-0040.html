			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> San Diego leads California cities in the number of assault weapons registered  under a new state law, but the state Justice Department says the registered  arms are only a tiny fraction of those possessed by gun owners.  </P> <P> The Justice Department reported Tuesday that 231 assault weapons -- including  Uzis, AK-47s, MAC-10s and similar guns -- were registered in San Diego during  the past 18 months. San Diego, California's second-largest city, has about 1.2  million people.  </P> <P> Under the law, people who owned assault weapons before June, 1989, and register  them before Dec. 31 of this year are legally entitled to keep them.  </P></p>

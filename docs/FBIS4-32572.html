			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Vaclav Havel by Eva Hulkova at </F> Lany presidential residence, date not given: "Conversations at  Lany"--live or recorded]    [Excerpts] [Hulkova] Mr. President, this week you visited  Romania and Bulgaria. I would be interested in hearing your  view of the prospects in our mutual relations.    [Havel] Romania and Bulgaria are two European states with a  rich and interesting history. These two states have the same  importance as any other state of that region. In a few years'  time, these two states could reach a level comparable to that of  Greece or any other state that has not experienced a period of  communism. These two states are following a complicated path of  tackling the consequences of communism, as are we. In many  aspects, we are ahead of them. They are well aware of this and  are look upon us with almost uncritical respect. However, at  the same time, I think that any belittling attitude towards  these countries is misplaced. [passage omitted]    [Hulkova] It is clear that behind any trip of a high  official  there is a question asked by the citizens of our country: What  are we going gain from it? This is what matters. [passage  omitted]    [Havel] The Balkans are also part of Europe. I have  gradually visited all European countries, or almost all of them.  This has been a part of my long-term plan, through which I am  realizing the idea of returning to Europe, becoming a part of  Europe.    We must not think that Europe is only Brussels. Europe also  includes Romania, Europe also includes Bulgaria. We want to  have good relations with all European states, both political and  economic relations. [passage omitted] Europe does not consist of  only the member states of the European Union.    [Hulkova] I think it was after your talks with the Bulgarian  president that you spoke in favor of cooperation and closer  contacts but not in favor of doing so under an umbrella of  institutions because this would simply lead to a further  division of Europe rather than its unification. How was this  idea received?    [Havel] We agreed on it with President Zhelev. I think this  view has begun to prevail in our countries. I have discussed  this with many officials from various countries. All of us have  begun to feel that turning the alliance and community spirit of  the former communist countries into institutions incorporates  the danger of some sort of new division. There are people in  the West for whom this would make life easier because it is  simpler for them to deal with us as if we were some sort of  alternative bloc, a counterpart, a partner, as they dealt for  decades with the Warsaw Pact or CEMA. This is, of course,  simpler than to perceive every single country as an individual  country, as a legitimate democratic country that strives to  become a legitimate part of the European democratic structures.    This is why I perceive as dangerous all those hints,  emerging  now and then, coming above all from the West, expressing their  preference to see us all in one bag and to deal in a certain  manner with that one bag. However, this is not advantageous for  us. [passage omitted]    [Hulkova] It is obviously in the greatest interest of the  West to have good relations with Russia; therefore, I would like  to hear your comment from this point of view on the signing by  Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev of the Partnership for Peace,  especially as this has consequences even for us. Can we be less  fearful of their enormous armed might and strength?    [Havel] I thought from the beginning and also had  discussions  to this effect when I met President Clinton here concerning  Partnership for Peace, that there must be some kind of  partnership-based relations between the North Atlantic alliance  and Russia. I felt that there must be good relations, which is  in the interest of Europe and the world. That relationship will  always be in a certain manner specific because Russia is a large  Eurasian nuclear power that is surrounded by its own security  system, the Commonwealth of Independent States, and that is in  an entirely different position from a small Central European  country like ours.    Whether Partnership for Peace should be a starting point for  good relations between the alliance and Russia I was not sure. I  was more inclined toward the view that it should, that  Partnership for Peace was such an open program that made  possible so many different means of implementation that it could  indeed be the starting point for that necessary good  relationship with Russia. Now, of course, it also depends on the  content with which it is implemented. I cannot imagine that it  could be implemented with the same content as is desired by us  for the Partnership for Peace program. For us, it is the first  stage toward legitimate, full membership in the alliance. I  cannot imagine Russia as part of the North Atlantic alliance.  That is an almost nonsensical notion, is it not? However,  friendship and good cooperation between the alliance and Russia  are unavoidable.    What is most significant about the Russian signing is the  fact that it is not linked to any special position in the sense  that Russia could advise the alliance as to who it may or may  not accept as a member, how it may or may not expand, that it  could have some kind of veto, that it could have a privileged  position in this respect on account of its being more powerful.  I think attempts were presumably made to link the signing of  Partnership for Peace to this kind of specific position, and,  fortunately, they did not succeed.    [Hulkova] This is exactly what I wanted to ask as regards  the  right of veto. I would like to know what is, in your view, the  meaning of the fact that the alliance has resisted this pressure  and that this idea has been put forward by Russia?    [Havel] The fact that it was voiced by Russia probably  reflects Russia's internal political situation. Russia is a  country going through a shock following the loss of superpower  status, following the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the  loss of its former satellites. Moreover, this is a country  where pushing through economic reforms is incomparably more  difficult than in our country. Its citizens are suffering much  more. It is a country without great democratic traditions;  there are social, national, and other tensions there. The loss  of superpower status is, of course, felt painfully there, and  this is to a certain extent reflected in certain tones present  in their foreign policy, which seems to be attempting to calm  society with impressions of some kind of special status.    This is also linked to the traditional Russian distrust of  others, above all those to the west of them. They fear the  alliance expanding eastward, as though an enemy were  approaching. They must understand that the eastward expansion  of the alliance means extending the zone of democracy, freedom,  peace, and civic principles and that this is nothing to threaten  Russia, that, on the contrary, this is something that, by means  of radiation, could help Russia. I consider it good that the  West has managed to defend this idea that we, the former Soviet  satellites, kept repeating--I wrote various articles on this,  published in the United States and elsewhere--that it has  managed to defend this fundamental position against Russian  attempts to win some special status. This is a sign of a  certain faithfulness to one's own principles and to the  principles on which the community is based.    [Hulkova] With regard to developments on the domestic  political scene, undoubtedly the most important and certainly  the most interesting point was the fact that this week the  government did not approve Kalvoda's concept of higher  territorial and administrative units. What is your view?    [Havel] Because I anticipated this question, I prepared a  note. Allow me to read it out to you.    It is obvious that democracy cannot be limited only to the  state level and that most of the decisionmaking process should  be transferred directly to the citizens.    That is why the reform of state administration and its  decentralization will be the paramount task of the government in  this sphere in the coming period. These two points are a  condition of the success of economic transformation and of the  functioning of a free civic society. The government will make  sure that regional and local self-administration is implemented  in the area it will specify to a greater degree than has been  the case so far. The territorial setup of the state will  correspond to the basic requirement of democracy, which  constitutes the transfer of decisionmaking powers and  responsibility as close as possible to the citizen. This  territorial setup will be based on self-administered  communities, natural regions or possibly historical territorial  units equipped with relevant powers and funds, which will lower  their dependence on the Republic's budget and will enhance the  citizen's coresponsibility for the development of the community  in which he lives.    We want our society to be a civic society. We shall be  defending its basic principles.    [Hulkova] Excuse me, but the note you referred to is, in  fact, the government policy statement.    [Havel] Yes it is, precisely. It is the government policy  statement delivered by the government in the parliament two  years ago. On the basis of this policy statement, parliament  voiced confidence in the government. Two years have gone by and  here we are!    The coalition lacks concord on the basic outline of the  reform of public administration, which is absolutely essential.  I have serious concerns about this. I intend to step up my  dealing with this issue, or perhaps get involved in it somehow.    I firmly believe that our ruling coalition will recall its  policy statement and that it will quickly unite on the nature of  this reform and its timetable.    [Hulkova] If I understand this correctly, you no longer  regard this problem as an everyday problem of the coalition.    [Havel] I think that the controversy within the ruling  coalition is quite serious. [passage omitted] It is a matter of  a consensus within the ruling coalition to arrive at a decision  with which all four parties [of the Czech coalition] will  eventually agree. Up until now, this has been attained. I  firmly believe that a consensus will be attained even in this  case. This appears to be the most serious dispute within the  coalition.    [Hulkova] You have mentioned your intention of joining the  game. Do you regard yourself as a sufficiently strong player?    [Havel] I do not know to what extent I am a strong or a weak  player, but what I do know is that the president's duty is to  contribute to the country's political stability, to look after  the country and possibly even to make sure that the promises  given to citizens have been adhered to.

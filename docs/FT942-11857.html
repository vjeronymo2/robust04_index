			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Post Office chief spells out business plans Mr Bill Cockburn, chief executive of the Post Office, revealed yesterday that he has lobbied more than 150 MPs as part of his campaign to secure commercial freedom from the government. He also spelt out for the first time detailed business plans which could only be put into operation if the corporation was privatised or given commercial freedom within the public sector. These include leasing some or all of the 16 trains owned by the Post Office, the distribution of newspapers and handling private mail and parcels. The measures could save the corporation tens of millions of pounds. Under current rules, the Post Office is prevented by the Treasury from using surplus cash to invest in such business ventures. Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, has said a strong economic case exists for privatising the Royal Mail. But he has yet to publish his department's review of the business. Mr Cockburn said: 'If the government were to give us the commercial freedom we have been pressing for, we would look at the whole of our balance sheet. 'This includes the ownership of our 16 trains, all Post Office buildings, commercial vehicles and our charter air service.' The corporation recently bought the mail trains as part of a Pounds 150m partnership with Rail Express Systems, British Rail's profitable non-passenger business. But instead of owning the trains the Post Office believes it could make more commercial sense to sell them to a bank, for example, and lease them back. The Treasury has already told the Post Office that it will not 'bend the rules' to allow the corporation to put its business plans into operation while it remains in the public sector. Mr Cockburn has been discretely 'wining and dining' MPs from all political parties to impress upon them the need for commercial freedom. Although he has been careful not to disclose publicly his preferred method of commercial freedom, he said that if the government favoured privatisation it should 'get on with it' immediately.</p>

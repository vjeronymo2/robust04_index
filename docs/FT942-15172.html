			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / International Company News: BSN and Saint Louis to merge top lines BSN and Saint Louis, two of France's largest food groups, are to merge their ready-to-serve food businesses to create a company which will rank third in Europe with sales of FFr8.4bn (Dollars 1.4bn). The new group, to be called Panzalim, will combine BSN's Panzani division and the Euralim prepared food operations of Saint Louis. BSN will have management control of the company and hold 65.5 per cent of the capital. Saint Louis will hold the balance. Mr Antoine Riboud, BSN's chairman, described the alliance as 'a logical step' which would allow both groups to strengthen their position in an expanding sector. Panzalim will control about 10 per cent of the western European market for prepared food, behind Nestle of Switzerland and Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch group, which both control about 13 per cent of the market. 'Prepared food is one of the big areas of growth in the food industry,' said Mr Riboud, who forecast the market would expand by about 5 or 6 per cent annually over the next 10 to 15 years. 'Nowadays, people want a restaurant at their home with a choice like a menu,' he said. Mr Riboud said the new company would offer canned, frozen and chilled food, pasta and sauces. The principal brands to be included in the new group include William Saurin, Panzani, and Vivagel. Of the FFr8.4bn combined sales, about FFr6bn will come from prepared foods, and the rest from pasta and sauces. Mr Bernard Dumon, chairman of Saint Louis, said the brands and products were complementary, and that the creation of Panzalim would also strengthen the geographical presence of the two food groups. As well as the French market, BSN is strong in Italy and is expanding rapidly in east Asia. Saint Louis, which already has a strong presence in frozen foods, is an important player in the Spanish market. According to Mr Riboud, the alliance will provide economies in the joint purchasing of ingredients and in investment in research and innovation. Describing the prepared-food sector as 'the cosmetics side of the food industry', he said the establishment of brand identities and innovation had become increasingly important. Panzalim's largest markets will be Spain and France. In France, the company will have a market share of about 26 per cent, while it will control about 30 per cent of the Spanish frozen ready-to-serve market. BSN said it did not expect opposition to the deal from competition authorities in Brussels, because the markets remained divided between several large producers. Food industry analysts in Paris described the deal as a positive move which would accelerate expansion of the two groups in the prepared food market. Shares in Saint Louis rose strongly, from FFr1,747 to FFr1,775. BSN's shares climbed FFr8 to FFr850.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------       BSN/SAINT LOUIS MERGER: ACTIVITIES &amp; BRANDS INVOLVED  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Company               Activities                Brands  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Panzani               Pasta, semolina,          Panzani, Garbit,                       sauces, ready-to-serve    Petitjean, Spagheto                       dishes  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Generale Traiteur     Chilled prepared foods    Honore, Janin Traiteur,                                                 Panzani, Petitjean  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Stoeffler             Chilled prepared foods    Stoeffler                       and meat products  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Vivagel               Frozen prepared foods     Vivagel  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Pycasa                Frozen prepared foods     La Cocinera                       (Spain)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- William Saurin        Canned French             William Saurin                       recipe foods  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comalim               Canned foods              Marie                       and pate Marie  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Mack                  Canned quenelles          Mack  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Conserveries          Canned foods, including   La Belle Chaurienne Du Languedoc          cassoulet  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Frealim               Chilled prepared foods    Marie, Paul Bocuse,                                                 Luang  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Gorcy                 Frozen prepared foods     Marie, Gorcy  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Frudesa               Vegetables, fish,         Frudesa                       frozen prepared foods                       (Spain)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Euralim               Distribution (Belgium)    William Saurin  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: BSN/St Louis  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- See Lex</p>

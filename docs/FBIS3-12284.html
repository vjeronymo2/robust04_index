In a press statement today, Hawatimah said PLO Chairman  Yasir  'Arafat should learn a lesson, cancel the Oslo and Cairo  agreements, and return to national unity and consensus in  accordance with international legitimacy.    Hawatimah said escalation of the intifadah to topple the  Oslo  and Cairo agreements opens the door for a political settlement  based on withdrawal, the end of settlement construction and  massacres, and securing the right to self-determination and  independence.    In a similar statement, Khalid 'Abd-al-Majid, secretary  general of the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front, said the  Ibrahimi Mosque massacre has come after the PLO and Israel  signed the Gaza and Jericho agreement, which provided the enemy  with a cover for its repeated crimes.    A statement issued by the Alliance of the Palestinian Forces  said the atrocious crime is but the bloody fruit of the  Gaza-Jericho agreement and a product of 'Arafat and his team's  policy which submitted to all Israeli conditions.    The statement, issued following an extraordinary command  meeting of the alliance, emphasized that the Gaza-Jericho  agreement entrenched the Zionist occupation and accepted the  continuation of settlements and settlers on our land and among  our kinsfolk in order to kill and destroy.</p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (12): System under severe strain - Government is looking to the private sector to bolster state pensions A TEAM of bureaucrats at the economy ministry in Bercy to the east of Paris is now beavering away on one of the trickiest problems on the Balladur government's agenda - how to reform France's anachronistic, and fiendishly complicated pension system. Pension reform is not only logistically complex, but politically explosive. The Bercy bureaucrats must find a way of reducing the financial strains on the present state-controlled system without attacking the living standards of France's pensioners, or burdening tax payers with even higher pension contributions. Both Edouard Balladur, prime minister, and Edmond Alphandery, his economy minister, are said to be determined to press ahead with pension reform. The consensus is that one element of their programme will be the introduction of private pensions to bolster the state system. This would not only provide a lucrative source of business for the banks and insurance companies, but should also have a beneficial effect on the Paris stockmarket. France's pensioners enjoy a reasonably high standard of living. The retirement age, reduced to 60 by the socialists in the early 1980s, is one of the lowest in Europe. The socialists also ensured that anyone who had worked for 37.5 years could retire at 60 and then receive 50 per cent of their annual salaries in their 10 highest-earning years up to a maximum of FFr149,820. The pension system, which dates back to the post-war years, is run on a cash management basis whereby the Caisse de Retraite, a state institution, pays out pensions from the contributions it receives from those in employment. This system worked well in the 1950s and 1960s when France had a large, young working population to support its pensioners. But the system has since come under strain as the population has aged and, in proportional terms, the number of pensioners has risen, while the working population has shrunk. The system is now operating at an annual deficit of FFr20bn with 3.3 workers to support each pensioner. By the year 2005, when the progeny of the post-war 'baby boom' start to retire, there will be 1.9 workers for each pensioner and only 1.3 by 2040. That means that, if the present system continues, each worker would have to relinquish 35 per cent of his or her salary in pension contributions, against 19 per cent today. Mr Balladur has already started to refine the system. He resisted pressure from the right to reverse the socialist reforms by raising the retirement age, but has done so indirectly by increasing the 'qualifying period' for state pensions from 37.5 years to 40 years from 2003 onwards. He has also extended the 'period of calculation' for pensions to the 20 highest-earning years thereby slightly reducing the final entitlement. These measures were only ever regarded as stop-gaps. Mr Alphandery's working party is now trying to thrash out proposals for comprehensive reform. Mr Alphandery says he hopes to be able to finalise his proposals by the end of this year and to present them to the National Assembly for approval during the next parliamentary session which starts in April. The simplest solution to the pension problem would be to encourage today's tax payers to invest in private pensions for their own retirement. This would alleviate the pressure on the state system by enabling the government gradually to steadily reduce its pension payments - and the pension deficit. The expansion of private pensions would create an attractive new market for France's banks and insurers. It would also have a big effect on the stockmarket by providing an influx of investment for French equities. Moreover it would create a new breed of private pension funds which would accelerate modernisation of the Paris market by acting as powerful institutional investors to 'discipline' companies as they do in the US and the UK. However, the prospect of persuading French voters to spend extra money on private pensions while they are still contributing to the state system, is potentially problematic for the Balladur government which comes up for re-election in spring 1995. The government would also be wary of burdening tax payers with extra expenditure at a time when it is desperately trying to stimulate consumer spending to haul France out of recession. Some observers suspect that the Bercy working party may be looking for more imaginative solutions. One option might be to package private pensions as savings schemes, given that the French have traditionally been fond of saving and the savings ratio is already high at more than 13 per cent. The Bercy working party might also consider launching a bumper pension fund, along the lines of this summer's highly successful 'Balladur bond' issue which raised FFr110bn for Mr Balladur's job creation schemes. Such a fund would not only plug the present pension deficit but could go some way towards solving the longer terms problems of the French pension system.</p>

			<p><P> January 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A Brazilian cattle rancher suspected by authorities of ordering the killing of  a prominent Amazon ecologist surrendered to police because "he was tired of  living on the run," authorities said. Darly Alves da Silva, who police believe  masterminded the Dec. 22 shooting death of ecologist Francisco Mendes, gave up  in the jungle town of Xapuri near the Bolivian border. Mendes, 44, led a local  rubber tappers union in Xapuri whose members often tried to block ranchers'  efforts to clear rain forest. Da Silva is the father of Darcy Pereira da Silva,  21, who has confessed to the killing. Two of his brothers are in custody in the  case.  </P></p>

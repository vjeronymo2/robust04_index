			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Receivers appointed at Plastiseal Receivers have been appointed at Plastiseal, the Coventry-based manufacturer of windows and doors. The company's shares were suspended earlier this week pending clarification of its financial position. The USM-quoted company incurred a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 780,000 in the year to end-January 1992 and has seen its margins deteriorate sharply in the past six months. Some 150 jobs are at risk in Coventry and Cardigan, south Wales, until the receivers, Price Waterhouse, find a buyer for the company.</p>

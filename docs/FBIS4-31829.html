			<p>BFN     [Text] At a news conference in Legnica, Prime Minister  Waldemar Pawlak has assessed the strike situation in the Polish  steelworking industry. He pointed out its international  implications. According to the head of the government, Western  manufacturers of steel have large surpluses of that raw  material. We are losing at our own volition, the prime minister  said, because strikes bring our own steelworks to a standstill  and foreign competitors can enter our markets.</p>

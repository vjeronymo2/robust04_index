			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Societies braced for poor figures BUILDING SOCIETIES are bracing themselves for what may be the worst month's figures for their savings business for six years. Although the figures on the flow of funds in and out of societies during July are not due to be published until August 26, the industry now accepts that they will be the worst monthly figures so far this year and will show a heavy outflow of funds. Mr Adrian Coles, economist at the Building Societies Association, said: 'The outflow is going to be pretty large. I think it will be at least as large as the one we had in June, which was Pounds 314m, and may well be larger, though it may not be quite as high as Pounds 500m.' The July outflow is virtually certain to drive building societies into a loss for their retail funding during the first seven months of the year. There were net inflows of only Pounds 260m in the first quarter and Pounds 77m in the second quarter. Severe competition from National Savings and gilts is blamed by the societies for attracting savers away from them. Large deposits held by sophisticated savers with smaller societies that pay high rates of interest have proved particularly volatile, as their savers have been quick to move them into National Savings products. The government has already cut rates paid on National Savings products in response to protests from societies that they would otherwise have no option but to raise both their saving and lending rates.</p>

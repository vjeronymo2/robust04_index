			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> KLAUS GAINS POWER IN CARIBBEAN  </P> <P> Tropical Storm Klaus gained strength off Antigua today and was upgraded to a  hurricane after leaving six people dead and two missing in flooding on the  Caribbean island of Martinique.  </P> <P> The National Hurricane Center in Miami said Klaus had sustained winds of 80  m.p.h. this morning, up from 60 m.p.h. earlier.  </P> <P> It remained stalled 30 miles off Antigua but was expected to start moving  again.  </P> <P> It was uncertain whether Klaus, the sixth named hurricane of the season, would  reach the United States.  </P> <P> "We expect it in the next two or three days to move toward the northwest and to  be north of Puerto Rico and east of the Bahamas. Beyond that, it's too early to  say," the Hurricane Center said.  </P></p>

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Cash hopes rise for Polly Peck creditors The administrators to Polly Peck International, part of the collapsed business empire of fugitive businessman Mr Asil Nadir, announced a breakthrough yesterday in settling the claims of creditors. As a result of a deal, agreed in principle with creditors of other parts of the Polly Peck Group, an interim payment is likely to be made to up to 1,500 creditors by early summer. Mr Christopher Barlow, a partner at Coopers &amp; Lybrand and lead administrator to PPI, told creditors yesterday that he estimated the interim payment at 1.2p to 1.8p in the pound. Further payments are possible up to a further 2.6p in the pound, although that does not include income from legal claims or assets held beyond the reach of the administrators in northern Cyprus. Last May Mr Nadir fled the UK for his native Cyprus while facing charges of false accounting and theft involving Pounds 34m. The administrators reported yesterday that they were in talks with the government of northern Cyprus on settling control of the disputed assets. In his eighth report to creditors since the collapse of the company in 1990 with debts of more than Pounds 1bn, Mr Barlow was able to report that complex legal issues stemming from the structure of the Polly Peck Group were very close to being settled. A deal is expected to be signed in a week. As a result Dollars 180m (Pounds 109.7m) held in PPI Holdings BV, a Dutch company, will be released and some funds allowed to flow on to PPI. The funds include the proceeds of the sale of the Del Monte fresh fruit business. The deal puts in place an agreed formula for the distribution of future assets realised from the Polly Peck Group and should mean that they will flow relatively smoothly to the creditors of PPI. The deal would also settle a legal dispute over the routeing of funds through the Polly Peck Group involving Dollars 400m. The total assets so far realised from the Polly Peck Group total Dollars 680m. According to the report to PII creditors the deal, if signed, will remove 'any scope' for further arguments about the claims from the different sets of creditors in the Polly Peck Group. The basis of the split between groups of creditors is confidential. Mr Barlow said he was 'cautiously hopeful' that direct talks with the government in northern Cyprus would unlock the remaining assets - which include three hotels, a cardboard box company, and a fruit packer  - in return for the payment of debts to the government. The assets in question in northern Cyprus have a book value of Pounds 50m but it is thought they would realise something more than Pounds 15m if sold. UK law bars administrators from paying creditors. Mr Barlow is suggesting, and has the agreement in principle of the creditors' committee, that PPI be placed under a scheme of arrangement under the Companies Act - a form of insolvency procedure.</p>

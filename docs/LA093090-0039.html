			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POST CARDS FROM THE EDGE OF THE QUIET CANYON  </P> <P> Alone in one of America's most popular national parks? It seemed, well, almost  unnatural.  </P> <P> But a ranger at Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona suggested that I catch  the sunrise from Point Imperial on the North Rim -- the highest point (at 8,803  feet) on either rim of the canyon. So the very next morning, ever the dutiful  tourist, I made the 12-mile, sleepy-eyed drive from my cabin, arriving just in  time to grab a seat on a flat rock for the first rays of the sun's colorful  show.  </P> <P> The dawn danced quickly across the canyon walls, spotlighting hues of red and  orange and purple like a spinning kaleidoscope gone wild. Morning is the best  time to view the colors before they are washed out by midday glare. A slight  breeze, stirring the pines, hummed a daybreak anthem to accompany the display.  </P> <P> Except for two rock squirrels playing tag on a nearby pine, I was alone. It was  both surprising and wonderful.  </P> <P> In a year, the Grand Canyon attracts about 3.5 million visitors. On a busy  August day, like the one just then aborning, more than 20,000 tourists will be  on hand, most of them at bustling Grand Canyon Village on the South Rim.  </P> <P> When conservationists talk about America's overused parklands, one of the  places they generally have in mind is the village -- a hub of hotels, lodges, a  youth hostel, museums, restaurants, snack bars and curio shops on the canyon's  edge. Crowds pour in from the parking lots in waves.  </P> <P> No one except me, however, had been tempted by Point Imperial's sunrise on this  particular day. I have swarmed with the photo-snapping throngs on the South Rim  in the past, but on this visit I went in search of some of the park's special  solitary places. You can, I was discovering, still find solitude in the Grand  Canyon without wandering far from the well-trod paths.  </P> <P> Many visitors, I suspect, arrive at the South Rim village, walk a few steps  from the parking lot to peer into the giant chasm and figure they have seen the  Grand Canyon. I thought so, anyway, on my first trip 30 years ago. The three of  us, recent college grads on a Western camping spree, spent maybe an hour at the  South Rim, part of the time buying post cards, and then left feeling strangely  disappointed. Only on later visits did I come to realize that the canyon  impresses most when you get to know it better.  </P> <P> Once I swept through the canyon on a nine-day rafting adventure, camping under  the stars each night on sandy beaches beneath the towering walls. The trip was  exciting, but I was surprised how varied the scenery was deep down at the  bottom of the canyon. Every twist of the river yielded a new perspective.  </P> <P> Our raft held only 15 people (including two guides), and only rarely did we  float past another raft. Thus, I got my first taste of the park without the  crowds.  </P> <P> I even began to appreciate the South Rim, once I had stuck around long enough  to learn about the West Rim Trail. The trail begins roughly at the front door  of El Tovar Lodge, an elegantly restored historic hotel in the heart of the  village, and follows the sweeping curves of the canyon west for eight miles to  Hermits Rest.  </P> <P> For the first mile or so, the trail is paved and as packed as any downtown  street, but traffic thins quickly the farther you walk. Every yard you cover  offers yet new canyon views and an inviting perch on which to sit and  contemplate them. I packed a lunch and made a day of it.  </P> <P> The trail is mostly level and well-worn, and you are never very far from rescue  should you tire along the way. Parallel to the trail but usually just out of  sight is West Rim Drive. During the busy summer months, the drive is closed to  all vehicles except passenger shuttle buses.  </P> <P> The buses make pickup stops along the full length of the drive, so you can hike  the trail one way and take the bus the other. Remember to walk with the sun at  your back so that you can see the play of light on the canyon walls ahead.  </P> <P> If I had so easily overlooked West Rim Trail on my initial visits to the park,  I wondered, what else must I be missing?  </P> <P> So when my schedule allowed a brief return to the canyon last August -- this  time to the North Rim -- the first thing I did was put the question to the  park's staff, and ranger Dale Schmidt, supervisor of programs at the North Rim,  obliged.  </P> <P> An eight-year veteran of the canyon, he filled me in on several short day-hikes  that would give me little-seen, unjostled glimpses of the canyon. And then, as  if to tempt me to a return visit, he disclosed some of his favorite hidden  spots in the most remote corners of the huge wilderness park.  </P> <P> I met Schmidt when I signed on for an afternoon's hike that he was leading  along the Widforss Trail. On our trek, I told him of my interest in the Grand  Canyon's less-visited areas. My query prompted him to gather his flock of  hikers for a brief lecture on the differences between the park's South and  North rims. For visitors who want to avoid the park's crowds, he told us, the  North Rim is the place to begin.  </P> <P> Most visitors see one or the other rim of the canyon, but generally not both on  the same trip. A 21-mile hiking trail links the two rims -- down one side of  the canyon and up the other -- and a very strong hiker can make it in a day,  although an overnight stay at the canyon bottom is recommended.  </P> <P> The shortest drive between the rims is 215 miles, and the trip takes about five  hours. Both rims offer grand viewpoints of the canyon, though good viewing  areas are more easily reached on the South Rim.  </P> <P> While the South Rim averages about 20,000 visitors a day, said Schmidt, the  more remote North Rim averages only 2,000. The difference is easily explained.  The South Rim offers about 1,400 overnight accommodations, the North Rim fewer  than 300. Also, the South Rim is open year-round, but snow closes the North Rim  from about mid-October to mid-May.  </P> <P> Because the South Rim is 1,000 feet lower than the North, it gets less snow and  rain. Warmed by winds from the canyon's interior, its vegetation is sparse and  desert-like. The North Rim is heavily wooded, its meadows lush and dotted with  wildflowers. You feel as if you are in a northern forest. "On this plateau,"  said Schmidt, "the deer outnumber the people."  </P> <P> Schmidt's basic guideline for getting away from the Grand Canyon's crowds is to  get a good map "and see where most people would not want to go." That generally  means some place reached by dirt roads, hiking trials or no trails at all.  </P> <P> Also, he advises, pick your seasons carefully. Summer is busy, spring and fall  are less so, and winter is the time for real solitude.  </P> <P> Among Schmidt's suggestions:  </P> <P>  -- Ken Patrick Trail: "It's quite under-used." Twelve miles one way, the trail  is the hiker's route from the Grand Canyon Lodge area on the North Rim to Point  Imperial. It follows the canyon rim east through thick forests, and the climb  is gentle. You probably will want to arrange to be picked up at the end of the  hike.  </P> <P>  -- The rim-to-rim hike: You can do it in either direction. From the North Rim,  you descend for 14 miles on the North Kaibab Trail to Phantom Ranch or Bright  Angel Campground at the canyon's bottom (overnight reservations are required at  both). Early the next morning, make the steep seven-mile ascent of Bright Angel  Trail.  </P> <P> During the summer months, a van makes a daily shuttle between the two rims to  return you to your starting point. The shuttle departs the South Rim at 7 a.m.  and the North Rim at 3 p.m. The one-way fare is $50.  </P> <P> To escape the masses, a hiker can descend either of the trails part way and  double back on the same day. Hiking down is deceptively easy; the climb back up  at the park's high elevation can be very difficult. On any summer hike into the  canyon, avoid the heat of midday. On the trail, carry plenty of water -- a  gallon a day per person is recommended -- because the temperature in the inner  canyon can soar above 100 degrees.  </P> <P> Several other trails descend into the canyon, but they are not always  maintained. They are linked by the 70-mile Tonto Trail below the South Rim,  making it possible to plan a circle route in and out of the canyon. If you are  unfamiliar with the canyon's hazards, consult rangers before attempting such a  hike.  </P> <P>  -- Kaibab National Forest: "There's a lot of territory out there." The vast  pine forest serves as a protective barrier north of the park's border on the  North Rim. It is laced with dirt roads, several of which lead to Grand Canyon  overlooks reached no other way.  </P> <P> Schmidt suggests taking the Widforss Road that continues 17 miles beyond the  Widforss trail head to Point Sublime, which he calls "one of the best  viewpoints in the park." You probably will need a pickup truck or other vehicle  with a high chassis. Mountain bicycles are becoming increasingly popular on the  forest roads.  </P> <P> Unlike in the national park, camping is permitted almost anywhere in the forest  without a fee, although developed campgrounds also are available at three  remote canyon viewpoints.  </P> <P>  -- East Rim: This is a five-mile hike that begins just east of Grand Canyon  Village on the South Rim. Go out to Yaki Point, a popular viewing spot where  the mule trips emerge from the canyon on the South Kaibab Trail. Then, says  Schmidt, "take a hard right turn and walk to Shoshoni Point." No official trail  exists, which eliminates most foot traffic, but if you follow the rim there is  no great risk of getting lost. On your left will be the canyon; on your right,  but generally at a distance, will be East Rim Drive, the first leg of the  highway to the North Rim.  </P> <P>  -- Supai: "One of the more sublime places." The tiny village of the Havasupai  Indians, Supai lies deep in the Grand Canyon far to the west of Grand Canyon  Village. It can be reached only by foot or horseback over an eight-mile trail  or by helicopter, and visitors are welcome at a small guest house and  campground. Near the village, the clear waters of Havasu Creek tumble in a  series of waterfalls into inviting pools.  </P> <P>  -- Hermit Trail: "One of my favorites -- the geology is fabulous," says  Schmidt. Beginning at Hermits Rest on the South Rim, the trail makes a  nine-mile descent to the Colorado River at Hermit Rapids. In rafting season,  you won't always be alone. But you will have one of the best vantage points in  the entire canyon to watch the passenger-filled boats plunge through the  rapids.  </P> <P> For a good circle route, descend Bright Angel Trail from Grand Canyon Village,  turn west on the Tonto Trail and ascend the Hermit Trail to catch the shuttle  bus back to Grand Canyon Village.  </P> <P>  -- Tuweep: Located in what the Park Service calls one of the most remote  desert pockets of the United States, Tuweep offers an unusual view of the  canyon not seen elsewhere from either the North or the South rim. In most  places, the canyon averages about 10 miles in width, but at Tuweep it narrows  to less than a mile. From the viewpoint, the canyon wall plunges a straight  3,000 feet, and you can see the river clearly below.  </P> <P> The viewpoint can be reached by one of three dirt roads -- from 55 to 90 miles  long -- that head south from Arizona Route 389 west of Fredonia. There is a  modest campground, but no water is available. The Park Service warns that the  drive should not be attempted "without ample preparation, including water,  food, gasoline and tools."  </P> <P> And, oh yes:  </P> <P>  -- Point Imperial at sunrise: Ranger Schmidt casually mentioned this easy  excursion during our group hike along the Widforss Trail. I sensed it was a  gentle hint to the lot of us that we had only begun to discover the hidden  Grand Canyon. Thus nudged, I was wonderfully rewarded by the beauty of the  canyon's solitude. Alone in the Grand Canyon? It's the best way to see this  magnificent park.  </P></p>

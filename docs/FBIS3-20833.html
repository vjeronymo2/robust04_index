			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] An article on page 16 of the 3 March  issue of the Belgrade daily POLITIKA reports that a new  automatic telephone exchange has been installed in Vukovar  "reconnecting this part of the republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK]  to the world." In addition to a number of telephone lines in  some areas of Slavonia, Baranja, and Western Srem that had been  linked to the telephone exchanges of Novi Sad, Sombor, and Sid  in Serbia's Vojvodina province, in the next 20 days the most  remote villages of the Vukovar municipalities will be linked to  the automatic system, and in the next two to three months  telephone exchanges of villages in the Dalj, Tenja, and Mirkovci  municipalities will be plugged into the Vukovar main telephone  exchange, POLITIKA states.    The paper cites Spasoje Popovic, director of the Post,  Telephone, and Telegraph [PTT] Public Enterprise for Slavonia,  Baranja, and Western Srem, as stating that the PTT will  recognize all the rights of previous subscribers in the  territory of the former Croatia, under the condition that they  prove that they owned the telephone before the war. Popovic  notes that, during negotiations to establish telephone links  between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] and the  Republic of Croatia, the Croatian representatives had demanded  that the territory of the republic of Serbian Krajina be  included in the Croatian telecommunications system, with the  prewar area code of 056, which would have meant that the RSK was  an integral part of the Republic of Croatia. This was not  accepted, Popovic says, adding that the telephone connections of  the RSK will remain in the FRY telecommunications system. Thus,  the RSK and the FRY, as a single system, will establish their  telephone links with Croatia via Croatia's country code number  99385, the POLITIKA article concludes.</p>

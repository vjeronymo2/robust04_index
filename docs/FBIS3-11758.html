It has never been a question of a  sale, but only a lease contract between the Haitian state and  officials of Port Tortuga S.A., said Minister Dejoie. I have  never granted a portion of the national territory to any foreign  company, Dejoie said at the conclusion of his conversation with  the Commerce and Industry Commission of the lower chamber.    The commerce [and industry] minister was responding to the  convening of the commission about the Port Tortuga matter on 23  March. The PAIN [National Agricultural and Industrial Party]  leader demanded a meeting in camera as he refused to provide  explanations to the deputies in the presence of journalists. The  Port Tortuga matter is nothing but a lease contract binding the  Haitian State and the officials of that company for the  exploitation of a portion of Mole Saint-Nicolas, according to  Louis Dejoie:    [Begin recording] [Dejoie] There has never been a sale of  land, either by Minister Dejoie nor the preceding [commerce]  ministers, to a foreign company at any time. [passage omitted]    No contract has actually been signed between the Haitian  state and Port Tortuga S.A. A draft contract was sent to  [Minister of Finances and Economy] Rey -- who is also a party to  this project -- for her signature. She has not signed. She did  not want to sign -- (?according to) a letter I received from her  -- [prior to] certain formalities. [passage omitted]    "I have signed no contract." [passage omitted] This is a  draft contract between the Haitian state and a company called  Port Tortuga for the exploitation of something touristic.    [Unidentified reporter] Louis Dejoie II says he is waiting  for apologies from the head of state if [Aristide] really asked  him to put an end to illegal activities. The PAIN leader pointed  out that he has never received any request from President  Aristide about Port Tortuga S.A.    [Dejoie] [Passage omitted] "I do not really know whether  President Aristide made such a statement. But if he did," which  counters even all that I have said here -- and everybody has  evidence that Dejoie (?could) never sell or alienate a tiny plot  of land -- I am waiting for retractions from the president of  the Republic.    [Unidentified journalist] "So, he has not asked you (?to do)  anything?"    [Dejoie] "He has not asked me (?to do) anything. I have  received nothing from the president. Neither would he dare ask  me for something like that when I have done nothing contrary to  the law." What I can tell you is that I believe in the honesty  of the president of the Republic, who would not say such things  if he did not have information. "In my opinion, leaflets saying  that Dejoie has done this and that have been sent out."    [Journalist] "Will you give up the project?"    [Dejoie] No, the project cannot be given up. "The government  has resigned. A new government has to be established and take  care of it." [end recording]</p>

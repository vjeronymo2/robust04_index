			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities futures and options trading Stock index futures ended sharply lower after another session of below average trading volume, writes Jeffrey Brown. The FT-SE 100 December contract was at 3,079 when pit trading came to an end, down 51 points. It ended broadly in line with the cash market and seven points under fair value. Activity was much higher than Monday's severely depressed level, but it was again below average and, at 11,220 lots, only just into the area where traders reckon the futures market starts to become profitable. December has tumbled 61 points in two days, falling into what traders describe as a major support area. Wall Street continues to dictate immediate direction but some dealers were speculating on an early rebound for stock futures. Activity was said to be strictly anomoly business: mostly book hedging and marketmaker to marketmaker deals. Although premiums to cash equities were minimal throughout the session, there was no real weight of selling, with dealing lots small. Business in traded options rose to 35,402 lots from Monday's 21,653. There was heavy turnover in a number of individual stock options. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE trades accounted for less than 16,000 contracts. Tesco was the busiest stock option at 4,135 lots, followed by BTR and Shell Transport.</p>

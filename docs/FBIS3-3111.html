			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Zhao Jian (6392 1017): "Can a Foreigner Beat </F> People?"]    [Text] If someone wants to have a popsicle, but gives only  40 fen for a 50-fen one, he probably may not take the popsicle  away. This is something even a kindergartener understands.  However, if I tell you that someone beat up a popsicle seller  because he was refused a popsicle for paying only 40 fen, what  will you think?    Not long ago something similar to this happened. Although it  was not a quarrel about a popsicle, it is similar.    According to a Beijing newspaper report, on the night of 20  October, three people allegedly having nothing wrong with their  nerves took a taxi to Changcheng Hotel. They should pay 74 yuan  as the meter read, but they paid only 50 yuan in foreign  exchange certificates. The driver, of course, refused the  money, but they threw the money on the ground and began to beat  up the driver. A hotel security guard stepped forward to  mediate, but was beaten and kicked too. In the end, five people  were wounded. Throughout the incident, they shouted abuse and  kept yelling: "We are Americans!"    I was astonished to hear that two of the three were women.  The report said that the two women "fiercely kicked the  driver," "turned around and slapped someone else on the face"  and "rudely grabbed his private parts." This reminds people of  Detective Hunter's partner McCall, the difference being only  that those who were beaten were not drug addicts or murderers,  but law-abiding Chinese civilians.    I have not conducted a special study of the United States or  Americans, but I studied some history when I was at school and  know that in the past some foreigners, both military and  nonmilitary, had been to China; now there are also foreigners  coming to China for visits, sightseeing, business purposes,  sports competitions, and putting on shows. However, one cannot  ride roughshod over others because he or she is an "American."  If this had happened in the past, it would not have been  surprising; but if someone still behaves in such an overbearing  or hegemonist way, this probably is something incomprehensible.    I suspect that these three Americans have the same organs in  their bodies as others. Otherwise, why are they so widely  different from others? People around the world should be like  brothers and respect each other, but there are some people who  like to show their arrogance. They say they take much account  of civilization, equality, and human rights, but what they have  done is inglorious.    According to reports, Chinese being humiliated, abused, and  beaten frequently happens. This makes me ask another question:  Is it that some of us have doted on these foreigners too much?  In the Changcheng Hotel incident, there was a 2.07-meter-tall  security guard whose "chest was beaten" and "private parts  kicked," but he did not return a blow, showing utmost endurance.  Did this awaken those people who dare not stand upright in the  presence of foreigners or think that the moon in a foreign  country is rounder than that in China? I cannot answer this  question.    The last part of the report on the Changcheng Hotel incident  said that the public security department had handled the matter.  The three Americans "expressed their regret" and said that they  would "abide by Chinese law" in the future and "were willing to  accept punishment." However, I would like to know this: What  were the details of the punishment? How much compensation did  those who were beaten receive for their "medical expenses," as  well as "material and spiritual losses"? Were they satisfied  with the way the incident was handled? Some people may say that  because the Americans admitted their mistakes, there was no need  to bring up these "details," but I think the reporter who filed  the report should not have skirted around this point. Will our  readers think that I am making a fuss over a trifle?</p>

			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REGULATORS INSTALL NEW PRESIDENT, BOARD AT SECURITY FEDERAL S &amp; L IN GARDEN  GROVE  </P> <P> Moving to shore up management at Security Federal Savings &amp; Loan, federal  regulators installed a new president and board of directors at the Garden Grove  thrift.  </P> <P> The departing board appointed five new directors, at least four of whom have  worked with troubled S&amp;Ls elsewhere for the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.  The new directors then hired William Verant as Security Federal's new  president.  </P> <P> Roger Sullivan, who had been named president just two weeks ago, returned to  his position as vice president in charge of lending.  </P> <P> The S&amp;L, which has lost money for several years, is operating with  "marginal" capital of just over $1 million for its $78 million in assets,  Verant said Friday after two days on the job. Regulations require it to have  more than $2.5 million in capital, its final reserve against losses.  </P> <P> But the thrift has earned more than $280,000 in the first five months this year  and has a loyal core of depositors, many of whom have been with the S&amp;L  almost since it opened in 1957, Verant said.  </P> <P> "It can be turned around," he said. "It just needs more capital and a good  business plan."  </P> <P> Security Federal, hurt by a small profit margin, has few of the problems that  have plagued many S&amp;Ls. Verant said loan delinquencies -- slow-paying loans  -- constitute only 1% of its loan portfolio, a figure well within acceptable  thrift standards. It also has few properties in foreclosure. Such foreclosures  can be an indication of financial problems.  </P> <P> Security's only major problem, Verant said, is that it has more than $2 million  in loan losses from the early 1980s that it has been deferring. It needs  profits against which it can write off those losses.  </P> <P> Verant, 47, of Laguna Hills said he has high hopes of rebuilding Security  Federal. He said it was a "refreshing" opportunity after managing the insolvent  Unified Savings Bank in Northridge, which has been liquidating its assets since  the bank board seized that institution in October, 1986.  </P> <P> He said he and the new and old directors met Wednesday at a board meeting,  where regulators introduced everyone.  </P> <P> Security Federal's new chairman is McKenzie Moss of Carmel. Its directors are  real estate syndicator Janice Ramocinski of Orange, consultant Paul Hogan of  San Francisco and Dale Welton and Dallis Widick of Lenders Technology Inc. in  Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Ramocinski managed North America Savings &amp; Loan in Santa Ana for regulators  before it was closed last June. Moss, Welton and Widick have served for  regulators on the boards of troubled thrifts.  </P> <P> Richard Miller, Security Federal's president since it opened, retired from that  position two weeks ago but remained as the S&amp;L's chairman. He and two other  board members retired Wednesday, and two other directors resigned.  </P></p>

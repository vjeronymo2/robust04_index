That, plus another two  centimentres, is what a ballot paper for the National Assembly  election will measure. With 60 cm ballot papers, 10 different  kinds of ballot papers and marking fluid all over our knuckles,  the April election is going to be like no other.    Our 80 million ballot papers will fill 10 jumbo jets when  they wing their way to South Africa from London where they are  being printed. According to the Independent Electoral  Commission, no South African firm could handle the printing  order and the London firm De La Rue, of Basingstoke, has  expertise in printing bank-notes, ballot papers and official  documents.    Printing will be completed by April 17. The ballot papers  will be flown to South Africa under stringent security and be  transported to warehouses under surveillance and in the presence  of political party officials. Three days before the election  they will be transported to secure locations near the voting  stations.    Ten different types of ballot paper will be used -- one for  the National Assembly (the 60 cm one giving details of each  political party) and nine for each of the provinces for the  provincial legislature elections indicating only the parties  contesting the election in each province.    On election day, voters will have both hands dipped into  marking fluid which is invisible but shows up under UV lights.  That means no one who has been "dipped" can vote again. The  dye washes off after about seven days.</p>

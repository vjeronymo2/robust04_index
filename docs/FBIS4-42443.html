			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Red Brigade Leaflets Against </F> Scalfaro and Berlusconi in Genoa"]    [Text] Genoa -- Five leaflets signed by a self-styled  "Armed Group for the Proletarian Revolution -- New Walter Alasia  Column" were found yesterday morning in Genoa, in the  Sampierdarena section, a stone's throw from the place where the  Red Brigades murdered two Carabinieri, Tosa and Battaglin.    The leaflets contained heavy threats against President Oscar  Luigi Scalfaro, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, National  Alliance [AN] leader Gianfranco Fini, and League leader Umberto  Bossi. Death threats were also addressed to CGIL [Italian  General Confederation of Labor] Secretary General Bruno Trentin,  and PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] Secretary Achille  Occhetto. The document, which was most probably written with an  electronic typewriter and then photocopied, is currently being  examined by the DIGOS [Division for General Investigations and  Special Operations]. Is it some sort of provocation? Possibly,  but the police are not dismissing the very real possibility of a  new terrorist flare-up.    The leaflets' presence in Via Rolando, in Sampierdarena, was  reported to the police by passers-by who noticed two of the five  leaflets affixed -- at eye level -- to the front of a house.  The other three leaflets were glued to a paper-collecting  container. An eye-catching five-point star was displayed on the  upper left-hand side of the leaflets. The five-point star is  BR's [Red Brigades] "historical" symbol on which, however, the  outline of a submachine gun was superimposed. Around this, in a  radiating pattern, was the "signature" of the self-styled "armed  group."    According to the leaflet, it is "the oppressive and  exploitative state structure" which justifies the resumption of  armed struggle. This includes executing Trentin and Occhetto,  who are accused of "collaboration with the  counterrevolutionaries and the bosses' clique," as well as of  "sabotaging proletarian actions."    The "New Walter Alasia Column" pronounces the same sentence  on Bossi and Berlusconi, who are targeted "because they are  enemies of the working class and of its armed organization," and  on Fini and Scalfaro, in that they are considered adherents of  party organizations which openly support neofascist ideology.</p>

			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SUIT AGAINST CHURCH TAKEN TO HIGH COURT  </P> <P> A Tujunga couple who contended in a lawsuit that a Sun Valley church is guilty  of "clergy malpractice" in the 1979 suicide of their son have appealed the case  to the U.S. Supreme Court, their attorney said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Allen P. Wilkinson, attorney for Walter and Maria Nally, said a petition was  filed Tuesday asking the Supreme Court to review the suit, whose claims were  rejected by the California Supreme Court in November.  </P> <P> The family maintains that Grace Community Church pastors, who were providing  24-year-old Kenneth Nally with spiritual counseling for his depression, should  be held liable for his suicide. But the state Supreme Court ruled Nov. 27 that  church pastors should be "free from state-imposed counseling standards."  </P> <P> Wilkinson said that the constitutional right of religious freedom should not  protect a church and its pastors from responsibility in counseling members.  </P> <P> David A. Cooksey, an attorney for the church, said he had not seen the petition  filed with the high court, but maintained that the case involves state and not  federal issues. "With the U.S. Supreme Court we have now, I don't think it will  touch this case," Cooksey said.  </P></p>

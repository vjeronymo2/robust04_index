			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [MTI report: "Duray for Minority Rights"] </F>   [Text] Miklos Duray, chairman of the Coexistence Movement,  only considers the current form of the European stability  agreement acceptable if certain national minority interests can  be included in it. In an interview to the [Bratislava] UJ SZO  on 25 May, Duray said: "Through its legitimate representatives,  the Hungarian community wishes to participate in drawing up the  agreement. We reject all such steps that would exclude our  direct participation.... There are two alternatives. One is  that we become part of bilateral talks and, in this case,  naturally, we accept the mediating role of a third party. As a  second solution, we consider it more important and necessary to  create a system of agreements within the given country, in our  case between the Hungarian minority and the government," Duray  said.</p>

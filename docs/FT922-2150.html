			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Lloyd's may give up plan to bail out Names PLANS TO set up a bailout fund to help those Lloyd's Names hardest hit by recent losses are running into difficulties and may be abandoned. An emergency meeting of the Lloyd's council, the market's governing body, was held yesterday to discuss a number of possible schemes. The council will make an announcement today, and some form of help for stricken Names is not entirely ruled out. However, a Lloyd's official admitted that a bailout plan was 'looking less and less likely'. The purpose of a bailout would be to cap the losses of those Names - the individuals whose assets support underwriting - who have been worst affected by Lloyd's recent losses. These are forecast to reach Pounds 2bn in the 1989 underwriting year. In line with Lloyd's three-year accounting system, these figures will be announced next week. Officials working on the scheme are understood to have been unable so far to solve complex legal and practical difficulties. A minority of the market's Names, who are members of 'spiral' reinsurance syndicates - which provided high-level catastrophe cover to other syndicates and companies - face a disproportionate share of losses. Chatset, the company which tracks the results of Lloyd's syndicates, says that Names on just 15 of the 401 syndicates trading could face losses of Pounds 948m. Any decision not to help them would be bound to stir controversy ahead of the society's annual meeting next week. Mr Christopher Stockwell, the chairman of the Lloyd's Names Associations working party, warned that the market's crisis could deepen if no help was offered. He predicted an 'an enormous wave of litigation' by Names in the autumn. 'The council may duck the issue but our basic belief and expectation is that something has to be done. Failure is the end of Lloyd's,' he added. The idea of a bailout plan has had a chequered history over recent months. In January, a task force under the chairmanship of Mr David Rowland, chairman of international broker Sedgwick, recommended against retrospective aid for Names, restricting its proposed cap on losses for future years. In April, Mr David Coleridge, chairman, revived the idea of offering help to the market's 'walking wounded' and a council sub-committee has examined various options over the past two months. Although the idea has found favour among some sections of the market, neither agents nor brokers have been enthusiastic about contributing funds to a scheme. The mood among underwriters and agents at the Lloyd's market has shifted in the past few weeks against setting up such a fund. This change of mood follows the approval of plans to boost the size of Lloyd's central fund, which meets losses when Names cannot pay claims.</p>

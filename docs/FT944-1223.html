			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / International Company News: BAS plans new year flotation BAS International Holdings, a supplier of low-cost consumer stationary, soft toys and giftware, announced yesterday its intention to make its Stock Exchange debut in the new year. Although few details are available, the Manchester-based group plans to raise about Pounds 12m by issuing new shares and hopes to be valued at Pounds 20m to Pounds 30m on flotation. Mr Graham Hallworth, finance director, said the fresh funds would be used to finance organic growth in the distribution business, such as product development, acquisitions and a new distribution centre in north-west England. BAS operates through four subsidiaries. It is owned by Mr Martin Abramson, chairman and founder, who has a 70 per cent stake, and Mr Tyrone Farber and Mr Richard Rosenburg, both managing directors, who hold 15 per cent each. Total annual sales are about Pounds 22m and pre-tax profits for 1994 are forecast at Pounds 2m, against Pounds 992,000. Panmure Gordon is sponsor to the issue.</p>

			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Deductions from a fund I have a holding in a Luxembourg-based bond fund. At the beginning of last year, it introduced a small annual charge which it applied by deducting units, equivalent to the charge, from my holding. I have no complaint with this but I wonder how I should deal with it when calculating my liability to CGT now I have sold the holding. 2. Looking to the future, Crest (the proposed new stock exchange settlement system) will force most private shareholders to use nominee accounts. If the annual charges for such accounts are levied directly on shareholders, how should these charges be dealt with in capital gains tax calculations? 3. Could you recommend a readable book giving information on trusts established by a will? First, each deduction of units from the holding is treated as though it were a sale of the units in question for a consideration equal to the charges which the deduction covered. 2. They should be ignored. 3. Try the tax and trust books in your local reference library. Probably all you need bear in mind, however, is that discretionary trusts tend to carry a higher ultimate tax bill than interest-in-possession trusts, and that accumulation trusts generally carry the highest tax burden. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

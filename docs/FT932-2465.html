			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / UK Company News: TV-am considers move into casinos TV-AM, the breakfast television company, which placed a very bad bet in the ITV franchise round is considering one final gamble. Just as they are taking down the famous eggcups over the TV-am studios before MTV moves in, the failed television company is thinking seriously about going into the casino business. TV-am is in talks to take over Crockfords, the Mayfair casino company whose last published results show a pre-tax profit of Pounds 10m for 1991. It is not clear whether the club has done so well as the recession has deepened. The television company, which lost out to Good Morning Television and the Curzon Street casino, is talking about a complex deal involving a simultaneous rights issue, Stock Exchange flotation and acquisition. Crockfords was owned by Tiny Rowlands' Lonrho group, then by Brent Walker before it changed hands in a management buy-out. As far as the shareholders of TV-am were concerned the company was due to be wound up and the money distributed. The studios had been sold for Pounds 3.5m and a 50 per cent stake in Virgin Radio was disposed of for about Pounds 1.5m. Instead shareholders were told about a proposal put to their board which could lead to TV-am 'acquiring a new business and thereby continuing in existence'. A number of directors have stayed on at the company to explore the possible takeover including Sir David Frost, the broadcaster, Mrs Edwina Coven, former deputy chairman, Mr Richard Redmayne of stockbrokers Smith New Court, and Mr Stratos Zographos, former finance director of TV-am and now finance director of the ITV Network Centre. TV-am still has assets of some Pounds 12m. It is not clear whether all the directors are in favour of the casino plan.</p>

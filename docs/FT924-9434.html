			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Angola's lessons DEMOCRACY IS faltering in Africa. As authoritarian regimes across the continent bow to international and domestic pressure, the transition to multi-party rule is endangered by electoral fraud, undisciplined armies, aggrieved minorities and flawed constitutions. Without tougher international monitoring of elections, and the introduction of constitutions that accommodate ethnic, religious and regional rivalries, democracy will remain imperilled. Angola's threatened relapse into full-scale civil war is the latest blow to hopes for a fresh start, and the most serious. Renewed conflict would be disastrous for southern Africa as a whole. But the tragedy will have wider implications. The UN has played a leading role in Angola, monitoring the country's ceasefire and observing the elections. Success would have encouraged such efforts in Somalia or Mozambique; failure will reinforce misgivings about mediation in Africa's conflicts. Clearly the burden of blame rests with Mr Jonas Savimbi, the Unita leader, defeated by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos in the September elections. Unita has claimed widespread electoral fraud, and demanded an international inquiry. The vote was deemed fair not only by the UN, but also by Washington, which along with South Africa, supported Unita in the civil war. Mr Savimbi is a bad loser, and a dangerous one. A Unita military victory seems impossible, but the damage it can wreak could be better contained had the ceasefire been firmly implemented. The demobilisation of the Unita and government armies fell behind schedule, as did the creation of a national force drawn from both sides. The understaffed UN monitoring team did its best, but Angola would have been better served had the UN made clear that, without full compliance with the transition terms, elections could not take place. The most serious obstacle to lasting peace, however, may be the constitution itself. The record of post-independence Africa suggests that systems which concentrate too much power in the hands of one party lead to one-party states. Its leaders have yet to find the constitutional formula which reconciles democratic values with ethnic or religious loyalties, and Angola is no exception. The passions that Mr Savimbi can now exploit could have been defused by a constitution offering proportional representation in the country's executive, a decentralised government which gives provincial administrations real power, and a revenue allocation formula that ensures that all regions receive an equitable share of Angola's oil wealth. Rigorous implementation and monitoring of transitions and constitutions which acknowledge African realities would not guarantee peace. But they offer a better chance of coping with political rogue elephants, in Angola and elsewhere.</p>

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Hoechst safety chief urged to step aside THE HESSE state environment minister, Mr Joshka Fischer, yesterday called for the member of the management board of Hoechst responsible for the security of the company's chemical plants to step aside, writes Ariane Genillard in Bonn. Mr Fischer said that Mr Karl Holoubek, the board member responsible for security, should step aside until a thorough investigation of safety systems could prove that a recent series of accidents at company facilities were not caused by mismanagement. Hoechst said the investigation would prove that its security systems were of a high standard. It is reviewing safety measures at its 123 plants.</p>

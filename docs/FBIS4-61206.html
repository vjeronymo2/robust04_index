			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 5 ITAR-TASS -- Russia's national  newspapers today lead with reports about the agreement on  Palestinian autonomy in Gaza and Jericho signed in Cairo on  Wednesday by Palestine Liberation Organisation leader Yasir  'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin.    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA comments: "This agreement is the first  and most significant step along the path of implementation of  the Washington declaration of principles". The newspaper quotes  Yasir 'Arafat as saying this event signifies peace not only for  Israel and not only for the entire Arab world, but for mankind  as a whole.    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA stressed that "the document signed in Cairo  yesterday marks the creation of the first-ever Palestinian  autonomy and opens a new chapter in the settlement of the  Arab-Israeli chapter. Along with this, the Palestinians in the  Gaza Strip are vieweing their autonomy with apprehension. Much  will depend on the ability of the new authorities to improve the  desperate situation of the local inhabitants, the overwhelming  majority of whom live in abject poverty".    Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev, who is  in  Cairo in connection with the signing of the agreement on the  Palestinian autonomy, told the newspaper TRUD that "the  agreement on Gaza and Jericho is the first major step towards  durable peace in the region, it marks a historic reconciliation  between Israel and its Palestinian neighbours, I hope it will  stimulate progress along other lines of the Middle East  settlement. The Israeli-Palestinian agreement must be followed  by its practical implementation. This will be a stage no less  important than the negotiations".    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA said in its comment on the signing:  "Both Rabin and 'Arafat are in a hurry to sign peace today, not  tomorrow. If they failed to do so, the right-wingers would  certainly come to power at the next elections in Israel, and  their understanding of the word "peace" is quite different.  'Arafat's political career is also at stake -- should his  policy fail, the irreplaceable PLO leader would be replaced by  his irreconcilable opponents".    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA noted in this respect that "literally a  few hours before the signing, Tel Aviv raised, without any  preliminary notice, 25 new disputable questions. But  nonetheless 'Arafat and Rabin, unshakable in their desire for  peace, sealed the historic document with the signatures by their  own hands".    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with Yabloko  [Yavlinskiy Bloc] leader Grigory Yavlinskiy. Asked why his  faction was against the political amnesty, which set President  Yeltsin's arch-rivals free, Yavlinskiy said: "We voted against  because we thought it most important to set up a commission for  the investigation for the tragic events of October 3 and 4. It  would have inevitably made clear that both sides were to blame  for the bloodshed. But the right-wingers and left-wingers  agreed on a compromise which set them free from moral  condemnation and juridical liability. I am convinced that the  question remains. Life itself will put it on our agenda".    PRAVDA also takes up the subject placing a statement by  General Valentin Varennikov on its front page who objects  against the application of the political amnesty to himself.  Varennikov writes "I have no objections to the State Duma  decision on amnesty. But I repeat yet again that throughout all  stages of the preliminary investigation and during the court  trial I never acknowledged and do not acknowledge now the  accusations against myself. I declared and declare myself again  not guilty."    Valentin Varennikov said he had appealed to the military  collegium of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation to  institute criminal proceedings against the people guilty of the  break-up of the Soviet Union. The text of his letter of appeal  is also printed in the newspaper SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA. The same  newspaper publishes reports about marches and rallies on May  first.    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI carries an interview between the  newspaper's editor in chief and the chief of the presidential  apparatus, Federal Minister Vladimir Kvasov, who comments on  lobbying government decisions. "This country has yet to create  the institute of lobbyism. And I am sure that it will be  created. Such institutes exist in all market economies".    Economy Minister Aleksandr Shokhin reports in ROSSIYSKIYE  VESTI about the results of the Russian delegation's  participation in the recent session of the leading bodies of the  International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, as well as the  conference of the finance ministers and central bank governors  of the Group of Seven countries. Aleksandr Shokhin expressed  satisfaction with the results of encounters in Washington, he  noted among other things that "an agreement on a 70 million  dollar loan to Russia was signed with the World Bank to develop  the employment and social insurance services".</p>

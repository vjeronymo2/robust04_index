			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Construction Contracts: Energy saving Anglia Polytechnic University is to receive funding from the European Community under the THERMIE project, a five-year European Community programme to promote the design and use of new energy saving technology. The successful bid is in respect of innovatory energy efficient elements incorporated into the design of Anglia's Learning Resource Centre, the first phase of the new university campus in Chelmsford. The Pounds 4.9m centre, which is to be built by WIMPEY CONSTRUCTION, is due for completion in summer 1994. The building will incorporate design concepts to reduce energy costs by up to 50 per cent and will obviate the need for an air conditioning system by use of stack ventilation towers to improve through ventilation. Good daylighting is another key element and will be enhanced by windows with light shelves to reflect light deeper into the building.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Section 620.5(i)_Compensation of Directors and Senior Officers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Director compensation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The disclosure requirements in the final regulation remain unchanged from the proposed regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Senior officer compensation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The senior officer compensation disclosure requirements were substantially changed in the final regulation. As previously discussed, the modifications were made because the FCA Board considered it important to balance commenters' privacy concerns with the shareholders' need for access to pertinent information regarding their institutions, and to further reflect the unique attributes of FCS institutions in the regulations. In addition, technical and clarifying changes were made to improve the understanding of the requirements and enhance the consistency of the disclosures presented to shareholders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An alternative means for associations to disseminate senior officer compensation information was added to the final rule. Many commenters asserted that the disclosure of compensation information is more appropriate for a proxy statement. To address this issue, final &sect;620.5(i)(2) permits associations to disclose senior officer compensation information in either the Association Annual Meeting Information Statement (AAMIS) or the annual report. By allowing associations to disclose compensation information in the AAMIS, the FCA Board aims to reduce the concern of wide distribution of potentially sensitive information in a public format. Currently, there is no other disclosure medium for banks that serves a similar purpose as the AAMIS. Thus, the banks would continue to publish senior officer compensation in the annual report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rule limits the requirement for disclosure of individual compensation information to FCS institution CEOs. Proposed &sect;620.5(i)(2)(i), which would have required institutions to make individual compensation disclosure for each of the five highest compensated senior officers, was dropped from the final rule. Final &sect;620.5(i)(2)(i)(A) requires FCS institutions to report the total compensation and the amount of each component of compensation paid to the institution's CEO for each of the last 3 completed fiscal years. If more than one person served in the capacity of CEO during any given fiscal year, individual compensation information must be reported for each CEO. However, no disclosure need be provided for any CEO whose salary and bonus (or annualized salary and bonus, if the CEO served in that capacity less than a year) do not exceed $150,000, adjusted annually to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all urban consumers. The 1994 calendar year will serve as the base year for making subsequent CPI adjustments to the $150,000 disclosure threshold.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;620.5(i)(2)(ii), which would have required FCS institutions to report the aggregate amount of compensation and the components of compensation paid to all officers as a group, was revised in the final regulation. The FCA did not perceive the proposed requirement as markedly different from the existing aggregate senior officer compensation disclosure requirement. Yet, several commenters interpreted the requirement to be more extensive. The FCA decided to retain the language in the existing rule with some modifications to reduce any ambiguity that may have been raised by the proposed requirement. Final &sect;620.5(i)(2)(i)(B) requires institutions to report the aggregate amount of compensation and the components of compensation paid during each of the last 3 completed fiscal years to all senior officers as a group, stating the number of officers in the group without naming them. As with the existing regulation, at a minimum, institutions must disclose the aggregate amount of compensation paid to the five most highly compensated officers, whether or not designated as a senior officer by the board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

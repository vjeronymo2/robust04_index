The adversary's firing hardware was  damaged by counterfire. The same day a frontier detachment  stationed on the section of the Khorog frontier came under small  arms fire from Afghanistan territory. No casualties are  reported.    On the whole, Tajikistan's territory and Russian frontier  detachments have been subjected to shelling from the Afghan  territory 18 times over the month and a half of this year, said  leader of the Information Department of the Tajik Foreign  Ministry Zafar Saidov. In his words, this creates conditions  for further destabilization of the situation on the Tajik-Afghan  border.</p>

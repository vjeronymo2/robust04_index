			<p>BFN     [Text] Following orders from Rio de Janeiro Governor Nilo  Batista, Military Police [PM] Commander Carlos Nazareth  Cerqueira yesterday dismissed Lieutenant Colonel Valmir Brum  from his post as chief of the PM Judicial Department. Brum is  an officer who was engaged in the operation against the numbers  game operators. Brum's dismissal was decided at a meeting  between former Rio de Janeiro Governor Leonel Brizola and  leaders of the Democratic Labor Party [PDT]. Lieutenant Colonel  Francisco Sergio Rangel, who has also taken action against the  numbers game kingpins, will also be dismissed. Lieutenant  Colonel Marcos Antonio Paes, chief of the PM Secret Service, who  also actively participated in the operation, will be given a  leave of absence on 28 April to take a course, and is not likely  to resume his post. The three officers have always been praised  by their PM superiors and by the Rio de Janeiro State  Government, but they were criticized when they disclosed that  politicians linked to the PDT were on the list of whose who  received bribes from the numbers game kingpins. They have been  charged with "planting" the names of Governor Batista and PDT  congressmen. The dismissals have provoked indignation among the  prosecutors who are handling the case, who once again contended  that the list is genuine.</p>

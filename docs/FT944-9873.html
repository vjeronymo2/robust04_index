			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Ashdown launches policy package Measures to improve training, promote energy efficiency and tackle homelessness are included in an alternative Queen's Speech to be launched today by Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, David Owen writes. The proposals contain a range of business measures including: A requirement for all employers to release employees aged under 19 for a minimum of two days a week for further training. The introduction of a training levy on medium-sized and large companies. A bill requiring interest to be paid on the late payment of commercial debt. The improvement of equal-pay legislation, with a view to bringing UK law into line with European Union legislation. A Liberal Democrat government would also introduce a bill to 'encourage monetary stability through a restructured central bank with operational independence and enhanced regional involvement'. On Europe, the party would legislate to remove Britain's opt-out from Maastricht's social chapter and work to ensure Britain is 'in a position to join a European single currency, if and when one is established'.</p>

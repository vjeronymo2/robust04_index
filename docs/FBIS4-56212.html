			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon; from the "Evening </F> Information Review" program]    [Text] If the U.S. economic blockade were lifted, Cuban  emigrants could invest in the island in prioritized areas, such  as those devoted to promoting exports. When addressing the  plenum of The Nation and the Emigrants Conference, Cuban Vice  President Carlos Lage confirmed emigrants are not deprived of  the right to invest in Cuba, although the specifics of that  process are pending definition.    Future facilities for Cuban-born entrepreneurs are part of  the process of normalizing relations with the expatriate Cuban  community, the first part of which involved holding the  aforementioned conference in Havana last weekend. At that time,  the Cuban Government launched a number of measures aimed at  normalizing ties with emigrants, among them eliminating the  requirement that those who leave the country legally wait five  years before returning.    Young emigrants will also be permitted to study at Cuban  universities provided they defray the cost. Travelers will not  be required to pay for a hotel room upon arriving on the island,  and the Foreign Relations Ministry will create a special  department to deal with the affairs of the expatriate Cuban  community.    Possible emigrant investment in Cuba in the near future  complements the aforementioned measures and reveals the  soundness of previous steps taken to reach the decision.  Recently, a meeting between Cuban officials and Cuban-American  owners and businessmen, known in the United States by its  acronym OCA, was held in Havana to explore the possibility of  joint ventures.    A desire has been expressed by both sides, but that desire  is  stumbling upon the obstacles of the U.S. economic blockade,  worsened by the implementation of the so-called Torricelli Law.  The same emigrants, who met recently in this capital in The  Nation and the Emigrants Conference, agreed on the need to lift  the blockade because, in addition to threatening the very  existence of 11 million Cubans, it blocks the normalization of  ties between Cubans on and off the island.    As stated by some of the participants at the Havana  conference, the Cuban economic opening is being blocked by the  stubborn isolationist policy of Washington.</p>

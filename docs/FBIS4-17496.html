			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 23 Apr -- "Russian President Boris Yeltsin  has been following the Black Sea Fleet situation with great  attention," a statement received by ITAR-TASS from Vyacheslav  Kostikov, press secretary of the Russian president, says. "He is  concerned about the Ukrainian side's open demonstration of its  unwillingness to adhere strictly to the understanding on the  separate basing of the Russian Black Sea Fleet and the Ukrainian  Navy, which was contained in the Moscow agreement.    "The Ukrainian side is making totally inappropriate hints  about the possibility of resolving the contentious issue with  the help of a third power. Needless to say, the Russian side  will not tolerate any outside interference in the question of  the Black Sea Fleet. One has the impression that the Ukrainian  side does not realize what the realities are and is losing  control over the situation. In these circumstances it is  becoming less and less consistent and more unpredictable both in  its actions and in its statements. This constitutes a serious  danger. At the same time it is obvious that the Black Sea Fleet  cannot be used as a hostage of Ukraine's internal political  disagreements.    "In connection with circumstances which have taken shape  Boris Yeltsin is holding intensive political consultations with  competent departments."</p>

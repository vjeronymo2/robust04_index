			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In computing the value of the Index, the current market value of each component stock is multiplied by the number of outstanding shares. The resulting market values are added together to determine the current aggregate market value of the issues in the Index. To compute the current Index value, the aggregate market value is divided by the base market value and multiplied by 100. The base value is adjusted periodically to account for changes in capitalization of any of the component stocks resulting from mergers, acquisitions, listings, and substitutions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Contract Specifications <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed long-term reduced-value XOC options will trade independently of an in addition to currently listed full-value XOC options and will be subject to the same rules that presently govern the trading of full-value XOC options, including sales practice rules, margin requirements, and floor trading procedures. The strike price intervals for the proposed options will be fixed at no less than $2.50, and the proposed options will be aggregated with full-value XOC options for position and exercise limit purposes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PHLX has determined that since positions in the full-value XOC options and those in the proposed reduced-value long-term XOC options are based upon the same underlying stock index, the proposed reduced-value XOC options will be aggregated with full-value XOC options for position and exercise limit purposes. Accordingly, the PHLX proposes to amend PHLX Rule 1001A to state that for aggregation purposes, ten reduced-value long-term XOC options are the equivalent of one full-value XOC contract. Since one full-value XOC contract is equivalent to ten reduced-value XOC contracts, each reduced-value XOC contract will be considered one-tenth of a full-value XOC contract when the contracts are aggregated for position and exercise limit purposes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, under the current XOC position limit of 10,000 contracts, an option holder with no full-size XOC contracts would be permitted to hold 100,000 reduced-value XOC contracts. Similar to full-value XOC options, the proposed reduced-value options will feature American-style exercise. The PHLX will continuously calculate and disseminate the underlying index value for the proposed reduced-value XOC options in addition to the full-value Index. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of the one-tenth reduced-value feature of the proposed options, the reduced-value XOC may vary slightly from one-tenth of the full-value Index. In this regard, the PHLX intends to adopt the following procedure in rounding the reduced-value Index: the PHLX will divide the calculated value of the XOC by ten and round the resulting quotient to the nearest one-hundredth. The digits one through four will be rounded down to the next number and digits five through nine will be rounded up to the next number. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Upon Commission approval of the proposal, the PHLX intends to list initial long-term option series on the new reduced-value XOC with December 1995 and December 1996 expirations. While the initial series listings would have less than 36 months to expiration, thereafter, the PHLX plans to list options with 36-month expirations at each December expiration, resulting in the introduction of a December 1977 expiration after the December 1994 expiration. Initially, three strike prices for calls and puts will be listed at and surrounding the prevailing reduced-value XOC option. However, the Exchange may list only a put or a call if two strike prices are introduced. The Exchange also proposes to list additional strike prices when the market reaches either the highest or lowest existing strike price. The Exchange believes this procedure will result in the listing of only a limited number of series for any expiration, thereby eliminating confusion that might otherwise be caused by a myriad of strike prices and expirations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange expects that its proposed policy of listing strike prices on the reduced-value XOC will permit the offering of options at premiums between $2.00 and $7.00 ($200 to $700 per contract) based upon current market volatility and other pricing considerations. Such premiums appear to be in the desired range of prices that investors have favored in trading index warrants. Such premiums could not be achieved by using full-size XOC options without the listing of strike prices so deeply out of the money and away from the current index value as to offer investors limited ability to participate in the market or protect a portfolio of primarily OTCV stocks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PHLX believes that the proposal is consistent with Section 6 of the Act, in general, and in particular, with Section 6(b)(5), in that it is designed to facilitate transactions in securities and protect investors and the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

When asked if they were ready to resign as a result of the  upper house's disapproval of the political reform bills, State  Minister Yamahana denied his immediate resignation, stating: "I  think I should carefully consider if it is appropriate to resign  right now. I have to consult with the ruling parties about this.  In fact, I am not allowed to determine my course of action at  my own discretion."    Minister of Home Affairs Sato said: "I have the primary  responsibility for the enactment of the reform bills. I should  fulfill my duties by trying my best as a cabinet member at least  until 29 January (when the extraordinary Diet session closes)."</p>

			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / The general with hot line to Yeltsin A letter from General Alexander Korzhakov, head of President Boris Yeltsin's security service, to Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, reveals a bitter struggle within the government over the direction of economic reform. It also shows the power of Gen Korzhakov in areas far beyond his jurisdiction. The general, to whom Mr Yeltsin has referred in his recent memoirs as his closest and most trusted aide, is seen by politicians and other observers as wielding immense power. The letter, a copy of which has been obtained by the FT, directs Mr Chernomyrdin to review decisions to liberalise oil exports, which will narrow the huge gap between domestic and world prices for oil. This is a key issue for both the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in granting loans to Russia. Both the bank and the Fund have recently voiced concern that a plan to introduce domestic quotas for oil distribution will be more restrictive than the existing quotas on exports which are to be lifted. Earlier this week, the Fund's deputy director for Eastern Europe, Mr Ernesto Hernandez-Cata, said that 'we are completely against this proposal'. In the letter, Gen Korzhakov opposes government orders drawn up by Mr Alexander Shokhin, the former deputy prime minister who resigned last month, and signed by Mr Chernomyrdin. They had promised to liberalise exports and to allow non-discriminatory access to oil pipelines for foreign oil companies as a precondition of further loans by the bank. Gen Korzhakov writes that: 'The national economy cannot be strengthened by foreign intervention in the raw material branches of the economy, which make up 60 per cent of Russian exports. The creation of a so-called 'non-discriminatory' access to the pipeline capacity of the oil sector of the economy (in accordance with the demands of the World Bank) means  ..the imposing of a financial agreement profitable to the World Bank, but not for Russia'. Noting that proposed loans to an oil project in Priobsky in Western Siberia (Dollars 500m) and the coal industry (Dollars 500m) would 'increase dependence on foreign capital', Gen Korzhakov says that the effect would be to lower the competitiveness of Russia's export potential in this area. 'That is wholly inadmissible both for the political and for the economic consequences on the country.' He adds: 'We believe it sensible to propose that you entrust first deputy prime minister (Oleg) Soskovets ..to set up a commission to work out an expert view on all the afore-mentioned orders from the point of view of their accordance with national strategy in the area of oil policy and the strengthening of the country's economy.' The 'we' in the last paragraph is not defined, but the letter is headed with the title 'Security Service of the President of the Russian Federation', and is signed by Gen Korzhakov. Those who have seen the letter - which is alarming reformers in the government - do not question its authenticity. The government orders he quotes - signed on August 29, August 30 and September 30 - are all accurately described. Gen Korzhakov was at the centre of another incident earlier this month when security service forces questioned and beat up the personal guard of Mr Vladimir Gusinsky, chairman of the Most Financial Group. Though President Yeltsin apologised, no inquiry appears to have been held.</p>

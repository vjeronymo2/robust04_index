			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 31 Mar (MENA)--Interior Minister Hasan  al-Alfi has voiced optimism over developments in the overall  confrontation of terrorists in view of the painful blows  recently dealt by the security agencies to the terrorist  organizations.    In an interview with today's AL-JUMHURIYAH, al-Alfi noted  that public opinion has exposed the terrorists for what they  really are -- outlaws who have nothing to do with religion and  whose goal is to terrorize the people, spread panic, and disrupt  stability. Consequently, he added, the public now sympathizes  with the state in its efforts to eliminate terrorism.    Minister al-Alfi pointed out that through cooperation with  Arab and Asian states, Egypt has repatriated 29 fugitives from  abroad. More is to come. He noted that coordination is now  under way among all the ministries and competent authorities as  part of the overall confrontation. He stressed that everybody  is in the same boat in the face of terrorism.    The interior minister urged the public to report any  deviation or shortcomings. He said that corruption is as  serious as terrorism, because they are two sides of the same  coin and both must be confronted.    Al-Alfi described the terrorists as outlaws who promote  ideas  that incite the overthrow of the regime by force; these are the  same ideas that they use to penetrate the youth's minds. He  emphasized that contacts exist among the various terrorist  organizations, as evidenced by the terrorists' confessions.  Their objective, he added, is to destabilize the regime and  embarrass the government. Toward that end, they came up with new  ideas, such as striking at tourist and economic installations,  he added.    The minister noted that cooperation exists among the Arab  interior ministers to confront the misleading ideologies as well  as the groups preaching such ideologies, because most of the  Arab states have started to realize the gravity of the ideas of  these gangs, which have become a threat to their regimes. These  groups use the same slogans, training methods, and even the same  instructors, he added. Proof of this is that bombs used in  Tunis, for instance, were made up of the same substances and  components as those used in Egypt, he added.    Al-Alfi expressed his belief that brainwashing of those who  join these organizations explains why particular individuals  carry out suicide operations. He noted that these organizations  receive continuing and considerable financial support. He said  that $15,000 and 20,000 pounds were seized from one of these  terrorist groups.    Asked about the possibility of initiating a dialogue with  these groups, al-Alfi asked: With whom will we hold a dialogue?  With a group of killers who use arms to promote ideological and  religious terrorism? He pointed out that holding a dialogue  with these groups would mean that their Islam is true and ours  is false.    Al-Alfi pointed out that Egypt is a state of institutions  and  has its laws and Constitution. He said dialogue can be held  with legal and recognized organizations in accordance with the  Constitution. Otherwise, the result would be chaos and  confusion. If anyone wants to be active he can join any legal  organization. He said: Those in charge of security want a  national dialogue to inform them of every legitimate view  through the constitutionally acknowledged organizations, noting  that there should be a bold comprehensive confrontation of  terrorism for the sake of Egypt.    Al-Alfi stressed that arms licenses must be restricted to a  minimum and be in accordance with the law. He said there should  be ample justification for carrying arms so as to prevent arms  from reaching terrorists. He noted that most arms being used by  terrorists are either brought in from abroad or left over from  the wars in Sinai. He noted that depots housing tons of TNT  were seized because there are some nomads who collect arms and  explosives from private depots to sell to anyone who pays.    On the role of art in the confrontation of terrorism,  al-Alfi  stressed that art plays a major and important role because it  influences the literate and illiterate masses through a quick  and facile presentation of facts.</p>

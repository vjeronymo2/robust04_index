			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Arts: Driven out of the intellect business - Television So this is the fabled autumn season, is it? The one which is supposed to redeem the reputations of the broadcasters after a summer full of repeats and cheap imports? Yet many viewers seem unimpressed. Their feelings are summed up by the novelist Jill Paton Walsh, featured in the regular Guardian item 'My Media' on Monday. Of television she said: 'We watch it less and less. We're not even going to have a TV set in our second home in Cornwall - John said it wasn't worth having one just to watch elephants at water holes. We see Newsnight and The Late Show, and nature programmes and good drama. But we increasingly feel TV is no longer directed at people like us: middlebrow, moderately intellectual'. 'No longer directed at people like us . . .' Of course the new season has brought new series, though as usual some called 'new' are geriatrically old. University Challenge, for instance, first appeared in 1962. Switching it from ITV to BBC2 and sticking Jeremy Paxman in Bamber Gascoigne's chair does not make it new. Actually it makes it rather inferior because with Gascoigne you always felt that he knew the answers without being told, whereas Paxman gives the impression that he would like you to think he knew but has sneaked a look at the card. In the case of The Moral Maze the programme is genuinely new to this medium (BBC2 again) but is another example of television's increasingly frequent piracy on the radio seas. Of course the brains trust pre-dates all forms of broadcasting, but this particular team has been hijacked whole from Radio 4. As so often with talk shows, the formula works better on radio where you do not have to look at Janet Daley's hairdo, or wonder why David Starkey seems different from his last appearance (he has shaved off his moustache). Most heavily hyped of all the borrowings from radio is Knowing Me, Knowing You in which Steve Coogan in his Alan Partridge persona plays a chat show host of such embarrassing crassness that I find it hard to watch. This is another instance - Nigel Planer's spoof master class in acting was a previous notable example - where material sufficient for a brilliant 10-minute sketch has been pulled out like chewing gum to stretch across not just a whole programme but an entire series. The fifth time you hear 'Knowing me, Alan Partridge, knowing you Charlie Farnsbarns. Aha' you fidget. The tenth time you grind your teeth. The 15th time you change channels. The complaint is not that the material on British television this autumn is unprofessional. All four of the terrestrial channels, which still account for more than 93 per cent of viewing, can point to new series that have been superbly well made, for instance the 'family at war' serial Seaforth on BBC1, the documentary series Reputations on BBC2, the series about a police psychologist, Cracker, on ITV, and the topical light entertainment series Rory Bremner, Who Else? on Channel 4. The complaint is twofold: that so many programmes now aim chiefly at maximising ratings, and that, however good, they all represent types of programming that are well tried and tested. Where is the fizz, the buzz, the dangerous novelty? Most of all, where is the programme that makes you want to switch on because it feels as though it really is in touch with what is happening in the world today, in a 'moderately intellectual' way? Watching Labour Party Live on BBC1 and BBC2 last week you began to wonder whether we might have reached a historic watershed with the Blair faction in the Labour Party finally leaving 1945 and Beveridge behind and looking out across new territory. Perhaps 'communitarianism' is what it is all about and politics will henceforth focus on smaller units. Perhaps, conversely, politics is becoming irresistibly international. Peter Jay's engrossing report on Panorama this week suggested that the old restraints of national boundaries are being removed from the world of employment (or unemployment) and wages. The conference coverage and the Panorama report were, of course, as topical as you could ask. Furthermore there have been programmes in the recent past which have capitalised (ho ho) on the collapse of communism in eastern Europe; the final programme in BBC2's Reputations series, for example, provided a portrait of Beria which could not have been made before the Soviet archives were opened up. So, as we might expect, it is not a question of broadcasters being blind to what is going on around them. However, such programmes are relatively rare; far, far more time is occupied by programmes such as Seaforth, yet another authentically filmed yarn beginning in the second world war, or The Danny Baker Show, a chat show which has already been reduced to the desperate old ploy of featuring another chat show host (Jonathan Ross) as guest. It is impossible to avoid the conclusion that television has been virtually driven out of the intellect business and into the market place. Those mainly to blame are the politicians whose tunnel vision, fear, and spite were largely responsible for the last lot of broadcasting legislation, though they were helped by top broadcasting executives who much too readily accepted the 'nothing wrong with ratings' philosophy. It is not professional skills that are being lost; technically speaking our programme makers get better and better. What is disappearing is the work which used to make British television a truly significant element within our society. The change is strikingly exemplified by the Channel 4 series Alan Bleasdale Presents which uses as a come-on the name of a man known for his outspokenness and for an idiosyncratic sort of drama which provided the nation with the phrase 'Gissa job'. Last night's offering was a glossy TV movie called 'Requiem Apache' which offered yet another variation on the familiar old theme of the retired slick operator (spy, safe-breaker, whatever - in this case a getaway driver) who is wanted by his former colleagues to do another job. It was slickly made and impressively cast, albeit somewhat thin in plotting for its 90 minutes, yet often funny. All the dramas in this series come from new writers and this, from actor Raymond Murtagh, was certainly full of promise. But apart from the professionalism there was nothing in it which you would associate with the sort of work that Alan Bleasdale stands for. The car chase was good, the use of music - for once - excellent, the photography lovely, and the ratings may well prove impressive. But I doubt whether Jill Paton Walsh will see it as a reason for having a television in that second home in Cornwall.</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Tottenham forced to tackle second forecast from Venables MR ALAN SUGAR, chairman of Tottenham Hotspur, yesterday launched another salvo in the increasingly bitter battle with Mr Terry Venables, the former chief executive Tottenham said yesterday that it had been forced to make a statement to the Stock Exchange following 'another profits forecast blunder' by Mr Venables. The company said Mr Venables had, in response to a question on the television programme Sport in Question, stated that profits would be Pounds 4.7m for the 10 months to May 1993. This was the second unauthorised public statement on company profits made by Mr Venables in recent months, Tottenham said. 'The company wished to make it clear that this statement is wholly unauthorised and is based on the latest unaudited management accounts for the company which are subject to amendment and are intended for private circulation only,' a statement said. 'The company stands by the profit statement made in response to a previous public statement made by Mr Venables, which indicated pre-tax profits for the first 10 months ended March 31 of approximately Pounds 4m.' Tottenham has given an undertaking not to remove Mr Venables from the board before his court case in the autumn which seeks to force Mr Sugar to sell his 47 per cent stake. The undertaking is expected to remain in place in spite of the latest statement. Mr Venables holds 23 per cent. Mr Venables also stated on the programme, broadcast on Carlton TV on Monday night, that he intended to lodge a Pounds 1m claim for wrongful dismissal over the loss of his job as chief executive. In the latest twist to the increasingly personal battle between the two former friends, Mr Sugar claimed in the statement made yesterday that Barclays Bank would allow an overdraft facility only if he and Mr Colin Sandy, the finance director, remained on the board.</p>

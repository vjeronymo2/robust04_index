			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 19 (XINHUA) -- The United States  supports UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's proposal to  broaden NATO authority to use air power in Bosnia and will press  for stiffer sanctions on Serbia, U.S. officials said.    The new military and diplomatic initiatives will be  presented  to NATO allies for discussion this week in Brussels, the  ASSOCIATED PRESS quoted a senior administration official as  saying.    The decision was made after two sessions of meeting between  President Bill Clinton and his foreign policy team, but no  further details were released yet on the latest U.S. Bosnia  policy.    Washington would also continue consulting with Russia and  the  United Nations on Bosnia, the official said.    Earlier today, when appearing on the MTV, Clinton said he  welcomed Russian President Boris Yeltsin's statement urging the  Bosnian Serbs to honor their cease-fire pledges but saw the  Russian suggestion for an international conference on the crisis  as premature though it "deserves serious consideration."    Without further elaboration, Clinton said he will announce a  new U.S. policy on Bosnia very soon.    At the Pentagon, Spokesman Dennis Boxx said Clinton and his  national security advisors discussed both military and  non-military options on Bosnia.    Clinton's Special Envoy Charles Redman has returned from  Bosnia to join the consultations in Washington.    Secretary of State Warren Christopher talked twice on Monday  with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd over the phone and  would call French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe today, State  Department Spokesman Michael McCurry said.</p>

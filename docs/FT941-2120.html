			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Oils on the alert The oil sectors provided the market's two highest turnover stocks in BP and Lasmo, ahead of what is viewed by oil analysts as a crucial Opec meeting in Geneva on Friday. Oil specialists were saying yesterday that stories emanating from the Middle East suggested that the most likely outcome of the talks was a roll-over of the current output agreement for a further two quarters. 'If that is the case then there is probably scope for a further Dollars 1 slide in oil prices to around the Dollars 12.50 a barrel level,' said one analyst. BP was the market's biggest turnover stock with 7.6m traded, as the shares edged up 3 1/2 to 371p as some of the market's action funds adopted an aggressively positive view of Friday's Opec meeting. Shell, on the other hand, dipped 2 1/2 to 670p, after talk of switching into BP. Lasmo shares were sustained throughout the session, closing a penny ahead at 131p on 7.2m traded following keen support by one of the big international marketmaking firms. Lasmo is due to announce preliminary figures tomorrow.</p>

Morton Plant Health System, Inc. and Trustees of Mease Hospital, Inc. No. 94&hyph;748&hyph;CIV&hyph;T&hyph;23E (M.D., Fla., Filed May 5, 1994) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> On behalf of my client, a nursing contractor doing business in Pinellas County Florida, this public comment is being submitted as there is considerable concern that the combination of Morton Plant and Mease may substantially lessen competition in the provision of health care services in North Pinellas County in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 18. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, the gravamen of my client's concern lies in the suspicion that should the merger go forward, staff relief nurses and other health care professionals will be injured. At 59 Fed. Reg. 357555 (July 13, 1994), Part VI (B) Independent Activities, the Final Consent Judgment reads as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Morton Plant and Mease shall each price and sell its services, both those owned and operated and operated separately and those purchased from the Partnership, in active competition with each other. Morton Plant and Mease shall each exercise its own independent judgment on how to market and price its patient care services and shall not discuss, communicate, or exchange with each other or any other hospital information relating to the marketing, pricing, negotiating, or contracting of any patient care services, including those purchased from the Partnership. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On information and belief Morton Plant has participated in predatory pricing. Morton Plant together with nineteen of twenty-three major hospitals in the Tampa Bay area previously engaged in activities which set forth a federal anti-trust investigation. This investigation was conducted in 1988&hyph;9 to look into alleged abuses by the hospitals. An organization by the name of SASSA alleged that the nineteen hospitals were acting in concert to attempt to eliminate competition in the staff relief nurse industry throughout the Tampa Bay area, and to drive prices below community standards for the relief nurses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the federal investigation of the anti-trust activities ended when the hospitals dropped their plan, the hospitals have continued to act in concert to try to eliminate competition in the staff relief nurse industry and to drive prices below community standards for the relief nurses. A new alliance was formed after the 1988&hyph;9 investigation called the Bay Area Hospital Council. (BAHC). BAHC has actively recruited foreign nurses to supply area hospitals with cheaper temporary nurses, and this collective activity has further damaged the nursing contractor that this firm represents, as the foreign relief nurses have been working for wages well below community standards for temporary nurses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although Morton Plant has engaged in utilizing relief nurses on H&hyph;1A nurses, Mease has not. The nursing contractor this firm represents has been doing business with Mease, but had been doing no business at all with Morton Plant, until the contractor would agree to do business with Morton Plant at rates below community standards for relief workers. This demand for cheaper rates commanded by Morton Plant has still not translated into significant return of business to the contractor who had historically provided Morton Plant with a large portion of its staff relief nurses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Should the merger go forward, there will certainly be an adverse affect on staff relief nurses desiring to work in north Pinellas County, in that their ability to work at Mease Hospital will be uncertain, should Mease be influenced by the practices that Morton Plant has adopted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further information has been supplied to Jerome Hoffman of the Florida Attorney General's Office in Tallahassee, Florida. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> Sincerely, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Ann Elaine Castro P.A. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SIGNER> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Tomkins jumps 50% to Pounds 257m: Chief executive finds share price 'depressing' but foresees further acquisitions Mr Gregory Hutchings, chief executive of Tomkins, yesterday expressed astonishment at the industrial conglomerate's low share price after it announced a better-than-expected 50 per cent jump in pre-tax profits to Pounds 257m. 'We win every match and we are still bottom of the league,' he said. He pointed to the 14 per cent increase in earnings per share to 15.1p in the year to April, compared with a UK average of 6 per cent. Yet the shares have underperformed the market by almost 30 per cent since it announced its Pounds 990m bid for Ranks Hovis McDougall in October 1992. They rose just 1/2 p to 218p yesterday. The RHM businesses contributed profits of Pounds 102.5m and enhanced earnings per share by 'at least' 4 per cent despite a bitter price war in the volume bread market. 'We have always delivered to shareholders what we said we would, which is what makes the share price so depressing,' said Mr Hutchings. He added that the lowly share rating would not prevent the group taking advantage of acquisition opportunities. 'With a very strong balance sheet we could gear up if we saw a major acquisition.' He stressed that nothing was presently being contemplated and any large deal would be outside its main businesses. 'We like being a diversified company.' Dividends rose 16 per cent to 7.38p, after a final payment of 5.3p, which Mr Hutchings said reflected the group's strong cash flow and good growth prospects. 'We are very optimistic and excited about the future. We are in the best position we have ever been.' He said that the integration of RHM was largely going to plan although delays in the delivery of capital equipment had pushed back the rationalisation programme. It has spent Pounds 23.3m out of the Pounds 81.2m provision set up for reorganisation. Profits from milling and baking rose to Pounds 22.1m on sales of Pounds 682.2m - compared with a 21-week contribution of Pounds 1.4m on turnover of Pounds 287.9m the previous year - but return on capital employed was still 'unsatisfactory'. The Mr Kipling cakes business has been disappointing and bread baking suffered from the price war, which Tomkins estimated had cost the main supermarket chains more than Pounds 50m in the last nine months. Profits from food products rose to Pounds 80.4m on turnover of Pounds 939.5m, against Pounds 28.4m on sales of Pounds 374.9m, and Mr Hutchings said there was 'a lot more still to come'. Profits from the non-food businesses rose 13 per cent to Pounds 130.6m on turnover of Pounds 1.62bn (Pounds 1.32bn). US housing and housing-related activities had a second year of 'solid growth'. The lawnmowers business performed well, but bicycle margins suffered from the threat of Chinese competition. Tomkins generates half its profits in dollars and a hedged rate of Dollars 1.59, compared with Dollars 1.76m the previous year, added about 4.5 per cent to sterling profits on translation. This year's rate is Dollars 1.48, giving it a gain of more than 3 per cent. The company said the UK was at last showing some signs of emerging from recession with companies serving the light engineering and housing markets seeing some pick-up. Tomkins ended the year with net cash of Pounds 156m, after spending Pounds 100m on the acquisition of Noma Industries, and shareholders' funds rose to Pounds 897.8m (Pounds 802.0m). Broker Hoare Govett forecasts profits of Pounds 300m this year with earnings up 19 per cent at 17.9p. Lex, Page 20</p>

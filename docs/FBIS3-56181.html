			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "Hold the Front Page!" </F> rubric: "President Checks Up on `Ostankino'"]    [Text] On Wednesday [12 January], a presidential  commission of 15 persons began a sweeping audit of the financial  activities of the "Ostankino" television and radio company and  of all subordinated enterprises. The commission comprises  representatives of control and auditing administrations under  the president, the tax police, and the Russian Federation  Finance Ministry. In all probability, some of the facts that  have been revealed and already reported by MOSKOVSKIY  KOMSOMOLETS and that further investigation may prove to be gross  financial violations, made Yakovlev ask the president to order a  checkup at the state level.    MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS has learned from competent sources  that the commission is supposed to pay special attention to  Lazutkin, former first deputy general director of "Ostankino,"  who currently holds the position of first deputy head of the  Russian Federation Federal Service for Television and Radio  Broadcasting. By all appearances, the commission will show  special interest in the agreement Lazutkin signed between  "Ostankino," the State Television and Radio Fund headed at the  time by Kornilov (currently under investigation on charges of  taking a $5,000 bribe), and the "YuSSYu- Art-Group" entitling  the Americans to rights to Russian music archives.</p>

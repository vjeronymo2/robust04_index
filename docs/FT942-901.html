			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Company News (This Week): Hope of acceleration to break-even point - Fiat Mr Gianni Agnelli, chairman of Fiat, Italy's biggest private-sector industrial group, should tell shareholders on Thursday that the group expects to break even this year at net profit level. In May, Fiat revealed the biggest loss in its 95-year history - L1,783bn (Pounds 731.9m) compared with a net profit of L551bn (Pounds 226.2m) in 1992  -and decided not to pay a dividend on ordinary shares for the first time since 1947. But 1993 now appears to have been the low point. This year, the group should benefit from gradual improvement in its main sectors - cars, trucks, and building and farm equipment - and especially from the success of the Punto range of small cars. The Punto leads a wave of new models to be launched in the next three years under the group's Fiat, Lancia and Alfa Romeo brands. Restructuring and cost-cutting across the group should also help profitability, and the innovative 'integrated' car factory in southern Italy spearheads a shift in Fiat's manufacturing culture, according to the group. On Thursday, shareholders should approve a potential increase in Fiat's maximum nominal share capital, to L10,000bn from L5,000bn, because last year's rights issue - which raised L5,000bn - took the company up to the limit of its issued share capital. But the group should not have to draw on the facility in the near future.</p>

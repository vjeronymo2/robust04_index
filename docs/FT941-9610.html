			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Sinister note Sir, The statement by Sir Robin Butler, head of the Home Civil Service, to the Scott inquiry will be given a sympathetic hearing by many who agree that the reporting may have pre-judged the issue ('Civil service head asks Scott to 'undo damage' of inquiry', February 10). Unfortunately, the statement includes a remark which appears most sinister in its implications. Sir Robin claims that 'the victims (the civil servants) are often middle-ranking officials who could not have expected to be thrust into the limelight'. Does he mean that they did expect not to be found out? Or is he perhaps claiming safe haven for them because they were only following orders? From time to time even middle-ranking officials have to take courage, stand up and be counted, preferably long before the matter comes to public inquiry.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 28 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean economy  is picking up faster than expected, with the Gross National  Product (GNP) growing 8.8 percent in January-March, the Bank of  Korea [BOK] said Friday.    The healthy nature of the growth led by the manufacturing  industry and facility investment, compared with the overheating  in the construction sector and consumption in the 1980s and  early 1990s, brightens economic prospects even more, BOK  officials said after studying the tentative estimate.    Accordingly, the central bank raised its forecast for this  year's economic growth to above 7 percent from last December's  6.3 percent, but voiced fears of economic overheating due to  shaky prices and increasing consumption.    GNP was 51.48 trillion won in terms of 1990 constant prices  (63. 8 billion U.S. dollars in current exchange rate) in the  first quarter of the year, up 8.8 percent from 47.43 trillion  won a year earlier.    The growth is the highest since 10.7 percent in April-June  1991 while the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) also soared 9.1  percent during this period, again the most since the second  quarter of 1991.    Facility investment and a recovery in the manufacturing  sector were major contributors to the better-than-expected  economic growth in the first months of the year.    Due to high hopes of an economic rebound, facility  investment  surged 20.2 percent, the highest since 23.7 percent in  January-March 1988, thanks to 21.3-percent growth solely in  machinery.    Manufacturing grew 9.8 percent, the most since 11.5 percent  in the winter of 1991, with the light industry increasing 1.2  percent for the first time since spring 1992 and the heavy and  chemical industry rising 13.2 percent.    Electric, gas, and water works rose 16.1 percent: service,  10.3 percent, and construction, 8.2 percent. Agriculture and  forestry, which decreased 6.8 percent last winter, rebounded  with 4.8-percent growth. Commodity and service exports  increased 8.9 percent.    External conditions look good, with an improved world  economy  and a strong yen, and facility investment at home should be  active, BOK Governor Kim Myong-ho said.    Should this trend continue, the domestic economy may well  rise above 7 percent this year, he said.    But there are signs of economic overheating.    Consumption in January-March hit 3.3 percent and the  current-  account deficit surged four times to 2.52 billion U.S. dollars  from a year earlier with imports on the rise.    Household consumption also hit 6.9 percent, the highest  since  7. 1 percent in April-June 1992.</p>

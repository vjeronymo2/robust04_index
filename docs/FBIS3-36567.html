			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Split in PRAVDA"] </F>   [Text] Yesterday, Aleksandr Ilin spent his first day as  newly elected editor in chief of PRAVDA.    The ousted Viktor Linnik, former PRAVDA editor in chief,  told  your MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS correspondent in a telephone  interview that yesterday a meeting of the editorial board was  held under Ilin's chairmanship to discuss the newspaper's  future. The new editor in chief formed a new lineup of the  editorial board. A number of Viktor Linnik's loyalists, who  were offered jobs on PRAVDA's new board, categorically rejected  the offer. MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS already reported on Sunday  that Linnik and a part of the newspaper's staff think the  general meeting's decision on leadership change to be unlawful,  because the meeting was attended by less than half of the  newspaper's staffers.    For the time being, however, there is dual power reigning in  the publication. Both Linnik and Ilin continue to occupy their  former offices -- the former, the editor in chief's; the latter,  the deputy editor's. According to Ilin, from now on, thanks to  straightening out the conflict with Steel Light Holding, a Greek  company, the newspaper will be published daily. By the time  MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS was signed into press, however, no order  to print PRAVDA had been given to the Pressa publishing house's  printing shops.</p>

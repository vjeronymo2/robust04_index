			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Education and the election and the politicians who seek to influence it - were well illustrated in two weekend news stories. On Friday, government and opposition vied to claim authorship of plans to improve reading standards based on schemes which have achieved remarkable results in New Zealand. The determination of both parties to give priority to reading and increase funds for raising standards is a welcome sign of the new consensus emerging across the party divide. That consensus covers much of the education field. Targets, standards and regular pupil testing are here to stay. There is agreement on the need to pay teachers adequately, the importance of developing an effective 'vocational' route through school and college, and the urgency of improving staying-on rates at 16 and at 18. After 20 years of chopping and changing, much of it dogma-driven, teachers and parents might feel that they can look forward to greater consistency of approach, whichever party is in government. Any such belief must have been rudely shattered on Saturday, when Mr Kenneth Clarke, the education secretary, announced his proposals for an upheaval in the teacher training system. He wants to shift the burden for training teachers from the colleges to the schools - already struggling to digest a series of changes from the national curriculum and testing to the local management of their budgets. There is certainly no consensus for these proposals, which have been roundly attacked by the opposition and appear to enjoy only qualified support from the inspectorate. Failure to consult Other recent pronouncements show a similar failure to consult widely or consider expert opinion. In November 1980, Mr Clarke introduced a bill to restore collective bargaining to teachers. Without public notice or consultation, it was withdrawn in April. A substitute bill was rushed through to set up a pay review body. In May, it was announced (again without consultation) that further education colleges were to be divorced from local education authorities. The main aim, it seemed, was to reduce council spending rather than improve further education. In the summer, Mr Clarke set up a two-month inquiry into the future of Her Majesty's Inspectorate. He refused to publish its report, and is implementing with extraordinary haste a scheme for privatising the inspection of schools which reportedly differs significantly from that recommended by his own inquiry. Last month he set up an inquiry into under-11 teaching - and gave it just two months to turn the primary school world upside down. Panicky electioneering This all reeks of panicky electioneering. It insults the professionalism of the teachers without whose co-operation no education reforms can succeed. And - in the long run, perhaps most damaging of all - it creates conflict and dissension where, with a calmer and more consensual approach, it could be minimised. The priority now is to stop making endless policy on the hoof, and find a way of establishing a firm consensus which can take the UK into the 21st century. The future shape of UK's education provision needs to be examined, fully and calmly, taking evidence from all in the field, and looking abroad in the process. Two of the broad issues which need to be addressed are these: to what extent should the education system be planned and run by the state? And how should it be financed? The safeguarding of basic educational standards and opportunities must, of course, be a state responsibility. But it is not coincidental that the most successful parts of the system are those in which Whitehall and Westminster have interfered least - the universities, the independent schools and local authority nursery schools. The first two also happen to be the best resourced - which ought to lead to some searching questions beyond the election. This is the first in a series on British education policy</p>

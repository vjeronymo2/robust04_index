			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Wet, wet, wet: The drought is finally over I suppose you could say the drought has ended,' is the cautious response from the UK National Rivers Authority (NRA) - and much of the water industry  -to the past week's deluge. Six days of near-constant rainfall have flooded much of Wales, the west country and the Thames valley, prompting evacuation of villages, slaughtering of livestock and causing an estimated Pounds 1m damage in Wales alone. This autumn is the wettest for eight years, with nearly one and a half times the usual amount of rain. It has brought an end to one of the century's worst droughts and to several years of disruption for householders in the south-east, where water is scarcest. Earlier this spring, after the fourth successive dry winter, 6.5m people in the south-east were banned from using hosepipes. Two water companies - Anglian and Essex - also made headlines last month by announcing that they would start the compulsory installation of household water meters to encourage people to use less water. But as householders stare out at their waterlogged gardens they would be entitled to ask how effectively the authorities would respond during the next drought. Their concerns will have increased after this week's report by Ofwat, the water industry regulator, that 22 per cent of treated water is lost through leaky pipes and mains - enough to fill 48m baths a day. The water companies are anxious to point out that the levels of the water tables are not yet back to normal - in east Anglia the level is still near its all-time low. Echoing the now-famous British Rail excuse, several water companies have blamed the weather for delivering 'the wrong kind of rain'. It has fallen in the wrong place - four times heavier over Wales and the south-west, which had no shortages, than over the dry south-east. And it has fallen too fast, saturating the top soil and then running off into the sea without time to percolate down to the water table. 'If this winter is wet it will solve a lot of problems, but we really need another one to get back to normal,' said Ms Emer O'Connell of the NRA. Customers may have found the shortages inconvenient, but the water companies are proud of their 'drought-busting' efforts over the past few years. Mr Alan Smith, group managing director of Anglian Water, in the driest part of England, said: 'This drought was far worse than the 1976 one and we were much better prepared this time - we had a 12-month hosepipe ban which ended last winter, but no essential supplies were affected.' Since the drought started, Anglian has spent Pounds 25m on linking the wettest and driest parts of its region, which should reduce the impact of any future droughts. Could they have done more? Mr Smith argues that 'whether to carry out drought work is always a dilemma. We don't want to waste money by having an asset lying in the ground unused and at the end of the day what we spend has to be reflected in customer charges.' Although an engineers' report in the summer concluded that Anglian could spend 'a hundred million pounds' on anti-drought measures if it chose, 'we had concluded by mid-September we were not going to do it'. Other companies, commenting on this week's Ofwat report, are also adamant that plugging leaks would not have offered an an easy solution, contrary to public impressions. Cambridge Water maintains that its leakage rate is already nearly half the national average, in common with many companies in regions where water is scarce. Water companies also say that it is often very expensive to the point of being uneconomic to detect and fix leaks in pipes buried several metres underground. However, others in the industry say privately that some problems could have been tackled earlier. One southern executive called hosepipe bans 'the easy option' compared to spending money. Ms Janet Langdon, director of the Water Services Association (WSA), which represents the 10 large water and sewerage companies, says that 'lack of investment in the past' before the WSA companies were privatised in 1989 is partly to blame for shortages. Few companies are willing to say that there will never be hosepipe bans again, but many are confident that they are now protected against the vagaries of the weather. Mr Roderick Paul, chief executive of the Birmingham-based Severn Trent which has just opened a Pounds 109m reservoir said: 'Comfortable is an awful word to use, but water is not a problem because we planned for it.' Although the drought has grabbed the public imagination, southern companies believe they need to spend more attention and money on coping with the rapidly rising population in their regions. Demand for water in East Anglia has been rising by nearly a quarter per decade as more people move in, attracted by Stansted airport and the new roads which will make Cambridge a key junction. Without new measures, lack of water year-round could eventually 'be a real problem', according to Mr Smith. That means plans for metering are probably here to stay, even if they are resented by customers. It means, too, that some companies may seek to open reservoirs and boreholes, even though this would provoke opposition from environmental groups and need lengthy negotiation with the NRA. The costs of meeting that demand will also, in one way or another, make its way onto customers' bills. The drought is over, but the problems of long-term water shortages in the south-east are not.</p>

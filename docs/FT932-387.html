			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Japan The Japanese government bond market is caught between political uncertainty and favourable economic fundamentals. Having retreated since the grip of the Liberal Democratic Party was called into question, real yields of around 4.4 per cent at the longer maturities are back close to the five-year average. Yet even on the rose-tinted view of recovery favoured by the authorities, inflation is unlikely to rise much above the current 1 per cent. Since the Japanese currency has now resumed its upward march, the chances are that a strong yen will add to the cyclical pain. That points to the kind of sluggish recovery in which bonds flourish. If political deadlock prevents a further fiscal stimulus this year, the Bank of Japan might respond with another cut in interest rates. That is unlikely to bring inflationary pressure while domestic demand remains so weak. As elsewhere, investors may move to longer maturities in search of income as short-term rates are cut. Given Japan's relatively comfortable government finances, bond yields could again fall below 4 per cent. Political reform may even prove favourable in the longer term. Liberalisation of agricultural markets and greater import penetration favoured by some of the break-away parties might result in lower consumer prices, for example. Given the respectable showing of the LDP in Tokyo's local elections, it would not do to take anything as bold for granted. But there is nothing in the emerging political chemistry which should spread gloom across the bond market.</p>

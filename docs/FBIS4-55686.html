			<p>BFN     [Text] Upon returning from their visit to the Russian  Federation, the members of the Serbian Civic Council [SKV] held  a news conference, at which they informed reporters about the  contacts that they had made with the representatives of the  Russian Government and the Russian Patriarchy. During this  visit, Russian Federation representative Churkin was informed  about the views of the SKV that the Bosnian issue can be solved  through political negotiations. The best evidence of that is  the agreement signed in Washington, stressed Mirko Pejanovic,  member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency and SKV chairman.  The Russian Federation is firmly committed to the sovereignty  and the territorial integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina within its  internationally recognized borders, and the unity of the city of  Sarajevo, he said.    During their visit to the Russian Federation, the members of  the SKV had meetings with the representatives of the Russian  Orthodox Church, and informed them about the extent of  destruction of the Bosniak religious shrines in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    An invitation was extended to Russian Federation President  Boris Yeltsin during their stay in Moscow to visit Sarajevo.</p>

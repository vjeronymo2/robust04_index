			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / International Company News: Westpac shares fall after Packer resigns from board WESTPAC, the troubled Australian bank, was plunged into renewed uncertainty yesterday after Mr Kerry Packer and an associate resigned from the board following a dispute about the bank's restructuring programme. Westpac shares fell 13 cents to ADollars 2.91 after the resignations, underlining market concern about the departure of Mr Packer, proprietor of the Consolidated Press Holdings media group, and Mr Al Dunlap, ConsPress managing director. Analysts said the shares were likely to come under further pressure unless the resignations were properly explained. However, ConsPress said neither Mr Packer nor Mr Dunlap would comment. Westpac said the resignations followed a 'disagreement' about management of the restructuring programme, announced late last year after the bank announced a record net loss of ADollars 1.5bn (USDollars 1bn) for the year to the end of September. The dispute is believed to have centred on the pace of restructuring and the choice of a managing director to replace Mr Frank Conroy, who resigned in December following pressure from Mr Packer and other major shareholders. Mr Packer is believed to have sought the appointment of Mr Dunlap, an American corporate restructuring specialist who has carried out a successful shake-up at ConsPress over the past year. Westpac said a replacement for Mr Conroy would be announced before the bank's annual meeting next week, when the board is expected to be the target of strong criticism from shareholders. Mr John Uhrig, chairman, said the board had agreed to accelerate the restructuring programme by cutting between 10 per cent and 20 per cent of staff over the next three years. The bank also plans to cut costs and improve revenue by ADollars 300m a year, reduce the ratio of expenses to revenue from 70 per cent to 58 per cent, and cut corporate lending risks by ADollars 10bn by 1995. Mr Packer is believed to have sought a much faster redundancy programme and a bigger reduction in corporate lending, which would have reduced Westpac's assets from ADollars 110bn to well below ADollars 100bn. Mr Packer and Mr Dunlap formally joined the Westpac board last week after ConsPress acquired nearly 10 per cent of Westpac's shares, close to the ceiling allowed under federal banking law. ConsPress could lift its holding to a maximum of 15 per cent, but only with the consent of Mr John Dawkins, the federal treasurer and the Westpac board. Westpac has been in difficulties since the failure in October of a ADollars 1.72bn rights issue which closed 72 per cent undersubscribed, leaving many sub-underwriters holding unwanted shares. Five directors resigned after the rights issue debacle, including the then chairman. The bank's shares, which traded at about ADollars 4.50 at the beginning of 1991, fell to a low of about ADollars 2.65 in November after the announcement of the record loss. Documents filed with the Australian Securities Commission, the corporate watchdog, showed that ConsPress increased net profits to ADollars 467m in the year to June 30, compared with ADollars 17.6m in the previous year. The documents showed that the shake-up masterminded by Mr Dunlap included the sale of more than 90 companies, leaving the company debt-free.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vasiliy Romanovskiy: "Serbian Brothers, Our </F> Hearts Are With You"]    [Text] Yesterday, representatives of the Belaya Rus Slavic  Assembly, the Officers' Union, the Communist Party of Belarus,  the Movement for Democracy, Social Progress, and Justice, and  other social organizations gathered by the U.S. Embassy in Minsk  to protest the bombing of Serbian positions by U.S. Air Force  fighters. The picketers -- who came armed with the slogans  "Serbian brothers, our hearts are with you," "Yankee go home;  Serbian soil will burn under your feet," and "Belarusians demand  punishment for killing our brothers in Yugoslavia" -- burned a  symbolic U.S. flag and passed a statement to embassy officials  addressed to the U.S. President and American people, which reads:    "We are filled with indignation over the barbaric U.S.  bombardment of civilian targets in Yugoslavia. With great  anxiety over the fate of the world, we protest against this  inhuman policy. All attempts on the part of Belarusian society  to prevent this insane step have been left unanswered by the  U.S. administration, which does not want to listen to the voice  of reason. The Slavic world will not leave this act of  vandalism unanswered.    ``The war in Yugoslavia has testified to the entire world  that the freedom-loving Serbian people are unvanquished, and  that military intervention will only lead to the outbreak of a  new world war... Stop before it is too late!''    "This quite unlawful action," Nikolay Sergeyev, cochairman  of  the Slav Assembly Duma, told a VECHERNIY MINSK correspondent,  "testifies to the fact that the United States is assuming more  and more the role of the world's gendarme with the right to  intervene in the affairs of sovereign states and people, if,  from the [U.S.] point of view, the behavior of those people does  not comply with the [U.S.] aspirations to introduce `a new world  order.' Unfortunately, the United Nations is turning into an  assistant of these hegemonic aspirations of the United States.    "Furthermore, we believe that the Republic of Belarus should  establish diplomatic relations with the Federative Republic of  Yugoslavia in the near future, and render feasible assistance to  the Serbian people in their just fight against the so-called  forces of the world community.    "We draw the attention of the Supreme Soviet and Belarusian  Government to the ever growing NATO threat to the national  interests of our country, and we believe that Belarus should by  no means join the NATO-projected Partnership for Peace..."    The Belarusian Committee of Solidarity with Serbs and  Montenegrins has also condemned the pillage of the U.S. military  in Yugoslavia.</p>

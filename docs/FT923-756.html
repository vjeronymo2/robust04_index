			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Don't hang out the flags just yet - The effect of base rate cuts on property prices BASE RATE cuts cannot possibly be bad news for the domestic property market. However, homeowners should not hang out the bunting just yet. In the long term, the market will be boosted. But there are several reasons to believe that this base rate cut will not, in the short-term, give house prices the upward push that normal theory suggests they should. Part of the reason can be seen in market behaviour this year. If lower lending rates were enough, then the market should already be showing signs of life. As the Weekend FT pointed out last month, the cost of servicing a mortgage as a proportion of average earnings, having increased to unsustainable levels in 1990, is back to the level of early 1988. First-time buyers in particular should have been tempted back into the market by the array of special discounts which lenders were offering. Ian Darby, of mortgage brokers John Charcol, says they have had a range of offers below 10 per cent to consider for some months, and affordability is not the issue. He says that the big issue is confidence. Young people are nervous for their jobs. While unemployment and the fear of it remain high, then, a strong pick-up in demand is unlikely. This opinion is born out by a survey for the Woolwich building society of 18-25 year-olds' attitudes to house purchase. When asked which factors would determine when they bought for the first time, 80 per cent named job security, 70 per cent income and 56 per cent savings. Only 44.3 per cent named mortgage rates, while future house prices, the presiding concern of virtually everyone who is already on the 'housing ladder' were important for only 11 per cent. Last week's events were scarcely conducive to confidence. Deals fell through as nervous buyers decided not to bother, while estate agents report ridiculous offers from buyers trying their luck. This week's worrying news about job losses may be more important for first-time buyers than base rates. However, the maths of buying is now appealing. A first-time buyer with the Leeds Permanent, the biggest lender to cut its rates this week, could fund a Pounds 60,000 mortgage with repayments of only Pounds 425.17 per month for the first year, and Pounds 526.63 after that. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, in arguably the most attractive fixed-rate deal currently available, would allow interest-only payments of just Pounds 360.94 per month to fund a mortgage of the same size, leaving the borrower with a full range of options to save towards the capital. This kind of sum will in many cases be cheaper than the rent for an equivalent property, and should be enough to tempt many savers out of renting. The savings rates available to those who rent are coming down, adding to the arguments for taking a loan. The rental market, meanwhile, has shown signs of life, particularly in areas such as London and the South East where homeowners have been particularly hard hit. According to Rowena Gilbert, letting director with Chestertons, the biggest letting agency in London, the proportion of business from individuals, rather than foreigners or corporate clients, has increased dramatically over the last year. Rents have been stable for some time while the cost of buying has continued to decrease. All of this points to pent-up demand for housing. But experts, such as John Wriglesworth of UBS Philips &amp; Drew, point to a similar overhang of supply thanks to repossessions and inheritance. He does not expect prices to rise until the end of next year. Those sitting on 'negative equity' need to stay put for another year. For first-time buyers, this is a 'time to buy' in terms of affordability, but it is not an investment opportunity - it would be most unwise to expect significant real returns from a house purchase. Youngsters are unlikely to look at it this way. The British retain their addiction to home ownership and this could rescue today's straitened homeowners. The Woolwich survey found 83 per cent of 18-25 year-olds regarded a home as a sound investment, and 80 per cent wanted to buy.</p>

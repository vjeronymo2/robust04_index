			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Pastrana Takes Up Defense of Development </F> Minister"]    [Excerpt] Andres Pastrana Arango, head of the New  Democratic Force, came out in defense of Development Minister  Luis Alberto Moreno yesterday, stating that that official had  not improperly intervened in politics.    Breaking his silence, Liberal precandidate Ernesto Samper  told this daily newspaper that only the Attorney General's  Office and the nation's president can judge Moreno's conduct.    "The proper persons to assess the conduct of Minister Luis  Alberto Moreno, who, along with Conservative candidate Andres  Pastrana, met with Presidents Rafael Caldera and Ramon J.  Velasquez in Caracas, are the attorney general and the  president, rather than the very Conservative candidate who  accompanied Minister Moreno on his trip to Venezuela," Samper  said.    Although Pastrana claimed yesterday that he did not know  whether Moreno's trip to Caracas had been officially authorized  by President Gaviria, he did say that simply speaking with a  chief of state or president-elect does not constitute improper  meddling in politics. He also denied that the fact that Moreno  has invited him to a number of public meetings constitutes  active campaigning for his presidential candidacy.    Pastrana answered reporters' questions at the conclusion of  a  meeting with members of the Conservative National Leadership who  paid him a visit at his political headquarters.    Despite Pastrana's reply, the Samper campaign, via spokesman  Marco Julio Gutierrez, continued its accusations of partiality  on the part of the minister of development and added more  photographic evidence to the petition submitted to the Office of  Attorney General seeking Moreno's removal. At a meeting of  deputies, members of the Samper bench concluded that the  government should address the issue of the minister's work in  Pastrana's behalf. [passage omitted]</p>

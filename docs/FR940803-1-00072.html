			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These species have been rendered vulnerable to extinction by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant loss of habitat and severe range restriction. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restricted distribution of these seven species also makes localized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> populations susceptible to catastrophic events and increased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressures from take.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Critical Habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, and implementing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations (50 CFR 424.12) require that, to the maximum extent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prudent and determinable, the Secretary designate critical habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the time the species is determined to be endangered or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threatened. The Service finds that designation of critical habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not prudent for these species. Service regulations (50 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 424.12(a)(1)) state that designation of critical habitat is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prudent when one or both of the following situations exist_(1) The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species is threatened by taking or other human activity, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identification of critical habitat can be expected to increase the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> degree of threat to the species, or (2) such designation of critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat would not be beneficial to the species. Such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination would result in no known benefit to these species, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designation of critical habitat could further increase the threat of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collecting or vandalism.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulations promulgated for implementing section 7 provide for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both a jeopardy standard, based on listing alone, and for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destruction or adverse modification standard, in cases where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical habitat has been designated. The fat three-ridge, shiny-rayed pocketbook, Gulf moccasinshell, Ochlockonee moccasinshell,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oval pigtoe, Chipola slabshell, and purple bankclimber occupy very  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restricted stream reaches. Any significant adverse modification or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destruction of their habitat would likely jeopardize their continued  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existence. Therefore, no additional protection for the species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would accrue from critical habitat designation that would not also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accrue from listing these species. If these are listed, the Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that protection of their habitat can be accomplished  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through the section 7 jeopardy standard, and through section 9  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibitions against take.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The publication of critical habitat maps in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and local newspapers and other publicity accompanying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical habitat designation could increase the harvest or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collection threat and also increase the potential for vandalism  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the critical habitat designation process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Available Conservation Measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or threatened under the Endangered Species Act include recognition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibitions against certain practices. Recognition through listing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The Act provides for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible land acquisition and cooperation with the States and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species. The protection required of Federal agencies and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibitions against taking and harm are discussed, in part, below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its critical habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requires Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical habitat. If a species is listed subsequently, section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continued existence of such a species or to destroy or adversely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal involvement is expected to include the EPA through the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Clean Water Act's provisions for pesticide registration and waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management actions. The Corps of Engineers will consider these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species in project planning and operation, and during the permit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review process. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider these species prior to the relicensing of hydropower dams.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Federal Highway Administration will consider impacts of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> federally funded bridge and road construction projects when known  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat may be impacted. Continuing development within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Apalachicolan Region may involve the Farmers Home Administration and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their loan programs. The Soil Conservation Service will consider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the species during project planning and under their farmer's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assistance programs. The Forest Service will consider downstream  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacts to habitat of the fat three-ridge and purple bankclimber  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when planning or implementing silvicultural, recreational, or other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs in lands adjacent the lower mainstem of the Apalachicola  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> River, and to habitat of the purple bankclimber when planning or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementing these activities in lands adjacent the lower mainstem  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Ochlockonee River, both drainages are in the Apalachicola  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Forest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Zhang Junsheng Talks About Nationality Issue, </F> Stressing That Special Cases Must Be Handled in Special Ways"]    [Text] In response to a reporter's question about the  nationality of the members of the Preliminary Work Committee  [PWC] yesterday, Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of XINHUA Hong  Kong Branch, said that while the National People's Congress  [NPC] Standing Committee had decided to establish the PWC, there  were no provisions restricting foreign passport holders becoming  PWC members. The situation in Hong Kong is special. The  legislature of the future special administrative region [SAR]  will even include foreign passport holders, who will not exceed  20 percent of the total number of members.    Deputy Director Zhang Junsheng yesterday attended a  reception  sponsored by WEN WEI PO for the issue of the album "Record of  China's Hope Project." A reporter said that there were foreign  passport holders among PWC members. Yes, Zhang responded, there  are many foreign passport holders in Hong Kong, which is a  special phenomenon. There are provisions in the Basic Law  concerning this issue. In the NPC Standing Committee decision  on forming the PWC, there were no provisions on what kind of  passports its members should hold. Actually, foreign nationals  are not allowed to be in the legislature of any country or  region. But Hong Kong's situation is special and its future  legislature may have foreign nationals, who will not exceed 20  percent of the total number of members.    Zhang Junsheng continued: The Basic Law clearly stipulates  that nationality and permanent residency are not the same thing.  Foreigners who meet the requirements of the Basic Law may also  become permanent Hong Kong residents. The provisions of the  Basic Law should be followed, as they clearly state the rules  concerning the matter. If there are no provisions in the Basic  Law concerning concrete matters, they should be handled by  adopting specific regulations. Prior to the promulgation of  these regulations, deliberations may be extensively held. The  question of Hong Kong residents' nationality is complicated, and  this was considered while drafting the Basic Law, Zhang Junsheng  stated. As some three and a half years are left until 1 July  1997, a number of problems may be encountered after the  establishment of the SAR government. Although some decisions  will be made prior to this period, we still have time.    A reporter asked whether there will be restrictions on  foreign nationals becoming members of the Preparatory Committee  of the SAR government. Zhang replied that the committee has not  been set up yet. You may offer suggestions, which may include  whether there should be restrictions on foreign nationals.</p>

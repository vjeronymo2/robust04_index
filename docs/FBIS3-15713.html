This is brought about by the critical state of  their finances. In all likelihood, publication of  large-circulation newspapers on vessels, flotillas, and bases  will cease. Only the fleet and district newspapers, such as the  Pacific Fleet's newspaper BOYEVAYA VAKHTA [COMBAT WATCH], will  remain.</p>

In a comparative survey in April, June, September and  November last year, Daewoo found a drop in the total number of  accounts at its branches after it became mandatory to use real  names, but a fast rise in large deposits.    Accounts totaled 605,717 in April, rose 3.91 percent to  629,422 in June, fell 13.66 percent to 543,470 in September and  sank 6.29 percent to 509,289 in November.    Large deposits, above 100 million won (123,304 U.S.  dollars),  totaled 4,207 in April, rose 6.99 percent to 4,501 in June,  dropped 6.51 percent to 4,208 in September and, immediately  after introduction of the real-name system, recovered 9.13  percent to 4,592 in November.    Large deposits accounted for 0.69 percent of the total  accounts in April, 0.72 percent in June, 0.77 percent in  September, and 0.9 percent in November.    They made their way to the stock market because they had  little choice of places to go after the real-name system took  effect, a Daewoo official said.    Large deposits grew 59 each in Kangnam and Kangpuk, both in  Seoul, 47 in Pusan, and 44 in South Kyongsang Province during  September-November.</p>

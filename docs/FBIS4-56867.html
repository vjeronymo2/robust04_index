			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on "exclusive" interview with Lieutenant General </F> Daniel Garcia, Army commander in chief, by unidentified LA  MANANA reporter; place and date not given]    [Excerpts]  <H5>  The Armed Forces as Guarantee and Support </H5> for the People    We find ourselves in a presidential year, said Lt. Gen.  Daniel Garcia, and as such the national Army is concerned with  providing for the country the guarantees and institutional  tranquility that will truly support the normal development of  the elections that are to take place in a few months.    This is a cause for concern for us, he noted, because we  want  to make it clear that the Army's support is a guarantee that the  elections will take place in total and absolute calm. He stated  that in this way the handing over of power will take place  without mishaps.  <H5>  Chain of Command Reestablished </H5>   Lt. Gen. Garcia imposed a new kind of clarity in the  handling  of the institution from the very first moment he took control.  He redefined the officers' internal relations due to their  tendency to deliberate. Garcia said that perhaps that attitude  still existed because some "nostalgic officers continued to  think as they did during the past military process."    In an exclusive interview with LA MANANA, Garcia discussed  various social and political topics and the country's foreign  relations.  <H5>  Absolute Calm in the Armed Forces </H5>   The economic situation affecting the country, as well as an  Armed Forces internal reorganization imposed by the executive  branch, has affected all the components in one way or another.  The general said that there is absolute calm regarding this  rather acute situation.    Regarding the common characterization of the Armed Forces as  "a family," Garcia said that the definition was an  oversimplification, and had be analyzed from two different  levels.    The definition of a military family is too all-encompassing,  and people might think it includes the "retired" personnel. The  issue is much more complex and serious if we include them in the  definition. The Army commander in chief is responsible  exclusively for those "on duty," Garcia said.    "We certainly have economic needs, just as any other group  in  the country, but we are optimists. We think the situation of  the country will improve, Army needs will be met, and our  situation compared to the rest of society will improve," Garcia  said.  <H5>  Armed Forces Reorganization </H5>   Regarding what has been called the new Army structure,  Garcia  said: I personally think the term is too explosive. People  might think the reorganization implies a total destruction of  present structures in order to create new ones." [no beginning  quotation marks as published]    "I say our work is to adapt, `update' [preceding word in  Italian] present Army structures to adapt it to new conditions.  We must try to make it more functional and efficient. We must  make it more responsive to the new cultural, technological,  scientific, political, and social development of the world, the  region, and the country. This has prompted us to propose and  implement a series of gradual changes day after day. We have  tried to reach conclusions on the elements we must change in  order to make the institution more efficient at a time of  responding to the demands of the new times in which we are  living."  <H5>  Armed Forces Position Same as Government's </H5>   The Army in particular, as well as the other two armed  branches, have participated in regional and world conferences to  analyze changes in the new world political geography. Some of  these changes reflect the intentions of some of the large world  powers to participate in combined operations to repress drugs  and terrorism. Some of these changes also imply dropping the  "traditional Army" concept, which in Latin America stems from  colonial times.    Garcia was very clear about this problem. He said that the  issue of collective forces, even within Mercosur [Common Market  of the South], has been discussed in international forums.    "Our country's policy has been very clearly established by  the president," Garcia noted. [passage omitted]    "We have maintained the traditional Uruguayan position of  not  participating in or encouraging the creation of inter-American  forces. That is a national foreign policy position. We think  this is not really what all countries want at this time,  particularly because of our regional resources' degree of  development," Garcia said.  <H5>  Fight Against Drugs and Terrorism </H5>   We think police forces should be responsible for fighting  drugs and terrorism. This is in accordance with our countries'  internal order. We believe that to commit the Armed Forces as  institutions to fighting these kinds of activities, before the  bodies specifically created by the states for these functions  are overwhelmed, is hasty and inappropriate for the development  of the specific responsibilities that have been assigned to the  armies. We maintain, however, a careful watch on those types of  activities, in the sense that we continue to study the  information available on those areas, and continue to plan for  possible Army participation in the task, in the given case that  the national government decides that we should intervene.  <H5>  Increased Armed Forces Participation in UN Peace Missions </H5>   Regarding our Armed Forces's future participation in  UN-sponsored peacekeeping missions and the Armed Forces  institutional responsibility to ensure the continuation of  scientific research in the Antarctic, Gen. Garcia said our  institutional participation is increasingly active and direct.    "These Armed Forces activities are part of our country's  foreign policy. This small country is very dependent on world  peace and order to guarantee its own peace. We think that our  contribution to the United Nations for maintaining peace in  other areas of the world contributes to preserving our internal  order, and benefits us in our desire to prosper in peace,"  Garcia said. [passage omitted]  <H5>  Armed Forces Will Respect Election Results </H5>   Regarding the possibility of unexpected electoral results,  Gen. Garcia clearly erased any doubts with respect to the Armed  Forces' position: He categorically ruled out any position  different from that which is established in the Constitution and  the law.    "At present I do not see any reason to think that the Army  will do anything else but strictly abide by the Constitution and  the law," Garcia stressed.    In accordance with this strong affirmation, Garcia said that  the Armed Forces, and particularly the Army, is absolutely calm,  even though the present economic situation affects all social  groups and the Armed Forces must be completely dedicated and  cannot maintain other sources of income.

			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> TRUSTEES, TEACHERS OK A NEW CONTRACT  </P> <P> Ending a bitter contract dispute that spanned nearly a year, the school board  of the Huntington Beach City School District and the teachers union Tuesday  reached an agreement.  </P> <P> District trustees voted unanimously Tuesday to ratify the contract which it  tentatively had approved on April 3.  </P> <P> Earlier Tuesday, union President Sharon Boudreau announced that union members  also approved the pact during voting that began Monday.  </P> <P> Under the agreement, teachers will receive a 7% pay raise retroactive to July  1, larger steps in the salary schedule and full health coverage, all of which  the union demanded throughout negotiations.  </P> <P> The votes signal an end to a teachers' protest which affected eight elementary  and middle schools with a total of 5,400 students. After months of stalled  talks, the teachers picketed, rallied parents to their side and boycotted  extracurricular activities.  </P> <P> This agreement comes just in time for talks to begin on the 1990-91 contract.  Leaders from both sides said Tuesday they are hopeful that the new bargaining  talks, scheduled to begin next month, will be devoid of any lingering animosity  and can be wrapped up within six months.  </P> <P> However, district and union officials acknowledged that specifics of a new pact  cannot be discussed in detail until the current state budget is finalized and  next year's health-benefit costs are determined.  </P> <P> The union issued its latest contract proposal on the new bargaining talks in  February, which calls for a 12% pay raise and improvements in the bargaining  process. The district's proposal is due May 1. JOHN PENNER  </P></p>

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / The Coal Crisis: Pits U-turn does little to relieve the economic gloom THE GOVERNMENT'S partial U-turn over pit closures yesterday did little to lift the pall of economic gloom that has descended on Britain since sterling left the European exchange rate mechanism on Black Wednesday. The news gave an slight boost to sterling and UK equities, which rebounded from earlier lows, but this latest evidence of a lack of clear direction in economic policymaking left City commentators un-impressed. Although only 10 pits now face immediate closure, economists still expect well over 100,000 jobs to be lost across a wide range of activities by the end of the year. Fears that the UK recession might give way to a depression were not banished by yesterday's adoption of a 'phased programme' to reduce surplus capacity in the coal industry or Friday's surprise cut of 1 percentage point in bank base rates to 8 per cent. The events of the past few days have come on top of steep falls in consumer and business confidence. Mr Alan Hyde, a researcher at Gallup, said yesterday that the latest findings on consumer confidence were the gloomiest the market research organisation had recorded since 1979. Gallup's latest poll, taken before the coal crisis broke and published last week, found that more than half of Britons expected the overall economic situation to deteriorate over the next 12 months while only one sixth expected an improvement. Surveys by regional chambers of commerce also point to a sharp deterioration in confidence among businessmen last month. The London Chamber of Commerce reported yesterday that hopes of business growth had been 'dashed' by falling activity. The Leeds chamber said last week that business confidence had 'fallen through the floor'. This grim picture is expected to be replicated over the whole of the UK on Thursday when the British Chambers of Commerce publishes its quarterly survey of business opinion, covering the period between September 7 and September 25. Mr Richard Brown, BCC director of policy, said yesterday that people in business had been 'befuddled' by the absence of a clear economic policy. The various speeches and statements from the government since Black Wednesday had produced 'no inclination to invest'. The coal crisis could only have added to the uncertainty, he said. But according to Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist of Salomon Brothers, 'loss of confidence is only part of the story'. Even if confidence were strong, monetary conditions would still be too tight for the economy to take off. The cut in base rates still leaves real short-term interest rates at 4 per cent. 'Against a background of declining personal wealth and the highest male jobless rate since the 1930s, 4 per cent real interest rates are too high to promote much growth,' said Mr Saunders. 'The last time that growth of wages, manufactured goods prices, broad money and credit recorded their current weakness was in the 1960s. At that time, 8 per cent interest rates were considered penal.' Professor Douglas McWilliams, the Confederation of British Industry's chief economic adviser, said it was too early to say that the UK was in a slump. 'A slump would mean no recovery for another two years,' he said yesterday. But Prof McWilliams believes the economic outlook is 'very tough'. Business is 'likely to get worse before it gets better' while unemployment could rise to about 3.5m from 2.85m at present. The CBI will produce its next quarterly survey of industrial trends next week, although this, like Thursday's BCC survey, will be based on information pre-dating the coal crisis. Prof McWilliams said the coal crisis was likely to have had a negative impact on business confidence similar to that of Black Wednesday. 'I have never seen an industrial reaction on the scale of that over the coal closures,' he said. 'That points to a lack of confidence in the government and more generally in the economy.' However, Mr Peter Spencer, chief economist of Kleinwort Benson, sees a silver lining for the economy in the sharp fall of sterling since Black Wednesday, which should make it easier for exporters to sell goods abroad. He said that in spite of poorer economic prospects in the US and continental European economies, British manufacturers should be able to take market share from competitors in Germany and France. 'The irony is that industry made great efforts to get its costs under control in the ERM - that is what the present wave of redundancies is all about,' Mr Spencer explained. 'Industry learned to live with the high value of the pound by the time the UK left the ERM. The devaluation gives UK companies a windfall opportunity.' However, Mr Spencer warned that it would take some time before these benefits were felt. Yesterday's partial reversal of the pit closures would do nothing to strengthen confidence in the short term in either the consumer or business sectors, he said. Indeed, uncertainty about future policies and exchange rates may be deterring UK companies from taking advantage of the devalued pound. Mr Brown of BCC said exporters seemed not to be exploiting sterling's more competitive level. From his vantage point at the CBI, Prof McWilliams was more hopeful. Anecdotal evidence suggested that some of Britain's large companies were now more active in export markets, he said.</p>

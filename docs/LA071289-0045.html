			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAELI PARTIES LOOK FOR NEW ALLIANCES  </P> <P> Rival Israeli politicians began to probe, bargain and cajole among themselves  Tuesday in search of alliances to form the basis of a new government or grounds  to revive the old one, which is in danger of collapsing after eight months.  </P> <P> Labor Party leader Shimon Peres began meeting with the heads of minor religious  parties to discuss conditions for creating a center-left coalition he would  head -- if his party decides to leave the government. Prime Minister Yitzhak  Shamir, who leads the rightist Likud Party, followed suit, saying all the while  it would be a mistake for Labor to pull out.  </P> <P> The maneuvering was set off when Shamir's rightist Likud Party drew attention  to an open secret: that Likud and Labor, uneasy partners in government, differ  radically on their views for ending the Israeli-Arab conflict.  </P> <P> Last week, a meeting of Likud's central committee passed a resolution that  would preclude steps in a government peace plan that, among other things, might  lead to giving up the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The center-left Labor  wants such an option left open.  </P> <P> Labor's advisory party bureau responded Monday by proposing to leave the  coalition. But it set no date for a meeting of the party's central committee,  which would make the final decision. Some Labor members, as well as many  partisans of Likud, want to keep the government in one piece. The question  comes down to whether differences over the peace plan can be reconciled, or at  least bottled up.  </P> <P> Likud leaders complained Tuesday that the country is being left adrift while  Labor makes up its mind. "For three or four weeks, we won't know what is going  on," said Avi Pazner, Shamir's spokesman.  </P> <P> Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, a member of Likud, insisted that Labor lacks  valid reasons to pull out. Arens, as well as Shamir, is said to prefer  maintaining the partnership with Labor rather than deal with demands of Likud's  right wing, not to mention ultra-nationalist parties outside Likud.  </P> <P> Arens said that nothing had changed in the peace initiative, which is centered  on Arab elections in the West Bank and Gaza. Likud's central committee won a  pledge from Shamir that no land would be given up to Arabs and that Arab  residents of annexed East Jerusalem would be banned from participating in the  vote.  </P> <P> The conditions were put forward by members of Likud's right wing who have long  opposed the plan for Arab elections. One of them, Housing Minister David Levy,  visited Shamir on Tuesday to insist that Likud maintain its position.  </P> <P> Labor officials continued to argue that the Likud conditions effectively killed  the proposal. They also viewed with alarm the apparent ascendancy of Ariel  Sharon, the hawkish Likud Cabinet minister who backed the conditions, to a  position of policy-making influence.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Deep Mistrust  </P> <P> Leftists in the Labor Party expressed a deep mistrust of Likud assurances that  nothing has changed. "Shamir will say anything to keep Labor in. The problem is  that Sharon dominates Likud. We will not be part of a Sharon government," said  Labor member of Parliament Uzi Baram.  </P> <P> In any case, the delay in Labor's final decision left some room. "The time  lapse can give Shamir and his allies breathing space to erase the results of  Likud's meeting," predicted political analyst Akiva Eldar in the Haaretz  newspaper.  </P> <P> Newspapers were generally skeptical that the government would actually fall.  One headline blared: "It's Not Over Yet."  </P> <P> The current wave of politicking brought to mind the rounds of coalition talks  that followed elections last November, when neither Labor nor Likud was able to  build a working majority in the 120-member Parliament. After much wrangling,  the two major parties joined in a fractured partnership, leaving most marginal  parties on the outside.  </P> <P> The same obstacles that confronted each party then still hold true: Religious  parties control the balance of power, and to make a deal, either Shamir or  Peres would have to give ground on divisive issues of religious authority.  </P></p>

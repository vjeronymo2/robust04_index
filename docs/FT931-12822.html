			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Budgens hits Pounds 3m despite competition BUDGENS, the small food retailing chain, maintained its recovery in profitability in the opening half year in spite of what it described as 'unprecedented competitive action' by the leading supermarket groups. The chain, where institutional investors installed new management in 1991, increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.24m to Pounds 3.07m in the six months to November 8, although turnover slipped slightly to Pounds 154.2m (Pounds 156.6m). Mr John von Spreckelsen, chief executive, said that last year the big supermarket chains such as Sainsbury, Tesco and Waitrose opened stores with an area of 800,000 sq ft in the vicinity of Budgens' outlets, which have a total area of 600,000 sq ft. He added: 'To hold turnover in the face of such competition indicates the improvements we have made to our stores to enhance customer loyalty, and augers well for the future.' Although the number of people using Budgens' stores increased slightly, the group suffered from a lower spend by individual customers, especially during August, September and October, together with a severe deflation in produce prices. Mr von Spreckelsen said that although it had been impossible to increase prices in the difficult trading environment, the group had increased operating margins from 2.08 per cent to 2.72 per cent. In line with other food retailers, Christmas trading started slowly but improved right through to Christmas Eve, although Budgens is traditionally less affected by Christmas trade than its larger rivals. An exceptional charge of Pounds 250,000, compared with a gain of Pounds 842,000 last time, covered the costs of closing four stores in poor locations. The group, which has just under 100 stores, opened three new stores during the half-year and a further two have come on stream since then. Two more openings will take place in central London before the year-end. Earnings per share were 1.45p (1.46p). The interim dividend was passed again, but the board said it was confident that it would be able to resume dividend payments again with the full-year results. Positive cashflow, control of working capital and the proceeds from 1991's Pounds 21.7m placing helped reduce interest payment from Pounds 1.9m to Pounds 838,000. COMMENT Mr von Spreckelsen's new management team continues to make sensible progress, but the degree of competition it faces is starkly illustrated by the amount of competing space other supermarkets have opened in the past year. The group has gained from improved buying power, distribution and local pricing policies, but analysts wonder how much more benefits there are to come. There was some disappointment that an interim dividend was not paid, but that again seems to reflect justifiable caution about the trading outlook. Forecast full-year profits of Pounds 6.7m put the shares, down 1p at 46p, on a prospective multiple of 14.4, a slight discount to the sector. The shares have risen nearly 50 per cent since August, and seem high enough  -particularly given long-term doubts about whether there really is a place in the high street for Budgens.</p>

			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> STUDY BACKS LIGHT RAIL FOR INGLEWOOD  </P> <P> A new study recommends constructing a light-rail transit line from the Westside  through Inglewood to ease traffic congestion at the Forum, Hollywood Park and  Los Angeles International Airport, officials said Friday.  </P> <P> Inglewood Mayor Edward Vincent and Los Angeles Councilman Robert Farrell,  co-chairmen of the study sponsored by the Southern California Assn. of  Governments, said Friday that such a line would provide much-needed  transportation for commuters in Inglewood, South-Central Los Angeles, Baldwin  Hills, Crenshaw, View Park, Windsor Hills and Hyde Park.  </P> <P> The proposed line would originate at Wilshire Boulevard, running south on  Crenshaw Boulevard to Imperial Highway. There, it would intersect with the  Century Freeway, becoming part of a countywide mass transit system now under  construction.  </P> <P> The study, known as the Airport Southwest Area Transportation Study, was to  make recommendations to meet transportation needs of residents living in a  39-square-mile area, including portions of Inglewood and the city and county of  Los Angeles. The area falls between the Santa Monica Freeway and Imperial  Highway on the north and south and between the Harbor and San Diego freeways on  the east and west.  </P> <P> There is no money earmarked for the recommendations in the study.  </P> <P> "People (in the study area) have not had their transportation needs addressed  well by the county," Farrell said in a prepared statement. "I believe that this  study will lay out some of the issues and concerns of the people in Southwest  Los Angeles."  </P></p>

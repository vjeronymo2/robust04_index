			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Tired Belgrade stands behind Milosevic UNDER threats of military intervention and worried about plunging standards of living, people in Belgrade appear to have accepted the apparent abandonment by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic of his Bosnian kin. Nearly 70 per cent of the population supports the Vance-Owen plan, more than double the figures of last month, an opinion poll shows. Most inhabitants of the Serbian and federal capital also seem to welcome Mr Milosevic's move to cut off all supplies, except food and medicine, to Bosnia after the dismissal by Bosnian Serb leaders of Belgrade's appeals to back an international peace plan. 'The most important thing is peace. Milosevic should support any plan which creates the conditions for peace,' says Nada, a 50-year-old school-teacher, reciting almost verbatim the daily fare of state-controlled Belgrade Television. 'Belgrade Television now says that everyone supports the plan. Last week we were all supposedly against it,' says Sasa, a computer programmer, worried about whether he could afford another half kilo of potatoes at Kalenic vegetable market. Most people appear confused by Mr Milosevic's sudden policy shift but support his calls for peace. Worn down by uncertainty and increasing economic deprivation, they want to believe the war is over. However, many do not believe that the terms of peace will exclude eventual unification of the Serb territories. This message, that what has been gained in the war can be cemented in peace, has been the main pillar of Mr Milosevic's new campaign. Last week he and other Belgrade power brokers tried to persuade Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, to back the plan, on the grounds that their forces have accomplished most of their goals. They appear confident the plan will fail to restore a multi-ethnic Bosnian state. 'If Yugoslavia could not survive I think it will be impossible to rebuild a multi-ethnic Bosnia,' says Sasa. The UN imposed tough new sanctions on Yugoslavia, now comprising Serbia and Montenegro, after the Bosnia Serb assembly rejected the peace plan to divide Bosnia into 10 provinces along ethnic lines. 'They should have signed the peace plan. Karadzic does not have the right to force Serbia and Montenegro to make sacrifices,' says Toma, a peasant who fled Bosnian Croat troops in Mostar, western Bosnia. The Serb referendum next weekend on the Bosnia peace plan will also ask whether the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb republic should be able to unite with other Serbian regions, the speaker of the Bosnian Serb parliament, Mr Momcilo Krajisnik, announced yesterday, Reuter reports.</p>

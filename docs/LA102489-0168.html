BRIEFING;  </P> <P> IBM, DIGITAL UNVEIL MAINFRAMES  </P> <P> International Business Machines Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp. unveiled new  mainframe computers today aimed at boosting demand in the sluggish $45-billion  market.  </P> <P> The new products will boost competition in a market dominated by IBM.  </P> <P> The improved products may also win back customers to the big-sized computers,  which have been surrounded on shop floors and offices by increasingly powerful  minicomputers.  </P> <P> Digital, which has been IBM's peer in the minicomputer market, is making a bold  move with its mainframe effort.  </P> <P> Digital's 9000 computer will be its first entry into mainframe-class computing  while IBM's addition to its 3090 series and related software is geared to  defend its dominant 70% share of the market, analysts said.  </P> <P> IBM introduced 16 new ES/3090 models, 13 of which are immediately available,  ranging in price from $830,000 for the 110J to $12.9 million for the 600J.  </P></p>

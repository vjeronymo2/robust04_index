			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible military source at the command of the  armed forces of the Democratic Republic of Yemen has said that  the forces of the adventurous al-Ahmar gang not only failed to  adhere to the cease-fire announced on evening of 20 May, but had  in fact escalated the fighting on all fronts. It unleashed  large forces in all directions. More serious than this, it used  rockets in its criminal acts.    Last night, the inhabitants of the quiet and peaceful city  of  Aden, which was celebrating the declaration of the Democratic  Republic of Yemen and the blessed 'Id al-Adha, were surprised by  a rocket which fell in a heavily populated area killing and  wounding peaceful women and children. Meanwhile, the air  defense forces of the Democratic Republic of Yemen succeeded in  shooting down a similar rocket in the air.    The responsible source confirmed that this was a criminal  act  and was part of the series of the terrible crimes of the family  of al-Ahmar, under the leadership of war general 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih.    The armed forces of the Democratic Republic of Yemen reserve  for themselves the right to retaliate forcefully against these  stupid and crazy acts of the bloody al-Ahmar gang.</p>

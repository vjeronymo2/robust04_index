			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / UK Company News: GPA may delay flotation until after June GUINNESS PEAT Aviation, which yesterday reported a 32 per cent increase in after-tax profits for its third quarter, is considering putting off its international flotation until after it publishes its year-end results in June. The Irish Republic-based aircraft leasing group made after-tax profits of Dollars 73m (Pounds 40.1m) for the three months to December 31, compared with Dollars 55.5m in the comparable period of 1990. Net profits for the nine months were Dollars 196.5m, only just ahead of the corresponding 1990 figure of Dollars 195.8m, but the group is confident of record earnings in excess of Dollars 261m for the full year. Earnings per share were Dollars 1.69 (Dollars 1.65). GPA had hoped to bring forward its international share offering - worth between Dollars 1bn and Dollars 1.5bn - to early April, to take advantage of the buoyant US stock market. However, the group now believes it may be prudent to wait until after June when it publishes its year-end results. This would strengthen its argument in favour of pricing the new shares closer to Dollars 30. Some of its advisers still believe GPA should press ahead with its share offering in April, but only if the GPA board accepts its recommendation to price the new ordinary shares at between Dollars 20 to Dollars 25, with the emphasis on the lower price. At a meeting last Friday at Shannon, GPA's advisers, which include Nomura, Schroders and Goldman Sachs, narrowed their recommended price range for the new shares to between Dollars 20 and Dollars 22. Mr Tony Ryan, chairman, yesterday said: 'We have now recaptured the net profit decline of the first half of the year and the increase of both operating and net profit over the third quarter of 1990 show we are recovering from the impact on air travel of the Gulf conflict.' Two thirds of the third quarter profits were generated from the sale of aircraft to investors. For the three months to December, aircraft sales accounted for 73 per cent of net profits compared with 63 per cent last year. Leasing accounted for 32 per cent (25 per cent) of earnings. The US has now replaced Japan as GPA's most important market in aircraft sales. Mr Maurice Foley, chief executive, said it would be 'unfair' to question the quality of net profits because of the growth of the sale of aircraft to investors. He added that in the aftermath of the withdrawal of the Japanese investors in the recession, the business of selling aircraft to investors had recovered faster than GPA's leasing division. In a final word of warning, Mr Foley said it would be wrong to assume that GPA was about to report quarterly net profit increases of about 30 percentage points. 'The worst of the recession is over' he said. 'But we do not want to hype it up too much.' See Lex</p>

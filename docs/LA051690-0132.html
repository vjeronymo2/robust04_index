			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LINKLETTER ADDRESSES ALZHEIMER'S MEETING  </P> <P> He joked about his age and how he often forgets names, including that of  "whatever her name is" -- his wife.  </P> <P> But all jesting aside, 77-year-old television personality Art Linkletter came  to a daylong medical symposium here Tuesday to discuss a serious subject --  Alzheimer's disease -- and the need to find a cure for "this dreadful scourge."  </P> <P> He gave the keynote address, telling 100 neurobiologists, doctors, nurses and  relatives of Alzheimer's victims who gathered at the Beckman Center of the  National Academies of Science and Engineering that Alzheimer's "is one of those  terrible things that happens."  </P> <P> "No matter how hard you work, no matter how hard you take care of yourself,"  the disease can progress relentlessly from confusion to dementia to death,  Linkletter said.  </P> <P> For all Linkletter's jokes about memory loss, he at least was healthy, he said;  he surfs in summer and skis in winter and was clearly still on top of his game  as a humorist.  </P> <P> But Alzheimer's affected Linkletter deeply several years ago when a good  friend, UCLA brain researcher John Douglas French, died of the disease.  </P> <P> Linkletter touched briefly on the pain of French's death, describing the  ultimate irony that "the man who spent his life on the mysteries of the brain  died because of a disease of the brain."  </P> <P> After that death, Linkletter became chairman of a West Los Angeles foundation  named after French, which has raised more than $5 million for Alzheimer's  research.  </P> <P> Some of the $2.5 million in grants so far has gone to several of Tuesday's  speakers: to UC Irvine psychobiologists Carl Cotman and Christine Peterson and  to psychiatrist Stephen Read, medical director of a Los Alamitos nursing home  for Alzheimer's patients.  </P> <P> For all the promising research, Linkletter still called dealing with  Alzheimer's "a frustrating business -- with no known cure, no known cause and  it keeps increasing by leaps and bounds."  </P> <P> In Orange County, an estimated 40,000 people have Alzheimer's, said a  spokeswoman for the Alzheimer's Assn. of Orange County, a support group for  patients and their families.  </P> <P> Nationwide, more than 4 million people are said to have the disease, but  Linkletter estimated "there are several more millions hidden -- because  families do what they did with madness and leper's disease earlier," keeping  the victims out of sight.  </P> <P> Tuesday's symposium, "Alzheimer's Disease: Recent Insights and Developments in  Research," was sponsored by UC Irvine, the Alzheimer's Assn. of Orange County  and the John Douglas French Center for Alzheimer's Disease.

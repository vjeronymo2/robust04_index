			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> DOMINGUEZ HILLS BEATS AZUSA PACIFIC TO SNAP 5-GAME LOSING STREAK, 77-70  </P> <P> Cal State Dominguez Hills outscored visiting Azusa Pacific University, 29-15,  to open the second half, then went to a four-corner offense to take a 77-70  non-conference basketball victory Wednesday night.  </P> <P> Dominguez Hills (1-5), ended a five-game losing streak, the worst start in the  school's history. Azusa Pacific fell to 4-2.  </P> <P> Dominguez Hills trailed by five points in the first 12 minutes of the game but  took the lead for good, 24-21, on a three-point basket by senior forward Brian  Johnson with 5:16 left in the half.  </P> <P> Dominguez Hills, which led by three points at the half, opened a 48-38 lead  four minutes into the second half. Azusa Pacific cut that to 48-45 with 13  minutes to go, but then the Toros ran off 11 unanswered points.  </P> <P> Coach David Yanai of Dominguez Hills, who started three freshmen for the fifth  consecutive time, was pleased with the effort.  </P> <P> "We had good recognition from an offensive standpoint of the type of shots we  needed to take," he said. "We got the good shot selection we needed to get from  different people. In the previous five games we didn't execute as well as we  thought we should have at this point in the season."  </P> <P> The teams combined to commit 30 turnovers, but Dominguez Hills made 21 of 28  free-throw attempts.  </P> <P> Junior guard Robert Barksdale (25 points) shared high-scoring honors with Azusa  Pacific's Matt Burns. Other players in double figures were Brian Johnson (18)  and Vincent Washington (15) of Dominguez Hills and Patrick McMann and Jeff  Hester of the Cougars. PAUL McLEOD  </P></p>

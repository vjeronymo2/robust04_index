			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vadim Belykh article: "Trap for General. Criminal </F> Proceedings Instituted Against Deputy Chief of Russian MVD Main  Administration for Criminal Investigations"]    [Excerpts] In issue No. 85 of 6 May IZVESTIYA gave an  account of investigation "maneuvers" concerning Major General  Igor Shilov, deputy chief of the Russian Federation MVD  [Ministry of Internal Affairs] Main Administration for Criminal  Investigations. Today we publish what we have managed to find  out about this sensitive affair from the Moscow Regional  Administration for Organized Crime, the capital's prosecutor's  office, and the Moscow Internal Affairs Main Administration  Investigation Department.    According to reports from representatives of these three  departments, the scandal started with a completely  run-of-the-mill operation whereby members of the organized crime  subdivision "grilled" a certain citizen Korneyev on suspicion of  illegal activity. [passage omitted]    So far the criminal proceedings against Shilov, like the  other militia officers, have been brought under Article 218 of  the Russian Criminal Code for illegal possession of weapons.  The investigation apparently has evidence directly against the  country's number two detective that he received a television and  video recorder, a fountain pen with a gold nib, and the promise  of a car at a cheap price from Korneyev in the form of bribes.    But staffers of the Moscow Regional Administration for  Organized Crime and of the capital's prosecutor's office are  letting it be known that they possess information about much  more serious transgressions by the deputy chief of the Criminal  Investigation Main Administration and other militia staffers who  have come to their notice. But it can be publicized only after  the investigation has finished.    The editorial office has learned that Shilov, who has spent  36 years working in the criminal investigation system,  categorically denies all the accusations being made against him.  Judging from his statements, the country's number two detective  sees all the recent events as a carefully prepared provocation  aimed directly against the entire criminal investigation  department. The mafia is trying to remove him using the Moscow  Regional Administration for Organized Crime with the help of  agent-informer Korneyev. It has been learned that Shilov is  confident that given an independent investigation all the  accusations made against him, like those against most militia  officers who have fallen out of favor with him, will totally  collapse.    One way or another Moscow City Prosecutor's Office (which is  now handling this sensational case) will have an extremely hard  time. Irrespective of the reality of the case's criminal basis  and even of the evidence gathered it has already become  political, and will undoubtedly play its role in the conflict of  various interests both within the MVD itself and outside it.    A major case of corruption in the militia's ranks could to  some extent encourage the MVD's future to be decided on the  pattern of its "big brother" -- the Security Ministry, whereby  the ultrapowerful department is split up into several structures  which are independent of each other: the Russian Administration  for Administering Punishment, Internal Troops, etc. The Main  Administration for Organized Crime would then become something  akin to the American FBI. The future of the Main  Administrations for Criminal Investigation and Economic Crimes  looks more complex under this scenario. Separately or together  they could be turned into federal departments or, by handing  over some of their functions to the Main Administration for  Organized Crime, they could be retained only at city or oblast  level.    But according to a different opinion the Russian MVD itself  has nothing terrible to fear, nobody is going to alter it. But  enemies of the current internal affairs minister will try to  exploit the furor over the "Shilov case" and other similar cases  in order to remove Viktor Yerin from his post....    We will very soon find out how events are going to develop  further.</p>

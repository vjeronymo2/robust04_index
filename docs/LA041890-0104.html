			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> PREGNANT POOR ARE NOT MORE LITIGIOUS  </P> <P> Pregnant patients served by the Medi-Cal program for the poor are no more  likely to sue for malpractice than other women, an independent foundation  reported. The Sierra Foundation, which finances local health projects in  Northern California, said researchers compared suits against physicians by  pregnant Medi-Cal patients to those filed by expectant mothers in the entire  state. "Because physicians consistently cite fear of lawsuits from Medi-Cal  patients as a top reason for refusing to serve more of this population, we  wanted to see whether there was any validity to this perception," said Dr.  Barbara Aved, a consultant to the foundation.  </P></p>

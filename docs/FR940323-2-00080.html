This assessment will also be concerned with the specific criteria for the selection of patients for pancreas transplantation and the cost effectiveness of the technology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The assessment consists of a synthesis of information found in the published literature and obtained from appropriate organizations in the private sector and from Public Health Service (PHS) agencies and others in the Federal Government. AHCPR assessments are conducted in accordance with sections 904(b) and (d) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 299a&hyph;2(b) and (d)). Based on the assessment, a recommendation will be formulated to assist the Office of Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (OCHAMPUS) in establishing CHAMPUS coverage policy. The information being sought by this notice is a review and evaluation of past, current, and planned research related to this technology, as well as a bibliography of published, controlled clinical trials and other well-designed clinical studies. Information related to the characteristics of the patient population most likely to benefit from pancreas transplantation, as well as information on the clinical acceptability, effectiveness, and the extent of use of this technology is also being sought.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The AHCPR is interested in receiving information which would help in the evaluation or review of the technology as described above. To enable the interested scientific community to evaluate the information included in the assessment, AHCPR will discuss in the assessment only those data and analyses for which a source(s) can be cited. Respondents are therefore encouraged to include with their submissions a written consent permitting AHCPR to cite the sources of the data and comments provided. Otherwise, in accordance with the confidentiality statute governing information collected by AHCPR, 42 U.S.C. 299a&hyph;1(c), no information received will be published or disclosed which could identify an individual or entity described in the information, or could identify an entity or individual supplying the information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person or group wishing to provide AHCPR with information relevant to this assessment should do so in writing no later than June 21, 1994 to the Office of Health Technology Assessment at the address below. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> Thomas V.

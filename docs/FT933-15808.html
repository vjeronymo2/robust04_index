			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Letter: Competitive companies are the key to removing unemployment Sir, As Samuel Brittan says (Economic Viewpoint, July 1) in commenting on the prime minister's remarks in Copenhagen and my own pamphlet, Making Britain Competitive, the units that compete in world trade are companies, not nations. Quite so. Nevertheless, as, among others, Michael Porter, in his book The Competitive Advantage of Nations, points out: 'The national economic environment does have a central role in determining the success of companies.' Compare, for example, the performance of major car companies in Japan, the US, Germany and the UK. One of the most important points in my pamphlet was that the countries where the highest growth has been achieved postwar have been those such as Japan and South Korea, which have both a market economy and a government that gives top priority to improving the competitive environment. The market-led reforms of the 1980s brought about a huge improvement to Britain, but the government policymaking process still needs a lot of attention. In particular it needs better co-ordination, economic policies better designed to help business and a more skilful approach in areas where the government itself is responsible. For example, since good policy starts with proper information and analysis, I suggest that a government-wide competitiveness unit should be established. This should report to a cabinet committee on competitiveness, chaired by the prime minister and including the president of the board of trade, the chancellor of the exchequer, the chief secretary and the secretary of state for education, who would also be responsible for training. All economic decisions such as the shape of the budget should be looked at by this committee. This would give a competitiveness strategy proper priority and improve co-ordination. Interestingly enough, it was also reported in your July 1 issue ('Treasury boosts help for business') that the Treasury is to set up a new unit to explore ways that it can improve industrial competitiveness. This shows the thinking is moving in the right direction, though it also betrays the fact that the government is still too departmentalised. The Department of Trade and Industry already has a competitiveness unit, so here we have another set up by the Treasury. I advocate one for the government as a whole. Samuel Brittan admits that, if relevant competitiveness is not the explanation for the differing economic performance of nations, there has to be some other. He advocates changes in the labour market and pay and he concludes: 'If there is to be a return to full employment, much more effort will have to be made by employers to find pay rates at which jobs can be offered.' I disagree. Pay is only part of the equation. I think we will not return to full employment until we have more of the competitive companies that have developed in the UK in the last 12 years. Japan has more and it has low unemployment. National economic policy should be directed towards improving the competitive environment. John Horam, House of Commons, Westminster, London SW1</p>

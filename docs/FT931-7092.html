			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / 'Whenever equities do well, people pile in': Building societies risk losing more ground THE FALL in base rates since sterling left the exchange rate mechanism has caused turmoil in the savings industry as companies compete for British nest-eggs. Savers who rely on building societies for income have seen returns halve since base rates were at their peak in 1990. That has caused many to consider the alternatives to the traditional home of the cautious British saver - the building society. Although building society inflows perked up to Pounds 363m in January, the sector had a dismal 1992, with inflows of just Pounds 295m compared with Pounds 5.8bn in 1991. One obvious alternative home for savings is the personal equity plan, which pays tax-free income. These can now offer better dividend yields than the interest payments available from building societies. Recent Pep launches from Cazenove and Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial, for example, offered yields of 7 per cent and 10 per cent respectively. Peps were an important contributor to the revival of unit trust sales in January. Ms Mary Blair, product development director of Fidelity Investments, a leading unit trust management group, says 'we have seen a lot of activity from about October of last year, as interest rates started to come down. Recently we have seen enquiry levels equal to those seen in 1987 before the stockmarket crash.' Recent highs in the stock-market may be an important factor. Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at Greenwell Montagu, said: 'There is a very close correlation between equity market performance and unit trust figures. Whenever the equity market does well, people pile in.' And since February and March tend to be the key months for Pep sales (ahead of the tax year end on April 5), inflows into unit trusts may accelerate. Another tax-driven investment is the Business Expansion Scheme. Devised as a means of encouraging investors to back growing businesses, the scheme has become a means of encouraging the private rented sector - and is due to be abolished at the end of this year. But the financial services industry has become so ingenious at exploiting this scheme that higher-rate taxpayers can earn profits of 20 per cent in six months at virtually no risk. The combination of these returns and some 'Buy Now While Stocks Last' marketing campaigns means that many scheme offers sell out within days. Guaranteed equity products, which offer investors the rise in the FT-SE 100 Index or their money back, have also proved popular with those investors who are nervous about the potential losses on conventional share-based schemes. An estimated Pounds 500m has been raised by such products. But it is not just the financial services industry which is competing for savers' money. The government needs to raise about Pounds 1bn a week to fund the budget deficit, and a good portion of that may have to come from National Savings. Building societies complained bitterly last summer about the success which National Savings was having in competition against them. The government retreated in the face of criticism and National Savings cut its rates and temporarily withdrew one of its most popular products. But National Savings is still advertising on television and did not reduce its rates in response to the last base rate cut. Given that long term rates are above short term rates at present - a positive yield curve in the jargon  -some building society investors have also been persuaded to switch their money into gilt edged stocks, which will also help the government's funding problem. Building societies are trying to fight back. When base rates were cut by one percentage point in January, most societies responded with a cut of only 0.8 of a percentage point in savings rates. Mr Jim Murgatroyd of Halifax says that the society is deliberately trying to keep up rates for those with large sums in 90-day notice accounts. Experience shows that around 80 per cent of the deposits come from 20 per cent of the savers. But societies may be limited in the degree to which they can protect their savers at the expense of borrowers. Societies are keen to revive the housing market, which will boost demand for mortgages and reduce their bad-debt problem. Mortgage rates are two percentage points above base rates (the margin was only 0.4 of a percentage point in 1990). With margins at that level, Mr John Wriglesworth, analyst at UBS Phillips and Drew, says societies are likely to face increased competition in the mortgage market from the banks and centralised lenders in 1993. Societies thus face a squeeze from both directions. Perhaps societies will continue to attract funds from those who are afraid of unemployment (or have been made redundant) and who do not want to risk the nominal value of their capital in equity-based products. But what comes in through that door may disappear out of another as retired savers are lured away by the government and the rest of the savings industry.</p>

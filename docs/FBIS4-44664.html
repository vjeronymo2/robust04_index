			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pierre Langereux: "Order for Last 20 Ariane 4's </F> and First 14 Ariane 5's in 1994"]    [Text] Arianespace is starting production of all the  Ariane 4's now planned and will order the first 14  series-produced Ariane 5's this year. It hopes to reduce  production costs by 30 percent.    By the end of the year, Arianespace will have put in an  order  for the last 20 of the batch of 50 Ariane 4 rockets that went  into production four years ago (batch P9) and started production  on the first 14 series-produced Ariane 5's intended for  operational flights that the launch firm will carry out by the  year 2000. That was one of the main "messages" which Charles  Bigot, Arianespace's chief executive officer, conveyed last  week--through the press--at the same time that he reported the  company's "excellent operating results" for 1993 (see AIR &amp;  COSMOS, No. 1454).    Last year, despite a late start (12 May) caused by the  unavailability of a satellite from Hughes (United States), the  launch firm successfully completed seven scheduled launches  putting 10 large satellites into orbit. The result is that  Arianespace's turnover will be "on the order of Fr4.5 billion,"  with profits "equivalent to those in 1992."    But most important, Arianespace signed 16 new firm satellite  launch contracts last year, whereas its competitors as a whole  received only six orders. Those 16 contracts cover satellite  launches with a total value of about Fr7 billion and bring the  backlog of orders to 37 satellites to be launched at a total  value of Fr16.9 billion (as of 1 January 1994). This does not  include the order from Intelsat that is currently being  negotiated for the launching of two more Intelsat 8's (F3 and  F4) in addition to the first two (F1 and F2), which have already  been entrusted to Ariane 4, or the three second-generation  Meteosat satellites covered by the signing on 10 January of the  first "convention" (or framework agreement) between Arianespace  and the European organization Eumetsat [European Organization of  Meteorology via Satellite] for launching the new MSG's between  the years 2000 and 2006.    Because of its "very full" order book, Arianespace has  decided to order from its manufacturers the last two series of  rockets in the P9 batch of 50 Ariane 4's--all of which will  therefore be produced--and simultaneously to speed up the pace  at which Ariane 4's are produced, going from the current eight  rockets per year to nine and then to 10 per year in 1994 and  1995.    "Production will increase by at least 50 percent over three  years," Bigot announced. The reason, he said, is that "the goal  is to launch 30 rockets in 36 months." That is 50 percent more  than were launched over the past two years. "It will require a  big industrial effort," he said, "because we must allow for the  unexpected and therefore be prepared to make considerably more  than one launch per month in order to guarantee 10 flights per  year." And it must be done without altering launch preparation  procedures. Because, as Bigot stressed, "we must not jeopardize  the `Ariane operational product,' which has now reached a  satisfactory level of quality."    The solution, then, consists of shortening production and  launch times. As a result, the average time frame for launching  an Ariane 4, which formerly included a minimum interval of 22  working days, has been reduced to 20 days. The feasibility of  this new schedule was demonstrated at the end of 1993, and it  will enable Arianespace to launch 10 Ariane 4's per year from  1994 to 1996.  <H5>  15 Ariane 5's Marketed </H5>   In addition, Arianespace has already started negotiating  contracts with manufacturers for series production of the new  Ariane 5 [AR5] launcher. At the end of October, the European  agency asked the firms concerned to make a special effort to  reduce manufacturing costs "by an average of at least 30  percent" (see AIR &amp; COSMOS, No. 1446).    "All the manufacturers concerned received a letter from  Arianespace establishing two objectives with respect to cost  reductions: one for the first 14 series-produced rockets (after  the two very first rockets, which are part of the development  program) and the other for the rest of the series beginning with  the 15th AR5.    Bigot told us that so far, "no manufacturer has achieved  that  30-percent reduction." Negotiations will therefore continue--and  be speeded up--this year because, he said, "we plan to order the  first batch of 14 AR5's (perhaps in installments) in 1994."    The result is that over the next three years, Europe should  have launched at least the first three Ariane 5's: AR-501 in  October 1995, followed by 502 and 503 in April and October 1996.  And according to Arianespace's CEO, "everything is to be in  order for operational flights beginning in 1997."    The next phase, he said, is to be "another three-year period  during which the AR5 will become increasingly popular, with two,  three, and then four launches per year (that is, nine rockets  over a three-year period). That will be followed by the AR5's  nominal launch rate (reduced since cancellation of the Hermes)  of five launches per year beginning in 1999.    "All of our contracts already stipulate flights with the  Ariane 5," said Bigot. He explained, however, that at first,  "AR5 will be offered at the same price (within 3 to 5 percent)  as Ariane 4," the argument being that Arianespace will sell  either Ariane 4 or Ariane 5 but will have to compensate for the  additional cost of the--less than optimal--operation of two  launchers during the three-year transitional period. The fact is  that productivity will not be as good during that period, with  only nine AR5 launches and 9 or 10 Ariane 4 launches.    But the transition may proceed faster than expected, said  Bigot, who explained that the company would take charge of  marketing Ariane 5 beginning with the second rocket (AR-502).  The ESA [European Space Agency] has (also) just put that  launcher on the market, since it is no longer reserved for the  Artemis experimental relay satellite, development of which is  already six months behind schedule even though work has just  begun--meaning that it will no longer be possible to launch  Artemis (for free) on AR-502. On the contrary, the agency will  have to pay at least $115 million for space on a commercial AR5  flight!    Arianespace is therefore already preparing to operate about  15 Ariane 5's, with flight 502--which is still part of the  Ariane 5 flight qualification program--being marketed especially  for the ESA. From that point on, Arianespace plans to have only  double launches of AR5's (and probably no triple launches other  than on an exceptional basis), while gradually speeding up the  launch rate to the point that by the end of the decade, there  will be five launches per year to put 10 satellites--half the  worldwide market--in orbit. Beginning with European satellites,  of course, because, as Bigot announced, "currently all the ESA  projects are being reworked to make them compatible with AR5."    But, and this is another new "message" from Bigot,  "Arianespace also wants to be the firm handling all elements of  space transportation in Europe," including, he said, the new  logistic elements of infrastructure or orbital service  operations such as the ATV "space tug," the CTV manned capsule,  or the ACRV rescue vessel.    But that will depend on the decisions made regarding those  programs at the next ESA council meeting on 18 January 1994 and  then at the conference of European ministers early in 1995!</p>

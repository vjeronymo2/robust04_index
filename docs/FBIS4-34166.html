			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] "The APRA [American Revolutionary Popular  Alliance] has no other course than to destroy the dictatorship."  This was the unanimous response of all the APRA leaders who held  an enthusiastic rally last night in the APRA headquarters to  honor Agustin Mantilla Campos who was recently released from  prison.    The leaders even proposed that after the current regime has  been defeated, the first motion in Congress will be a formal  accusation of "high treason" against President Alberto Fujimori  and the military leaders supporting him.    With these expressions, the leaders discarded any possible  rapprochement with the current government as was hinted by Alan  Garcia unless great changes occur in the country.    The slogan sung by everyone at the rally yesterday was clear  in this regard: "The APRA moves on without pacts or alliances."    The main speaker was Agustin Mantilla who energetically said  that they would never accept a pact with a government that  imposed a policy of hunger and misery.    He added: "In the 1995 elections, our task will be to take  the dictator out of the palace and lock him up in prison."    Regarding the possibility of a concensus candidacy, Mantilla  was clear when he said that, according to the thoughts of APRA  founder Haya de la Torre, a political democracy cannot exist  without an economic democracy.    He said: "We should not fall into a limping democracy with  hunger and misery just because we want to come out of the  dictatorship."    He added: The struggle is also against neoliberalism,  against  the auctioning of the country, against the rich who are getting  richer.    Addressing the rally, which filled the auditorium, Mantilla  recognized the need for the APRA to renew its program and  government platform.    He said: We must look at the new world events and the real  situation of the country.    But never--he said--abandon the idea that the state must  continue to act in the national life.    At the end of his speech and in the midst of shouts from his  supporters, Mantilla asked the party militants for more work,  effort, and sacrifice to be successful in the 1995 elections.    Also, leader Jorge del Castillo clarified that Alan Garcia  in  an interview with a foreign television station never spoke of  pacts or alliances.    He said that Garcia referred to the possibility of dialogue  on issues such as misery or subversion.    He added: "He never mentioned an alliance with the  dictatorship, his comments were general and some media tried to  distort them." [passage omitted]</p>

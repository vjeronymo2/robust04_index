			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IS IT JUST AN X WITH ANOTHER NAME? READERS SOUND OFF ON THE NEW NC-17 MOVIE  RATING;  </P> <P> THE RECENT CHANGE IN THE MOVIE RATING SYSTEM PRODUCED A NUMBER OF RESPONSES.  HERE ARE SOME.  </P> <P> A wolf in sheep's clothing is still a wolf. An X-rated movie with an NC-17  rating is still an X-rated movie.  </P> <P> I respectfully ask you to not advertise NC-17 movies.  </P> <P> Otherwise, our family will be forced to get our news elsewhere.  </P> <P> LINDA MURRAY, Sun Valley  </P></p>

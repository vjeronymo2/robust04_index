			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Finance and The Family: There'll be L to pay in August THE first L-registered cars appear next month and motorists' thoughts will be turning to how best to pay for a new one. Shrewder drivers may also be thinking about buying a used car. Car finance can be a complicated area, as different options are difficult to compare. The main choices are between manufacturer's finance, or a loan or hire purchase plan with a financial institution. The traditional way to buy a car is on hire purchase, and this is still offered by car companies' finance arms and some independent finance companies. Interest rates are lower than on personal loans, but you will not own the car until you have made the final payment. Defaulting will lose you both the car and everything you have paid. Manufacturers' own loans can be good value, with lower annual percentage rates than from other lenders, but the attractiveness of the rate will depend on how much deposit you put down, and there may be a relatively short time to pay off the loan. A personal loan from another lender could be more flexible. A new option, strongly promoted by most car makers, is an American-style personal contract purchase scheme. Ford's scheme is called Options, Vauxhall's is Choices 1-2-3, Rover and BMW both call theirs Select, and so on. Essentially, all work in the same way, based on the concept of a minimum guaranteed future value (MGFV). This is what the dealer and customer agree the car should be worth at the end of a two- or three-year contract, allowing for limited annual mileage and reasonable maintenance. Then, a hire purchase-type contract is set up for two or three years. The customer pays only for the car's price less a deposit and the MGFV - although interest is charged on the price including the MGFV - making monthly payments cheaper than normal hire purchase. At the end of the contract period, the customer can either hand the car back and walk away, buy it outright for the MGFV (using savings or a loan), or trade it in for a new model. This type of contract is very common in the US, and is starting to prove popular in the UK. One drawback is that contracts are based on the car's list price, rather than a price you negotiate with a dealer. Price negotiation may still be possible with other kinds of manufacturer's finance, but you will probably have the most leverage if you are effectively a cash buyer. August is not a good month for trying to get a large discount on a new car, except perhaps towards the end of the month when dealers are under pressure to meet sales targets. However, the large numbers of people trying to sell their old cars and buy newly-registered vehicles can mean there are good used motor deals. TSB has published a free booklet giving tips on how to bargain for goods and services. The chapter on cars includes a calendar of best times to buy. If you decide to use a personal loan to finance your purchase, a wide range of companies will be eager to lend you money. If you are a homeowner whose mortgage is less than the current value of your home, you could take out a secured loan. These are generally cheaper than unsecured loans, but remember you are putting your house at risk if you do not keep up repayments. It is unlikely to be worth staking your home for a lower rate of interest on a relatively small loan. Unsecured personal loans are riskier for the lender, so interest rates tend to be higher, but if you shop around, you can find good deals. There is usually a maximum amount of around Pounds 10,000 that banks and building societies are willing to lend as an unsecured loan for a car. Some offer loans only to existing customers, although others will let you take out a loan and open an account at the same time. Marks and Spencer offers a good deal for account customers, but its maximum loan is Pounds 5,000, and interest rates are slightly higher for non-account holders. Many high street lenders have special offers on personal loans for car buyers during August, such as cuts in interest rates, free gifts or discount vouchers. Barclays, Midland and the TSB are all cutting normal loan rates by 2 percentage points for car purchases before the end of August, while Halifax has cut its rate by 1 percentage point. Abbey National is giving away a free car alarm or steering wheel lock with every car loan taken out before the end of August. HFC bank has a package of offers and discounts with its car loans, including free RAC membership, and discounts on Scorpion car alarms, RAC motor insurance and inspections of second-hand cars. However, free gifts can obscure the fact that HFC's loans are more expensive than competitors' (see table), with APRs of 23.6 per cent on loans of Pounds 2,000-Pounds 4,999, and 21.9 per cent on loans over Pounds 5,000. As with all special offers, it is worth checking exactly what the offer is worth. Most lenders will offer payment protection insurance for the loan, which will cover repayments if you cannot work because of illness or unemployment, or if you die. But this can add significantly to loan costs. Ask for details before you sign. Beware of inertia selling. For example, Barclays requires you to tick a box if you do not want insurance. The application form for a loan from the Alliance and Leicester does not even have a box to tick - some extremely small print instructs you to delete a clause and initial it if you do not want the insurance, which adds more than Pounds 500 to the cost of a Pounds 5,000 loan over two years. A two-page special report on second cars appears on Pages VIII and IX.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   UNSECURED PERSONAL LOANS/CAR LOANS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           Amount             APR         Offer ends                           Pounds           Per cent  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Abbey National           500-1,999           21.9           31/8/93*                           2k-10k             19.9           31/8/93* Alliance &amp; Leicester     500-1,999           20.6                           2k-7.5             18.6 Barclays                2.5k-4,900           17.9    1/8/93-11/9/93                           5k-10k             16.9 First Direct             500-10k             17.9 Halifax BS                1k-7.5k            19.1           31/8/93 Lloyds                   500-10k             18.1 Marks &amp; Spencer          500-5,000      17.4-16.8**                                         17.9-17.3** **** Midland                  500-2,990           19.4           31/8/93                           3k-10k             17.3           31/8/93 NatWest                  500-2k              20.9                           2k+                18.9 Royal Bank of Scotland  1.5k-2,450           20.8                         2.5k-15k             18.2 TSB                       2k-4,990           17.9           31/8/93                           5k-12k             15.9           31/8/93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Free car alarm or steering wheel lock before this date. ** APR depends on length of contract. **** Rate for non-account holders.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

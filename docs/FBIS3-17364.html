			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Mar 24, BNS -- The representatives of  Russian forces are expected today to present to Estonian  authorities the lists of Russian military who reside and work in  Paldiski, Juri Tikk, special representative of the government in  Paldiski, told BNS.    "Estonian military authorities together with Russian  officials will go over the lists and permit applications and, if  everything tallies, the documents will be stamped for  registration," Tikk said. The stamp allows Russian military to  move freely in Paldiski during the dismantling of the nuclear  reactors when control over persons staying there will be stepped  up.    Tikk said the command of Russia's 144th motorized rifle  division and the Baltic Fleet are supposed to present similar  lists, since some officers serving in those units live in  Paldiski.    At a meeting with Russian officials on Tuesday [22 March]  the  two parties agreed that family members of the Russian military  living in Paldiski as well as their cars will be registered and  that lists of officers and seamen will be given to Estonian  authorities. Tikk said about 600 Russian military are currently  stationed in Paldiski.    "We are not entirely satisfied with the compromise, but  there's no other solution at present," Tikk said. "On the basis  of the lists we are to get we shall issue the Russian military  with temporary permits for moving about in Paldiski. We hope  the lists can be trusted."</p>

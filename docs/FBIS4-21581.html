			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From 22 March RAHVA HAAL, PAEVALEHT, HOMMIKULEHT; "News </F> Bulletin" No. 55/94]    [Text] Tuesday, March 22 -- Yesterday's questions and  answers session was dominated by the Israeli weapons deal.  Prime Minister Mart Laar and Commander in Chief Aleksander  Einseln had to answer questions concerning their compatibility  to the NATO standards and quality.    The Israeli-made small arms do not meet the STANAG  agreements  since Israel is not a member of the NATO, General Einseln  explained. However, since the agreements concern primarily  ammunition, the weapons can be considered as meeting the STANAG  requirements, he stressed. Einseln added that the government  had not approached him before on the NATO standards issue and  the decision to purchase weapons from Israel had been made  before he became Commander in Chief.    MP Andra Veidemann questioned Mart Laar on the incomplete  weapons consignments and the premier claimed the drawbacks to be  insignificant. Laar mentioned some missing cartridge clips and  bayonets, stressed that this does not prevent the weapons from  being used, and added that the Israeli company will supply the  missing parts. Estonian experts will later check on the  completeness of the consignments before they will be shipped to  Estonia, Laar assured the parliament.    Further questions concerned the presented 23-millimetre  anti-  aircraft guns. Laar told the Riigikogu [parliament] that the  decision had been made after an appeal by GHQ chief of staff  Colonel Ants Laaneots during his visit to Israel last year.  Laar claimed that the anti-aircraft guns as well as the machine  guns had really been a present, outside the consignment which  had been paid for. The Israeli supplier will help to repair the  unusable weapons, he added. But the opposition members  disagreed. Peeter Lorents claimed to have rarely heard "such a  barefaced lie" as told by Laar and further explained that tests  had disclosed more serious drawbacks with the weapons. He  specifically mentioned defective mines and anti-tank ammunition.  Lorents was seconded by MP Jiri Toomepuu, who claimed to have  seen the original agreement, according to which the defective  anti-aircraft guns were a part of the deal. They were supported  by some other members. Centrist MP Olav Anton commented that  only the Defence Minister, who has never served in the army,  could believe such vague explanations.    Centrist MP Liina Tdnisson asked about the renting of the  building in 3 Toompuiestee and Laar explained that the  government had decided to hold an open auction. But he repeated  that the government keeps supporting the idea of renting it to  the company "Koneston", which intends to organise a Russian  business centre there.    Laar rejected the claims that the mari airfield is being  used  for transporting stolen cars out of Estonia. The Estonian  border guard is checking the leaving aircraft, he said.    Laar also explained that the government had decided to  spread  the funds of the national budget between different banks purely  in order to cut the risks. He added that a closed contest will  be held to determine the banks which will handle the funds next  year.    Laar assured the parliament that the investigation of the  cases when police officers mistreated Defence League members is  continuing and Interior Minister Heiki Arike has been instructed  to pursue the matter. But the names of most policemen who  allegedly beat the volunteers are still unknown, Laar admitted.    The "Independents" faction of the Riigikogu elected Jaanus  Raidal its chairman and Mart Niklus vice-chairman. Other  members of the six-man faction are Ants Erm, Avo Kiir, Kalju  Pdldvere and Toivo Uustalu. Raidal announced that the faction  meeting approved a resolution to support the reinforcement of  law and order in Estonia.</p>

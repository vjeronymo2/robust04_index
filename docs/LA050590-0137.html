			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINESE FILMMAKER LOOKS BACK TO FUTURE;  </P> <P> MOVIES: DIRECTOR EXAMINES THE PLIGHT OF WOMEN IN CHINA IN 'GOLDEN LOTUS.'  </P> <P> She's young, she's beautiful and she's got all of Hong Kong talking about the  reincarnation of China's most celebrated "slut of all time." She is Clara Law,  a 1985 graduate of the acclaimed National Film School in England who is one of  Asia's hottest new film directors and only one of three working woman directors  in the fast-paced competitive Hong Kong movie industry.  </P> <P> Combining lush period costumes and a modern setting with illicit romance,  mystery and reincarnation, Law is clearly poised for international acclaim  through her newest film, "The Reincarnation of Golden Lotus," which opened  Friday, at Laemmle's Monica Fourplex in Santa Monica and the Grand Fourplex in  downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The film opens at the Gates of Hell where a young woman faces a sorceress who  is preparing her for reincarnation. The story then follows Lotus' second chance  in mid-1960s China, in a fast-moving drama filled with humor and tragedy  delivered with a distinct social and political statement about the role of  women.  </P> <P> Law, 32, takes Lotus, who is a well-known character from classic Chinese  literature, and by placing her in modern-day China and Hong Kong turns around  all preconceived notions about the most famous "fallen woman" of Sung dynasty  China.  </P> <P> "Originally, I thought I would look at it from a moral point of view -- in  ancient times she was looked upon as a slut. But given a modern way of looking  at women, she would be like any woman who wants to make her own decisions. So I  tried to look at it from this perspective but I found it a bit difficult to do  this in Hong Kong society where, basically, (social values) are still just the  same (as in ancient times). Women still have to sell their bodies to be able to  get to the top," Law explained.  </P> <P> After several rewrites, Law and female scriptwriter Lee Pik Wah finally settled  on portraying Lotus as a young woman who is constantly haunted by flashback  scenes of her tortured previous life in ancient feudal China, linking her past,  present and perhaps future to a predetermined fate.  </P> <P> In the original classic, Lotus is a beautiful woman in 10th-Century China who  is sold, raped, abused and finally murdered -- all at the hands of men.  Although viewed as pornographic by both Mainland China and modern-day Hong Kong  standards, the book nonetheless is considered the earliest social criticism  written in China.  </P> <P> In "Reincarnation," Law shows Lotus as a young woman who is not afraid to go  after what she wants. But despite the modern setting, Lotus finds herself again  a victim of fate. Stunningly beautiful, she attracts the unwanted attention of  men and although raped by her school principal, it is she who is labeled a slut  for attempting to fight him off. When she tries to again master her own fate  and gives a pair of shoes to a handsome classmate, she is accused of stealing  the shoes. She is then sent to the countryside for re-education after the  classmate bows under peer pressure and disavows her.  </P> <P> But Lotus refuses to give up. In yet another attempt to escape from the  confines of a society which has labeled her immoral, she enters into a loveless  marriage with a homely but rich Hong Kong businessman who brings her to Hong  Kong and showers her with gifts and affection. But Lotus appears to be unable  to shake either of her pasts and soon discovers that the handsome classmate has  been hired as a chauffeur by her new husband, who considers him to be a  brother. In her past life, the Sung dynasty Lotus fell in love with her  brother-in-law and is eventually killed by him after she seeks out another  lover in frustration.  </P> <P> "We put her in a situation that she can remember bits of her past life at a  time. She wants to overcome fate. She doesn't want it to happen again. She  wanted to be in control. . . .  </P> <P> "I wanted to make a positive statement about the woman," said Law. "I felt that  she relied on men because she had no way to defend herself against the basic  social inequality against women. I had a certain sympathy for her. That's why I  wanted to put her into this life.  </P> <P> "But I wanted to keep a certain romantic notion of the story; what I feel is  that the brother-in-law in fact loves her but he just doesn't have the guts to  show it. He wanted to be a man, a moral one. But in modern society, it's not  that hard to get your brother's wife if you love her enough. But he is just not  that kind of man. He is more a coward and I really wanted to portray the woman  as superior -- someone who is willing to pursue her love."  </P> <P> Law's transformation of Lotus from slut to heroine has raised some controversy  in her native Hong Kong. After the film opened last fall, Law said that the  audiences found it interesting but they were also disturbed by the subject. She  said; "Chinese are, in a way, superstitious. They believe in reincarnation and  the film may have made some people think they too were reliving past lives."  </P> <P> Law feels that all of her films are linked by a common theme of feeling  "homeless," of not having a place where one can belong.  </P> <P> Her 80-minute graduation thesis film, "They Say the Moon is Fuller Here," which  won the Silver Plaque at the 1985 Chicago International Film Festival, explores  the difficulties a young woman from Hong Kong faces when she goes to England.  The autobiographical bent of the film came one step closer when Law couldn't  find the right actress to play the role of the woman and ended up both acting  in and directing the film.  </P> <P> Law's first commercial film, "The Other Half and the Other Half," tackled the  problem faced by many Hong Kong couples who have separated temporarily to  ensure that they will have a place to go should China's 1997 takeover of Hong  Kong prove to be too restrictive.  </P> <P> "I wanted to explore what happens when a couple is split up in this way. In  Hong Kong we call them 'tai hoong yun' -- people without their spouses. It has  become very commonplace. What are you to do with your life when your other half  is not there? That is a question that is worrying all Hong Kong people."  </P> <P> Law was deeply affected by the Chinese government's violent crackdown on the  student democracy movement on June 4, which she watched live on Hong Kong  television. "I was so shocked I cannot forget it," she recalled. "It was late  at night. I was glued to the set. When the lights went out at Tian An Men  Square, everything went dark for me.  </P> <P> "This feeling of homelessness, of searching for freedom, for justice in the  homeland and not able to find it . . . It seems to me that time is running out  for China."  </P> <P> Chen is a San Francisco-based freelance writer.  </P></p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / International Company News: Disposal clears Uni for cash call UNI STOREBRAND, Norway's largest insurance group, is to be re-listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange within two weeks. It will then be released from the grip of public administrators in August, company officials said yesterday. The disposal on Tuesday of Uni Holding's 25 per cent stake in Skandia, the big Swedish insurance group, was the last step in a difficult process to facilitate a NKr4.3bn (Dollars 627m) recapitalisation of the group. A fully-underwritten share offer will raise NKr2.8bn, while a bond issue will generate the remaining NKr1.5bn. A prospectus for the issue of 208m new shares, to be sent to 115,000 former Uni shareholders, is about to be finalised. The shares in the rights issue will be priced a NKr10 each. Norway's finance ministry had demanded the disposal of the Skandia stake before it would approve the plan. Uni collapsed last August under the weight of NKr3.8bn in short-term debt accrued to finance the acquisition of a NKr4.7bn, 28.3 per cent Skandia shareholding. Uni, together with Hafnia, the Danish insurance company, jointly launched a failed raid on Skandia, which almost resulted in the demise of both companies. Uni and Hafnia disposed of their respective Skandia shareholdings in a deal valued at SKr3.2bn (Dollars 441m). Skandia warmly welcomed news of the share placing, saying it brought stability to its ownership base and 'a strong position in the market for future success'. Mr Bjorn Wolrath, Skandia chief executive, said: 'This means that uncertainty concerning the ownership issue, which has prevailed for nearly three years, has at last been resolved.' Uni sold 18.96m shares at SKr100 a share, or a total of NKr1.77bn, while Hafnia got SKr110 a share. At the end of March, Uni Holding's 25 per cent Skandia stake was booked at a value of NKr1.57bn, which means it will book a gain on the disposal of an estimated NKr200m. Uni's life insurance business still holds a 3.3 per cent stake in Skandia, or 2.5m shares. Skandia has rebuffed two assaults since 1990 - the first from Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, the second from Hafnia and Uni Storebrand - but saw its share price plunge from around SKr220 to a low of SKr45 in the process.

			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AMBIGUOUS ART CARVED DOWN TO THE NITTY-GRITTY  </P> <P> On the beach at Corona del Mar on Sunday, a woman sauntered past an impressive  carving in the sand, where skilled hands had fashioned a hulking mass of wet  beachfront into a work of art.  </P> <P> "Did you do this?" the woman inquired of a man, whose knees and fingernails  were answer enough.  </P> <P> "Uh huh," said John DiLauro, smiling and proud.  </P> <P> "What is it?" the woman asked.  </P> <P> Art can be ambiguous.  </P> <P> DiLauro's smile faded a bit as he said the sculpture was a sandcastle. And by  the way, it was actually his son, John DiLauro the architect, who was  responsible for the carving.  </P> <P> "It's an abstract sculpture," son John said. "A series of planes -- horizontal,  vertical."  </P> <P> Not every castle and creature formed Sunday at the 1989 Invitational Sandcastle  Competition was as open to interpretation as the DiLauro creation.  </P> <P> Most of the 26 entries in the competition, sponsored by the county chapter of  the American Institute of Architecture, were clearly what they appeared to be:  castles, astronauts, turtles, lobster and a bust of Pete Rose with the caption:  "$10 says I don't bet on baseball."  </P> <P> "This contest is much more than running sand through your hands. . . . This is  big-time carving," said Loralyn Reif, spokeswoman for the event.  </P> <P> The competition promotes public awareness of architecture and raises money  through entry fees and T-shirt sales for the institute's educational programs,  scholarships and other activities.  </P> <P> The participants, architects, architectural firms and professional sand  sculptors had just five hours to complete their work. Entries were judged on  best use of site, originality and design, degree of difficulty and detail and  execution. Winners received plaques and applause.  </P> <P> A panel of judges -- including architects, Orange County Supervisor Thomas F.  Riley and Times architecture critic Sam Hall Kaplan -- awarded the grand prize  to a crew representing architect Joseph Woolett for a neatly fashioned series  of classical columns.  </P> <P> First place in the "sandcastle" category went to the Newport Beach  architectural firm of Dougherty &amp; Dougherty, whose handiwork featured crisp  lines and lifelike detail.  </P> <P> However, in the sand sculpture category, ambiguity appeared to reign. Bill  Crook, owner of WRC Associates of Newport Beach, accepted without explanation  the winning plaque for a what was called "a derailed train."  </P> <P> "It wasn't a derailed train," Crook said later. "It was a spaceman coming  around on a crater."  </P> <P> Who called it a derailed train?  </P> <P> "The judges," Crook said.  </P></p>

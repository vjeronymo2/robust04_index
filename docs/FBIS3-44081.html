			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Angolan peace talks continue in Lusaka, Zambia.  No agreement has been reached on specific principles on forming  the national police at today's meeting. Pedro Maneul reports.    Good evening. The government and the National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] have not yet reached  agreement on specific principles. The main document from the  mediators and observers was readjusted during separate meetings  held this morning. These readjustments, called coordination of  language, should have been finished late this afternoon [words  indistinct] mediators submitted documents to be examined by the  negotiating teams.    We say the readjustments should have been finished late this  afternoon, because this information has not yet been confirmed  due to the press blackout [preceding word in English]. The  readjustments would have transformed the document by the  mediators into a final text, since this would come after the the  negotiating teams replied to the document that UN's Alioune  Blondin Beye presented to them last Thursday [20 January]. On  that occasion, the document was already known as a proposal from  the mediators and observers for the final discussion of specific  principles. But since a proposal is just a proposal, replies can  either be positive or negative.    Thus, some readjustments have been suggested. Now, some  sources say that the [words indistinct] intermediary stand of  the mediators and observers on specific principles. The sources  say that with this stand the negotiators should propose signing  an agreement on the principles under discussion. Sources say  this agreement could be reached tomorrow, if UNITA does not  complicate issues further. The government has always said yes  to proposals by the mediators and observers.</p>

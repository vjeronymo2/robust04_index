			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 14 Apr (EFE) -- Argentine  President Carlos Menem indicated today that he supports the  creation of a "court of ethics" to control "aggressive"  journalism "that humiliates and discredits without proof or  foundation."    Menem reacted in this way after learning of the acquittal  handed down by Federal Judge Nerio Bonifatti on Menem's  sister-in-law, Amira Yoma, in the trial for alleged drug money  laundering. [passage omitted]    The matter was investigated by the Argentine media, which  gave ample coverage of the trial and discussed the actions of  the judges and prosecutors in the case.    As soon as Yoma was acquitted, Menem vented his anger on the  journalists who had revealed details of the trial within the  framework of his periodical confrontations with certain sectors  of the media.    Menem told a radio station of this capital that "in my  opinion the time has come to create a court of ethics to judge  those who engage in a type of journalism that is totally out of  line with reality, an aggressive journalism that humiliates and  discredits without proof or foundation."

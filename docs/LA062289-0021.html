			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CULVER CITY ASSISTANT TO REPLACE MCCURDY AS ROYAL BASEBALL COACH  </P> <P> Daniel May, a varsity assistant at Culver City High for the past three years,  has been selected to guide the Royal baseball program, Principal Dave Jackson  said Wednesday.  </P> <P> May, 26, replaces Mike McCurdy, who resigned last month with a four-year record  of 44-56. The Highlanders were 12-17 and finished sixth in the Marmonte League  with a 4-8 mark in 1989. Royal never reached the playoffs under McCurdy.  </P> <P> Jackson picked May over Al Tarazon, the other finalist for the job and the  junior varsity coach at Channel Islands High.  </P> <P> "It was a tough decision because both are fine young men," Jackson said. "I sat  down and took a big yellow paper and listed the pros and cons of each. The easy  part is when you have one guy who's a 10 and everyone else is a 4. Both these  guys were 9-plus.  </P> <P> "The part that swayed me was that Dan May had three years of varsity experience  as an assistant. But I'll tell you what, Al Tarazon will be a head coach  somewhere soon."  </P> <P> May will join Royal in the fall as a student teacher in the art and photography  departments. He also will assist in the football program.  </P> <P> "That did not come into my final decision. I was trying to find a very, very  good baseball coach," Jackson said.  </P> <P> May has coached the Culver City defensive line for the past two seasons. He  coached the freshman baseball team before serving as varsity assistant the past  three seasons.  </P> <P> May said that he met Royal Athletic Director Terry Dobbins three years ago at a  Culver City-Simi Valley baseball playoff game and has kept in touch ever since.  Dobbins, then at Simi Valley, later moved to Royal. May's parents also live in  Simi Valley.  </P> <P> "Between keeping in touch with Dobbins and my parents, I stayed on top of what  was going on with job openings out there," said May, a 1981 Culver City  graduate who played baseball at Cal State Dominguez Hills.  </P> <P> May said that he is exploring the possibility of entering Royal in an area  summer league.  </P> <P> "We're off to a late start," May said. "But I'm hoping that with the contacts I  have down here that we can work something out.  </P> <P> "Even if it's real informal, I'd like to see what we're going to have out  there."  </P> <P> Culver City won the Ocean League title last season and finished 21-7. The  Centaurs were defeated by Long Beach Millikan in the second round of the  Southern Section 5-A Division playoffs.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 182(b)(2) of the amended Act requires States to adopt RACT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rules for all areas designated nonattainment for ozone and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classified as moderate or above. There are three parts to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 182(b)(2) RACT requirement: (1) RACT for sources covered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by an existing CTG_i.e., a CTG issued prior to the enactment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the CAAA of 1990; (2) RACT for sources covered by a post-enactment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CTG; and (3) all major sources not covered by a CTG, i.e., non-CTG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources. This RACT requirement which applies to nonattainment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas that previously were exempt from certain RACT requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires areas to ``catch up'' to those nonattainment areas that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> became subject to those requirements during an earlier period. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, it requires newly designated ozone nonattainment areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to adopt RACT rules consistent with those for previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designated nonattainment areas. As previously mentioned, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State of Maine contains three moderate ozone nonattainment areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These areas are thus subject to the section 182(b)(2) RACT catch-up requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, the State of Maine is located in the Northeast Ozone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transport Region (OTR). The entire State is, therefore, subject  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to section 184(b) of the amended CAA. Section 184(b) requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that RACT be implemented for all VOC sources covered by a CTG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issued before or after the enactment of the CAAA of 1990 and for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all major VOC sources (defined as 50 tons per year or greater for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources in the OTR).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since Maine had previously submitted regulations for bulk gasoline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminals, fixed roof petroleum tanks, and paper coating sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pursuant to the RACT fix-up requirement, in order to meet the RACT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> catch-up requirement, the State must, therefore, adopt regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (or affirm that no sources exist) for the remaining 26 CTG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> categories as well as adopt rules for all major non-CTG sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Rules for non-CTG sources are not part of this SIP revision and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not be further discussed in this document).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> EPA's Evaluation of Maine's Submittal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to the RACT catch-up requirement, on May 14, 1992 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> June 12, 1992, Maine submitted negative declarations for the CTG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> categories listed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Surface coating of coils.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Surface coating of magnet wire.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Surface coating of large appliances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Surface coating of automobiles and light duty trucks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Manufacturing of synthesized pharmaceuticals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Manufacturing of pneumatic rubber tires.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Manufacturing of vegetable oil.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Air oxidation processes in synthetic organic chemical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturing industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Manufacturing of high density polyethylene, polypropylene and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> polystyrene resins.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Leaks from synthetic organic chemical and polymer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. Petroleum liquid storage in external floating roof tanks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / UK Company News: WMI jumps 49% to Pounds 144m WASTE Management International, the UK-listed overseas arm of Waste Management of the US, has maintained its rapid growth helped by acquisitions. It announced pre-tax profits ahead 49 per cent, from Pounds 96.4m to Pounds 143.7m, for 1992. Fourth quarter profits rose 36 per cent, from Pounds 30.1m to Pounds 40.9m. Mr Edwin Falkman, chief executive, said the results were 'very satisfying' against a difficult economic background. During the year the group made 25 acquisitions and raised Pounds 438m through a listing of 20 per cent of its shares. Waste Management and its subsidiaries retained 80 per cent. Turnover increased 34.5 per cent to Pounds 816.6m (Pounds 606.9m). Almost half the rise came from acquisitions with the remainder stemming from volume and price increases, especially in the Netherlands, France and Italy. Europe remained WMI's most important market, accounting for 77 per cent of turnover, while the proportion of sales in Italy declined from 46 per cent to 38 per cent as other markets grew. Full year operating margins improved from 15.4 per cent to 15.7 per cent, although fourth quarter margins were affected by lower contributions from new acquisitions and seasonal factors. Earnings were up 30 per cent to 23.3p (17.9p), partly reflecting the increased share capital since the initial public offering in April. WMI has said it will not pay dividends during its present, acquisition driven phase. This is likely to last for at least two or three years. The shares, which were listed at 585p, jumped 27p to 762p.

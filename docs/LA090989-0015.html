			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOW, BASEBALL MUST TACKLE THE DRUG ISSUE  </P> <P> When Pete Rose stonewalled his accusers with the standard "denial" response,  the late Bart Giamatti, very properly, played hardball with him. No  first-offense warning, no temporary suspension, just the maximum penalty --  banned for life.  </P> <P> The next commissioner will be faced with a period in which this country and  much of the world is attempting to deal effectively with our No. 1 problem --  drug abuse. Let him act just as decisively as his predecessor against even more  serious offenses on which Peter Ueberroth failed miserably.  </P> <P> Any player found using illegal drugs should face immediate suspension from  baseball for life, period.  </P> <P> J. DEVEREAUX LEAHY, Ventura  </P></p>

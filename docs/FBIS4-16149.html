			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM correspondent Mikhail Stetsyuk for TASS] </F>   [Text] Sevastopol, 13 Apr -- Over 300 delegates from  military units, establishments, and services of the main base of  the Black Sea Fleet and the fleet's garrisons gathered today in  the Sailors' Club for an officers' meeting. There were no  representatives of the command at the meeting; it was organized  and conducted by the leaders of the fleet's Council of Officers'  Meetings. The officers discussed the situation connected with  the events in Odessa.    The meeting passed a resolution expressing no-confidence in  the Ukrainian Defense Ministry and in Vice Admiral Vladimir  Beskaravaynyy, commander of the Ukrainian Navy. The meeting  again called the attention of the presidents of Ukraine and  Russia to the need to speed up the adoption of a decision on the  Black Sea Fleet. The resolution called on the newly-elected  Crimean Supreme Soviet to examine whether it is expedient to  have the many military formations of the Ukrainian Armed Forces  on the territory of the republic. The resolution also appealed  to the deputies of the town soviets of Odessa, Sevastopol,  Ochakov, Izmail, and Nikolayev to discuss the Odessa events and  give their assessment of them. The officers' meeting was very  stormy and showed that the officers by no means believe that  they should refrain from interfering in political processes.</p>

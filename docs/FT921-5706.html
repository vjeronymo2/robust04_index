			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Letter: Shareholders are owners Sir, Through your columns may I urge shareholders to reject the views of Sir Owen Green, reported in the Financial Times, that shareholders should not be considered as owners of the business ('BTR chief defends corporate leadership', February 27). This seems to be nothing more than yet another plea to leave management unfettered in the conduct of the business. With the memory of the unrestrained action of directors in Guinness, Polly Peck and Maxwell Communications still fresh, I would hope that shareholders will unreservedly reject such ideas. Interestingly, Sir Owen's views may not indeed be in the interests of management. Checks and balances on executive action are an essential feature of any successful organisation and in their absence executive power eventually exceeds acceptable limits. The consequences are either a demand for greater regulation or that resort has to be made to the law to resolve an issue. The alternative to statutory regulation is an improved relationship between management and shareholders. This can only be achieved within the reality that the shareholders, having provided the capital, are thereby in effect the owners of the business. Maurice Gillibrand, 7 Tal-y-Cae, Tregarth, Bangor, Gwynedd</p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / People: Non-executive directors Towry Law, one of the UK's largest chains of independent financial advisers, has moved to strengthen its board by appointing two extra non-executive directors: Bill Stuttaford and Clive Gilchrist. The appointments come in the context of the firm's plans to join the market: until now, Lord Ellenborough has been the only non-executive director. Stuttaford, 64, is a director of Invesco, General Portfolio Group and several investment trusts. He has, however, given up his role with Brown Shipley since the investment management side was sold to Capital House. Gilchrist, 43, has a background in pensions and investments and is a vice president of the National Association of Pension Funds. Alan Wesley, chief executive of Towry Law, says it is important to the company to be 'Cadbury compliant' and have the right numbers of executive and non-executive directors, but emphasises also that both appointments had areas of expertise which would bring 'added value' to the board. He highlights particularly Stuttaford's European knowledge, and says that Gilchrist's experience will be important because the company wants to increase the pensions part of its business. Stuttaford says he is keen to take an active role in offering comments and ideas: 'I don't see myself just as a monitor'.</p>

			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NUCLEAR ARMS PLANT OPERATOR OFFERED BONUSES  </P> <P> For the first time since its Savannah River nuclear weapons plant was built in  1950, the Energy Department is offering performance bonuses and a guaranteed  base fee to the plant's operator, officials said Thursday.  </P> <P> William Kaspar, manager of the department's field office at Savannah River,  near Aiken, S.C., outlined the payment plan to a group of experts advising  Energy Secretary James D. Watkins on safety issues involving the department's  nuclear weapons facilities.  </P> <P> The payment plan, which takes effect Saturday with the debut of a new  contractor at Savannah River, marks a significant departure from past practice  in which E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. operated the plant for 38 years  without any incentives.  </P> <P> Kaspar said the new plan is intended to give Du Pont's successor at Savannah  River, Westinghouse Electric Corp., a financial incentive to improve operation  of the plant's three nuclear reactors, which make materials for nuclear  warheads. The site also includes other facilities that support the nuclear  weapons program.  </P> <P> The three reactors have been shut down since last spring because of safety  concerns. Last week, Westinghouse submitted recommendations on how to get them  running again.  </P> <P> Although Westinghouse's contract is for five years, the payment plan can be  changed each six months, Kaspar said. For the first 6-month period, it can earn  a maximum of about $7 million in performance awards, Kaspar said.  </P></p>

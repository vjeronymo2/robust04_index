			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Heseltine launches London manifesto THE Conservatives yesterday summoned the genie of the defunct Greater London Council (GLC) in an attempt to link Labour's proposed strategic London authority with 'loony left' extremism. The Tories attacked Labour-controlled borough councils and what they termed Labour's 'vicious targeting of London' through its tax proposals. Labour's tax and national insurance plans meant that 'people on top taxes would be paying those taxes at lower levels than even under (former Labour chancellor) Denis Healey,' said Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, who was heading a six-strong phalanx of ministers. The six ministers assembled at Central Office to launch the Tories' London manifesto, which promises a Cabinet subcommittee for the capital, a minister for London transport and a private-sector forum to advise on the city's promotion as a cultural and business centre. The ministerial cast - Mr Heseltine, Mr Michael Portillo, Mr Timothy Renton, Mr Stephen Dorrell, Mr Roger Freeman and Mrs Angela Rumbold - seemed designed partly to compensate for the lack of anything new: the proposals had appeared in summary form in Wednesday's manifesto. Mr Heseltine attacked Labour's proposed authority as 'a GLC which we will remember very clearly is . . . a body to undermine the elected government of the day.' The aggressive tenor appeared to confirm the view of many observers that Labour's proposed London government might prove attractive to the capital's voters. Polls suggest that seven in 10 Londoners want an elected authority for their city. The Liberal Democrats have also proposed such a body, to be elected by proportional representation and partly funded by local taxes.</p>

			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NO CONFLICT OF INTEREST FOUND FOR BURBANK COUNCILMAN  </P> <P> The Fair Political Practices Commission has advised the city of Burbank that  Councilman Thomas E. Flavin does not have a conflict in voting on issues  affecting the Walt Disney Co., which pays an annual $1,000 membership fee to  the nonprofit organization that employs Flavin.  </P> <P> Sandra Michioku, a commission spokeswoman, said Monday that Flavin may  participate in City Council decisions regarding Burbank's proposed Media  District Specific Plan, which could affect Disney's development plans. Disney  owns and operates studios and corporate offices in the district, a 1.2-square  mile area in the southwest corner of Burbank and composed mostly of motion  picture and television studios.  </P> <P> Michioku said Disney's membership fee in the Economic Development Corp. of Los  Angeles County, of which Flavin is executive vice president, is not considered  a source of income to the councilman. The development corporation's main  function is to assist county businesses in attaining financial assistance for  expansion.  </P> <P> Burbank City Atty. Juli Scott said her office requested the advice from the  commission in July on Flavin's behalf.  </P> <P> Flavin said Monday, "I didn't expect that there would be any conflict, but I  just wanted to be sure."  </P> <P> Burbank is considering the adoption of a Media District Specific Plan as an  element of the city's general plan. The specific plan is to set strict design  standards regulating development by the studios and other property owners.  </P></p>

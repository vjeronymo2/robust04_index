			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / Widespread spending cuts in German draft budget MR THEO WAIGEL, the German finance minister, yesterday won cabinet approval for an austerity draft budget for 1993, imposing widespread spending cuts to finance the continuing heavy transfer of subsidies to eastern Germany. He presented the deal as 'a political signal' for next week's Group of Seven economic summit in Munich. Mr Waigel said it complied point-for-point with Germany's commitment made last January to reduce its budget deficit. The budget was put to cabinet two weeks early in an effort to show Germany's good faith to the G7. Germany was strongly criticised at the last G7 meeting in Washington for its disturbingly high public sector deficit. In the budget, overall spending is kept to a strict 2.5 per cent nominal growth rate, well below current inflation, and the government's net borrowing requirement will be cut by DM2.5bn (Pounds 850m) to DM38bn next year. By 1996, the plan is to reduce government borrowing to 'well under DM25bn', he said. The draft budget proposes its biggest savings in defence spending - down by 2.5 per cent from DM52.1bn to DM50.8bn. That budget also does not include an item of DM110m for the pre-production phase of the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA), following the political decision not to go ahead with the fighter as currently planned, but to design a cheaper derivative. Net savings are also planned in the economics ministry budget, which includes regional subsidies and trade promotion, down by 4.8 per cent, and in environment spending, down by 3.5 per cent to DM1.29bn. On the other hand the heavy spending drain remains overwhelmingly in eastern Germany, with an 8.8 per cent increase in the employment ministry budget - paying for unemployment benefit, retraining and job creation measures. Overall, the Waigel budget would see spending next year rise from DM425.1bn to DM435.65bn, or 2.5 per cent. European fighter's future, Page 5 Editorial Comment, Page 20</p>

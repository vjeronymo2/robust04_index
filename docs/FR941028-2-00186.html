			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Table S2&hyph;1. Summary of Interpretation of Purified Protein Derivative (PPD)-Tuberculin Skin-Test Results  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. An induration of "5 mm is classified as positive in:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Persons who have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or risk factors for HIV infection but unknown HIV status;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Persons who have had recent close contact* with persons who have active tuberculosis (TB);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> *Recent close contact implies either household or social contact or unprotected occupational exposure similar in intensity and duration to household contact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Persons who have fibrotic chest radiographs (consistent with healed TB).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. An induration of "10 mm is classified as positive in all persons who do not meet any of the criteria above but who have other risk factors for TB, including:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> High-Risk Groups <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Injecting-drug users known to be HIV seronegative;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Persons who have other medical conditions that reportedly increase the risk for progressing from latent TB infection to active TB (e.g., silicosis; gastrectomy or jejuno-ileal bypass; being "10% below ideal body weight; chronic renal failure with renal dialysis; diabetes mellitus; high-dose corticosteroid or other immuno-suppressive therapy; some hematologic disorders, including malignancies such as leukemias and lymphomas; and other malignancies);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Children &lt;4 years of age.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> High-prevalence Groups <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Persons born in countries in Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, and Latin America that have high prevalence of TB;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Persons from medically underserved, low-income populations;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Residents of long-term-care facilities (e.g., correctional institutions and nursing homes);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Persons from high-risk populations in their communities, as determined by local public health authorities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. An induration of "15 mm is classified as positive in persons who do not meet any of the above criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Recent converters are defined on the basis of both size of induration and age of the person being tested:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;"10 mm increase within a 2-year period is classified as a recent conversion for persons &lt;35 years of age;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;"15 mm increase within a 2-year period is classified as a recent conversion for persons "35 years of age.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. PPD skin-test results in health-care workers (HCWs) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;In general, the recommendations in sections 1, 2, and 3 of this table should be followed when interpreting skin-test results in HCWs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the prevalence of TB in the facility should be considered when choosing the appropriate cut-point for defining a positive PPD reaction. In facilities where there is essentially no risk for exposure to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mycobacterium tuberculosis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i.e., minimal- or very low-risk facilities [Section II.B]), an induration "15 mm may be a suitable cut-point for HCWs who have no other risk factors. In facilities where TB patients receive care, the cut-point for HCWs with no other risk factors maybe "10 mm.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A recent conversion in an HCW should be defined generally as a "10 mm increase in size of induration within a 2-year period. For HCWs who work in facilities where exposure to TB is very unlikely (e.g., minimal-risk facilities), an increase of "15 mm within a 2-year period may be more appropriate for defining a recent conversion because of the lower positive-predictive value of the test in such groups.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Inquiries about trains may move to premium phone rate Rail travellers could be faced with paying premium rates for calls to railway inquiry offices, Charles Batchelor writes. Charging premium rates is one of the options being studied by Mr Roger Salmon, the railway franchise director charged with selling off the British Rail network. He is attempting to put an end to the perpetual engaged tone at BR telephone information offices and has invited four companies to submit bids to run a national telephone inquiry bureau. Bids are expected in the next few days and the winning company will be chosen in the next few months. 'We are keen to do this job a lot better,' said Mr Salmon. The rate for calls is undecided, but the franchise director is considering a range of options including introducing 0891 lines which charge premium rates or 0345 lines which charge at local call rates.</p>

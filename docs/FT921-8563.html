			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of the Philippines (4): Power crisis bites - Electricity Supply NOT FOR the first time, parts of the Philippines are suffering from a shortage of electricity. The southern island of Mindanao has been worst hit and consumers have endured blackouts - or 'brownouts' as they are known locally - for up to 12 hours a day. Businesses - from cement factories to fish canneries, some of them lured to the island by the prospect of cheap hydro-electric power - have been forced to reduce their output or use their costly standby generators for extended periods. Prices of the affected products are expected to rise. Further north, the grid for the island of Luzon and its capital Metro Manila has barely enough electricity to cope with demand, which will mean more power cuts if part of the ageing and overstretched generating system fails. Had the economy been growing rapidly instead of stagnating, the shortages would be even worse. The single most important cause of the power crisis - which, besides the elections, has become the country' hottest topic of conversation and controversy - is the lack of decisive action by the government to build new power stations. The government has not been helped, it must be said, by the popular tendency to complain about the financial losses and inadequacies of the state-owned National Power Corporation (Napocor) at the same time as protesting about modest increases in the price of electricity. 'Whereas in other countries with fast economic growth the price of oil and electricity is accepted as an economic fact of life,' said an exasperated Mr Jesus Estanislao, finance minister, last month, 'here it has remained a subject of endless debate and fruitless discussion.' A drought affecting hydro-electric dams on Mindanao, a dispute between Napocor and the local community over the island's Agus I dam, and a range of environmental concerns have exacerbated the crisis. Deforestation has speeded up soil erosion and silted up dams. Power stations on Luzon belching pollutants from poor-quality local coal have alienated nearby communities and are said to have reduced agricultural output. The Japanese-funded Calaca project shows how badly things can go wrong. The first 300MW unit was designed to burn local coal shipped from Semirara island but the coal turned out to be of worse quality than expected and had to be mixed with Australian coal. The local coal was also inclined to catch fire spontaneously in the yard, causing further pollution and raising a storm of local opposition to the second 300MW unit. A contractor was chosen three years ago, but the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) has declined to issue the environmental clearance certificate which would allow work to begin. Meanwhile, a 600MW project to be funded by the Asian Development Bank at Masinloc has been stalled - apparently because the mayor has relatives in Calaca - although it has been designed to use higher-quality imported coal. Environmental and administrative delays have also afflicted geothermal energy projects and all the while the existing plant becomes older and more prone to breakdowns. The authorities, although able to use the International Monetary Fund as a scapegoat for electricity price rises, are now learning the hard way that it might be worth facing a mild outcry today in order to avert power cuts and the inevitable anger of the public in the future. But their response to the mounting power crisis has been to adopt expensive, quick-fix solutions, including the purchase of barge-mounted diesel generators. Such increases in generating capacity as there have been in the past five years have come from these mobile barges and from the 200MW gas turbine project implemented by Hopewell of Hong Kong (the turbines were supposed to be used occasionally to top up supplies at times of peak demand, but their continued running is now essential simply to maintain the base load.) In Mindanao, Napocor is hoping for rain and negotiating to start operating the Agus I dam. 'We really have a very, very serious crisis in Mindanao at the moment,' says Mr Pablo Malixi, Napocor's chief executive officer. He admits contritely that the corporation has failed to explain itself properly to local communities affected by power projects. President Corazon Aquino, bowing to public pressure, has ordered a shake-up of Napocor's management and demanded that the DENR issue environmental licences to new power plants. There has also been desultory talk of reviving a 620MW nuclear power station in Bataan, built by Westinghouse of the US but abandoned before it was commissioned by the Aquino government after the overthrow of the late President Ferdinand Marcos. Even if the government launches a decisive energy strategy now, it will take several years before the country sees the results. The current power shortages are profitable for the foreign manufacturers of generators and power barges, but not for the Philippines.</p>

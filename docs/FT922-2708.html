			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / People: Sears goes shopping from Hanson's office Liam Strong, the ambitious new chief executive of Sears who arrived in February, has headhunted Lord Hanson's assistant Stephen Park on to his board as finance director. Park says that 'while this may not be the perfect environment in which to go into retailing . . . I think I will be missing some opportunities if I have not improved Sears' performance within three years'. While Park insists that his decision to accept the Sears offer predated the arrival of Derek Bonham in the new position of Hanson chief executive, the group said yesterday that there will be no new assistant to the chairman as such. Park's duties are being reallocated - most being picked up by Bonham's team. Park, meanwhile, says that 'having been finance director of the Allders division of Hanson for a while I at least know what to expect (of the retailing industry).' A chartered accountant with previous experience at Arthur Andersen and Data General, 39-year-old Park has been at the conglomerate since 1981 - most recently responsible for strategic planning, acquisitions and divestments. The styles of the two operations could hardly be more different - but the gung-ho acquisitive Hanson may be losing some of its lustre, while investors have great hopes that Strong will shake the slumbering retail giant alive. The position of finance director is opened up by John Lovering's move into a newly created position - managing director of corporate development and international operations. Lovering, 42, has been in the finance seat since 1988, but wanted to move into a more 'operational' job. Sears currently has only a tiny presence in continental Europe, and while Strong has been keen to stress that he does not regard European expansion as a panacea for domestic UK problems, he also appears to believe there is a degree of urgency if he is not to miss the boat.</p>

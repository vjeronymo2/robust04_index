			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 24 (XINHUA) -- The United States  House of Representatives today endorsed a motion opposing U.S.  military action against Haiti but supporting a plan to use a  nearby island as a place for screening refugees.    The motion, put forward by Representative Porter Goss and  endorsed by a 223-201 vote, is not binding but expresses  congressional opinion.    The motion opposes U.S. military action against Haiti unless  there is a clear and pressing danger to U.S. interests or  citizens.    But it supports the use of Ile de Gonava, a 35-by-8-mile  island, for screening refugees seeking asylum in the U.S., as  well as for a base of operations for exiled Haitian President  Jean-Bertrand Aristide.    U.S. President Bill Clinton announced on May 8 some changes  in U.S. immigration policy on Haitians.    U.S. officials will no longer send Haitian boat people home  without any asylum screening, but will determine on board ship  or in another country who are bona fide political refugees.    Clinton has also said that he would not rule out a military  option against Haiti.</p>

			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The danger zone looms ENTERPRISE zones seem to be entering the danger zone. No-one who opened a newspaper as Olympia &amp; York's flagship development, Canary Wharf, sank into receivership this spring could fail to be aware that enterprise zone investment has its problems. But enterprise zone trusts (EZT), the syndicated deals which allow buildings to be bought by a group of investors, have been very popular, drawing around Pounds 143m in investors' funds in 1990-91 and Pounds 158m in 1991-92. The most spectacular casualty has been Greig Middleton EZT2, which bought the Mansion building in Docklands. It was sponsored by Greig Middleton, the stockbroker, and managed by Independent Property Securities. No tenant has been found, and rent on the property was guaranteed by Seifert Ltd, the property development arm of the Seifert group of architects which also includes the company responsible for such buildings as the National Westminster Tower. Seifert Ltd went into receivership last week, although R. Seifert &amp; Partners, responsible for designing the well-known London buildings, and Seifert International Ltd, which has projects in Europe, continue to trade as before. A bank guarantee from Sanwa Bank will continue to pay rent to investors until the autumn, and will then run out. At this point, if no tenant is found, there will be no income for the trust's investors. This situation is made all the worse because most funded their investments with loans. This is very tax-efficient, as extra tax relief is available if rental income from an EZT is used to pay off a loan, but means that the loss of income will leave them facing mounting, suddenly tax-inefficient debt. They also have to pay for the upkeep of the building, including rates and insurance. GMEZT2 was put together in a rush to catch the end of the 1990-91 tax year. Greig Middleton's chairman, Mark Kemp-Gee, admits that with hindsight the sponsor's due diligence when putting together the trust was 'not enough'. He adds: 'We feel that we have a great moral duty of care to the investors, coming out of our sponsorship. But it is not as though the building has fallen into the Thames.' GMEZT2 is not the only trust in trouble. Charter Developments is also now finding it hard to finance obligations to enterprise zone trusts. PET15, an EZ trust based in Salford, recognises that Charter cannot be relied on to continue paying rent, and the trustees have asked for extra powers from investors to borrow funds. When a trust runs into trouble, the illiquidity of property investment can make it become a millstone for investors' necks. The trust as a whole can only escape the investment by selling the entire property - not easy at present - while there can be conflicts between different trustholders. There is no market as yet in EZT units. All of this is bad news for EZ investment. But the zones still offer the greatest tax reliefs currently allowed by the government for any form of investment. Relief is available at the investor's top marginal rate, with no maximum limit, making the incentives even greater than for the Business Expansion Scheme for which there is an annual maximum of Pounds 40,000. In return for sweeping tax benefits, it seems fair to shoulder greater risks. But the recent disaster stories must not be repeated. Do EZTs have a future? They do, but it will have to be much less ambitious. Anthony Yadgaroff, of the Allenbridge Group, says many EZT investors have already borrowed heavily to fund previous EZTs, and their total liabilities are now so high that banks will be reluctant to extend much more crdit. Stephen Bantoft, now of Cannock Investments and previously of Allenbridge, who recommended against investment in GMEZT2 at the time it was launched, expects EZTs to continue on a reduced scale. No trusts will be launched in Docklands, he believes, unless they have strong bank guarantees, and come with a 'put' option. Investors would have a legal right to sell the property at a fixed point in the future for a set price. Office blocks, in the current market, are also probably off limits. But industrial property, if it has been pre-let to a financially secure tenant, and carries a bank guarantee, could still prove popular. The EZ sector's ills ultimately stem from the state of the office property market. Once tenants start returning to offices, even the trusts currently in trouble could become good investments. But for now, investors contemplating EZ investment should be ultra-cautious. As several EZT holders now know, there are worse things in life than paying tax.</p>

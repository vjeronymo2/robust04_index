			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Insurers plan rival to direct dealing A group of independent insurance brokers is planning to fight back against the increasing dominance of direct dealers such as Direct Line, by setting up a cost efficient insurance company to take on their direct rivals. The project has been launched by the Institute of Insurance Brokers, which represents about 1,100 members, generally small independent brokers, and will be giving a presentation to launch the new company in September. Mr Andrew Paddick, the IIB's director general, said a leading team of industry specialists had already laid down the blueprint for the company and developed software designs, and it would be in a position to launch by June 1 next year. The project is contingent on getting financial backing from brokers and possibly outside insurance companies to cover the set-up costs of 'several million pounds' and the more substantial underwriting reserves. In addition, it will have to fight concerns over independent insurance brokers selling through a captive company, which could be open to abuse. However, there is no doubt that the brokers are under pressure to stem the tide of losses from one of their staple sources of business. The new insurance company will have a minimal staff and no advertising fees since it will be marketed and sold by the brokers, who will be able to lock directly into the system. Mr Paddick said it would be able to offer premiums which at least matched the direct insurers. The direct insurers will hold the cost advantage of having no brokerage commissions, but this will be partly offset by their higher marketing and sales costs. It will be a challenging fight. Direct Line was formed in 1985 but has already become the UK's largest insurer with 1.6m motor policies.</p>

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Sweeping changes in South African broadcasting: Controversial cut in use of Afrikaans likely to provoke serious backlash The South African Broadcasting Corporation, the state-run body which has a virtual monopoly on radio and television broadcasting in South Africa, yesterday announced plans for sweeping changes to its structure, including a significant reduction in the use of Afrikaans on the airwaves. The decision is controversial and likely to provoke a substantial backlash from a large part of the Afrikaner population. Many of them will take it as proof of their continued marginalisation in South African society since the April elections. It may also prove a potent future election issue for right-wing political parties. Announcing the changes at a Johannesburg press conference yesterday, Mr Zwelakhe Sisulu, the recently-appointed SABC Group chief executive, said that on television English would become the most widely-used language. All main news broadcasts will become evenly divided between English, Afrikaans, the Nguni group of African languages (which include Zulu and Xhosa), and the Sotho group of languages. Under the present system, SABC's main television channel, TV1, splits its broadcasts evenly between English and Afrikaans, while black languages are relegated to the broadcaster's other two channels, CCV and NNTV. Mr Sisulu also said that radio services will be restructured to create 11, full-spectrum public-service stations, one for each of the country's official languages. As a result, there will only be one station that will continue to broadcast exclusively in Afrikaans. Several smaller, regional stations that at present use Afrikaans are likely to close or to be restructured. The proposed downgrading of Afrikaans, rumoured for several months, has been widely condemned by Afrikaans cultural and political groups, who charge it violates another constitutional clause forbidding any 'diminishing of the rights and status of existing languages'. The proposed changes will also almost certainly mean the retrenchment of hundreds of Afrikaans-speaking staffers at SABC and their replacement with blacks capable of running the new African-language programming, a move which will help the corporation attain its stated goal of 50 per cent black staffing by 1998. Mr Daan van der Merwe, arts and culture spokesman for the Conservative party, claimed the move signalled a plan to undermine Afrikaans language and culture. Mr Sisulu said he was aware the decision might prove controversial, but argued that given the strictures of the new constitution, which stipulates 'equal use and enjoyment' of all South Africa's official languages, the new proposals represent the most feasible compromise. Underlying the language issue is the deeper question of whether SABC will be able to transform itself into a genuinely independent public broadcaster in the mould of Britain's BBC, or whether it will become merely a mouthpiece for the current ANC-led government. During the apartheid years, the broadcaster was an effective propaganda instrument wielded by the former government, adroitly manipulating television and radio news to reflect its vision of South Africa. Since the accession to power of former President F W de Klerk in 1989, the organisation has been trying to transform itself into a genuinely representative national broadcaster, with a firm commitment to freedom of expression and freedom of the press, a goal officially supported by the present government. But critics charge that the corporation's new board and management are far too closely aligned to the ANC to be the architects of a reformed, independent institution. Mr Sisulu, whose father, Mr Walter Sisulu, is ANC deputy-president, was a long-time ANC activist and formerly edited the ANC-supporting newspaper New Nation. Other board members, including the chairman, Dr Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri, are known to have ANC sympathies.</p>

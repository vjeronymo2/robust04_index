			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Interest but few takers in multi-media markets There is widespread corporate interest in the multi-media market but not many companies are ready to take advantage of the new business opportunities, says an international survey. Formerly separate sectors such as computers, telecommunications, broadcasting and entertainment are covered by multi-media. More than 500 executives from cable and satellite companies throughout Europe and North America responded to a detailed questionnaire devised by consultants Touche Ross in co-operation with the Financial Times. The survey shows that while 89 per cent were interested in multi-media markets and in offering multi-media services, only 33 per cent were ready to move. In the consumer market the services seen as most likely to be successful within the next three or four years ranged from computer games and video-on-demand to screen-based home shopping. A little further down the consumer market line, screen-based distance learning and home banking were seen as potential growth services. In the business sector, on-line business and financial news, company messaging, interactive travel information and booking and computer-based training were judged the services most likely to succeed in the next four years. Nearly 90 per cent of respondents supported the view that co-ventures and collaboration across several industries would be needed to encourage market development. Mr Rob Woodward, telecommunications and media partner at Touche Ross, warned of multi-media hype at yesterday's FT Cable and Satellite conference and said the pace of market development may have been exaggerated. 'It's not yet a revolution,' he warned. A full report on the survey will be published next month.</p>

			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / UK Company News: W Greenbank bolsters defence WALKER GREENBANK, the commercial wallcoverings group, brought forward the announcement of a near-12 per cent increase in pre-tax profit to help its defence against a challenge from its largest shareholder. Aubin, the Jersey-based holder of 27.4 per cent of the equity, has requisitioned an EGM for April 26 which will consider the appointment of five non-executive direc-tors. Walker has described the move as an attempt 'to take control on the cheap.' Its share price gained another 1p yesterday to close at 70p, giving a market value of Pounds 64m. In the year to February 2 1991, taxable profit rose to Pounds 7.96m (Pounds 7.12m) although an important factor was a switch from Pounds 2.52m interest paid to Pounds 1.07m received. The group's disposal programme helped turn net debt of Pounds 18.4m into Pounds 5.7m cash. Turnover fell to Pounds 75.34m (Pounds 127.27m). Walker's change of tack, which involved the sale of 18 businesses in 18 months for just over Pounds 30m, followed the puncturing of Sir Anthony Jolliffe's efforts to build up a conglomerate. 'Accounting irregularities' were discovered at the Alkar shop-fitting subsidiary in 1988 and the shares shed about 40 per cent of their value. Aubin started buying in mid-1989, when the price range was 100p to 133p. The October crash brought it down to a low of 44p. By the end of the year Aubin, which has admitted that it originally hoped to make an agreed bid, had just over 8 per cent. Aubin wrote to shareholders earlier this week criticising Walker's management for rebuffing potential offerors, selling businesses for questionable prices, having the wrong approach to European distribution and moving 'upstream' into manufacturing. It said the proposed independent non-executive directors would 'provide an effective review of and challenge to management's performance.' Mr Charles Wightman, chief executive of Walker since February last year, said the UK recession had affected sales at the core wallcoverings business, which saw pre-tax profit slip to Pounds 7.41m (Pounds 7.59m). A signs business that had been taken off the market fell back to Pounds 538,000. Head office expenses were more than halved at Pounds 352,000. The sale of loss-making businesses meant that a non-core loss of Pounds 1.21m was replaced by a Pounds 354,000 profit; but the previous year's Pounds 820,000 profit from disposals was not repeated. Losses and provisions relating to sold businesses produced an extraordinary charge of Pounds 899,000. Since the year-end, Walker's cash has been spent on buying Bryant, one of its suppliers, which will cost up to Pounds 9.3m. Mr Wightman said profit from that business would be more than double the interest lost. Earnings per share rose to 5.55p (5.1p). An increased final dividend of 1.9p makes a total of 3.1p (2.75p).</p>

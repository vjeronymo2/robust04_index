			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / International Company News: Guoco plans listing for bank subsidiary Guoco Group plans to list Dao Heng Bank, its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, early next month, company executives confirmed yesterday. Dao Heng is Hong Kong's fourth largest bank in terms of assets and number of branches in Hong Kong. Earlier this year it acquired Overseas Trust Bank (OTB) for an estimated HKDollars 4.5bn (USDollars 58m) and promised a stock market flotation later in the year. Guoco will issue 38.52m shares to the public - equal to 5.87 per cent of the bank's enlarged capital - at a price of HKDollars 21.70 each. In addition, 151.75m shares (23.13 per cent of the bank's capital) will be offered to holders of USDollars 350m worth of convertible preferred stock which was issued to fund the acquisition of OTB. The issue price represents a prospective price/earnings ratio of 14.5 on a fully-diluted basis. Dao Heng's net tangible assets value has been put at HKDollars 8.46 a share. Guoco, which is controlled by the Kwek family of Singapore, will retain a 71 per cent interest in Dao Heng.</p>

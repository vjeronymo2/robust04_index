Upon arrival, he  immediately met his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel to discuss  preparations for the Russian president's visit to Germany  scheduled for this coming spring, as well as a settlement of the  Bosnian conflict.    The Bosnian settlement and relations with the European Union  (EU) are to be in the focus of the upcoming political  consultations between Kozyrev and the so-called EC "Troika"  consisting of the foreign ministers of Belgium, Greece and  Germany -- the former, present and future EC chairs. The Athens  meeting is initiated by Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias.    The programme of Kozyrev's visit also provides for a meeting  with Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, talks on bilateral  Russian- Greek relations and a meeting with the Cyprian foreign  minister.    After visiting Greece, the Russian foreign minister is to  make a tour of East European states entering the so-called  Visegrad group.    The first country to be visited is the Czech Republic where  Kozyrev is expected to continue a diologue on various aspects of  Russia's relations with these countries and to look into the  progress of implementation of the earlier signed agreements.  The sides will also exchange opinions on the current situation  in Europe, specifically on problems of conflict settlements,  above all in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and on a new structure of  European security.    While in Krakow, Poland, Kozyrev is to attend a  Russian-Polish conference on cooperation, "Partnership Under New  Conditions".</p>

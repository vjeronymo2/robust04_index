			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by B. Shokhin, deputy general director of the </F> Moscow Municipal State Industrial Railroad Transport Enterprise,  chief inspector for Traffic Safety: "Without Accident or Injury:  Work at the Moscow Promzheldortrans Enterprise"]    [Text] A year ago, on 30 March, GUDOK published an  appeal from the collective of the Moscow State Promzheldortrans  Enterprise to the railroad workers and to all workers, calling  for transport work to be performed in 1993 without wrecks,  accidents or injuries.    The year passed, and it was revealed that  Promzheldortrans did not take the words as just idle talk:  during the past year and the first quarter of this one, it did  not permit a single wreck nor production injury.    How did they succeed in achieving these results? We  asked B. Shokhin, deputy general director of the Moscow  Municipal State Industrial Railroad Transport Enterprise, chief  inspector for Traffic Safety, to tell us.    Our proposal may have seemed adventurous to some people, but  all our production subdivisions took it very seriously and  responsibly. We have been working toward this goal for several  years, realizing that you can't eliminate defects by waving a  magic wand, you need solid organizational and technological  running time. Therefore we first prepared a bridgehead from  which we could assume the offensive.    For example, we were the first on the railroad network to  introduce a system of accident-free work: "Foresight is a pledge  of safety." Having become familiar with this, the specialists  most likely would not find any innovations for themselves which  would not be known to our colleagues from other enterprises and  roads. It is my firm conviction that this is not required. One  thing is necessary when working with rolling stock: impeccable  adherence to the rules for technical operation and instructions  and orders, for the slightest deviation from them is fraught  with peril -- and commanders of all ranks must establish rigid  monitoring of the entire technological chain.    At selector conferences, when the question of traffic safety  would come up, we most often heard complaints that the rails  were extremely worn (especially on the enterprise track spurs,  where we have to do our main amount of work), that railcars  needing repair are in operation everywhere, and that  loading-unloading mechanisms often get out of order, and indeed,  are often of an obsolete design. All this is true. For some  reason, though, in discussing the problems of safety,  increasingly fewer people have paid attention to the human  factor. When an accident happens, then as a rule, we find out:  It was not the equipment that let us down, but the person  controlling it.    Therefore, having begun to introduce an accident-free  system,  we waged a most decisive battle against those who violated work  discipline. A drunken person is dangerous at any production  facility, but especially at a transport facility: after all, in  this case, he risks not only his own life, but also the lives of  other people. We must remember what tremendous material damage  an accident on the railroad incurs. It is not by chance that  medical monitoring is compulsory for locomotive crews and  yardmasters before they go on for their shift. We decided among  ourselves at the enterprise to make this more severe: we perform  it not only before a team goes to work, but after the shift. A  foreman who conceals a violation of discipline or lets an  engineer (yardmaster) go to work when he is drunk will be fired  from the enterprise, rather than the violator. Even before, we  were forced to apply these strict sanctions. They proved to be  effective -- we have not encountered drunkenness at the work  place for three years now. We were forced to let go the ones who  could not take themselves in hand, but those who were inclined  to go on drinking bouts, but valued their work at our enterprise  had to combat the unhealthy habit for themselves.    Having got rid of our drunks, we are strictly adhering to  our  rules -- not to accept for work people who have been dismissed  from other enterprises for the same reason. Every quarter, I  personally take to the road administration lists of engineers  who have been deprived of the right to drive locomotives for  some specific reason. We send these lists to all the  subdivisions: not a single violator who has been fired from the  railroad will find any sympathy from our staff members. To this  kind of person we state: Before you take on the control of  equipment, you will learn to control yourself.    In introducing the accident-free work system, we certified  all the workers and regularly conduct recertification. This is a  very serious examination for everyone. Let us say, an engineer  and a yardmaster should have an impeccable knowledge not only of  the rules of technical operation and safety, but of all the  special features of the sections which they handle. We handle,  as you know, the enterprises of the capital. The line within the  city limits has an abundance of curves, grades and upgrades. An  engineer who does shunting work should, of course, as they say,  know with his eyes closed where the downgrade or ascending grade  begins and be particularly attentive at sections with small  radius curves. As should, by the way, yardmasters. An engineer  is categorically forbidden to put a locomotive into motion until  he is certain (visually or by radio) where the yardmaster is at  the given moment.    We have also resorted to a number of additional measures.  Considering the present technical condition of the track and the  rolling stock, we have restricted speeds in order to eliminate  damage. For example, when a locomotive approaches a consist, the  norm-set speed should not exceed 5 kilometers an hour, but we  have restricted it to 1.5 kilometers an hour, and when a consist  is fed under a trestle or when it is removed after loading or  unloading, from 15 to 3 kilometers an hour. With movement along  a curve with a radius of less than 120 meters, we have reduced  it from 15 to 5 kilometers a hour.    One often hears today that, with the transition to new  economic relations, the need for monitoring adherence to  discipline and the rules of safety has disappeared. People  interested in the end result of work, on which their wages  depend, will of themselves, without prodding, perform their  duties conscientiously. They will not tolerate being alongside  those who violate discipline or are sloppy workers. It is  possible that when the market economy, moreover a civilized one,  not the one that we have, becomes firmly established, it will be  this way. For the time being, though, monitoring is necessary.    Incidentally, it exists, and much more strictly than in our  country, in the highly developed capitalist states. We also  attribute paramount importance to monitoring functions. All the  divisions, enterprises and sections have been assigned a command  staff. Nor have we given up holding the "Safety and Labor Safety  Practice Days." In preparing for them, we organize surprise  checks, and moreover, on both the day and night shifts. I  emphasize the word, surprise.    It is no secret that we most often have occasion to  encounter  violations on paydays. With the approval of the work  collectives, we issue wages once a month (formerly, as at most  enterprises, we paid them twice a month). On those days we step  up the monitoring at all the subdivisions.    There is one more innovation which we are striving to comply  with without delay. Our production commanders are obliged to  check the working ability of all their subordinates every  one-and-half hours in the course of a work shift. How to get to  the work places, whether to call a subordinate to their offices  by radio or through public safety inspectors -- that is for them  to decide. The main thing is to put in place a covering force to  avert violations of labor safety practices, and thus  sub-standard work or an accident. Incidentally, with a staff of  800 people, over 250 of them are public traffic safety  inspectors.    The introduction of an accident-free work system also made  us  correct the regulations on material incentive. The criteria for  a favorable evaluation of the work of each brigade are the  absence of sub-standard work, injury, outbreak of fire and  damage to rolling stock, and after that, labor productivity and  the profit obtained.    None of what I have said means that the problems of  introducing new equipment, advanced technology and the technical  state of transport developments have, as it were, been pushed  into the background. In this respect we have been lucky, since  the leading transport institutes are located in Moscow, and we  have the opportunity of being the first to test their scientific  developments and put them into operation.    In conclusion, I wish to say that the accident-free work  system that we introduced will prove itself as effective only  when the entire set of measures is applied, from organizational  to technological. The experience that we have accumulated shows  that, even in the present difficult economic situation, one can  work without accidents and injuries, or at least reduce them to  a minimum. We have called upon and still call upon all railroad  workers to do this.</p>

The allocation is also to cover expenditures for the  drafting  of an anti-drug law.    Last year, with a budget of 26 billion VND, the government  brought into operation 95 projects which ranged from  sendentarisation [as received] and resettlement for nomadic hill  tribes to the replacement of opium poppy with food and other  crops. Much was spent on mass education on the danger of drug  and the treatment and vocational training for addicts.    Last year, the law enforcement force cracked down on 904  cases of drug trafficking and eliminated hundreds of drug dens.</p>

			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Management: Time for an action plan - Andrew Baxter stresses the need for successful product introduction THE successful introduction of new products is one of the keys to profitable manufacturing but, for many UK manufacturers, improving the process is still in its infancy. This is one of the findings of an updated edition of Manufacturing into the Late 1990s* - first published in late 1989 - which has been prepared for the Department of Trade and Industry by Tony Roberts and Mark Smalley at PA Consulting Group. The study says recognition of the importance of new product introduction has continued to grow since the first report was produced. The pool of knowledge and experience of best practice in this area is now greater - particularly within leading manufacturers. But Roberts, director of PA's manufacturing sector, says there is still some way to go. 'Product design often takes years for many engineering-type products,' he says. 'Some companies have put relatively more effort into 'quick-buck' initiatives such as changing factory layouts, where you can get benefits in a few months.' The complexity of new product introduction means it is less well understood than other industrial processes. It involves highly-skilled people who are accustomed to working at their own pace. 'Product design is not deterministic,' Roberts says. 'You cannot predict that something will take 100 hours to complete. It could be five hours or five days.' The study has plenty of advice for managers on how to improve their manufacturing responses to the challenges in the 1990s. It identifies four themes. Higher customer expectations. 'Customer power continues to grow and to compete effectively you must satisfy existing and new customers profitably.' Greater business complexity - multi-technologies in the product and the manufacturing process, a wider product range, customisation and market niches. More uncertainty, stemming from a wider range of customers, shorter product life cycles and more competition. This means greater uncertainty about the life of products and investment decisions associated with them. Growing competitive and legislative pressure. 'Legislation such as that concerned with product liability, health and safety and the environment will place additional strains on the business.' The task for manufacturers, says the study, is to 'distil, from all the external drivers, a competitive strategy based on opportunities, clear responses to threats and then use your manufacturing capability as a competitive weapon'. This is why successful new product introduction is seen as so important. According to the study key ways to achieve this include getting designers close to customers; using multi-discipline teams with clear objectives about delivering the product on time; having the design effort managed by a product director with clear authority to deliver. But there are other important ingredients to the manufacturing response. While many companies feel they have greatly improved factory operations over the past decade, for many others there is still plenty of scope to reshape the factory to better serve the needs of the business. Among the key factors contributing to better factories, the study mentions selecting flexible, low-inertia processes, ideally suited to the manufacture of core items and creating flexible factories, with focused units that can handle mix variations and be reconfigured to cater for short product life cycles. While some companies have to try harder, Roberts is encouraged by what has been happening in manufacturing since the first report. 'There is a much greater awareness of the need for a strategy - something that makes sense of all the elements of design and manufacture to produce a competitive and profitable business,' he says. *Manufacturing into the Late 1990s.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Qingyuan, June 20 (CNS) -- The worst damage was  caused by an extraordinarily serious flood in Qingyuan, a city  in Guangdong Province, in the last 100 years. Initial  statistics showed that at least 87 persons died because of  floods and the direct economic loss was over RMB 1.3 billion  [renminbi] as of today.    Nearly half of the population of 3.5 million were affected  by  the natural disaster. An official report said that most of the  death toll might be registered in Qingyuan's Liannan County, in  which at least 42 persons died and 22 were missing. Most of the  dead were young persons who were either drowned or swept away by  floods. There were at least 110,000 homes destroyed and 16,000  houses collapsed. The homeless across the city was put at over  10,000 persons, and there were up to 6,000 persons homeless in  Fogang County alone in northern part of the city.    About 80,000 hectares of crops were flooded across Qingyuan  and large pieces of paddy-fields coming near to a harvest were  destroyed. One third of 150,000 mu of paddy-fields in Qingxin  County was flooded, according to a local official.    Quite a lot of trunk roads which were put at 459 and at  least  two bridges were damaged by violent floods. A 16-kilometre  section of a provincial grade road was flooded while 6-kilometre  long part of road was seriously destroyed which caused a damage  of over RMB 40 million [renminbi]. Traffic across the city was  paralyzed. As there were many areas across the city with  breakdown of traffic and communications, it is estimated that  the death toll and damage would climb up.    In Wuzhou of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the flood  peak topped the water level of 25.91 metres, exceeding the  warning level by 10.91 metres. The flowing rate was put at  46,200 cubic metres per second, registering the greatest flood  since 1949. Wuzhou and its suburban areas were flooded to a  certain extent. Most of the outbound traffic and communications  broke down. It is in a critical state in the Pearl River Delta  area in which flood control is in great urgency.    In Hunan Province, Hengyang, Xiangtan and Changsha cities  underwent the highest flood peak the day before yesterday since  1949. Eight cities along the Yangtze River covering 128 towns  were flooded.    The State Council sent working teams from the Ministry of  Water Resources, the Ministry of Construction and the Ministry  of Civil Affairs to rush to Guangxi and Guangdong to help fight  floods.</p>

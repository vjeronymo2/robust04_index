			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Germany near car recycling GERMAN Environment Minister Klaus Topfer yesterday presented a draft regulation which would make it compulsory for car makers to take back their old cars when they are ready for the scrap heap, Reuter reports from Bonn. Under the draft, German motorists would be entitled to return their old cars and lorries free of charge to their dealer for disposal or recycling. The ministry said the regulation, which must still be approved by the cabinet, would apply to German as well as foreign manufacturers selling vehicles in Germany. About 2.6m cars are scrapped annually there, most ending up in crushing plants.</p>

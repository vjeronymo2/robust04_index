			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Urban challenge BUSINESSES, LOCAL authorities and voluntary organisations wanting access to UK government money for economic regeneration face a bewildering variety of programmes. Several government departments have cash to spend, each with their own priorities, and each jealously guarding their prerogatives. The creation of a single regeneration budget for England, announced yesterday by Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, is therefore a welcome step. The move will bring together 20 programmes from five government departments to create a fund worth Pounds 1.4bn for economic regeneration. A new cabinet sub-committee will control the budget and set overall priorities for its use. To avoid confusing lines of accountability, Mr Gummer will be accountable for all five departments' share of the budget - an unusual and sensible innovation. Bringing together these programmes will also make it easier to integrate regeneration projects. Restoring a run-down housing estate can currently mean applying to the environment department for Estate Action money, to the Home Office for Safer Cities funding and the employment department for business start-ups. In future, a single bid will suffice. Equally welcome is the accompanying reorganisation of the local offices of the Whitehall departments involved. Ten government regional offices will be created, each headed by a senior civil servant. These regional directors will provide a single point of access for those wanting a share of the unified regeneration budget, and will monitor progress locally. The third leg of yesterday's announcement is City Pride, an invitation to city leaders to create a vision of where they want their cities to be in 10 years. Ministers have been impressed by the way that Manchester's Olympic bid succeeded in creating new alliances between business, community groups and the local authorities to improve the city. Creating similar alliances in other cities will help in drawing up local priorities and in formulating bids for the regeneration budget. Ministers have heralded yesterday's package as a small constitutional revolution, delegating responsibility for spending the economic regeneration programme from Whitehall to the regions. That may be over-egging the pudding: it will still be central government that holds the purse strings. And it is unlikely that departments will be able to resist introducing new programmes in the future to deal with specific problems. Ministers may also find new initiatives and new programmes irresistible, especially around party conference time. Yet the new structure announced yesterday is an improvement on the old multiplicity of programmes. It will bring a new coherence to government spending on regeneration and further encourage the partnerships which are central to success in local economic development.</p>

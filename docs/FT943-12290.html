			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Happy contrast - but objective? Sir, According to Ian Davidson ('Too late to kiss it better', July 30), the government is in 'craven submission' to the Eurosceptics, whose attitude is of 'ill-tempered obstructionism' reliant on the 'atavistic rhetoric' of 'xenophobic nationalism'. This has led to the 'incomprehensible' squandering of our credit by 'single-handedly precipitating a gratuitous and futile crisis' over the presidency of the Commission. By happy contrast, there is the 'gathering momentum' of the 'logic' of a 'new phase' of building Europe, 'irresistibly led' by Germany and embraced by Mr Tony Blair with 'rational serenity'. Could it be possible that Mr Davidson has mislaid his objectivity somewhere? Rodney Leach, 15 Clarendon Road, London W11 4JB</p>

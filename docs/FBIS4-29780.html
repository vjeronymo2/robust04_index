			<p>BFN     [Text] A senior official at the Ministry of International  Trade and Industry [MITI] revealed on 17 June that Japan and the  United States have agreed to hold subcabinet-level negotiations  between Deputy MITI Vice Minister Sozaburo Okamatsu and  Undersecretary of Commerce Jeffrey Garten in late June to  discuss the auto and auto parts issue under the Japan-U.S.  economic framework talks. A place for the talks has not been  decided.    Based on the results of working-level talks to be held in  Washington on 23 and 24 June, they will hold final consultations  in an effort to reach an agreement before the Naples summit  (meeting of leaders of the seven industrialized nations)  beginning 8 July.    Commenting on negotiations on the government procurement  sector, for which the deadline for sanctions is set for the end  of June, the official also disclosed that coordination is now in  progress on the schedule for talks between Foreign Minister Koji  Kakizawa and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor following  the vice-ministerial talks to be held on 22 and 23 June.</p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Romanian government crisis The Democratic Agrarian party, which has a pivotal position in Romania's hung parliament, said yesterday it was withdrawing its support for the ruling Party of Social Democracy and that it intended to lodge a no-confidence motion in the left-wing minority government. The PSD government has relied on the DAP and three small neo-communist and nationalist parties to reach a 53 per cent majority in parliament since narrowly winning elections in September 1992. None of the four parties has lodged a no-confidence vote in the government to date. The DAP, a small centre-left party supported by farmers, said it was bringing the motion on grounds that the government's economic and social policies had failed and that, in particular, it had done little to solve the problems facing the agriculture and food sectors. Romania's centre-right opposition parties, which control 47 per cent of parliament, have also said they will lodge a no-confidence motion in the 20-month-old government this week. The DAP said yesterday it would co-operate with any party sharing the same criticisms of the government.</p>

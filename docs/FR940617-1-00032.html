			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of September 7, 1982 (47 FR 39406), FDA issued a notice to reopen the administrative record for OTC topical antimicrobial drug products to allow for consideration of the Miscellaneous External Panel's recommendations on topical antimicrobial drug products used for the treatment of diaper rash. The agency discussed topical antimicrobial active ingredients for this use in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of June 20, 1990 (55 FR 25246).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with &sect;330.10(a)(10), the data and information considered by the Panels were put on public display in the Dockets Management Branch (address above), after deletion of a small amount of trade secret information. In response to the previous tentative final monograph and the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for mercury-containing drug products and the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for alcohol drug products, 4 drug manufacturers' associations, 44 drug manufacturers, 1 medical device manufacturer, 1 drug distributor, 2 medical schools, 2 research laboratories, 1 law firm, and 1 consulting firm submitted comments. Copies of the comments received are also on public display in the Dockets Management Branch.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The advance notice of proposed rulemaking, which was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of September 13, 1974 (39 FR 33103), was designated as a ``proposed monograph'' in order to conform to terminology used in the OTC drug review regulations (&sect;330.10). Similarly, the notice of proposed rulemaking, which was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of January 6, 1978 (43 FR 1210), was designated as a ``tentative final monograph.'' The present document is also designated as a ``tentative final monograph.'' The legal status of each tentative final monograph, however, is that of a proposed rule. The present document is a reproposal regarding health-care antiseptic drug products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This antimicrobial rulemaking is broad in scope, encompassing products that may contain the same active ingredients, but are labeled and marketed for different intended uses. For example, one group of products is primarily used by consumers for ``first aid'' and includes skin antiseptics, skin wound cleansers, and skin wound protectants. Another group of products, antiseptic handwashes, are used by consumers on a more frequent, even daily, basis and includes products for personal use in the home, such as when caring for invalids and during family illness. A third group of products is generally intended for use by health professionals and includes health-care personnel handwashes, patient preoperative skin preparations, and surgical hand scrubs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to expedite the completion of the first aid section of the antimicrobial monograph, the agency published a separate tentative final monograph for these products in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of July 22, 1991 (56 FR 33644). The non-first aid uses of topical antimicrobials, now identified as ``health-care antiseptics,'' are addressed in this document. Although the amended tentative final monographs for first-aid antiseptics and health-care antiseptics are being published separately, both categories will eventually be included under part 333 (21 CFR part 333).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

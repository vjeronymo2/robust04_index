The pattern of electors that emerged from the survey by CNEL  [National Council for Economy and Labor], Unioncamere, and the  Tagliacarne Institute was likened to "a harlequin's suit" by  CNEL's Chairman, Giuseppe De Rita, presenting the results  yesterday.    The survey looked at criteria such as age, employment  levels,  and the number of businesses in order to gain an overall  impression of the economic and social make-up of each of the 707  constituencies.    For the Lower House ballot, which will assign 475 of 630  seats, the survey found that 12 per cent of the population live  in areas of "weak" economic power; 40 per cent live in areas of  "semi-weak" economic power; 33 percent in "semi-strong" areas;  15 per cent in "strong" areas.    Instead of reinforcing the traditional divide between North  and South Italy, the results exposed numerous "marked  differences found in the constituencies within each region."    The first three positions of the strongest socio-economic  category are occupied by constituencies in Lombardy, but eight  other Lombard areas are to be found in the "semi-weak" category.  Alongside Lombardy in the top five is Emilia-Romagna.    Although the lower economic categories are still occupied  almost totally by the Southern regions of Campania and Sicily,  three constituencies in Campania have a "semi-strong" economic  strength, the study showed.    The poorest zone of all Italy is that north of Aversa, in  Campania.    De Rita, commenting on the findings, stressed that their  importance must not be over-exaggerated. Despite declaring  himself to be "an old proportionalist," he said that the  first-past-the-post system, voted for by 85 percent of Italians  in last April's referendum, "will enable a new political class  at a general as well as at a local level" to come into being.</p>

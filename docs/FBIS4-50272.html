			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Morning News" program] </F>   [Text] Wu Bangguo, member of the CPC Central Committee  Political Bureau and secretary of the Shanghai Municipal CPC  Committee, met with a Ho Chi Minh City party and government  delegation led by Vo Tran Chi, member of the Political Bureau of  CPV Central Committee and secretary of Ho Chi Minh City Party  Committee, at Xijiao guesthouse on the afternoon of 14 May.  During the meeting, Wu Bangguo briefed the Vietnamese visitors  on Shanghai's development.    Wu Bangguo said: Shanghai adheres to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics,  persistently carries out reforms, and opens itself wider to the  outside world. In recent years, its economic development has  been better than anticipated.    Wu Bangguo pointed out: On the road of advance, Shanghai  persistently takes economic construction as its central task;  builds both material and spiritual civilizations, and attaches  equal importance to both; and assumes an overall point of view  in handling the relationship between development and stability.    He said: Shanghai keeps to a socialist orientation and  places emphasis on two things: One is to maintain the  predominance of public ownership. The other is to maintain the  predominance of the system of distribution according to work and  taking the road of common prosperity.    Wu Bangguo said: Shanghai is eager to promote cooperation  between the two cities. The two cities are mutually  complementary to a great extent in economic development.  Shanghai is willing to strengthen its cooperation and exchanges  with Ho Chi Minh City in the economic, trade, and scientific and  technological fields.    Vo Tran Chi expressed his admiration for Shanghai's  development. He hoped that the two cities would develop their  cooperation and exchanges rapidly.</p>

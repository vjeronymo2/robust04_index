			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh AKP April 8 -- Four sets of anti-tank  missile were seized in Siem Reap Province on April 5. Police  said the four missiles known as "Bruss" were found in a boot of  a taxi driving from Banteay Meanchey to Siem Reap. One man on  board, suspected to be an owner of the missiles, was arrested  when the police found the missiles at their checkpoint.    The taxi driver Yoeun Yang, 43, said the arrested man had  ordered him to pick up a well-wrapped package, in which the  missiles were found, at a place in Banteay Meanchey Province.    Besides the arrested man, there were one woman and two  children on board.    Police said the four missiles were expected to be used for  destroying tanks of the Regional Military Unit 4 stationed in  Siem Reap Town.    Chea Sophat, the two-star police general, said he believed  that the missiles, if not found, would have been used for not  only destroying tanks but also for other purposes.</p>

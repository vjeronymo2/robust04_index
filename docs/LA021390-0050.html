			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY PEOPLE  </P> <P>  Bishop Inc., a struggling Agoura Hills producer of engineering and design  equipment, has hired John J. Theiss as its new president and chief executive.  He succeeds Kenneth J. Kay, who resigned to work elsewhere but who remains a  director of Bishop. Richard M. Drysdale remains Bishop's chairman.  </P> <P> Theiss, 53, most recently was chief executive of Cardkey Systems, a Simi Valley  producer of card-controlled security systems, such as those used to lock hotel  rooms. He earlier spent 16 years at Xerox Corp. as a manager in its engineering  products group.  </P> <P> Bishop, formerly called Bishop Graphics, has posted major losses in recent  years, largely because it failed to keep pace with the computerization of its  industry. Bishop chiefly supplies engineers and drafting professionals with  equipment to design electronic circuit boards, and much of the work is now done  with computerized workstations.  </P> <P> In its fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, Bishop lost $355,000 on revenue of  $10.2 million, and it lost $2.5 million the previous year.  </P> <P> However, Theiss said Bishop has stepped up its own sales of computerized  workstations through its InterCad unit, and that its cost-cutting steps have  made Bishop profitable since Sept. 30. In the quarter that ended Dec. 31,  Bishop reported pretax earnings of $38,000, compared with a pretax loss of  $35,000 a year earlier. A $211,000 tax gain a year ago gave Bishop net income  of $176,000.  </P> <P> Theiss said he wants to expand Bishop's role in the workstation marketplace,  while protecting Bishop's share of the market for more manual  engineering-design supplies.  </P> <P> * UniHealth America, a Burbank-based nonprofit organization that owns and  operates medical centers, health maintenance organizations and other  health-care programs and services, said it named Darrel C. Neuenschwander vice  president of financial operations for its nine medical centers. Neuenschwander  most recently was senior vice president and chief financial officer at Summit  Health Ltd.  </P> <P> * HemaCare Corp., the Sherman Oaks blood products and services company, said it  appointed George H. Fekas as vice president, sales and marketing. Fekas was  previously administrator of the West Tennessee Regional Blood Center in  Jackson, Tenn.  </P></p>

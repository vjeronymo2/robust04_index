			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Survey of Egypt (7): A new hand at the pump - Confidence is rising in the oilfields FOR EGYPT'S oil and gas sector it has been a year of upheaval, but things appear to be settling down following the abrupt replacement last May of the long-serving oil minister, the volatile Dr Abdel Hadi Qandil, by Mr Hamdi el-Banbi, a low-key technocrat. The new minister of Petroleum and Mineral Wealth has quietly put his stamp on his ministry with a reshuffle of senior positions and a new pricing policy for crude oil exports. The new formula, which applied from October 1, sets the price of Egypt's benchmark Suez Blend crude at 60 per cent Brent minus Dollars 3.00, 20 per cent Iran Heavy minus Dollars 0.55 and 20 per cent Suez Blend spot. Mr Tarek Heggy, head of Shell in Egypt, was speaking for the industry when he observed that 'in the old days, Egyptian pricing was a dollar out on a daily basis, now its barely a dime'. Apart from bringing greater order to the daily marketing of Egyptian crude, and thus lessening friction with foreign companies, the new formula is also designed to appeal to purchasers seeking long-term contracts. Mr Banbi's initiation in his early days as minister has not been without pain, however. British Petroleum's decision to sell its 16.67 per cent stake in the Suez Oil Company (SUCO) to Repsol of Spain and to scale down its activities in Egypt was hardly a vote of confidence. But BP executives say the decision was less a reflection of the difficulties of doing business in Egypt than of the company's worldwide rationalisation to enable it to concentrate on new and perhaps more promising exploration zones. Mr Banbi, at a meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Cairo late last year, sought to place the best gloss on the BP decision, noting that big players such as Shell had come and gone in Egypt without serious effect. The new minister also foreshadowed a renewed drive to increase areas under exploration for both oil and gas after a hiatus period in the past year or so, due in part to personnel changes in the petroleum ministry and in the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC). Fourteen exploration agreements were currently being processed, and there would be at least two bid rounds for new acreage this year. 'Our goal is not only to maintain our reserve base of 6bn barrels equivalent, but also to exert all efforts to increase it,' Mr Banbi said. To this end, Egypt has, since the mid-1980s, been encouraging oil companies to explore for gas. The introduction of a new gas clause has spurred efforts in that direction. Egypt's present gas reserve totals 12 trillion cubic feet (TCF). The target is 27 TCF to meet anticipated demand for the next 20 years. Dr Banbi, in his American Chamber address, described this as a 'real challenge to all involved.' He added that if companies discovered larger quantities of gas than could be absorbed by the growing domestic market, as Egypt seeks to convert as much as possible of its power sector and larger processing industries to gas use, surpluses could be exported. Shell has been particularly active in gas exploration and development. Its main production comes from its Badr al-Din deposits in the Western Desert where reserves total about 2TCF. The gas is delivered via a 270-km pipeline to al-Amiriya near Alexandria. Shell has also been among the leaders in investment in oil exploration with drilling programmes from the Gulf of Suez to the Western desert: it has made modest finds in both, including gas in the latter. It is also exploring offshore in the Mediterranean. British Gas is another foreign participant which is relatively bullish about its investments in Egypt. The company, in partnership with Yukong of South Korea and Union Pacific Petroleum Suez of the US, is committed to commercial production from its Gulf of Suez North Zafarana concession. Reserves in the British Gas concession - the first sizeable find in the Gulf of Suez for several years - are put at between 50-100m barrels, somewhat less than indicated by initial exploration. Among other noteworthy developments in the past year or so was Repsol's strong entry to the Egyptian scene. In 1990, it bought Conoco's Western Desert interests, and followed that up in 1991 with its SUCO purchase. Repsol's aggressive strategy in Egypt appears aimed at securing a reliable Mediterranean source of crude oil. Mr Banbi's elevation to minister (he was previously chairman of EGPC) was accompanied by the good news that Egypt's oil export earnings jumped by 70 per cent to Dollars 2.54bn in the year to June, due largely to the Gulf crisis.</p>

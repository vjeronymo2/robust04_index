			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / NZ acts to relax monetary policy THE NEW Zealand Reserve Bank yesterday announced it was relaxing its monetary policy after actively intervening earlier this month to support the New Zealand dollar in defence of its anti-inflation targets. The bank's governor, Dr Don Brash, said he was satisfied at 'the continued consolidation' of the New Zealand exchange rate at current levels. Yesterday, the dollar was trading at 53.8 NZ cents against a trade-weighted index of main currencies, having traded at 53.5-53.8 recently. When the bank intervened earlier this month it had fallen to 52.4. The bank has been given total independence by act of parliament from the Finance Ministry in the way it handles monetary policy with the single objective of achieving 0-2 per cent inflation. The bank acted when it believed the drop in the value of the dollar endangered its inflation goal. Yesterday the bank announced it was cutting the discount margin at which it will buy eligible Reserve Bank bills from 150 to 120 basis points. It said it was increasing the settlement cash target from NZDollars 10m (Pounds 3.3m) to NZDollars 15m. This is the first movement in the discount margin since the cental bank first intervened. It is the third time the bank has acted to increase the settlement cash target. Earlier this month, this was slashed from NZDollars 20m to zero and, as the reserve bank said stability was returning to the market, it was progressively lifted, first to NZDollars 5m, then to NZDollars 10. Interest rates have gradually declined following a leap after the bank intervened. On Friday, cash rates were quoted at 11 per cent, ahead of a long holiday weekend, and at 8.45 per cent yesterday. Thirty-day bank bills (9.55 per cent on Friday), were 8.35 per cent yesterday; 90-day bank bills, (8.45 per cent last week), were quoted at 7.85 per cent yesterday.</p>

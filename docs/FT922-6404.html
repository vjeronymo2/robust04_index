			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Opec to roll over accord on oil output THE Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) yesterday agreed to 'roll over' its second-quarter oil output ceiling of 22.98m barrels a day for the third quarter, but allowing an increase of at least 300,000 b/d in Kuwaiti production. Only 10 of the 13 members fully endorsed the roll-over, with Iran and Saudi Arabia maintaining reservations they expressed to the previous ceiling in February. Iraq rejected the agreement, saying it should refer to the need to prepare for Baghdad's re-entry into the oil market. However, Mr Osama al-Hitti, Iraq's oil minister, gave no indication that Baghdad was any nearer breaking a deadlock in talks with the United Nations over the sale of a limited amount of crude in exception to the UN embargo. Iran's reservations derive from its view that the February ceiling is too high to attain Opec's reference price - its notional target price - of Dollars 21 a barrel, while the Saudis insist they will produce no less than 8m b/d, rather than 7.88m b/d allocated for the second quarter and officials said the kingdom would 'keep its options open' about a possible rise in production during the third quarter. Mr Gholamreza Aghazadeh, Iran's oil minister, nevertheless said he was happy with yesterday's accord. Accelerating Kuwaiti output, now over 900,000 b/d, and Saudi production at 8.06m b/d has helped push actual Opec output to nearer 23.5m b/d, despite the February agreement. Oil analysts estimate that yesterday's deal could see Opec pumping near 24m b/d by the end of the third quarter - a figure corresponding to lower estimates of demand for Opec oil over the period. Kuwait is expected to pump an average 1.2m b/d in the third quarter, but Dr Subroto, Opec secretary general, said its output could rise to 1.5m b/d by the quarter's end.</p>

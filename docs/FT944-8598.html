			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Faster economic growth fuels rates concern The UK economy grew at its fastest annual rate for six years in the third quarter, indicating that the recovery is far stronger than the Treasury or City had predicted. But the pace of growth revived fears that Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, might push for a further increase in interest rates before the end of the year. The Central Statistical Office said yesterday that gross domestic product grew at a seasonally adjusted 0.9 per cent between the second and third quarters, up from its earlier estimate of 0.7 per cent. Since figures for earlier quarters were also revised upwards, the result was that third-quarter GDP was 4.2 per cent higher than in the same period a year ago. The last time the economy grew at such a pace was in the fourth quarter of 1988. Even if the economy fails to grow at all in the fourth quarter, GDP for the calendar year 1994 will be 3.7 per cent higher than in 1993. At the start of the year, the Treasury forecast and the City consensus was for an increase of just 2.5 per cent. Most estimates are that the long-term growth rate of the UK economy is between 2 per cent and 2.5 per cent. This year's rapid growth means that the so-called output gap - the difference between actual and potential output - is narrowing fast. Economic theory suggests that inflation will accelerate sharply once the output gap disappears. September's increase in interest rates from 5.25 per cent to 5.75 per cent was partly spurred by evidence of faster-than-expected economic growth. While economic statistics published earlier this week, notably on inflation and retail sales, had appeared to rule out an imminent rate rise, yesterday's GDP figures might persuade the governor that quick action is needed to slow the pace of growth. The GDP figures also weakened hopes for an investment-led recovery, in which the consumer took a back seat. Investment actually fell in the third quarter, while consumers' expenditure was responsible for about a third of the GDP increase. Nevertheless, other figures published yesterday painted a mixed picture of consumer confidence. Although consumer credit rose in October, mortgage lending faltered following the interest rate rise in September. The Building Societies Association said net advances, which take into account loan repayments, fell significantly to Pounds 788m in October, down from Pounds 1.14bn in September. This was the lowest level since February. The broad measure of the money supply, M4, was also sluggish. The Bank of England said yesterday that M4 had grown by 3.8 per cent in the year to October, the slowest rate for a year.

			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> IN WOODLAND HILLS, PRESERVATIONIST SPIRIT IS SHINING THROUGH  </P> <P> The organizational meeting of the Woodland Hills Preservation Society on Monday  was illuminating.  </P> <P> First there was the unusually captive audience -- those attending were chained  together around a lamppost at the corner of Topanga Canyon Boulevard and Dumetz  Road.  </P> <P> And there was the unusually quick approval of the agenda -- less than an hour  after the meeting ended, Los Angeles city officials were hurriedly promising to  pay close attention to the new group's first recommendation.  </P> <P> The fledgling society's suggestion is simple: The city should drop its plan to  replace two dozen old-fashioned street lamps along a 16-block section of  Topanga in Woodland Hills.  </P> <P> City officials announced Friday that the 63-year-old globe-topped poles will be  replaced starting in mid-August with 74 modern street-light fixtures. The  $138,500 project is to boost the amount of light on the busy boulevard while  reducing maintenance costs and electricity safety hazards, officials said.  </P> <P> But some Woodland Hills residents took a dim view of the announcement.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Quaint Town'  </P> <P> "They look old and we like it," said homeowner Joe Molina. "For God's sake,  this is not Century City or a new development like West Hills. Those lights add  to the neighborhood and the sense of a quaint town.  </P> <P> "Taking these lights out of the neighborhood would be like taking the frame off  a painting."  </P> <P> The fixtures were installed between 1923 and 1926 by Victor Giraud, the  original subdivider of Woodland Hills. They have been retrofitted to use the  same efficient and bright high-pressure sodium bulbs that newer poles use, said  another resident, John Shugrue.  </P> <P> "I just came back from my mother's house in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, where they  have gone out and installed light poles like these all over," Shugrue said.  "There's a town that's trying to preserve and serve, not tear everything down."  </P> <P> Resident Bill Brady hastily gathered a few others at the corner Monday  afternoon to demonstrate their concern. They wrapped themselves in a 10-foot  chain and locked it to one of the threatened old poles, pledging that the  tactic would be used if city crews showed up to rip down the lights.  </P> <P> "This is the first meeting of the Woodland Hills Preservation Society," Brady  proclaimed. He predicted that the community's few remaining original street  lamps are likely to be quickly yanked once those on Topanga disappear. They  include four on Dumetz, 21 on Commercio Avenue and 14 on Ventura Boulevard.  </P> <P> As the group unchained itself, passer-by Rhonda Walance hurried over. "Where do  I sign the petition? I love these old lights," she said to Shugrue. "I'm tired  of new places like Warner Center, where things are getting out of control."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Can Be Repaired  </P> <P> City officials, who became aware of the objections Monday, quickly vowed to  forget about the new lights if there is heavy community support for the old  ones. They said cracks, which have made the 5,000-volt systems potentially  dangerous, can be repaired in some poles.  </P> <P> "If people want to object, now's the time," said Glenn Barr, a spokesman for  City Councilman Marvin Braude, who represents the area. Barr said that the new  lights seem like a good idea but that "if there's enough opposition, we'll  listen."  </P> <P> George Teal, associate city street-lighting engineer, said it's not too late  for residents to save their lights.  </P> <P> "It will be the end of it if the council office doesn't approve of the  project," Teal said. "If there is sufficient adverse reaction, we wouldn't  proceed."  </P></p>

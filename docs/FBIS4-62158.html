			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Artyushin] </F>   [Text] Bryansk May 13 TASS -- "Russia cannot be made a  training ground for the American Army," Russian Federation  Security and Defence Committee Chairman Pyotr Shirshov said in  an interview with ITAR-TASS.    Commenting on forthcoming joint Russian-American exercises  to  be organized on the Totsk training ground in the Orenburg  region, Shirshov said that for organizing such an arrangement at  first a legal procedure must be devised. "We do not have any  laws, in compliance with which foreign troops could be invited  to Russia," deputy to the Federal Assembly from Bryansk said.    Regarding the possiblity of Russia's participation in NATO's  "Partnership for Peace" programme, Pyotr Shirshov called it a  "danger for Russia". In his opinion, by participating in this  programme Russia does not gain anything from the point of view  of any access to NATO strategies and workings, and  simultaneously, the Russian Army "becomes transparent to the  North Atlantic bloc."</p>

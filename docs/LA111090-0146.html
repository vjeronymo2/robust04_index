			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Newspaper Unions Reiterate Offer: Striking workers at the New York Daily News,  trying to depict themselves as flexible, reiterated that they are ready to take  the same pay cuts that their colleagues did at the New York Post two months  ago.  </P> <P> In September, unions at the Post took pay cuts of up to 20% to keep the paper  open. Union President George McDonald made the statement after News Publisher  James Hoge said union negotiators had offered only small concessions. News  spokeswoman Lisa Robinson said McDonald "should learn that the place for  negotiations is at the bargaining table, not at a news conference."  </P></p>

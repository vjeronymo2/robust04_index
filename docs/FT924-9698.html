			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Simpsons suspended on bid SHARES IN Simpsons of Cornhill, owners of the famous City chop house, were suspended yesterday after the board received a takeover bid for the Nottingham-based restaurants group. Mr Paul Reece, managing director, said he had requested a 48-hour suspension following an approach from a UK venture company. Promising to disclose the identity of the bidder before the end of the week, Mr Reece said there was considerable corporate interest in the group which comprises Simpsons of Cornhill and the Jamaica Inn in the City and the Dell'Ugo and Palio bistros in London's west end. The bidder is not connected to the group of dissident shareholders currently seeking the overthrow of the current board, he added. The rebel group, led by Mr Robert Klapp, former chairman of Select Appointments, confirmed they had not been approached by bidders seeking to buy their shares - estimated at 29 per cent of the total. The bitter struggle for control of the company centred on allegations that the board had abandoned its strategy of developing a chain of themed chop house restaurants. The rebels claimed the company had been made more vulnerable to outside bids by the acquisition and costly refurbishment of restaurants such as Dell'Ugo in Soho. Mr Reece, however, claimed the company was healthy and set for further expansion following its small pre-tax profit of Pounds 80,000 for the last full year.</p>

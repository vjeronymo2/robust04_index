			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Cyclical shares likely to suffer most - New York The prospect of a summer rally on Wall Street now seems as remote as an August snowstorm. On Friday, investors were confronted with the last big hurdle standing in the way of a sustained upturn, and the obstacle proved insurmountable. The pundits were again tripped up by economic fundamentals, as the July increase of 259,000 in non-farm payrolls was well above the consensus forecast of 200,000. The immediate result was an 18-point downturn in the bellwether Dow Jones Industrial index, following a 26-point decline the previous session, when the market sensed bad news was on the way. The data were unsettling because they provided convincing evidence that the economy is still rolling along at an unmanageable pace, even though the Federal Reserve has lifted interest rates four times since February. A fifth move to tighter money now seems likely before the August 16 policy-making session. It might come this week. An unnamed official at the central bank, quoted by the Market News Service, appeared to confirm the pessimistic view. Employers 'are running out of people to hire', the source commented, alluding to incipient wage pressures. With investors playing the waiting game once again, stocks are likely to retrace the gains posted early last week, before sentiment turns full circle for the second time in a fortnight. The latest readings on consumer and producer price inflation, scheduled for Thursday and Friday, could exacerbate the tension, especially if the bond market pushes long-term yields to worrisome levels. Cyclical stocks, especially those in the motor vehicle and heavy equipment sectors, could suffer the most, with the prospect of tighter credit conditions looming large. 'Share prices in those groups tend to anticipate events,' points out Mr James Solloway, an investment strategist at Argus Research in New York. 'They tend to correlate very closely with trends in interest rates.' The Big Three carmakers were under pressure even before the release of the employment data, as investors reacted to news of weak July sales of US-made motor vehicles. But raw material suppliers should continue to benefit from a bubbling economy. Last week, paper and steel companies outperformed the market on news that manufacturers were willing to pay higher prices for the products. There are a few more rays of sunshine which suggest a mild reaction to any rate increase. Last week saw a resurgence in takeover activity in the pharmaceuticals, media, technology and insurance sectors. Corporate insiders, meanwhile, continue to snap up shares in companies they manage.</p>

			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Swiss to appeal over Iranians Switzerland will appeal to France's top administrative tribunal in a bid to prove that Paris violated international law by refusing to extradite two Iranians accused of murdering a leading opposition figure. The Swiss justice minister said France broke European extradition treaties when it returned the two suspects, Sharif Esfahani and Ahmad Taheri, to Iran in December, rather than handing them over to Swiss authorities.</p>

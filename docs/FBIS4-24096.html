			<p>BFN     [Text] The Federal Government says no amount of pressure,  internal threat, or external intimidation will force it to take  measures that are likely to create anarchy in the country. The  secretary to the government of the federation, Alhaji Aminu  Saleh, stated this in Abuja last night at a reception for media  executives. He said government was determined to put in place a  genuine democratic government as soon as possible.    Alhaji Aminu advised some foreign powers against sponsoring  terrorism and disorder in the country. He said no country  should be allowed to impose its political ideas on the country  since Nigeria has never imposed its ideas on any other country.  The secretary to the government said the Constitutional  Conference was at present the only legally constituted body to  carry out the assignment on behalf of the people of this  country. He said government would continue to rely on the mass  media for an objective assessment of economic policies.</p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / International Company News: Dresdner Bank advances to DM2.2bn MR WOLFGANG Roller, chief executive of the Dresdner Bank, yesterday defended the bank's business and shareholding ties with Allianz, the largest insurance company in Europe which last week was ordered by the German federal cartel office to cut back its links with the bank. Speaking as the bank, the second largest in Germany, reported partial operating profits up 13.5 per cent to DM2.2bn (Dollars 1.33bn) for last year, Mr Roller stated that Allianz was in no way seeking to expand its influence over the bank. He said the insurance company's stake actually strengthened the independence of the bank by bringing stability to the share register. Last week the competition authorities told Allianz and Dresdner that they must scale down their business co-operation and gave Allianz a provisional order to cut back its holding in the bank from 22.3 to 19.1 per cent. It said that the Dresdner links gave Allianz domination of the German life market and the shareholding gave the insurance company undue influence over the business strategy pursued by the bank. Mr Roller said yesterday that business links with Allianz predated the formal agreement signed in 1989 to sell each others' products by a matter of decades. He insisted that at a very early stage the bank had decided to enter the life market by means of a co-operation agreement with insurance companies rather than by setting up its own subsidiary, as Deutsche Bank did in 1990. A more detailed response to the cartel office's findings was being worked on at the moment by the bank's lawyers, Mr Roller added. They have another five weeks to put together their formal reply to the authorities, although they have already spelt out their objections in general terms in a joint statement published last Thursday. Reflecting on business conditions last year, Mr Roller said the bank had benefited from a combination of strong demand for credit and an improvement of the interest rate margin. Net interest income for the group rose 13.9 per cent to DM5.39bn from DM4.73bn, while net commission income climbed 8.6 per cent to DM2.00bn. Staff costs rose 12 per cent to DM3.45bn, mainly because of the bank's expansion in eastern Germany. The current year had started off well, with profits up more than 10 per cent in the first two months, the chief executive said. Business volume was likely to expand moderately. As previously reported, the dividend for 1991 will be unchanged at DM12 per share. For the first time, the bank released a figure for total operating profits, which includes the profit generated by the bank via own-account share-trading. This was DM2.5bn for the group, up 23 per cent on the previous year, implying that the group generated profits of some DM300m from trading last year. At the parent company level, operating profits were up more sharply by 40 per cent to DM1.8bn, reflecting lower write-offs in 1991 compared with the previous year. Mr Roller said that the planned share-swap between Dresdner and BNP, the largest state-controlled bank in France, was proceeding. He said that the co-operation agreement between the two banks, which has been the subject of discussion for years, has now been signed by the supervisory board of both banks and they were working out the practical details of closer co-operation. The group's exposure to debt from the former Soviet Union stands at 'less than DM750m,' Mr Roller said. Some 80 per cent of this has now been provided for, he disclosed. Mr Roller is standing down as chief executive as from May 1993 and will be replaced by Mr Jurgen Sarrazin, the head of international business at Dresdner. Mr Roller will take over as chairman of the bank's supervisory board next year. Mr Wolfgang Schieren, formerly Allianz chief executive and chairman of the insurance company's supervisory board, will join the bank's supervisory board this year.</p>

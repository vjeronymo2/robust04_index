			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Rebel Abkhazia braces for long struggle: Georgian troops win a round but the separatists are far from throwing in the towel THE SCENE in two homes in the tiny Black Sea resort of Sukhumi summed up the mood after nearly a week of fighting between separatist Abkhazians and the Georgian majority. On a dirt road, the Arshaba family cowered in their woodframe home. Ethnic Abkhazians, they awaited word of husbands and brother at the front - and hid from men like Mr Tkutuli Kukachia. Mr Kukachia, a 52-year-old Georgian with Josef Stalin's photograph adorning his wall, sat with friends at his house 100 yards away, drinking victory toasts of sweet home-made wine. Fighting between the separatists and the Georgians, which began on Monday when troops were deployed to remove the Abkhazian government, has marked Mr Eduard Shevardnadze's evolution from diplomat to tough pragmatist as Georgian leader. It has also marked the unification, at least temporarily, of east and west Georgians, who have been feuding for months. But it may not herald a permanent peace in the region. 'The Georgians are well ahead in the battle but the Abkhazians will continue to fight them,' said Russian colonel Valery Krasovsky, commander of Commonwealth of Independent States troops in Sukhumi. 'All the Abkhazians are soldiers now.' Georgian troops control Sukhumi and much of the countryside. But Mr Vladislav Ardzinba, deposed Abkhazian leader, holed up with 1,500 troops in the town of Buduata, 40km north of Sukhumi, still directs a battle that is killing Georgian soldiers. Mr Ardzinba's men also control the town of Novy Afon, 25km north of Sukhumi. On Wednesday, they were firing on Sukhumi's Mayatskaya district from just 2km away. The trouble can be traced back to Stalin, a west Georgian who sometimes vacationed in Sukhumi. A century ago, Abkhazians made up nearly all the local population. But Stalin began moving in Mengrelians - west Georgians - as past of his ethnic control programme. Now, the Abkhazians make up just 18 per cent of the population of the semi-autonomous region and Mengrelians 45 per cent. The latest fighting resulted from a two-week battle of wills between the Georgian and Abkhaz leaderships. The Abkhaz parliament voted to adopt the old 1925 constitution, which describes the region as independent. That angered Mr Shevardnadze, who declared the vote illegal. The Abkhaz leadership responded by going to the nearby Mengrelian capital of Zugdidi and kidnapping 12 of Mr Shevardnadze's senior officials. That provoked Mr Shevardnadze to order in tanks and throw out Mr Ardzinba's government. At Sukhumi port on Wednesday more than 1,000 fleeing Georgians and Russians jostled for a position on a Russian steamer heading for the Black Sea resort of Sochi, four hours' voyage north. Mr Eldgudzha Adamiga, a Georgian who is director of a local hospital, was sending his Russian wife, Irina, and their 11-year-old twin sons to Sochi. Despite the destruction which resulted from the Georgian intervention, he supports the fighting. In his view, the revolution that swept away communists in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi and elsewhere months ago has finally reached Abkhazia. Mr Ardzinba represents the old, and Mr Shevardnadze the democratic new wave. But he added: 'The partisan war will continue. Ardzinba has his forces. They're the old Soviets and they'll keep fighting.'</p>

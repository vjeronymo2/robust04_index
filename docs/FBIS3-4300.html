On the eve of ROK President Kim Yong-sam's visit to China, this  reporter visited a number of institutions, enterprises, and  schools in the ROK, and found that pleasant spring winds of  expanding exchanges and cooperation with China are everywhere.  This can be seen in a string of convincing figures: China has  become the largest external destination for ROK investment, and  ROK investment in China accounted for 58.6 percent of its total  overseas investment in 1993. The number of ROK investment  projects in China last year reached 616, exceeding the total of  the previous five years. At present, China has become the ROK's  third largest trading partner.    Since China and the ROK established diplomatic relations in  1992, bilateral economic and trade relations have developed  rapidly. According to the latest statistics of the ROK Trade  Association, the total volume of trade last year reached $9.08  billion and increased by 42.3 percent. Along with the increase  in trade, the ROK has also been increasing its investment in  China year after year. Although there is a good foundation for  PRC-ROK economic cooperation, and such cooperation has developed  to a considerable scale, there remains a huge untapped potential  for the further expansion of trade and of economic and technical  cooperation. This is the consensus of the people in business  circles.    We can see the following characteristics in the development  of ROK-Chinese trade and economic cooperation: First, there is  a high growth rate. According to ROK customs statistics, the  volume of bilateral trade increased by an average annual rate of  over 50 percent between 1988 and 1993. Second, indirect trade  has been replaced by direct trade. In the past, entrepot trade  between the two countries accounted for over 70 percent of their  total trade volume, but the proportion of indirect trade  declined to 20 percent in 1992, and further fell to a lower  level last year. Third, economic cooperation between the two  countries has begun to develop in the capital-intensive,  technology-intensive, and resource- developing patterns.  Various ROK conglomerates have been carrying out their  cooperation plans with China in key industries. After the Daeu  Enterprise Group of the ROK invested approximately $300 million  in China's Shandong to build a modern cement factory, other  leading ROK enterprises, such as Samsong, Hyontae, Daeu,  Sangkyong, Ssangyong, and Nakhui Kimsong, have all been seeking  opportunities to expand cooperation with China in the  car-making, electronics, space, passenger aircraft, and  telecommunications industries with the support of the ROK  Government.    Along with the rapid development of Sino-ROK economic and  trade relations, a new "Chinese language craze" is rising in the  ROK. This reporter saw that not only large enterprises, but also  a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises had set up  China affairs offices, and people who know the Chinese language  are being urgently employed by various institutions,  organizations, and enterprises.    This year, there was a tide of "recovering Chinese  characters" in the Korean language. The government leaders  explicitly pointed out that the past practice of eliminating  Chinese characters from the Korean language was wrong and went  against the trend of the times. ROK newspapers are now  frequently using special columns to popularize knowledge about  Chinese characters and advocate the need to master Chinese  characters in order to open up the country and bring it into the  international community. Designers have created rotating  Chinese character tables on pencil boxes for primary school  students to enable the children to learn more Chinese characters  at any time. Recently, when schools enrolled new students, they  required students to write their names in Chinese characters.  Computer companies have also began to develop Chinese-character  software. Seoul is planning to erect Chinese-character  signposts for all streets.    China and the ROK are two neighboring countries which are  separated only by a strip of water. The two countries have a  time- honored historical tradition of economic and cultural  exchanges. Their mutually complementary economic structures, the  two peoples' strong desire for increasing exchanges, as well as  the needs in the interests of the two countries form the  precondition and foundation for the development of their  friendly cooperative relationship. The changes in the  post-cold-war international situation and in the ROK's domestic  situation and the vigorous development of the Chinese economy  have also provided a new opportunity for the development of  Sino-ROK relations. ROK political circles have generally held  that the meeting between President Jiang Zemin and President Kim  Yong-sam during the informal APEC summit meeting in Seattle last  November was an important event in the development of ROK-PRC  relations. Since China and the ROK established diplomatic  relations in August 1992, Chinese leaders Qian Qichen, Li  Lanqing, Tian Jiyun and ROK National Assembly Speaker Yi Man-sop  and Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu have exchanged visits, and  this has played an important role in helping the ROK renew its  understanding of China. As the economy in the Asia-Pacific  region is maintaining its momentum of rapid growth, the new  China craze in the ROK is obviously not related to short-term  economic interests. The ROK looks forward to closer cooperation  with China so that they may jointly make contributions to the  prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Leaders bathe in historic praise ALMOST no one who was not paid to do so greeted or celebrated Start 2 in Moscow yesterday: at 21 degrees below, it was not the weather for it and, after a year of economic reform, there was not the stomach for it. A couple of Russian children waving the Stars and Stripes had stood outside Spaso House, the US ambassador's residence, when President George Bush's party arrived on Saturday: Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who keeps the banner of fascist imperialism flying whenever he can, had earlier led 10 supporters to picket the airport with signs saying: 'Hands off Iraq.' Otherwise, Muscovites went about their holiday business: queueing for petrol, looking for food and telling foreign television crews that they didn't give two kopeks (0.5 cents at the current exchange rate) about what was happening in the Kremlin. In that chill fortress, Mr Bush looked weary as he commended the 'most significant arms agreement ever' at the Saturday night banquet in the Hall of Facets: Mr Boris Yeltsin, bouncy and at his most amiable, called the agreement a 'Christmas present to the world', a phrase which Mr Bush's speechwriters either could not match or thought too sugary for inclusion. They were bested again yesterday, when Mr Yeltsin's scribes pulled an 'agreement of hope' out of the phrase bag, it sounding even more soothing in Russian. Sitting in St Vladimir's Hall before their officials and the press, the two men assured each other of their historic importance: Mr Bush remembered that Mr Yeltsin had saved democracy in August 1991 by climbing on top of a tank, and Mr Yeltsin said that 'my friend George' possessed 'political and personal qualities (which) had helped to make the change from the cold war to warm relations between our countries'.</p>

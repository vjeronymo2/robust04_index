			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Satellite interview with Foreign Minister Peter Kooijmans </F> in The Hague by anchorman Henny Stoel in the studio -- live]    [Text] [Stoel] Good evening Mr. Kooijmans    [Kooijmans] Good evening Henny Stoel.    [Stoel] NATO has finally decided to issue a new ultimatum to  the Serbs and to carry out air strikes if necessary. Are you  satisfied with this decision?    [Kooijmans] Yes, I am. It is clear that the UN Security  Council has decided that the Serbs must leave Gorazde and that  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] troops should deploy in the town.  The ultimatum has been set for Sunday evening at 03OO.    [Stoel] Are the Serbs to be fought from the air? Should the  fighting not take place on the ground, as advocated by Minister  [Jan] Pronk?    [Kooijmans] At this time, that is absolutely impossible. In  any case, according to the military, an airborne strike force  could be used, and they [the Serbs] must take the credibility of  this threat into account.    [Stoel] What about the security of the UN ground troops?  U.S. Senator Nunn, a very influential man, advocates evacuating  the UN troops first before launching air strikes. Would you  agree to this, too?    [Kooijmans] Certainly not. This would be totally  inconsistent with what has been decided by the Security Council;  namely, that the UN troops absolutely should be stationed in  Gorazde. This is the assurance that can be given to the safe  areas and, therefore, there should not be any withdrawal.    [Stoel] But the UN ground troops will be in danger?    [Kooijmans] Necessary measures must be taken and some have  been taken to ensure their safety as much as possible.    [Stoel] What kind of measures?    [Kooijmans] I cannot provide any information on that.    [Stoel] They are secret?    [Kooijmans] Those measures are confidential.    [Stoel] Presidents Yeltsin and Clinton want to organize a  summit on Bosnia. Does this still make sense?    [Kooijmans] Yes, but do not forget that this is only to  prevent Gorazde from being taken over completely. A political  solution must also be reached and it is therefore very important  that the different parties involved in the negotiations  intervene. This is being contemplated in the form of a  conference with all parties involved directly -- the United  States, Russia, European Union, and the United Nations.    [Stoel] Thank you, Mr. Kooijmans    [Kooijmans] You are welcome.</p>

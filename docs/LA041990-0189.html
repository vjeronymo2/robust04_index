			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> COUNCIL MAKES RUTH NEW CITY MANAGER  </P> <P> The City Council has approved a contract promoting Assistant City Manager James  D. Ruth to the job of the city's top administrator.  </P> <P> The 3-0 vote Tuesday formalized the selection of a replacement for City Manager  Bob Simpson, who is retiring May 1.  </P> <P> The controversy that erupted over the selection process rattled City Hall last  month, with Mayor Fred Hunter and Councilman William D. Ehrle accusing fellow  council members of meeting secretly to choose Ruth.  </P> <P> "I think we're all pleased that this is behind us and we can move forward with  the business of the city," Ruth said Tuesday night.  </P> <P> Ehrle abstained from the vote, and Hunter was absent from the meeting.  </P> <P> "I feel Jim Ruth will be a very good city manager; however, I cannot condone  the manner in which he was selected," said Ehrle, explaining why he abstained.  </P> <P> He and Hunter have asked the Orange County district attorney and the Orange  County Grand Jury to investigate whether there was any wrongdoing by the three  council members during the March selection.  </P></p>

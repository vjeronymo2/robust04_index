			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAMPEAU BOARD MEETS IN SEARCH FOR SOLUTION;  </P> <P> RETAILING: DIRECTORS ARE UNDER PRESSURE TO SEEK BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION FOR  DEPARTMENT STORE CHAINS. THE FATE OF BLOOMINGDALE'S IS UP IN THE AIR.  </P> <P> Directors of Campeau Corp., facing mounting pressure to seek bankruptcy court  protection for their big department store divisions, huddled late into the  night Monday to try to come up with a way to deal with the company's financial  mess.  </P> <P> The Campeau board met amid indications that the company may put on a back  burner its efforts to sell Bloomingdale's, the crown jewel of its vast  retailing empire. Sources close to Campeau also speculated that the board was  wrestling with the issue of who controls the company, most of whose stock is  divided among several large shareholders.  </P> <P> Carol Sanger, a Campeau spokeswoman, termed "unfounded" a report in London's  Financial Times that her company already has taken the 17-store Bloomingdale's  chain off the market because the offers have been too low.  </P> <P> But sources familiar with the negotiations speculated that Campeau officials  are reconsidering their plans for Bloomingdale's. They explained that  prospective buyers appear to have been frightened off by the possibility that a  deal could eventually be voided or altered by a bankruptcy judge. Campeau  reportedly has asked $1.2 billion for the chain, but sources say the  preliminary offers have been less than $1 billion.  </P> <P> "It would be extremely difficult for anybody to acquire Bloomingdale's with the  specter of bankruptcy hanging over Campeau," said Gilbert W. Harrison, chairman  of Financo, a New York investment banking firm that specializes in the  retailing industry.  </P> <P> Campeau announced plans to sell Bloomingdale's in September as part of a  reorganization intended to rescue the giant Toronto-based real estate and  retailing company. The company has been struggling to cope with $7.4 billion in  takeover debts from its acquisition of Allied Stores in 1986 and Federated  Department Stores in 1988.  </P> <P> In December, Campeau disclosed that its Allied and Federated department store  divisions might have to file for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of  the U.S. Bankruptcy Code early this year. Under Chapter 11, a company is able  to remain in business and reorganize its operations while protected from the  threat of lawsuits by creditors.  </P> <P> Although Campeau is the second-largest department store organization in the  United States, there are no Allied or Federated outlets in Southern California.  Its only retail operation in the region is Ralphs supermarkets, and that chain  would not be included in the possible bankruptcy filing.  </P> <P> During the next week, Allied and Federated face two key deadlines in dealing  with their creditors, fueling speculation that a Chapter 11 filing could come  within days. On Wednesday, payments are due on merchandise received by Campeau  stores as of the month ended Dec. 20. If the stores file for bankruptcy court  protection quickly, they could temporarily put off those debts and keep the  cash they received from selling the merchandise.  </P> <P> In addition, a banking syndicate led by New York's Citibank has threatened to  declare $2.34 billion in Allied and Federated loans in default unless the  companies meet certain conditions by Monday. At that point, the banks could  demand that Allied and Federated pay off the loans early, a move that almost  certainly would force the department store companies into bankruptcy.  </P> <P> Apparel manufacturers and other department store suppliers in recent weeks have  held off shipments to Allied and Federated operations out of fear that they  will go into bankruptcy and not pay their existing debts. As a result, the  Allied and Federated stores may be badly short of spring merchandise unless the  stores can assure suppliers that payments will be made.  </P> <P> Analysts say a Chapter 11 filing could provide that assurance because orders  shipped after a bankruptcy petition is made would have the first claim on the  department stores' assets.  </P> <P> On the other hand, analysts say, a bankruptcy filing could scare off customers.  Campeau officials, they suggested, have also resisted filing for bankruptcy  because of the uncertainty of what could happen once the company's operations  are under the supervision of a bankruptcy judge.  </P></p>

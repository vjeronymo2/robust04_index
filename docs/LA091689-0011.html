			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURATEUR TO BE TRIED IN BOY'S KILLING  </P> <P> Pacific Beach restaurateur Roger Sing Ip will stand trial for the shooting  death of a Mission Bay High School freshman who was fatally wounded after a  minor traffic altercation.  </P> <P> Municipal Judge H. Ronald Domnitz on Friday ordered Ip, 34, to stand trial, at  the conclusion of a three-day preliminary hearing. Domnitz also refused to  lower Ip's $1-million bail, after commenting that the shooting appeared to be  unprovoked.  </P> <P> "I'm going to leave bail where it is. . . . I've had three days of testimony  that puts Mr. Ip at the scene, but I haven't heard anything about provocation,"  Domnitz said.  </P> <P> According to witnesses, Kurt Von Yokes, 15; Michael W. Endsley, 19, and Debbie  Lichty, 18, were driving home when a red Isuzu Trooper allegedly driven by Ip  nearly collided with Lichty's car. Words were exchanged and Ip allegedly  followed the three teen-agers to Endsley's home.  </P> <P> When the youths arrived at Endsley's house, Endsley and Yokes got out of the  car and stood at the end of the driveway. Endsley and Lichty testified that the  driver of the Trooper fired one shot and drove away.  </P> <P> Dr. Leena Jariwala, a San Diego County pathologist, testified that the bullet  entered the right side of Yokes' chest, pierced his heart, both lungs, and  liver, before exiting through the left side of his chest. Jariwala said the  youth bled to death.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregg McClain said that Ip was a flight risk and argued  against a bail reduction. Ip, who is from Hong Kong, is a British citizen and  permanent resident alien of the United States. Ip fled the area after the  shooting and hid in Los Angeles, before surrendering to San Diego police.  </P> <P> Before surrendering, Ip had a passport waiting for him in Los Angeles, McClain  said. He faces an arraignment hearing Oct. 16.  </P></p>

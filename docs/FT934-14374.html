			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Arts: New organ put through its paces THE NEWLY-opened organ in St John's, Smith Square is the first concert organ to be built in London for four decades - the last was the Royal Festival Hall monster - and on Thursday evening several notable organists swelled the audience to hear Gillian Weir put it through its paces. Her recital provided the first real test of the instrument's versatility. In last week's gala inauguration concert the organ had featured only as part of the celebration; and Simon Preston's recital the day after was an all-Bach affair. By contrast, Weir's pot-pourri programme covered the spectrum from Bach and his slightly senior contemporaries to Messiaen and some younger 20th-century composers. There is no doubting the instrument's capabilities: in all areas of the repertory it sounded eloquent, and the Bonn organ building firm of Klais has matched it perfectly to the scale of the building. It is bright but not strident in Baroque music; the action is alive to the demands of modern works, and the stops are colourful. The fiery reeds are not too rough for the Romantic repertory, but here the tracker action produces an intrusive 'chiff' in quieter passages and at times the pedal department seemed underpowered. The evening got off to a worrying start, with a dull Bruhns E minor Prelude and Fugue. None of the threads of its rather disjointed structure was tied together, and Miss Weir never allowed the music to take flight. Her account of the Bach Passacaglia was unworthy - the playing messy, even frantic, the registration unrelenting. For once there was no poetry or majesty in this towering masterpiece. But she more than redeemed herself with a dazzling account of the Belgian Joseph Jongen's rhapsodic Sonata Eroica, making light of its virtuoso demands. Most of the second half was devoted to post-1945 pieces, and all were dispatched with ease and sensitivity. The organ responded equally well to her incisively played set of Calvin Hampton dances and to the ethereal bird-calls of Messiaen's 'Les Oiseaux et les sources' (from the Messe de la pentecote). A highlight was the exhilarating Salamanca by Guy Bovet, exotically coloured. Saint-Saens's 'Echo' Fantaisie, a rousing finale, gave the audience another chance to admire Miss Weir's dexterity at the console - St John's have even installed an innovative projection screen which allowed us to witness it in close-up. Indeed, the whole project blends state-of-the-art modern technology with the best of the old. Further recitals in the 'Notes Tremendous' series: Daniel Chorzempa (October 28,29), Jon Laukvik (November 4,5), Alexander Fiseisky (November 23, 24)</p>

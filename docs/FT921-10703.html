			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Arts: Dramatic chronicles from Moscow THE MOSCOW ART THEATRE LETTERS edited by Jean Benedetti Methuen Drama Pounds 20, 377 pages The idea to found the Moscow Art Theatre, for decades a legend, was conceived a few years before the First World War by Konstantin Stanislavsky and Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko during a lunch-time meeting in a Moscow restaurant which lasted for 18 hours. The two men understood that the fate of the as yet unborn theatre depended entirely on their unshakeable friendship. Whether they could maintain it must have seemed an open question to both of them, although their faith in the realisation of the dream did not wane. As for the deep differences between Stanislavsky, the theatre man through and through, and Nemirovich-Danchencko, the literary intellectual, both believed they would avoid all dangers by a division of power: Nemirovich's view would decide all literary questions, while disagreements on questions of production would be decided by Stanislavsky. During the next 40 odd years another Moscow Art Theatre followed the first, and then a third one, RAPP. The language began to be dominated by such bundles of capital letters (RAPP stood for 'Revolutionary Association of Proletarian Writers), but Anton Chekhov, whose conversion to the theatre was one of the new venture's first achievements, was still part of the repertoire, next to his friends Maxim Gorky and Mikhail Bulgakov, the author of the White Guard. But Chekhov's plays The Three Sisters, Uncle Vanya and The Cherry Orchard remained through all the changes of time and temper the unforgettable, at any rate still vibrantly living, dramatic treasure of those years. What mattered most was the growing tension between Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko, the bond between them being rubbed thinner and thinner until at last Nemirovich-Danchenko wrote to Stanislavsky in 1938 that 'a historian, some theatrical Nestor, not without humour, will say 'Can you imagine: These people, they themselves, destroyed this relationship, fought over it, and history will find this a complete mystery.'' So massive a collection of letters chronicling this story could have been dull; but of the applause the Moscow Art Theatre has achieved, some part will be shared by Jean Benedetti's excellent book, which contains much of the correspondence among those principally concerned. From the beginning the Theatre broke with the then dominant style of pedantic naturalism and tried anything and everything that promised good theatre: Russian playwrights, of course, from Gogol to Maxim Gorky and Bulgakov. But ever more foreign authors were performed: Ibsen (a political satire like Pillars of Society was a very great success, but Ibsen's dramatic poem Brand no less so) and, once the Theatre had moved so far from naturalism, Shakespeare. In 1903 Nemirovich produced Julius Caesar, with Stanislavsky as Brutus. A few years later Stanislavsky set up a small company of young actors under Vsevolod Meyerhold's leadership and began to try out new rehearsal techniques, including improvisation. Under this new persuasion acting came first, not literature. Nemirovich wrote to Stanislavsky: 'under the influence of Meyerhold's absurd blabbering about the need to rehearse as the spirit moves, you suddenly felt the desire to exploit a method you claim to have been dreaming about for a long time. In fact, you want to get rid of reason]' That exchange of letters between the two was in 1905. This is a letter written in the autumn of 1935 from Stanislavsky to Stalin: 'Our theatre can and must be the most advanced theatre in the country in its representation of the fullness of the inner spiritual life of working people who have been made masters of the soil. The struggle is hard and help is needed if the two chiefs, despite our declining age and the tangled state of our 40 years old relationship are to lead the theatre out of its present condition . . . Knowing your affection for the theatre I hope you will help'. Indeed, Stalin 'helped.' For Party fanatics, Stalin's 'help' meant that somebody like Meyerhold, whom Stanislavsky had called his artistic successor, could at long last be hunted down. He was accused of the heresy of 'formalism,' the most damnable sin under the sacred doctrine of Socialist Realism. On January 8 1938 Meyerhold's theatre was closed down, while Stanislavsky, very close to the end of his life, continued to work with Meyerhold in his own home. But Meyerhold was arrested and sent to a punishment camp in Siberia where he died; to this day it has never been made public exactly how. A few weeks after his disappearance his wife, the actress Sinaida Raich, was murdered in their flat. In 1974, a major exhibition in Moscow celebrated Meyerhold's achievements: it showed in countless photographs Moscow's theatre world of the 1920s and brought out Meyerhold's revolutionary influence, above all in his great Agit-prop productions. It was, in fact, Meyerhold who put himself immediately at the disposal of the government after the October revolution. He played a leading role from 1920 to 1938, going well beyond what Stanislavsky had taught him. Bertold Brecht's writings are to some extent inspired by his admiration of Meyerhold. No doubt, the exhibition was meant to be a kind of rehabilitation. If so it lacked the essential admission. Not one word referred to how Meyerhold had been dispatched in Siberia, nor why and how his wife was killed a few weeks later.</p>

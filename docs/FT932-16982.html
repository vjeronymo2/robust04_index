			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: Fletcher to sell 9% of its stake in Canadian arm FLETCHER Challenge, the New Zealand forestry group, is to sell 9 per cent of its stake in Fletcher Challenge Canada for CDollars 190.8m (USDollars 151.7m), through a public offering of shares. The move is part of FCL's debt reduction programme and will reduce its shareholding in the Canadian subsidiary to 63 per cent. FCL said a primary aim of the sale, however, was to avoid having to issue 120m of its own ordinary shares on July 16 when it was liable to convert shares in Fletcher Challenge Investments, a Canadian subsidiary, into its own. Mr Hugh Fletcher, chief executive, said FCL wanted to avoid converting the shares because this would dilute the value of its ordinary shares. He said a group of Canadian underwriters, led by Wood Gundy, would buy 10.6m A shares in Fletcher Challenge Canada. The group would offer the shares to the public for CDollars 190.8m, or CDollars 18 a share, on an instalment basis. The purchase price would be paid to FCL in two instalments of CDollars 100.7m on April 28, and CDollars 90.1m on June 30 next year. Mr Fletcher said the transaction would enhance shareholder value by increasing asset backing per share. FCL will earn a profit on the deal. The price of CDollars 18 a share compares with CDollars 14.50 that FCL paid for the shares last year. Analysts said the move accorded with FCL's objective of reducing its exposure to the British Columbian forestry industry, although Mr Fletcher emphasised its long-term commitment to the Canadian industry, and optimism about its future.</p>

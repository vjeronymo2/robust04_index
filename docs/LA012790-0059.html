			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIGHT DRUGS WITH VOLUNTEERS, BUSH TELLS MAYORS  </P> <P> President Bush told the nation's mayors Friday they should rely more on  volunteer efforts to fight illegal drugs in their cities and pledged to use the  White House as "a bully pulpit" to activate citizens in the effort.  </P> <P> While agreeing on the value of voluntary action, the mayors responded that it  is no substitute for government money and renewed their criticism of the  Administration's newly released drug war blueprint.  </P> <P> Bush earned some good will from the mayors by becoming the first President in a  decade to address the U.S. Conference of Mayors meeting, but his drug plan has  drawn mostly negative reviews from the men and women who run the cities.  </P> <P> Citing surveys showing Americans' willingness to contribute time or money to  combat drugs in their neighborhoods, Bush said: "They want to serve. They want  to give. But they have to be asked before they can do either. I promise, I will  use the bully pulpit to ask them to do both, and I urge you to do the same  thing."  </P> <P> Asked about Bush's emphasis on his "1,000 points of light" approach, Houston  Mayor Kathy Whitmire, a Democrat, said: "I happen to be an advocate of  voluntarism. I feel it is a successful approach. It is not, however, a  replacement for government."  </P> <P> The mayors criticized Bush's latest drug strategy, which calls for $10.6  billion in spending, as inadequate given the problem they are confronting at  home.  </P> <P> In his speech, Bush also emphasized tougher law enforcement and asked the  mayors to support his plan to expand the death penalty for certain drug-related  crimes. The mayors, taking no position on capital punishment, said they want  substantially more money for law enforcement and want the money funneled  directly to the cities, claiming cities received only 15% of the federal  enforcement funds last year.  </P> <P> Boston Mayor Raymond L. Flynn, a Democrat, praised the President for appearing  but said the mayors have a "sharp disagreement" with the Administration on its  approach to cities, not only in the drug fight but also in providing adequate  housing for the poor and the homeless.  </P></p>

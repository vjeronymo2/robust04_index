			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 24 KYODO -- The ruling coalition and  the opposition agreed Friday [24 June] night to convene a  plenary session of the House of Representatives at 1 a.m.  Saturday [1600 GMT 24 June] to vote on a no-confidence motion  against the minority government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata.    They reached the agreement at a meeting of directors of the  lower house's steering committee, party officials said.    If Hata fails to survive the no-confidence vote, he must  either resign with his entire cabinet or dissolve the lower  house for a snap election. The no-confidence motion was  proposed by the opposition Liberal Democratic Party.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Summary of Comments.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters raise both practical and legal issues with respect to the proposal's sanction clock policy where it indicates that EPA must fully approve SIP submittals before sanctions clocks that are started by disapprovals can be stopped. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first commenter's practical concern is time. With respect to a sanctions clock started by a disapproval, because of the length of the State's regulatory development, approval and adoption processes and EPA's review period, the interpretation in the proposed rule could result in sanctions being imposed even if a State had fully adopted and submitted the corrective rule. Sanctions would remain in effect until EPA finished its rulemaking approving the corrected rule. The commenter is concerned that the rule could have an adverse impact solely because EPA had not had time to act on SIP revisions that are fully approvable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter further believes that EPA's policy is not supported by the language of the Act. The commenter argues that the Act elsewhere explicitly distinguishes between correcting the deficiency and EPA's process of approving a SIP. Section 110(c)(1)(B) states that the Administrator must promulgate a Federal implementation plan (FIP) within two years of SIP disapproval ``*&blank;*&blank;* unless the state corrects the deficiency, and the Administrator approves the plan or plan revision *&blank;*&blank;*.'' Section 179(a), though, merely provides that sanctions shall apply ``unless such deficiency has been corrected *&blank;*&blank;*'' and does not include the phrase regarding EPA plan approval. The commenter believes that EPA cannot ignore the difference between sections 110 and 179 because to do so would constitute ``reading out'' or rendering meaningless the additional phrase of section 110(c)(1)(B). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To support its legal argument, the commenter states that principles of statutory construction provide that effect must be given to each word in a statutory provision, and that every effort must be made to avoid an interpretation which renders other provisions of the same statute inconsistent, meaningless, or superfluous ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Boise Cascade Corp.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States Environmental Protection Agency,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 942 F.2d 1427, 1432 (9th Cir. 1991)). The commenter also notes that an agency cannot ignore or ``read out'' part of a statute ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Natural Resources Defense Council  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States Environmental Protection Agency,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 822 F.2d 104, 113 (D.C. Cir. 1987)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As an alternative to EPA's proposal, the commenter recommends that the sanctions clock policy for disapprovals follow the process in the proposal for findings of nonsubmittal and incompleteness. The commenter states that under that alternative policy the clock would be stopped if a new submittal is received, pending EPA's determination of whether the deficiency has been corrected. The commenter urges EPA to adopt a consistent policy to stop sanction clocks in all cases upon receiving a revised SIP submittal. If EPA's preliminary review indicates the deficiency has been corrected, then the clock would remain stopped and EPA would proceed to approve the plan through rulemaking. If the deficiency was not corrected initially, the clock would restart via a letter to the State. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A second commenter raised similar concerns with EPA's proposal that actual approval was needed to stop a sanctions clock started by a disapproval. According to the commenter, the clock should be suspended with the submittal to EPA of a completed rulemaking and remain suspended unless EPA disapproves the SIP. The commenter notes that EPA has the opportunity to participate in the State's rulemaking process to ensure the deficiency is corrected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response to Comments.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to the comments received, EPA reevaluated its proposed sanction clock policy and made two changes. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA is also making a clarification to the sanction clock policy which is discussed in section II.C.4. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Overview of Change One. For the reasons stated in subsection (4) of this section II.B.3.c., EPA does not adopt the exact approach set forth by the commenters, which would actually stop a sanctions clock started by a disapproval upon State submittal of a SIP. However, EPA has determined that it is reasonable to temporarily defer and/or stay the application of sanctions, as appropriate, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  following SIP disapprovals, where EPA proposes to fully approve a SIP revision or proposes to conditionally approve a SIP. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In addition, EPA has determined that such deferral and/or staying of sanction application is reasonable following findings of nonimplementation <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  where EPA proposes to find that a State is implementing its SIP. Simultaneous with such proposed approval or finding of SIP implementation, EPA will issue a separate, interim final determination that the State has corrected the deficiency that prompted the finding that started the sanctions clock. In all these cases, whether sanctions are deferred and/or stayed depends on the timing of EPA's proposed action vis-a-vis the sanction clocks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed below under change two, the proposed sanction clock policy specifically provided for the deferral of sanctions during completeness reviews of SIP's submitted following nonsubmittal and incompleteness findings, but not staying the sanctions. The concept set forth here for initial disapprovals and findings of failure to implement is carried forth from this process developed in the proposal for initial findings of failure to submit or of incompleteness. In carrying this concept over, EPA believes that it is logical and necessary that if the effect of sanction application is to be deferred that sanctions actually applied should be stayed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Note that a proposed partial or limited approval would not result in the deferral and/or staying of the application of sanctions because such actions are associated with proposed partial or limited disapprovals. (For a discussion of partial and limited approvals/disapprovals, see the memorandum entitled ``Processing of State Implementation Plan (SIP) Submittals'' from John Calcagni to Air Division Directors, Regions I&hyph;X, July 9, 1992.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Although the comments focused on a clock started by a disapproval, EPA has extended its changes to a clock started by a finding of failure to implement, finding no reason to treat findings of failure to implement differently. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

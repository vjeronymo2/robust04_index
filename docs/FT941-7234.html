			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Survey of Asia-Pacific Telecommunications (2): World waits for reforms - India The Indian government is putting the final touches to a new telecommunications policy which it hopes will pave the way to large-scale private investment and end the state's monopoly of the industry. Foreign companies are among the many groups which hope to take advantage of the reforms once they come into force and have been busy lobbying for change. But in framing the policies ministers have also to take into account the opposition of most of the 470,000 workers employed by the government's department of telecommunications, who fear their jobs might be lost if the market is opened to competition. The improvement of India's telecommunications network is a prerequisite for the success of the government's policy of opening India to international trade and investment. India has about eight telephones per 1,000 people, compared with a global average of 100. India has about 7m telephones. Just to provide an average of one line for every 10 of its 200m middle-class people would mean installing an extra 13m lines - an investment of the order of USDollars 13bn, according to officials of the government's department of telecommunications. Mr N Vittal, the dynamic chairman of the Telecommunications Commission, the industry's policy-making body, believes that without private sector investors, including foreign companies, India cannot raise the funds it needs for telecommunications. And without better telecommunications, India 'cannot plug into the global market'. In an effort to improve the efficiency of the network, the services for Delhi and Bombay were split from the department of telecommunications in 1986 and made into a separate state-owned company called Mahangar Telephone Nigam Ltd. But the frictions between this and the department - over pay rates, for example - were so great that in 1991, the government ordered a review by the Athreya Committee, which in the same year recommended splitting the network into four regional corporations and one for long-distance services. (A separate corporation Videsh Sangam Nagar Ltd or VSNL handles international calls.) The telecommunications trade unions protested strongly at the suggested break-up of the network, principally out of fear that the loss-making operations covering depressed eastern India would have no choice but to cut staff. The unions orchestrated political support so effectively that the planned reorganisation of the network has repeatedly been delayed - and with it the rules under which private companies are to be allowed into telecommunications. Mr Vittal, a high-flying civil servant who took over at the telecommunications commission last autumn, has argued in favour of extensive liberalisation to promote the growth of efficiency and to open the door to investment. His target is to have 20m lines installed by 2000 - an aim that is only feasible with large-scale private investment. However, the latest indications are that the government is unlikely to order the network's break-up and may instead turn the telecommunications department into one state-owned corporation. There would still be plenty of scope for the entry of private capital but preserving the public network inside one corporation would shield it from the full blast of competition. As Mr Vittal said in a speech late last year: 'One has to make a distinction between liberalisation and privatisation. At the moment our emphasis is on liberalisation.' It seems likely that the government will also continue to distinguish between the basic network of telephone services, in which the influence of the trade unions is strongest, and new added-value services including computer-linked services, cellular telephone networks and paging services. In the basic services, a strong hint of the conditions under which private investment will be permitted are indicated by the terms on which US West, a US telecommunications company, last year won approval from the Cabinet Committee on Foreign Investment for a USDollars 100m joint venture providing services to an industrial town in Tamil Nadu in partnership with the state-owned Tamil Nadu Electronic Development Corporation. The partners, which plan to invest a total of USDollars 1bn over 10 years in different locations, will have a non-exclusive licence and will therefore be obliged to compete with the department of telecommunication and with other possible carriers. The partners will also be required to charge the same as existing DoT rates and to connect their systems with the DoT network. However, the US West project still requires separate approval from the telecommunications ministry. Other foreign companies which are among 18 groups that have expressed interest in investing in basic telephone services include Qualcomm and Media Digital of the US and Northern Telecom, from Canada. The potential bidders also number leading Indian industrial groups including Calcutta-based RP Goenka group and YK Modi of Delhi. In the meantime, the government has tried to promote the expansion of added-value services, particularly cellular telephones and paging services, but its efforts have been stymied by clumsy handling of bids resulting in legal action. For paging services, the government last month gave an initial go-ahead to 16 companies, all joint ventures between Indian and foreign groups, to operate radio-paging services in 27 cities. The announcement came a year after the Delhi High Court over-ruled objections from some unsuccessful bidders.</p>

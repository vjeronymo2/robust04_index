			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Warning on repossession of homes Many of the 300,000-plus households with arrears of six months or more on their mortgages are running up increasing debts which could lead to a rise in the number of homes being repossessed, according to a study published today, Alison Smith writes. The paper, which comes from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, suggests that the concessionary payment schemes which were offered to a higher proportion of borrowers during the early 1990s can mean that repossession is postponed rather than avoided. It says the levels of repossession among borrowers who are taking part in concessionary schemes may rise if they cannot increase the amount they are paying in a way that satisfies mortgage lenders. Possessions have dropped from a peak of 75,450 in 1991 to about 25,000 in the first half of this year. Housing Research Findings 125. JRF, The Homestead, 40 Water End, York YO3 6LP.</p>

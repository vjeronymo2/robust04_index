			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Budget policy swings in political wind: Republicans' election success leaves future direction in doubt The Republican takeover of Congress has left fiscal experts and financial market analysts in doubt over the future of the US budget policy. Is Washington about to embark on a frenzy of tax cuts that could widen the deficit dramatically unless offset by the kind of severe spending cuts that neither Republicans nor Democrats have ever shown any real inclination to undertake? Will the fiscal restraint begun by President Bill Clinton's 1993 budget continue as Republicans follow through on their promise to amend the US constitution to require a balanced federal budget, and take the steps necessary to achieve that balance? Or will gridlock set in, leaving the US with its current, relatively moderate budget deficit but with severe fiscal imbalances in the longer term unaddressed? At its most extreme, the new Republican majority in Congress includes members such as Congressman Dick Armey, a confirmed supply-side economics professor from north Texas who wants a flat income tax rate, and believes that tax cuts will pay for themselves because of the additional revenue they produce. But Mr Clinton warned in his press conference the day after the Republicans' crushing election victory that he would 'do all in my power to keep anyone from jeopardising this economic recovery by taking us back to the policies that failed before' and produced the rising deficits of the 1980s. The House Republicans' 'Contract with America' promises measures that would reduce government revenue, such as a Dollars 500 per child tax credit, lower tax rates on capital gains and a higher earnings threshold before older Americans still working lose their social security pension benefits. But, although it promises a balanced budget constitutional amendment, it offers no specifics of the spending cuts that would be needed to balance the budget. Republican candidates have individually been assuring their constituents that they would not touch social security, Medicare, agricultural subsidies or veterans' benefits, which together account for 66 per cent of federal spending. Mr Clinton may have critical support from some Republicans whose priority is fiscal discipline rather than supply side stimulus. Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico, who will take over as chairman of the Senate budget committee, is a noted fiscal hawk who has stood out from his party colleagues by his willingness to contemplate higher taxes as a means of bringing the budget deficit under control. He will not have much support for that position, but is likely to serve as an important brake on his colleagues' tax-cutting zeal. Congressman Bill Archer of Texas, who will have direct control over tax policy as the new chairman of the House Ways and Means committee, stands between the two positions - though closer to his fellow Texan than to Mr Domenici. He concurs with the supply side analysis of a cut in capital gains tax rates - and also wants to index capital gains to inflation - but insists on keeping the current Budget Act rules which require any measure involving a loss in tax revenue to be offset by spending cuts or other tax increases. 'It's a discipline we must apply to the members of the Congress,' he said yesterday. 'Revenue scoring' - determining whether a measure will increase or reduce the government deficit - is an esoteric science conducted principally by the Joint Committee on Taxation, a Senate-House organisation which will be taken over by Mr Archer and Senator Bob Packwood, the new chairman of the Senate finance committee, and may therefore be expected to change some of its methodology. Past studies have suggested that while a lower capital gains tax increases revenue in the short term and reduces it over the medium term, its long run effect is close to neutral. But an administration analysis of the Republicans' promise to index capital gains and exclude 50 per cent of gains from tax showed the measure to lose Dollars 30bn over four years. Scoring could thus become a crucial battleground between the White House and the Congress, with accusations of 'smoke and mirrors' flying freely. In the new political environment, the commission on entitlements chaired by Democratic Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and retiring Republican Senator John Danforth of Missouri could play an unexpectedly important role. It was once viewed as a sop from the White House to Mr Kerrey in exchange for his vote on the 1993 budget, but its findings could now attract much wider support.</p>

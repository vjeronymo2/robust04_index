			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Invitation to Khmer Rouge alarms west THE POSSIBILITY of Khmer Rouge officials being included in the new Cambodian government yesterday alarmed politicians and foreign observers a day after the interim administration was formally announced. Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the head of state, released a statement saying there would be no Khmer Rouge officials in the government. The day after announcing the formation of a new interim administration, he said only members of elected parties could join the government. However, at the same time the prince published a letter to Mr Khieu Samphan, nominal Khmer Rouge leader, inviting the faction to send representatives to Phnom Penh to hold 'family-style' talks with the interim government. For months, the prince has talked of the need for a government of national reconciliation. When the prospect of Khmer Rouge representation was first raised by Prince Sihanouk in a speech to the Constituent Assembly on Tuesday, there was a swift and hostile reaction from the US. Officials in Washington and diplomats in Phnom Penh made it clear they would resist any Khmer Rouge involvement in a Cambodian government. Prince Sihanouk's statement was intended to calm US fears and to assuage the Cambodian People's party, the former communist party which has ruled the country and fought a civil war against the Khmer Rouge since it was installed by Vietnam in 1979. Earlier yesterday Prince Sihanouk received the leaders of a short-lived but violent movement for autonomy in eastern Cambodia, one of whom was his son, Prince Chakrapong.</p>

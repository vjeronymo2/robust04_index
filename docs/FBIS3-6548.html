Japan should not  take an action to appease its own people under pressure from  foreign countries as it has done so far, but it should adopt a  policy of voluntarily and independently doing what it has to do.    However, after the Japanese-U.S. summit talks were broken  off, Japan stated with composure: "With the breakdown, the  relationship between the two nations has matured." This  justification is based on a quite incorrect understanding.    It is too optimistic a view that economic issues can be  separated from political and security issues. If Japan holds  such a view, its national interests may be hampered.    Japan has not seriously realized that there are great  differences in views as well as in national interests between  Japan and the United States. There is a possibility that Japan  will in the future become aware that Japanese-U.S. relations  will have worsened irreparably. Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa should take the initiative voluntarily in preventing  the Japanese-U.S. relationship from deteriorating further.    The Clinton administration also has its problems. The leader  that should bear responsibility for the world is unable to make  a decision from a broad viewpoint and is instead adopting a  policy of emphasizing domestic affairs. The United States can  be described as a daimyo who holds a fief which yields 1 million  koku [1 koku equals 180 liters] of rice but who acts as if he is  daimyo with a fief which yields only 100,000 koku of rice. That  country should clearly define the place of the Japanese-U.S.  relationship in the world order.    There is a concern that Japan revisionists [nihon ishitsu  ronsha], who express dissatisfaction with Japan through business  dealings with Japan, are at the center of the Clinton  administration and that they surround the President.    The economic framework talks, which have been at an impasse  as the Japanese-U.S. Structural Impediments Initiative talks  were before, look like salesmen's negotiations as would be found  in the private sector. Because deregulation and the expansion  of domestic demand are issues that concern Japan itself, while  at the same time they are of benefit to the entire world, Japan  needs to take a drastic approach to them.    Now that GATT's international trade rules have changed,  Japan  should at first propose a new Japanese-U.S. structure which  includes political and security issues and which takes the new  world order into account. To that end, it is appropriate for  not only government officials but also learned men who represent  the two countries to hold thorough discussions without time  limits being set for these.</p>

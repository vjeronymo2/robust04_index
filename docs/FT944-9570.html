			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Sketchley rises 11% and aims to rebuild image Sketchley is poised to embark on a marketing campaign in an effort to rebuild its image and increase awareness of its brand name. Mr John Jackson, only 11 days into his new job as chief executive, said that dry-cleaning was mostly generic, but that the Sketchley brand was an under-utilised asset and should denote market leadership in terms of professionalism and reliability. Mr Tony Bloom, deputy chairman, acknowledged that problems in the past had tarnished the brand, but a marketing campaign, probably on radio and in the press, would start soon to address this and to increase awareness. The announcement came as the dry-cleaning, photo-processing and textile services group reported pre-tax profits up 11 per cent from Pounds 3.61m to Pounds 4m in the 26 weeks to September 30. Mr Jackson was appointed following the departure of Mr John Richardson, who with Mr Bloom steered Sketchley away from the financial brink. Mr Richardson left, because 'the job is done'. Mr Bloom said both consumers and retailers remained cautious, given that the 'macro scene is still patchy'. On the consumers' side, dry-cleaning was 'a grudge purchase'. He added that the retail side was highly operationally geared. 'Three extra customers per day per shop and we'd have a really excellent business.' Group turnover slipped to Pounds 74.5m (Pounds 75.7m), including Pounds 1.49m (Pounds 24.1m) from acquisitions, as 60 lossmaking branches were closed, bringing the total to 750. So far there are 47 sites which combine dry-cleaning and Supasnaps, the photo-processing business acquired in 1993 for Pounds 6.6m. The group expects to have 150 joint sites within 18 months, which will involve a move into the north of England where Supasnaps is already represented. The retail division made profits of Pounds 2.79m (Pounds 2.44m) on turnover of Pounds 45.8m (Pounds 48.9m). Profits in textile services rose to Pounds 2.79m (Pounds 2.21m) on turnover of Pounds 28.2 (Pounds 25.3m). Warrender Aircraft Services, acquired in April for Pounds 8.4m including debt, contributed Pounds 400,000 to profits and Pounds 1.5m to turnover. Over the half, borrowings rose from Pounds 11.3m to Pounds 15.5m after the Warrender buy, giving gearing of 42 per cent. This should revert to the 30-35 per cent level of the April 1 year end by the end of this year. Earnings per share emerged at 4.5p (4.4p) and the interim dividend is unchanged at 1p.</p>

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Fairey profit little changed after good electronics result FAIREY, the engineering group, turned in only slightly reduced profits due to a strong performance from its electronics and electrical power division and a five months contribution from LaserMike, the US measuring equipment manufacturer. Pre-tax profits for the year ended December 31 amounted to Pounds 14.5m (Pounds 14.6m), reflecting lower interest income. Sales were up at Pounds 88.8m (Pounds 86m). Earnings per share rose from 27.6p to 28.1p, benefiting from a lower tax charge. The shares rose 22p to close at 385p. The group ended the year with cash resources of Pounds 12.7m (Pounds 12.1m). It is expecting to use its cash pile to buy another company as big or bigger than last year's Dollars 11.5m (Pounds 6.5m) acquisition of LaserMike, the US manufacturer of non-contact dimensional measuring equipment which is now making a valuable contribution. Mr Derek Kingsbury, chairman, confirmed that the group is likely to make a purchase which would be incorporated into the rapidly expanding electronics and electrical power division. 'We are looking for a good quality purchase. But we do not have to do a deal,' he said. Electronics and electrical power, which five years ago was the junior partner to aerospace, now accounts for the bulk of the group's operating profits. Boosted by the recent addition of LaserMike, it increased its contribution to Pounds 7.56m (Pounds 7.15m). Aerospace and defence also increased profits, to Pounds 2.45m (Pounds 2.26m), as Fairey Hydraulics increased earnings on reduced sales. Filtration and specialised ceramics showed a profits decline to Pounds 3.17m (Pounds 3.56m) mainly because fluid power orders from the mobile equipment industry were down sharply A final dividend of 6p (5.5p) makes a total of 9p compared to 8.25p in the previous year. COMMENT If this is the worst year for Fairey, with static profits and a slight increase in earnings, the future must look pretty good. The group has also ended the year with a healthier cash balance than expected which will almost certainly go towards making a biggish acquisition this year. Although electronics and electrical power was helped by a significant contribution from LaserMike in the US, it is still worth noting that over five years it has transformed its modest profit contribution of just over Pounds 2m, which was then significantly behind aerospace and defence, into Pounds 7.5m - more than the other two divisions put together. With expected pre-tax profits of Pounds 15.5m, giving earnings of 29.1p, the shares are on a prospective multiple of 13.2. This is above the sector average of 12.2, reflecting the group's ability to make good profits in difficult times.</p>

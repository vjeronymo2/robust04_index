			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Eve pays more despite profits fall EVE GROUP yesterday became one of the few contractors and property developers to announce a dividend increase during one of the worst results seasons the industry has experienced. The final dividend goes up from 6.5p to 7p, despite a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.11m to Pounds 3.26m for the 12 months to end-March, a decline which reflected lower interest received of Pounds 375,000 (Pounds 1.05m). Turnover dropped from Pounds 46.6m to Pounds 39.1m. The total distribution, covered 2.3 times by earnings per share of 22.5p (29p), increased from 9.2p to 9.7p. The USM-quoted group's cash position, however, improved by the end of the year to stand at Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 3.91m). Mr Gerald Hough, managing director, described the results as a considerable achievement in such a difficult market. He expected dividends to continue to rise provided profits increased in line with general inflation. The group's strength is its specialist contracting division which is one of only three companies carrying out work for the National Grid Company, erecting transmission lines and pylons. The division also erects transmission towers for radio and telecommunications and television companies. This field of work has held up much better and commands much higher margins than general contracting which only broke even last year. Construction profits fell by only Pounds 51,000 to Pounds 3.15m, helped by a strong performance from the specialist engineering division. This was despite a 16 per cent fall in the division's turnover, from Pounds 43.3m to Pounds 36.2m. Property development incurred a loss of Pounds 104,000 following an Pounds 87,000 deficit the previous year. Profits from Trakway, which provides portable aluminium roadways for construction sites, exhibitions and pop concerts, dipped from Pounds 786,000 to Pounds 656,000.</p>

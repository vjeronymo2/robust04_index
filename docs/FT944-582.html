			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Sport: Underdog that does not bite - Cricket / Simon Hughes argues that Britain's teams can learn to stop losing You would never know from the dreadful recent performances of some of Britain's national teams that the British invented most of the world's main sports. Between 1860 and 1885 the British codified almost two dozen games. The country's diligent colonists launched them on the dirt tracks and dust bowls of the Empire. But now, in team sports at least, Britain teeters on the brink of a precipice. Its footballers failed to reach the finals of the World Cup. In hockey, cricket and rugby league, British teams are no match for the Australians. The England cricket team on tour in Australia lost twice to Australia's cricket academy and was beaten in a one-day international by the part-timers from Zimbabwe last week. In due course the dictionary writers might decide to list 'England Test Collapse' as all one word. Whenever England's cricketers take the field, they do so more in hope than expectation. They seem to be caught in the downward spiral with the echo of a laughing Kangaroo in their ears. Losing has become a cycle that is hard to reverse. But it can be done. Australia suffered the same disease in the mid-1980s and took action. It invested hugely in setting up the Australian Institute of Sport, realising that sport had become a science. It established schools of excellence, employed specialists and drilled home the ethic of winning even in primary schools. Practice became fun rather than a chore and the Japanese philosophy of Kai Zen (constant improvement) coursed through competitors veins. As a result the familiar brawny bravado of Australian teams has been replaced by clinical efficiency and a remorseless zeal. 'Winning is the science of being totally prepared,' said Dr Peter Terry, a sports psychologist at the West London Institute. It is a message some British teams are not heed-ing. In sport boardrooms there are some dyed-in-the-wool attitudes among the ageing policy makers. Other countries move forward, embracing new concepts and approaches, Britain does not. A strange gene in the British make up produces a distaste for striving too hard - it is better to hold something back than go for broke. The absurd 'We didn't need that in my day,' rejection of new methods is rolled out as a reason to stick with the status quo. Look at coaching. Keith Fletcher, a suburban personality whose lack of adventure worked within the domesticity of county cricket, administered the same inane warm-up routine for 99 consecutive days during England's tour of the Caribbean last winter. During his reign England have won four Tests and lost 13, but he will almost certainly see out the other half of his five-year contract. The former England batsman Bob Woolmer, whose meticulous preparation and brilliant man-management transformed Warwickshire, has been lured to mastermind South Africa's re-emergence. Dave Alred, an American football coach, helped the England rugby union fly-half Rob Andrew to kicking perfection against Canada a fortnight ago, but received the cold shoulder from Twickenham. Australia have hired him. These sports are run by unwieldy committees made up largely of non-sportsmen or people who played the game 20 years ago. They are out of touch. For the last two months Ray Illingworth, the chairman of England's cricket selectors, has not even been in the same hemisphere as the team. He says he is in Bradford rather than Brisbane because of his restricted contract. In the long term, reform has to start with school sport. In the short term, Dr Terry has a few suggestions. 'You've got to create positive vibes, England prepared for the West Indies tour by watching videos of a previous series when batsmen were ducking and weaving and taking painful blows on the body. That put them immediately in a tentative state of mind. I have encouraged players like Graham Gooch to look at film of themselves dominating a particular opponent and they seem to have found it helpful. I don't advocate abandoning traditional methods of preparation, but you can always add to them.' In cricket's old fashioned environment video analysis and psychological enhancement are not seen as important. Dr Terry's official association with England has ended. The Australians use every trick at their disposal to undermine visitors. Immediately before the first Test in Brisbane, England played in chilly Tasmania. Their preparation for the one-day international series involved a match on a cabbage patch in Canberra against a team of local civil servants. Mike Atherton admitted he had not seen the itinerary before they left. When touring teams visit England they receive cosy warm-up matches and a conveniently planned fixture list. They are allowed into the nets at Lord's before the England players. The British cosset opponents. This approach percolates on to the field. Recently, Nelson Mandela said: 'I was brought up in a British school and at the time Britain was the home of everything that was the best in the world.' Britain's sports have a glorious past. The trouble is, some of its sports administrators are still living in it.</p>

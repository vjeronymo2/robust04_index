It has  established economic and technological cooperation with more  than 70 countries and regions and enjoys a good reputation for  its top-quality service.    As reported, the corporation has satisfactorily completed  contracts for launching Asian, Australian, Pakistani, and  Swedish satellites. Now it has started carrying out a number of  contracts for launching international commercial satellites.    Now the corporation is manufacturing the Dongfanghong [East  Is Red] No. 3, a high-capacity telecommunications and broadcast  satellite; the Fengyun [Storm] No. 2, a geostationary  meteorological satellite; and the Ziyuan [Resource] No. 1, a  multipurpose earth resources satellite. A large number of  telecommunications satellites and meteorological satellites will  go into operation soon. The Chengzheng [Long March] No. 3, a  carrier rocket with low-temperarure, high-energy fuel, has  emerged. The Changzheng carrier rocket series is taking on a  development pattern of systematization, generalization, and  standardization. It can meet domestic needs better and provide  a wider field of service for the international market.    In recent years the corporation has stepped up use of  spaceflight technological achievements to serve the national  economy. The output value of its civilian products has  increased at an annual rate of 34 percent. Through developing  its three main products -- satellites, cars and their  components, as well as computers--the corporation is making  efforts to improve the quality of its civilian products, expand  their scale, and improve their economic results. In the near  future, the corporation will turn a number of projects with  prominent spaceflight characteristics and major influence on  social progress into civilian products, such as developing a  satellite information system, a mobile telecommunications  subscriber's station system, and a global television  transmission system for civilian purposes.</p>

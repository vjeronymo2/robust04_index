			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Sweden acts to shore up shaky financial system THE SWEDISH government will introduce legislation this autumn designed to protect the country's financial system and secure credit supplies, it announced yesterday. With Sweden's banks facing estimated credit losses totalling SKr90bn (Pounds 9.5bn) over the next five years, contingency action by the state is seen as vital to safeguard their activities. The legislation will involve a state guarantee to underpin commercial banks and their subsidiaries and also other credit institutions, including the building societies which have a government affiliation. The Finance Ministry said the aim was to reassure households, enterprises and other holders of claims that their finances will be safe, by creating a framework for the functioning of the banks and their subsidiaries. The cost of this rescue plan has not been revealed. 'The aim is to secure credit facilities and make it possible to finance housing', said Mr Bo Lundgren, tax minister. 'It will also strengthen overseas confidence in the whole of the financial system.' The government's commitment would remain as long as necessary and when it was phased out it would be done in such a way as not jeopardise the interests of creditors, he said. Housing interest rates fell yesterday as a result. The proposals reflect government anxiety at the continuing deterioration in the position of Sweden's financial sector. Three days ago Standard and Poor's, the US credit agency, placed 13 of Sweden's leading financial institutions under review for possible downgrade. The state has already been forced to intervene this year to save Nordbanken with SKr20bn worth of grants and guarantees and Forsta Sparbanken with SKr7.3bn and more recently the Gota Bank, a rescue plan for which is still being worked out. The government is worried that other banks and financial institutions will also need financial support in the coming months if they are to avoid collapse. Mr Lundgren said that he did not rule out direct state ownership of a bank if this was necessary.</p>

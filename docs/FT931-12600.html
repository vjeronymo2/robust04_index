			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian farm sector to get emergency support MR VIKTOR Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, has signed a resolution on emergency support for Russia's struggling farm sector and proposed an overhaul of the system of subsidies, according to the Itar-Tass news agency, Reuter reports from Moscow. The document proposed granting low-interest credits to farm producers and raised the possibility of writing off debts incurred by agricultural companies to finance capital investment. CIS television said the programme would add Rbs160bn (Dollars 281m) to the Russian budget. It quoted Mr Alexander Rutskoi, the vice president, as saying that Russia would also allocate Dollars 250m to build new processing facilities for agricultural products, but gave no details. Tass said subsidies, including half their fuel expenses, would be paid to cattle-breeders who sold their livestock to the state. Subsidies of 50 per cent would also be paid on all types of fuel and energy used for heating and for transport of fodder for farms which suffered drought or other natural disasters in 1992. The resolution said direct subsidising of producers should be replaced during 1993 by subsidising of goods in the form of guaranteed prices for basic products. The volume of subsidies would be cut gradually. The pro-market government is trying to implement sweeping changes in the chronically inefficient farm sector by breaking up large collective farms and encouraging private farms to start up. But farmers are clamouring for more government support, arguing in particular that loans are too expensive.</p>

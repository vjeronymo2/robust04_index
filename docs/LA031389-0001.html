He  became the first high-ranking politician to corroborate a statement by the  government's chief prosecutor, Jan Danielsson, that a number of top Swedish  officials were bugged during the so far futile police hunt for the killer of  former Prime Minister Olof Palme, slain in 1986. "I know I have been bugged.  But I have good reason not to tell you when it happened or whether it was  during my time as foreign minister," Andersson told reporters. Police Chief  Bjorn Eriksson denied that police had bugged the foreign minister. "Nobody in  the police force is bugging anybody," he said.  </P></p>

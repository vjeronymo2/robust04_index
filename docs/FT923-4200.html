			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Poland begins heavy wheat imports POLAND HAS bought 500,000 tonnes of wheat abroad and further imports this year could go as high as 2.5m tonnes in the wake of the country's drought-ridden harvest. Latest official estimates put this year's grain crop at 21.2m tonnes or 24 per cent less than last year. The shortfall has already pushed up grain and meat prices and retail food prices threaten to grow by 20 per cent in the coming months. Indeed prices being asked for grain by farmers in some parts of the country have already outstripped world market levels. The present grain purchase has been made in the European Community by the state run Food Market Agency to boost government reserve stocks. A 40 per cent drop in this year's potato crop down to 17m tonnes will also affect pork output in the coming months. The Solidarity Farmers' Union has called on the government to provide aid for farmers in the worst hit areas in western and northern Poland as well as subsidised credits and tax deferments until the end of 1993. This year's grain shortage comes after three years of declining fertiliser and pesticide usage as real farming incomes have fallen. This year the number of hectares sown with grain fell for the first time by 4.6 per cent to 8.3m hectares.</p>

			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TROOPS FIRE INTO CROWDS IN ROMANIA;  </P> <P> EAST BLOC: DESPITE REPORTS OF BRUTAL REPRESSION AND NUMEROUS DEATHS,  DEMONSTRATORS CONTINUE TO DEMAND AN END TO CEAUSESCU'S RULE.  </P> <P> Security forces armed with automatic weapons fired into crowds of protesters in  the Romanian capital of Bucharest on Thursday, killing or wounding an  undetermined number of demonstrators demanding an end to the rule of dictator  Nicolae Ceausescu.  </P> <P> A reporter for Tanjug, the Yugoslav news agency, said several thousand  demonstrators, mainly schoolchildren and university students, were surrounded  by police and tanks at a main intersection near the Inter-Continental Hotel in  the center of Bucharest. Peter Tomic, a Yugoslav journalist, said he saw an  armored vehicle crush two students. When others rushed to their aid, security  forces opened fire, killing or wounding about 20 people.  </P> <P> In Washington, the State Department quoted U. S. Embassy officials in Bucharest  as saying that at least 13 young people had been killed in the demonstration  just two blocks from the embassy. Budapest Radio reported 32 more demonstrators  were killed in the northern city of Cluj.  </P> <P> The Soviet news agency Tass reported at midnight that the sounds of gunfire  from automatic weapons could still be heard echoing in the center of the  capital.  </P> <P> "There is light in all the windows of buildings in the areas where the  demonstrations are under way. People have come out onto balconies and some of  them are shouting slogans supporting the protests," the report added.  </P> <P> Reports on the second assault on unarmed civilians in five days came mostly  from such East Bloc news organizations, among the few foreign news services  reporting from Romania, which has been sealed off to foreigners since Monday,  as the Ceausescu regime faced what could be its terminal crisis after 24 years  in power.  </P> <P> Gunfire was also reported to have broken out at a demonstration in the city of  Arad in western Romania, about 40 miles from the western city of Timisoara,  where security forces opened fire on demonstrators Sunday. Estimates of the  death toll in Timisoara range from a few hundred to as high as 4,000, but there  has been no independent confirmation of the casualties. Even East Bloc  journalists, attempting to reach Timisoara, have been turned back from the  town.  </P> <P> The Tanjug correspondent, reporting on Belgrade Radio, said the confrontation  in Bucharest had turned into a "bloody riot."  </P> <P> Before its midnight report, Tass said, "Along the central street of the  capital, tanks are moving, following the lines of submachine gunners pushing  back the crowds. Bursts of automatic weapons fire are being heard.  Panic-stricken people are hiding in doorways and courtyards."  </P> <P> Tass added that "a great many fire brigade trucks and military trucks with  personnel are being concentrated in the central part of the Romanian capital,"  and approaches to Communist Party headquarters and Ceausescu's presidential  palace were blocked by heavily armed army units.  </P> <P> Tass reported that students had gathered late into the night on the grounds of  the university and had called for a general strike today. It said the students  claimed to have sent representatives to factories to urge workers to join the  strike. It added that anti-government leaflets have appeared on walls in the  city.  </P> <P> Ceausescu, 71, whose disregard of human rights has ranked him among the most  notorious dictators on the globe, told Romanians in a speech Wednesday night  that the demonstrations in Timisoara were inspired by "fascists" and  "international espionage centers."  </P> <P> He issued no warnings about further action against demonstrations, but defended  the actions of security forces in Timisoara.  </P> <P> With the country so effectively sealed off, accounts of the Timisoara events  have come only at a trickle and are of uncertain reliability. But some of them  begin to suggest that Ceausescu may be facing a problem in keeping army and  police units loyal to his cause.  </P> <P> A Yugoslav newspaper reported that a truck driver, returning to Yugoslavia from  Timisoara, said security officers publicly executed soldiers who refused to  shoot at the demonstrators. He did not say when the executions took place, or  how many people were involved.  </P> <P> Two other sources reported that the demonstrators in Timisoara managed to take  control of at least two tanks during the protests. A woman resident of  Timisoara, whose taped interview was broadcast on Hungarian television  Wednesday night, said protesters seized at least five tanks. Armored units then  opened fire on the captured tanks, she said.  </P> <P> According to one Austrian physician, who was visiting relatives in the western  city and who spoke with the Romanian section of Radio Free Europe, the  demonstrations started last Saturday when protesters broke shop windows, looted  stores, attacked the local government center and burned books written by  Ceausescu.  </P> <P> The demonstrations continued Sunday, when large forces of heavily armed  security troops arrived with tanks and armored personnel carriers. Throughout  the day, the tension mounted steadily, until about 8 p.m., when, the witness  said, he found himself among ranks of demonstrators confronting the security  forces. His account goes on:  </P> <P> "Suddenly, machine guns and shotguns started rattling. In a few seconds, 30-40  people fell in front of me, wounded or dead. . . .  </P> <P> "The crowds tried to withdraw. But the thousands at the back were advancing,  chanting slogans. So that, to our astonishment, the rows were allowed to pass,  moving toward the center of the town by the thousands. . . .  </P> <P> "Afterwards, the riot in the center of the town was in full swing. Shops were  set on fire. Slogans were chanted. The mood was that of a national holiday.  </P> <P> "The machine guns and shotguns kept rattling until 4 o'clock in the morning.  Hundreds upon hundreds of wounded and dead were carried to the nearby  hospitals. . . . Toward 4 o'clock, many people had withdrawn. There had been a  great many wounded. There were heaps of dead and blood all over the place.  </P> <P> "Early next day, the city was relatively quiet. But tanks, soldiers, militia  men were everywhere. Thousands of people stood around bewildered, dumbfounded .  . . .  </P> <P> International condemnation of the Ceausescu regime continued to grow Thursday,  isolating him from even his East Bloc allies.  </P> <P> The Hungarian government revoked its 1948 friendship treaty with Romania, as  the Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Horn rejected Ceausescu's charges that  Hungary had helped to incite the unrest in Romania. However, Horn said Hungary  would not break diplomatic relations with Bucharest, in the interest of  offering at least some assistance to the 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians living  in Romania.  </P> <P> The Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry summoned the Romanian ambassador to register  its displeasure. The evening news in Prague opened with the sound of gunfire in  Bucharest and reports of protesters chanting slogans and singing patriotic  songs.  </P> <P> In Poland, the parliament and the government newspaper issued denunciations of  the Romanian government's use of violence against protesters.  </P> <P> In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called on Romania to  "cease the brutal repression of the Romanian people," reopen its sealed borders  and observe its international treaties on human rights.  </P> <P> State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the United States has tried  repeatedly but failed to deliver a formal protest. The U.S. ambassador to  Romania, Alan Green, had been turned away repeatedly and Deputy Secretary of  State Lawrence S. Eagleburger had been rebuffed in his efforts to invite the  Romanian ambassador in Washington to a meeting Wednesday.  </P> <P> "We have summoned the Romanian ambassador to come to the department tomorrow  (today) to receive our protest," Boucher added.  </P> <P> The United States also said it will re-evaluate its trade relations with  Romania, with which it does about $300 million a year.  </P> <P> Only China, which last June dealt with its own pro-democracy demonstrations  with the same force now being used by the Ceausescu regime, refrained from  criticism, calling the Romanian events an "internal matter."  </P> <P> On a visit to East Berlin, French President Francois Mitterrand described the  Ceausescu government as "a regime of personal, family power that has no honest  reason to remain. I think that the days of this regime, in a Europe full of  movement, are numbered. But at what price?"  </P> <P> The price could get even higher if Ceausescu, backed by his widely despised  wife Elena and about 50 members of his family placed in key positions  throughout the government, remains determined to use force.  </P> <P> The East German army, according to a report on ADN, the East German news  service, appealed Thursday to Romanian soldiers to refrain from using arms  against their fellow citizens. The appeal points to an issue that must now be a  primary Ceausescu concern: How far can the loyalties of his security forces and  military be pushed?  </P> <P> In recent years, Ceausescu has carefully weeded out the higher echelons of the  military to eliminate any officers whose devotion to his service might be  suspect. Diplomatic analysts say that officers who received military training  in the Soviet Union were among those shunted aside. One of Ceausescu's  brothers, Ilie, is a general and the deputy defense minister. Another, Nicolae  Andruta, is a police general and deputy interior minister.  </P> <P> In recent months, there have been vague and unconfirmed rumors of discontent  among the army's officer corps, but, in a country whose key institutions are  riddled by security department agents, the existence of an anti-Ceausescu cabal  has always seemed unlikely.  </P> <P> But it also seems unlikely that the Romanian military would be able to sustain  for very long Ceausescu's policy of shooting into crowds of fellow citizens.  </P> <P> It was also uncertain whether protesters would continue to defy the security  forces in obvious risk of their lives in order to dislodge the Ceausescu  dynasty. Thursday's demonstrators in Bucharest were undeterred even though they  were aware of the blood bath reported in Timisoara.  </P> <P> The Bucharest protest began with a small crowd of young people who were  immediately joined by hundreds of others marching to a pro-government rally,  where Ceausescu was speaking to a crowd of factory workers, bused in for a show  of support, according to Tanjug.  </P> <P> Ceausescu's speech was being broadcast on the radio, but Tanjug said the  transmission was interrupted as the demonstrators approached the rally site.  The protesters, defying security agents who rushed forward to photograph them,  began to hoot and shout at Ceausescu. Then his speech was interrupted by what  sounded like a piercing scream.  </P> <P> For about three minutes, the radio played patriotic music, then resumed  Ceausescu's speech in mid-sentence.  </P> <P> LITHUANIA CRISIS -- Gorbachev tells "concern and alarm" over republic.

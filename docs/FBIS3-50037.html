Prime Minister Meksi brought up numerous reasons for the  necessity of bilateral cooperation in all fields. He asked for  an expeditious start to real work either through joint  commissions or contacts at various levels by government  officials and experts.    Mr. Meksi stressed that Greece, as EC chairman, needs to  directly engage itself in the direction of Albania, so as to  include Albania in the projects of this development institution,  especially in the big transportation program.    Papandoniou called the spirit of relations between both  countries excellent, and stressed the good level of political  relations. He brought a message of friendship to Albanian Prime  Minister Meksi from Greek Prime Minister Papandreou, wishing a  move from stationary climate into concrete results.    Further, he focused on EC projects to revive the European  economy and expressed the desire that a segment of the program  finds space in our region and that both countries profit from  this big project.    Welcoming the Greek party's proposal, Mr. Meksi expressed  the  desire to immediately and expeditiously start their  implementation.</p>

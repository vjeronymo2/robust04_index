			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks are recorded] </F>   [Excerpts] This afternoon NATO aircraft attacked Serb  positions near the eastern Bosnian town of Gorazde for the  second time in 24 hours. [passage omitted]    In the N-TV "Newspunkt" program, Bosnian Prime Minister  Haris  Silajdzic commented on the NATO air strikes on Serb positions.    [Haris Silajdzic, in English, with superimposed German  translation] "The principle is right but unfortunately it is not  enough. This is not enough of a deterrent. Unfortunately there  was too much hesitation, and then when finally intervention  came, it was only half-hearted. Although we really welcome the  work of NATO and the United Nations, it is still not enough. I  think a not very strong message was sent there, not strong  enough."    [Announcer] To the question of what more had to be done,  Silajdzic told N-TV:    [Silajdzic] "As far as I know, two or three tanks were  destroyed in these attacks. Serb soldiers, however, destroyed  far more than 10 Bosnian tanks and the people in them. The  lesson is not yet hard enough. A clear lesson would be to  destroy all the Serbs' tanks, that is the only way. A clear  message would be to lift the arms embargo against the Bosnians.  As you know we have been denied this so far. The international  community owes us this, however. Then we can deal with our own  defense. Let us defend ourselves and we will do it ourselves."</p>

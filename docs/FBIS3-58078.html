Belgium,  it is being said in diplomatic circles, is giving priority to  not supplying ammunition to the ultranationalist opposition to  Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Boris Yeltsin himself has  already expressed his opposition to any eastward expansion of  NATO.    The countries of Central Europe cannot expect much more from  the declaration to be made by the NATO summit than a general  statement to the effect that NATO may be extended at a later  date. That will come as a disappointment to the so-called  Visegrad countries (Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and  Slovakia), which are pressing for a clearer commitment.    According to senior Belgian diplomats, NATO must do  everything within its power to prevent any heightening of  Russian feelings of inferiority and isolation. To this end, a  clear decision made now on any expansion of NATO would be  counterproductive.    Like the United States, Belgian diplomats find that "drawing  new dividing lines" would do nothing to consolidate stability in  East Europe.    According to diplomatic sources, the main problem facing the  countries in Central and East Europe is not one of military  insecurity, but one of internal social stability. Awarding them  NATO membership, they say, would do nothing to change this.    The diplomats believe that the "logical and harmonious" road  ahead for the countries of Central and East Europe consists of  first gaining membership for the European Union, then also for  the Western European Union (WEU) and thus for the European  pillar of NATO.    Senior U.S. officials reiterated yesterday that the door to  NATO would remain closed for the foreseeable future. Strobe  Talbott, Bill Clinton's special adviser on Russian affairs,  admitted that U.S. reticence was prompted by the concern not to  stir up "ultranationalist sentiments in Russia."    U.S. President Bill Clinton, who will start off his first  visit to Europe with a two-day stay in Brussels for the NATO  summit, will then move on to Prague to convince the Visegrad  countries of the sympathy and appreciation of the United States  and NATO. In this connection, Belgian diplomats are saying that  diplomatic efforts will be required to reassure these countries  of the fact that NATO is not subjecting them to a "veto" imposed  by Moscow.</p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992 (The Manifestos): Tories top the quango count  -Ballot Box Even making allowances for the way you count, the Tories easily outstrip Labour in their list of proposed quangos published in the party manifestos yesterday. A quango is a quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisation. Mrs Margaret Thatcher didn't like them very much. John Major obviously does. For the new model Labour party they seem a natural way of avoiding overt interventionism while keeping some questions open. They were prominent in much of the party's pre-manifesto literature. Still, the Tories have taken the lead. On a minimum count the Conservatives are offering 21 and Labour 14. The Tory count would go even higher if offshoots from the Citizen's Charter were included. No less than 18 charters have been published since the white paper a year ago. It is not quite clear how far these should be counted as quangos, though they will involve some measure of quasi-autonomous bureaucracy. Among the genuinely new quangos, the Conservatives are offering a task force to counter school truancy, a new body called Scottish National Heritage to be supplemented by a new Scottish Environ-mental Protection Agency, and a Welsh Economic Council. Labour's proposals include a Food Standards Agency, transport safety inspectorate, judicial appointments commission and children's commissioner. Whoever wins, there should be jobs all round for those who like to serve on committees.</p>

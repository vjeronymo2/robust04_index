			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): Tackling the 'surplus' problem - Advance Corporation Tax THE immediate impact of the change in Advance Corporation Tax will be to cut the ACT paid on a dividend of Pounds 100 from the present Pounds 33.3 to Pounds 26.87 in 1993-94 and to Pounds 23.35 in the tax year beginning in April 1994. Companies which pay dividends out of UK profits will not be significantly affected by these changes. The major change will be to those companies which pay dividends out of profits they have earned outside the UK. Until now those companies have had to pay ACT on those dividends, but since they have had no UK corporation tax to pay on them - because in most cases they will be fully taxed in the country where they were earned - they cannot offset them. Since ACT is not repayable, the surplus ACT is effectively a dividend tax. It is now proposed that dividends paid out of foreign profits - a foreign income dividend, or FID - will still carry an ACT burden, but that ACT will now be recoverable from the Inland Revenue if the company cannot offset it against UK profits. This will be of great help to these companies, and will significantly reduce their tax burden. A consultative document will be issued on this proposal. This means that the relief will not be introduced this year, and also implies that nothing is being done to enable the many companies affected to recover the surplus ACT they have already paid. It may not be of benefit to all their shareholders however. A UK tax payer will be deemed to have paid income tax at 20 per cent on FIDs. Basic rate taxpayers will pay no more tax on FIDs. Higher rate UK tax payers will pay an additional 20 per cent tax. However, the deemed income tax will not be available for repayment to non-taxpayers, such as pension funds, nor to overseas shareholders who are currently able to claim a credit from the UK under tax treaties with the UK. If this plan goes ahead, companies that pay FIDs may find their shares become less attractive to overseas shareholders. The existing rules have been a major disincentive to the setting up of UK-based foreign-owned holding companies, say, to act as regional headquarters for group companies in Europe. Instead, these companies have been established elsewhere in Europe, to the detriment of the UK exchequer. It is proposed that if agreement of the proposals is delayed beyond the end of 1993, special rules will be introduced in 1994 to cover just those companies. In the meantime, the chancellor has moved to close a loophole exploited by companies which have tried to use their surplus ACT by selling it to other companies which are able to use it.

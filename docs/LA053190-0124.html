			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SAN MARINO;  </P> <P> BUILDING TENTATIVELY OKD  </P> <P> The Planning Commission has tentatively approved construction of a two-story,  8,000-square-foot financial office building at Huntington Drive and Granada  Avenue.  </P> <P> It postponed a final decision on the building's design pending a review by the  city's Design Review Committee.  </P> <P> The City Council has placed restrictions on new or expanding stock brokerage  and real estate firms. But a spokesman for Trusty Associates, an Alhambra-based  financial services firm that will occupy the building, said the company will  not function as a brokerage house. Trusty spokesman Anthony Chang said most of  the 25 employees will be brokers acting as financial advisers.  </P> <P> "This site will be used primarily for research purposes," added Philip Yao,  spokesman for M. C. Y. Development Co., which owns the property.  </P></p>

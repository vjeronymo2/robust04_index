			<p>BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 16 Jun (EFE) -- Cuban President  Fidel Castro believes that the entrance of Cubans into embassies  and consulates in Havana does not constitute "any type of  political problem."    In statements to Radio Cadena Nacional (RCN), from Cartagena  de Indias, where he attended the Fourth Ibero-American Summit of  Chiefs of State and Government, Castro said "the principal cause  is that the people want to emigrate."    Dozens of Cubans have entered the Belgian and German  diplomatic and consular missions in the Cuban capital in the  past few days requesting "political asylum."    "They do so," Castro told RCN, "to promote illegal  departures  from the country and to promote incidents in order to reap  political dividends." He added that "in our country, whoever  wants to leave can do so."</p>

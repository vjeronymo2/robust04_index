			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Yakovlev, the Russian president's </F> newly appointed representative to the Federal Assembly, by  Yelena Dikun in the "Presentation" column: "The New  Plenipotentiary Representative Has No Excessive Ambitions. At  Least No Political Ambitions"; place and date not given]    [Text] The well-known lawyer, Professor Aleksandr  Yakovlev, has been appointed the Russian Federation president's  plenipotentiary representative in the Federal Assembly. In the  former parliament the president was represented first by State  Secretary Gennadiy Burbulis, then State Legal Directorate chief  Sergey Shakhray, and finally State Legal Directorate Deputy  Chief Anatoliy Sliva. All three did this duty while continuing  to work in their regular jobs, failing to achieve any particular  success in consolidating the president's cooperation with the  Supreme Soviet. How does the president's new envoy envision his  role?    [Yakovlev] First of all, what is involved is not one  representative but the creation of the president's  representative institution constantly interacting with the  Federal Assembly. In my charge will be a special service with  20 to 30 employees, mainly jurists. Our work will be centered  on ensuring the smooth passage of draft laws submitted by the  president. We shall not just present them for the parliament's  consideration, as was the case before, but supplement them with  the requisite comments or organize discussions on them.    Furthermore, I hope that with time the service of the  plenipotentiary representative will be used by the Federal  Assembly as a feedback channel through which deputies will be  able to make their proposals or complaints known to the  president. To prevent the separation of powers from turning  into a new "confrontation of the branches," it is necessary to  set up constructive interaction at all working levels, including  ours. This is where I see my task. Concrete materialization  will always depend on the initiatives which the constitution has  granted the president with respect to parliament.    [Dikun] Although you are a well-known lawyer, up to now no  high posts have been offered to you. Lately, if I am not  mistaken, you have been working in the United States. Why did  they suddenly remember you in the Kremlin?    [Yakovlev] Indeed, recently I have been delivering a course  of lectures at Emory University in Atlanta; it was devoted to  our domestic affairs: the evolution of Russian  constitutionality. Then, presidential administration chief  Sergey Filatov offered me this post. It is hard for me to judge  the motives, but it is very important that I collaborate with  Filatov because we have worked together on the new draft  constitution and we are on the same wavelength.    [Dikun] Your predecessors in this post, Burbulis and  Shakhray, had reputations as being conflict prone. They did not  manage to establish good contacts with the parliament. Do you  believe in your good luck?    [Yakovlev] At any rate, I will try to establish rapport. I  am a fairly flexible man and, what is most important, I believe  that law serves equally all political forces acting within the  framework of the legitimate constitution. Moreover, I have no  personal power ambitions or any ulterior political super-task.    [Dikun] Your new duties are largely similar to diplomatic  ones. You will have to smooth out the rough edges that may  emerge in relations between the president and parliament, and  sometimes act in the role of the president's advocate....    [Yakovlev] Legally no such duties have been assigned to me  and everything here will depend on the president's articulated  intention. Only he can empower me for such actions. Of course,  whatever I do, I shall proceed from the presumption of  constitutionality of the president's actions. It is another  matter if I am asked to support a particular initiative or  proposal which in my opinion is not justified by constitutional  norms: In that event I will immediately tender my resignation  and go back to the Institute of State and Law, where I have some  very interesting work to do.</p>

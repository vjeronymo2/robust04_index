Unfortunately,  the attempts to place the "Wake Shield" satellite in orbit ended  in failure. Sergey Krikalev was going to work with the  satellite, which had been carried in the cargo bay.    The satellite was to have moved to a distance of 75 km from  the space shuttle. At that distance, with no microgravitation  at all and no effect from the station's exhaust gases, there  would have been an experiment to grow extremely pure  semiconductor films for new-generation computers. But the  guidance system of the manipulator, which would have been used  to move the satellite, turned out to be faulty.    This failure is very regrettable, since this faulty  manipulator will be used to assemble the components of the  "Alfa" international station when it is created. After many  attempts the astronauts did manage to obtain seven laminated  electronic components of reasonable quality in the satellite  factory, but they were not as fine as had been expected.    According to the U.S. specialists, Sergey Krikalev performed  very well, despite the relative failure of the main experiment.  Any aberrations in the operation of the vehicle were instantly  eliminated by our engineer.    In a year's time a second Russian cosmonaut -- Colonel  Vladimir Titov -- will fly in the shuttle. During this flight  the shuttle will approach our "Mir" station for the first time  and Titov will perform a spacewalk. A docking between "Mir" and  the shuttle is planned for spring 1995. Incidentally, this week  U.S. astronauts Norman Thagard, 51, and Bonnie Dunbar, 45 (wife  of astronaut Ronald Sega, who was on the "Discovery" flight),  started training sessions at the Cosmonaut Training Center near  Moscow. The long flight by a U.S. astronaut on the Russian  "Mir" station is to begin on 1 March 1995.</p>

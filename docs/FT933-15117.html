			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Not over until all the fat ladies sing: Why does the Uruguay Round matter? Martin Wolf explains what the trade agreement in Tokyo might mean By the way, Martin,' remarked the deputy editor, 'we want a feature for the Saturday paper on what the Tokyo trade deal will mean. You know, who the losers and who the gainers will be, that sort of thing.' I blenched. 'In the first place,' I explained pedantically, 'we don't even know what has been agreed. In the second place, they are still far from a conclusion to the Uruguay Round. In the third place, nobody knows what such a trade deal means quantitatively.' 'What about the British officials who say it could produce 400,000 jobs in the UK over the next 13 years? Where did they get that figure from?' 'Heaven knows,' I replied. 'Increased trade generates additional economic welfare. Its impact on employment depends on what you assume about real wage flexibility, and so on.' 'What are you saying? That figures like that are simply made up?' 'Yes and no. They are made up, but pseudo-scientifically.' 'Well, what about Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative,' persisted the deputy editor? 'He said it was the 'biggest tariff-cutting agreement in history' and claimed a successful trade round would create an extra 1.4m jobs in the US over 10 years and 2m over 13 years.' 'That's no proof, I'm afraid. For a person who prides himself on his resistance to 'trade theology', Mr Kantor is getting mystical. Did you notice that 600,000 of these extra jobs are supposed to come more than 10 years from now? Who knows what might happen by then?' Irritation began to break through the deputy editor's calm demeanour. 'Anyway,' he insisted, 'we want a feature. Go and talk to the features editor about it.' Thus admonished, I went. 'Yes,' that formidable personage remarked in her most head-mistressly manner. 'You must tell readers what this deal might mean. But remember they are bored silly by this Gatt business. So make it imaginative, even amusing. And no ifs, buts or footnotes. You know what the editor thinks about footnotes. 'What are you going to say,' she demanded? 'Well,' I replied, 'the first point is that it's not over until the fat ladies sing in harmony. They have many difficult decisions to reach between now and next December, when renewal of Mr Clinton's 'fast track' authority runs out.' 'What's a fast-track authority? Come on, Martin, leave out the technicalities, for once. Imagine you're trying to explain what you mean to your elderly uncle.' 'A fast-track authority,' I explained patiently, 'means that Congress can only vote for or against the agreement as a whole. It cannot destroy it by amendments.' 'Well, what does still have to be done?' 'The first thing is to obtain concessions from the other participants in the Uruguay Round to match those made by Canada, the European Community, Japan and the US. Probably the most sensitive issue will be tariffs on textiles and clothing. There will also have to be a multilateral steel agreement, to reduce distorting subsidies. Japan and South Korea will have to accept liberalisation of rice imports and France will have to agree to last year's farm trade deal with the US or to be overruled on the issue.' 'Could the French veto the deal?' 'Strictly speaking, it has no veto. The question is whether other EC member states will be prepared to outvote France. Much depends on Helmut Kohl. 'Then there is trade in services,' I continued. 'The Japanese and Koreans have to liberalise financial services, like banking, while the US wants the Europeans to liberalise audio-visual services.' 'There you go again. What does that mean?' 'It means Hollywood's right to flood the globe with pap,' I replied. 'For once, the French have a point. Unfortunately, much more is left to be decided in services than just these tricky issues. I pressed on. 'Apart from services, there is also doubt about whether an integrated disputes mechanism will be established within the proposed new multilateral trade organisation (MTO). Given the hostility to that idea of environmentalists and other pressure groups, particularly in the US, the MTO may share the fate of the International Trade Organisation, which perished on its way to the US Congress in the late-1940s.' 'Stop,' she shrieked. 'We already know the round may never be finished. Our readers need to know what the round would mean if it were finished.' 'Well, among the winners would be exporters of farm produce, such as Argentina, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Thailand and other members of the 'Cairns group'.' I noticed the features editor was ostentatiously filing her nails, but ignored her. 'Anyway, one should not exaggerate the difference this deal might make. Farm trade liberalisation would only begin with the Uruguay Round. More important than the actual liberalisation might be the ceiling it would put on any future increases in farm subsidies. Exporters of clothing from developing countries would gain too, but not all. Chinese exports would be the main beneficiary. Some developing countries are protected by the bilateral quotas of the MFA and would lose if it were liberalised. Efficient steel producers should benefit, wherever they are located. This is not a north-south issue. Competitive steel producers are found everywhere. 'Industrial country producers of pharmaceuticals, recorded music, videos, computer software and books, all of whom should obtain more effective patent and copyright protection, would also make substantial gains. 'US and British companies expect to do well in services, particularly financial services, but France, too, wouyld be in a strong position. Financial service providers like American Express have been among the most influential US supporters of the Uruguay Round. If they do not get what they hope for, there may not be enough support in Congress to pass the package. 'Another high potential export sector for some industrial countries is telecommunications. The economic pressure for liberalisation is very strong, which means the Uruguay round may not make much difference. But big US suppliers, along with companies like BT, should gain. The traditional PTTs are likely to come under huge pressure. New cross-border and cross-industry alliances seem certain. 'Losers are simply the mirror-image of the gainers: highly protected farmers, makers of labour-intensive manufactures in high wage countries and, more generally, producers who need their protection to survive.' 'Isn't it possible to be more precise than that? 'Not really,' I replied. 'You have to remember that tariff reductions are to be phased in over five years. after ratification. Liberalisation of the MFA is due to take 10 years, with the bulk of that liberalisation towards the end. Nobody can really tell what might happen to world trade in clothing by 2003.' The features editor pulled a 'what wishy-washy features I have to put up with' kind of a face. 'Can't you say something about employment,' she pleaded? 'I am glad you asked that,' I replied. 'Fortunately, the first thing Peter Sutherland, the Gatt's new director-general, asked from his staff was an analysis of the link between trade and jobs. They made the important point that 'the jobs and trade debate is not a debate about jobs, but about which jobs'. 'Rich countries would exchange low paying jobs in import-competing industry for higher paying jobs in export-related industry. Over the last few years, the most dynamic markets for industrial country exporters have been China, the Middle East and Latin America. In fact, between 1986 and 1990, virtually all job growth in US manufacturing was in exports, while a recent study by the US trade representative's office found that workers in export-related jobs earn 17 per cent more than the average US worker. So trade liberalisation is how rich countries will get more of the 'good jobs' that president Clinton wants. Meanwhile, poorer countries would obtain more jobs for each unit of investment. So both sides would gain, which is what trade is all about. 'Is that all there is to say?' 'Not at all,' I replied, warming to the theme. 'If exports of manufactures from developing countries continue to grow at their recent pace, the ultimate effect might well be an increase in wage inequality in rich countries, other things being equal, but less inequality in poor countries. Industrial countries would have to find imaginative ways to deal with the problem. It would be disgraceful to make the poverty of developing countries an excuse for policies that keep them poor. 'But the most important effect of an agreement in the Uruguay Round would be preservation of a multilateral trading system. That would confirm the wisdom of the outward-looking, market-oriented policies adopted by so many countries in recent years. These policies should, in turn, spread the exceptionally rapid growth of east Asia during the past decade or two to other parts of the world, including to the industrial countries who provide nearly all the capital goods developing countries need.' 'Is that all there is to say?' asked the features editor, looking at her watch. 'Not at all,' I replied. 'Even if successful, the Uruguay Round would be one in a probably endless series. Something will have to be done to secure a global competition policy, instead of controversial anti-dumping and countervailing duty measures. The US will have to be weaned off its desire to manage trade, particularly with Japan. I am not particularly concerned about the supposed threat of regional trade blocs, since there is not going to be one in east Asia. But an accommodation must be made with the environmentalists, though not one that satisfies the urge of some of them to push humanity back into the self-sufficient manorial economy of the Dark Ages. 'So what does that mean? Yet another round?' 'Absolutely. The next one will have to start well before the results of the Uruguay Round are harvested. I think it might be called the Beijing Round.' The features editor smothered a yawn. It was obvious she was never going to be persuaded that Saturday readers should be served this arid sort of stuff. 'All right,' she said. 'But make sure you get the copy in early. You know how difficult Fridays always are.'</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Dividends It is hard to accuse BAT of being stuck in the mud. The company pioneered the controversial enhanced scrip dividend last year, and is leading the pack with the foreign income dividend now. Both have the express purpose of saving unrelieved advance corporation tax, but BAT may find that fewer others will copy its latest innovation. In part that is because the FID regulations are onerous. Despite earning almost three-quarters of its income abroad, BAT only decided that it should issue a FID after extensive work. Other companies may not pay enough overseas tax on their earnings to qualify. Nor do FIDs have the same cash-flow advantages as enhanced scrips, which were often used by companies with as much of a cash flow as a tax problem. Institutional reaction may also be mixed. BAT has structured its FID so that tax-exempt funds do not suffer, but the main gain goes to tax paying shareholders. There may be some resentment of this, despite the fact that FIDs put taxpaying and tax-exempt shareholders on an equivalent footing. Equally, however, taxpayers will have to accept that if the company does not pay a FID in future years, their payment may fall. Unless companies are allowed to stream foreign income to taxpaying and UK income to tax-exempt shareholders, FIDs will have limited appeal. Permitting that would, however, make it difficult for the Treasury to distinguish between the sheep, who earn substantial sums abroad, and the goats, who pay excessive dividends from inadequate UK profits.</p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Hard to identify 'duty' Sir, The duties of the director-general of Ofgas are specified unequivocally in the Gas Act 1986. The present director-general, Clare Spottiswoode, chose to emphasise their limitations most emphatically when she decided to repudiate the agreement made by her predecessor to provide funding for the government's Energy Saving Trust, as being outwith her remit. However, you quote Clare Spottiswoode ('MPs to speed up gas deregulation probe', October 4) as saying that she has a 'duty' to warn the government that indecision regarding possible new legislation for deregulating the gas market might damage the interests of those considering entering this market. That 'duty' is not easy to identify in the 1986 Gas Act. One can only hope that her latest definition of her duties also allows Ms Spottiswoode to reconsider the damage that Ofgas's volte face on funding the Energy Saving Trust has done, to the interests of those operating within the energy efficiency market. Andrew Warren, director, Association for the Conservation of Energy, 9 Sherlock Mews, London W1M 3RH</p>

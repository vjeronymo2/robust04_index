			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Index futures lead share prices again DOMESTIC factors returned to centre stage in the UK stock market yesterday, when hopes for a cut in base rates revived. City analysts were optimistic that rates may be cut either ahead of the annual conference of the governing Conservative party, or at the time of the November Budget. International trends played a less important role, with London taking little heed of sluggishness in other European markets or of the 24-point advance on Wall Street overnight. The lead again came from UK stock index futures, which maintained a strong premium against the cash market, encouraging heavy arbitraging by the leading specialist derivatives trading houses, both European and US. Share prices were a shade easier at first, but quickly turned higher with the future to show a gain of 19 points on the Footsie. The market then settled down before attracting increased volume towards the close of business. At the final reading of 3,036.9, the FT-SE 100 Index was 10.6 higher on the day. The recovery of nearly 32 points on the Footsie over the past two trading sessions has taken the Index comfortably above the 3,000 mark and restored confidence that the 3,115 peak achieved at the end of August can be challenged again before the year-end. Forecasts for the Footsie year-end reading by the brokerage houses range from around 2,900 to 3,500. Securities houses are now tidying up their trading books for the end of the third quarter of the year. This could hold share prices back for the rest of the week which also marks the end of the two-week trading account in equities. Most market firms are still taking an optimistic view of the outlook for the final quarter, and trading volume in equities indicates that underlying confidence has remained unshaken by the retreat from the Footsie peak. Seaq volume, slow at first, rose smartly in the second half of the session, to show a final total of 603.2m shares against 540.9m on Monday. Non-Footsie business made up around 61 per cent of the total. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, covering a wide range of non-Footsie stocks, edged up by 0.5 to 3,437.6. Retail, or customer, business in equities, the more significant guide to genuine investment activity by the fund managers, has remained good. On Monday, retail business was worth Pounds 1.25bn, within the range of the higher value totals of the past twelve months. The blue chip internationals remained firm although less active as the political news from Russia continued to present a less alarming picture. Oil shares edged higher, still sustained by crude oil prices but the pharmaceuticals lacked conviction. Interest rate hopes again showed in a firm performance by bank stocks. Retail, or consumer stocks which are traditionally beneficiaries of lower interest rates looked less certain as the sector digested company news from two leading companies, Sears and GUS. Neither of the two lent much support for market optimism on the company news front. But some analysts have stressed that, while the third quarter profits season which has just closed failed to come up to the best expectations, there could now be good profits news in the pipeline in the final quarter of the year.</p>

Major General Hartmut Foertsch,  the federal government's authorized representative for the  withdrawal of the Western Group, told the paper (Sunday [23  January] edition) that on 1 January 1991, a total 677,000 tonnes  of ammunition had been stored in Germany. Of this amount,  580,390 tonnes had been dispatched to Russia between 1991 and  1993. The Western Group had reported stocks of only 15,560  tonnes of ammunition on 1 January 1994. There was uncertainty  about the whereabouts of the missing 81,050 tonnes.

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Leading Article: County Hall THE GOVERNMENT should think again about its declared intention to allow a Japanese developer to purchase London's County Hall, and instead support the bid by the London School of Economics to inherit the building. The nationality of the developer is irrelevant. It is a straightforward matter of public interest. County Hall is London's foremost vacant public building; the LSE is the country's foremost social science university and among London's most prestigious public institutions, in urgent need of improved accommodation - and with a very strong claim to a commanding location in the capital. Its plans for County Hall have other features which justify a prime-site venue, notably a national 'social science park' and a relocated civil service college. County Hall might also make an appropriate base for ministers and others too grand to move to Canary Wharf, but soon to be homeless with the demolition of the Marsham Street complex. There is, of course, a price to be paid - about Pounds 120m in income foregone and conversion costs. That is a modest sum. It may be no sum at all taking into account the LSE's future needs and the yields to be gained from giving it greater national prominence.</p>

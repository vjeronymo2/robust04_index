			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Smith scorns government policy failures REPEATED government policy failures and the 'disappearing authority and credibility' of Mr John Major, the prime minister, justified MPs of all parties in voting against the government, Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, claimed in the Commons last night. He had to contend with a barrage of charges from Conservative and Liberal Democrat MPs that by refusing to support the government he had sullied his record as a consistent supporter of membership of the European Community. Sir Edward Heath, who as Conservative prime minister took Britain into the EC in 1973, told Mr Smith he had 'forsworn his integrity'. Mr Smith insisted that the ambiguous and anodyne government motion on which the debate was based had more to do with the internal crisis in the Conservative party than with the EC and the Maastricht treaty. Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, confirmed that further proceedings on the bill seeking authority for the ratification of the Maastricht treaty would not be affected by a government defeat. Mr Smith highlighted the sharply contrasting indications from government quarters in recent weeks about the importance that ministers attached to the debate. And, scoffing at the navety of Liberal Democrat MPs who intended to vote for the motion, he said they had been 'conned by the Conservatives'. Mr Smith said that for Labour MPs to adopt the same course would amount to an endorsement of the government's decision to opt out from the social chapter. 'That might suit the Liberal Democrats, but it would be a betrayal for us,' he said. The motion contained no ringing declaration about the future of Europe that would rally the troops under the Maastricht banner, he said. Mr Smith argued that further proceedings on the bill should be delayed until after the Edinburgh summit in December, when the terms secured by the Danish government for staging a second referendum on the Maastricht treaty would be clarified. He said that a statement made by the prime minister in September amounted to an acceptance that the 'framework' for the second Danish referendum would have to be agreed at the Edinburgh summit before MPs were asked to deal with the next stage of the Maastricht bill. To cheers and laughter from the Labour benches, Mr Smith poured ridicule on the recent statement by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, that a vote against the government at the end of the debate would result in a policy vacuum of 'incalculable destructiveness'. Mr Smith said: 'After all the clear and decisive leadership of the last few weeks, after all the consistent and determined implementation of long-established policies, how could we possibly cope with the black hole of a policy vacuum?'</p>

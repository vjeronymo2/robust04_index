			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Livestock shipping ban 'may cost farmers Pounds 200m' British farmers yesterday claimed that they stood to lose up to Pounds 200m a year in trade from bans on the export of live animals to the Continent imposed by most large ferry companies. The warning from the Association of Livestock Exporters came on the eve of today's start of the ban by P&amp;O. It also became clear yesterday that a new service for transporting live animals was unlikely to be able to start immediately. MDT Holdings, a London-based shipping company, plans to start a service from Harwich to get around the ban on live exports. However, the agriculture ministry said yesterday that the company's vessel had not yet been approved and was unlikely to get the go-ahead to begin today. P&amp;O introduced its ban because it was unconvinced by tough measures introduced by Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, to improve the treatment of live animals on long journeys. 'We are looking to Brussels for some action,' it said. The ban in effect cuts off business for farmers, as the company carried 60 per cent of live exports. Stena Sealink and Brittany Ferries, with 10 per cent of the market each, have already introduced bans - although Brittany's ban covers only animals destined for immediate slaughter. Livestock markets are already feeling the effects. The Meat and Livestock Commission, the industry's marketing body, reports prices for Friesian bull calves down 30 per cent this week to Pounds 99 against the same week last year. Prices have dropped sharply from Pounds 170 per animal at the end of June. This can be explained partly by a seasonal increase in cattle coming to market, but much of the drop is attributed to uncertainty over the ban.</p>

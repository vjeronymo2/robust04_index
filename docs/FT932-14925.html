			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Hope for improved language skills EMPLOYERS yesterday welcomed the new national curriculum for English, saying industry was demanding better communication skills from recruits. Mr Eric Dancer, managing director of Dartington Crystal, one of the largest employers in Cornwall, said: 'Many young people coming into industry do not have a fully developed command of the English language and I welcome any steps that seek to remedy that.' Mr Dancer, like other employers, said young people who were not able to express themselves adequately were at a particular disadvantage in the jobs market. Inability to speak or write English was not only a disadvantage to recruitment on the shop floor but would disqualify an individual from a job which involved contact with the public. 'People who are communicating externally have to enhance, not detract from a company's image,' said Mr Dancer. Cadbury, the Birmingham-based confectionery company, said it did not believe standards of written and spoken English had deteriorated - rather, companies such as itself were demanding more from recruits, both school-leavers and graduates. Mr Neil Makin, Cadbury's personnel director, said five years ago the company had recruited most of its school leavers through the Youth Training Scheme. 'It did not matter if applications were made in writing that was not joined up or grammar was shoddy in interviews.' But the company now aimed to recruit more school-leavers who had the potential for a full career path, which could take them as high as management. 'We are now looking for the best, rather than recruiting from an unemployment scheme,' said Mr Makin. The ability to express oneself fluently in standard English was important, he said.</p>

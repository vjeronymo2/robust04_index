			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Shatalov: "Vladimir Preparations"] </F>   [Text] Vladimir Oblast Administration Chief Yu. Vlasov has  approved statutes for an Oblast Duma and elections to it.    The draft of this document was first discussed in detail at  an oblast assembly of representatives of various parties,  movements, and other public organizations, and also power  structures. There were major objections from assembly  participants to the administration's proposal to elect 17  deputies to the future Duma who would work on a permanent basis.  In that case, the opponents claimed, not all Vladimir Oblast  rayons would be represented in it, not to mention the fact that  it would have to operate without standing commissions. But,  apparently, the representative body henceforth will operate  without standing commissions, since the final version of the  statutes on the Oblast Duma provides for 21 deputies.    The original draft statutes on elections also underwent  significant changes. Now someone wishing to register as a  candidate in an electoral district requires not three but only  two percent of voters' signatures in his favor. According to  the statutes, groups of voters, public associations, and  individuals are entitled to nominate a candidate.</p>

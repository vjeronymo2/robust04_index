			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REFUGEE MAY FACE PRISON; JUDGE CHASTISES HIS LAWYER  </P> <P> A Superior Court judge said Friday that he may send a local Vietnamese refugee  to state prison for his involvement in a political assassination attempt. And,  in a fierce reprimand, the judge lambasted the defendant's attorney for having  publicly suggested otherwise.  </P> <P> Be Tu Van Tran, 33, who admitted having shot a fellow refugee for expressing  views that Tran interpreted as being pro-Communist, must now be committed to  the state probation system for a 90-day examination to determine whether he  poses any continuing danger to society.  </P> <P> In putting off Tran's sentencing until that analysis is completed, Judge Robert  R. Fitzgerald lashed out at defense attorney Robert Weinberg of Irvine for his  public comments on Tran's fate.  </P> <P> After Tran entered what amounted to a guilty plea last month, the lawyer told  reporters that he was confident from his discussions with the judge that his  client would have to spend only a few months of incarceration, rather than the  nine years he could face for an attempted-murder conviction.  </P> <P> In court Friday, Fitzgerald called Weinberg's quoted comments a "gross error"  and said he was "appalled" that the lawyer would prejudge the case by  disclosing confidential in-chamber proceedings.  </P> <P> Asserting that he has made no promises, Fitzgerald underscored the severity of  Tran's plea by warning that the case "may end up in substantial prison time."  </P> <P> In an interview after the hearing, Weinberg expressed regret over the comments  that sparked Fitzgerald's reprimand, saying: "I've done myself and my client a  terrible disservice."  </P> <P> Weinberg added: "I can understand why (Fitzgerald) got so upset at me. . . . My  intuition should have been kept to myself."  </P> <P> The unusual reprimand by Fitzgerald was yet another twist in an emotionally  charged case that began in 1986, when Westminster businessman Tran Khanh Van  suggested in a Los Angeles Times Magazine article that the United States  normalize relations with Vietnam.  </P> <P> Shortly after those comments appeared, Van was shot twice in an attack outside  his Westminster real estate office. Be Tu Van Tran admitted in a disputed  statement to police that he shot Van because he was infuriated by what he saw  as the fellow refugee's sympathies toward the Communist regime in Vietnam.  </P> <P> Tran's defense team has tried to show that the one-time English teacher in  Vietnam, who left his entire family behind in the war-torn region, did not  actually shoot Van but took responsibility for the crime only as a "badge of  honor" in the fight against communism.  </P> <P> In 1986, a jury in the case could not reach a verdict in a trial that drew the  attention of members of the Vietnamese community, many of whom saw Tran as a  hero for his stand against communism. A second trial that was to have begun  last month was averted when Tran effectively admitted guilt in what is known as  a "slow plea."  </P> <P> In his remarks from the bench Friday, Judge Fitzgerald said he would wait to  see the evaluation of state probation personnel before deciding on an  appropriate sentence for Tran.  </P> <P> But in assessing the case, the judge did assert that every citizen "has a right  to be free from fear" of reprisals for expressing controversial views.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans went further in urging that Tran be  sent to prison.  </P> <P> In papers filed with the court, the prosecutor called the assassination attempt  "the prototype nightmare of a free-world society. In short, Van Khan Tran was  gunned down because of what people thought he believed."  </P></p>

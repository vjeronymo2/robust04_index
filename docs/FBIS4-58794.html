			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Faysal al-Husayni, "head of Fatah in the </F> West Bank," by Yoni Ben-Menahem; place and date not given --  recorded]    [Text] [Ben-Menahem] Mr. al-Husayni, when will the future  Palestinian authority be announced?    [Al-Husayni] I believe that this will take place within the  next few days, whereby this authority will be able to take over  all its powers when Israel concludes its withdrawal. Great  tasks lie ahead of the authority that is to be established.  These include implementation of the Cairo agreement, rebuilding  the infrastructure in the areas from which the Israeli forces  will pull out, preparing for deployment in the other areas from  which Israel will withdraw in the future, and preparing for free  and democratic elections that will be held in the middle of  October.    [Ben-Menahem] Will you participate in the future Palestinian  authority?    [Al-Husayni] If I am assigned to this authority I will  discuss the assignment and see what my duty will be. If this is  within my capabilities and abilities I believe that it will be  incumbent upon me to accept.    [Ben-Menahem] According to reports, a large number of West  Bank and Gaza Strip figures have expressed reservation in  accepting participation in this authority. What is your  position regarding this reservation?    [Al-Husayni] I believe we have the right to have  reservations. I myself have reservations on the Cairo agreement,  but we should not have reservations on performing our duties if  this chance is provided to us in an open and good manner and if  the powers and responsibilities are determined. If such an  opportunity is offered to me and if the powers and  responsibilities are determined and clear, I believe that I  should accept.    [Ben-Menahem] Then according to your assessment those  figures will not refuse the appointments by Yasir 'Arafat?    [Al-Husayni] I believe that the position of a large number  of those figures in terms of whether to accept or not stems from  their lack of confidence that the picture and the  responsibilities will be clear. Therefore, I believe that  entering a new stage in which the responsibilities and powers  are defined in a pyramidal way can serve the coming stage.    [Ben-Menahem] Is there a split between the residents of the  occupied territories and the diaspora regarding the issue of the  future Palestinian authority? Is it true that the residents do  not accept those from the outside to arrive and govern the  people?    [Al-Husayni] There is absolutely no such thing. In fact, I  have met many people outside who hold opinions similar to those  inside. I have also found many people inside who hold different  opinions but they are identical with those of the outside. The  issue is not inside or outside but how one thinks. A  Palestinian may affiliate himself with the inside or outside  irrespective of a position.    [Ben-Menahem] But do most of the figures in the West Bank  fear that the outside, the PLO, will come here and govern the  people?    [Al-Husayni] No. I do not believe there is such a thing,  although if some are objecting it is against the decisionmaking  approach. Some here have such reservations, but not so much  against personalities as against the decisionmaking approach.</p>

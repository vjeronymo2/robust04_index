			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Walesa threatens to call elections The row between Poland's President Lech Walesa and the ruling coalition government over the appointment of a new finance minister escalated at the weekend when the president threatened to dismiss parliament and call new elections. Tension between Mr Walesa and the government heightened after deputies from the ruling post-communist Left Democratic Alliance (SLD) and the Polish Peasant party (PSL) tabled draft changes in the country's interim constitution giving parliament the right to overrule the president's veto on government appointments. President Walesa, in Litomysl in the Czech Republic at a meeting of central European heads of state, said he did not believe the coalition would go ahead with the changes. 'But if they do, that means elections. I will convince the people of the danger of the course the coalition is taking,' he said. The coalition's move has been prompted by Mr Walesa's refusal to accept the appointment of Prof Dariusz Rosati, a UN economist and SLD supporter, as finance minister, following the resignation in February of Mr Marek Borowski. Mr Borowski had argued with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak over control of economic policy. The coalition is arguing that the present interim constitution, passed in 1992, needs to be amended as the president's right of veto over cabinet appointments deprives the governing majority of the power to replace ministers. The constitution, as it stands, gives parliament the right to overrule a presidential veto only when the cabinet is initially appointed. Mr Alexander Kwasniewski, the SLD leader who has persuaded Mr Pawlak to support the amendment, called yesterday for talks with the president in the hope he could be persuaded to accept Mr Rosati's appointment and avoid the need for constitutional change. The accord between the coalition parties marks a change of heart for Mr Pawlak, who had initially opposed Prof Rosati's appointment. Mr Pawlak still wants to increase his control over financial policy; this had been handed to the SLD under the agreement establishing the coalition last autumn. The president's hand is not strong as the coalition needs just four further votes for the amendment to pass. The constitution also only permits the president to call mid-term elections if parliament is unable to appoint a government or pass the annual budget. The next parliamentary elections are due in 1997. Reuter adds from St Petersburg: Prof Rosati said yesterday he was still willing to become Poland's finance minister, provided the long wrangle about the appointment did not seriously damage the economy. 'I don't consider myself as a candidate but apparently the coalition does,' he said. 'I wouldn't object. . . I would accept.' He added: 'The economy can fall into disarray. If something fundamental changes in the economy I would reconsider.' Among his priorities as finance minister would be promoting privatisation and enterprise restructuring. It would also be necessary to start work on the 1995 budget, which would be financed in different ways to the past, he said. One possibility would be to raise a Eurodollar loan, and work had to be done on signing a deal with the International Monetary Fund.</p>

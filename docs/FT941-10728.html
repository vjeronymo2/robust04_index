			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: After the storm The equity markets weathered the initial storm rather well. By yesterday afternoon Wall Street was on its way back up again. The UK pared initial losses to close with the FT-SE 100 down only 56 points, which still leaves it almost exactly level with where it ended 1993. Since the dollar was also consolidating around DM1.76, it looks as though the worst fears of what might happen when the Federal Reserve started to tighten were overdone. There was no sign yesterday of a wholesale retreat by private investors or a reversal of the flows of US money that have been fuelling international markets. Whether that means world equities can continue on a carefree upward path is another matter. The Fed's action must make some difference, particularly for more over-heated markets such as Hong Kong. Financial markets had generally assumed the Fed would tighten during 1994. Now that the move has started, attention must focus on the still unanswerable questions of how much more is to come and how soon. As they got over their initial shock, markets yesterday were tending to the view that the Fed may have lessened the risk of much larger interest rate rises later that would certainly curb the US recovery. By beginning a gradual process of tightening now it may instead prolong growth. That thought is comfort to equity markets, especially those in Europe which can look forward to some further interest rate cuts. The UK, for example, need not abandon hope of seeing an index level of 3,500 again this year. But much does depend on earnings living up to expectations. And markets everywhere will scrutinise each monthly US inflation more nervously than before.</p>

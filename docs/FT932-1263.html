			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Frogmore joins cash queue FROGMORE Estates yesterday joined the queue of property companies tapping the equity market when it announced a Pounds 42.9m rights issue to help finance Pounds 58m of acquisitions which are agreed or under negotiation. The 1-for-3 cash call, which involves the issue of 12.78m new shares at 345p, has been underwritten by Warburgs. The shares lost 17p to 404p. Frogmore has agreed two acquisitions subject to contract totalling Pounds 30m, while negotiations are in progress for another Pounds 28m of purchases. The deals are in the retail and residential sectors, which Frogmore believes will lead the recovery. It said it was possible to buy quality properties on yields close to interest rates. Group borrowings amounted to Pounds 68.2m by June 10. A forecast final dividend of 12.4p will make a total for the year of 16p, an increase of 6.6 per cent. COMMENT When yet another property company jumps on to the rights issues bandwagon, it risks being charged with opportunism. The dangers are that if it fails to find suitable acquisitions, it may simply dilute its net asset value and reduce its gearing at the wrong stage of the cycle. But Frogmore is likely to avoid the traps. Far from suggesting opportunism, its record demonstrates strong organic growth; this is only the second rights issue in its 32 year history. Moreover, it has shown unusual skill at reading the market's cycles: it reduced its gearing by selling property in the late 1980s and returned to the buying trail in the last 18 months. The issue is likely to involve no earnings dilution and a relatively small dilution of asset value of about 4 per cent. Although investors might prefer to know more about the deals that Frogmore has lined up, the rights issue deserves to be well supported.</p>

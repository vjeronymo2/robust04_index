			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Svetlana Sukhova: "Oleg Davydov's Foreign </F> Voyage: The First Results Have Been Summed Up"]    [Text] Negotiations with both political leaders and  representatives of a number of leading companies from Bulgaria,  Hungary, and Germany were held during the trip to Europe by a  Russian delegation headed by Minister of Foreign Economic  Relations Oleg Davydov; the trip ended yesterday. The visit  became part of a plan to invigorate trade and economic relations  with the former CEMA [Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]  member countries, which the minister announced a long time  ago.    As Oleg Davydov said in a conversation with a KOMMERSANT  correspondent, they succeeded in signing two protocols in the  course of negotiations with Deputy Prime Minister of Bulgaria  Valentin Karabashev: on trade and economic relations between  Bulgaria and Russia for 1994 and on the continuation of  cooperation in the area of development of the gas industry (the  Yamburg field). Building on the agreements achieved, it is  planned that negotiations will be held in January concerning the  creation of a free-trade system between Russia and Bulgaria (a  special working group was already established during the visit).  The "gas" topic was dominant in the course of discussions in  Sofia. This is not surprising. A special role is assigned to  Bulgaria in Russia's gas exports: It is precisely with the help  of Bulgaria's transit gas pipelines that Moscow is planning to  expand deliveries of what is now its main exported product to  Greece, Macedonia, and Turkey, and in the long run, possibly  Yugoslavia.    As far as gas deliveries to Bulgaria itself are concerned,  they will obviously become possible after the gas received is  paid for in construction services provided by the Bulgarians to  develop Yamburg (to this day, Bulgaria owes Russia for previous  deliveries, and the overall positive balance of settlements in  favor of Russia comes to 700 million transferable rubles).  Besides, Gazprom representative Yuriy Zaytsev discussed the  issue of Russia's participation in the conversion of Bulgarian  gas transportation routes to joint-stock operations (this  project has long been proposed as a scenario for settlement of  the Bulgarian debt).    Other results of the negotiations in Bulgaria include the  finally reached agreement on effecting mutual transactions in  national currencies. If mutual relations with other former CEMA  partners develop along these paths, this will certainly help to  overcome the current crisis in bilateral relations caused by  switching to settlements in freely convertible currencies only.  To be sure, the issues of deadlines for the repayment of the  debt denominated in transferable rubles and of the payment of  the Bulgarian debt to Russian commercial banks denominated in  foreign exchange remain unresolved. Negotiations on these issues  will be continued on 24 January in Moscow and Sofia.    Unlike in Sofia, no breakthrough occurred in Budapest, and  yet, according to Mr. Davydov, they still achieved some movement  on the issue of debts. The deadline for the payment of the  second segment of the Russian debt (totalling $1.6 billion) was  resolved in negotiations with Minister of Trade Bela Kadar. The  payment of this segment will be effected after 1994, whereas the  first segment will be paid through military deliveries in 1993  and 1994. The issue of participation by Russian companies in the  construction of a subway in Budapest toward the repayment of the  debt was also discussed. This project will be considered in  greater detail at a meeting of the intergovernmental  Russian-Hungarian commission on 24 January in Moscow. The  Hungarian proposal to establish a Hungarian-Russian bank for  trade and economic cooperation (with the participation of the  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development) will also be  discussed at the meeting. The signing of a protocol for  cooperation in 1994 is also scheduled for January.    The last four days of the visit were devoted to negotiations  with representatives of the German BASF concern.    [begin boxed item]  <H5>  Trade and Economic Relations Between Russia and Bulgaria </H5>   In 1993 commodity trade between Russia and Bulgaria  increased on account of Russian exports, amounting to $1.7  billion.    Two protocols were signed during the negotiations:    --on trade and economic relations in 1994;    --on the continuation of cooperation in the area of  developing the gas industry (the Yamburg field).    Negotiations were also held:    --on the issue of settling the mutual debt;    --on cooperation in nuclear power generation (in particular,  Russia will provide assistance in servicing four Bulgarian  nuclear power stations);    --on the issue of gas exports from Russia and its  participation in converting the gas transportation network of  Bulgaria to joint-stock operations.    Negotiations were also held with the chiefs of the  Metallokonstruktsiya, Glavbolgarstroy, and Bulgargaz companies.

The message said: Under the leadership of the CPC Central  Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, we Hunan  people, together with the people of all nationalities in the  country, enter the new year with confidence and hopes of  speeding up reform and development. The past year has seen us  building up socialism with Chinese characteristics. Under the  guidance of the important talks of Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the  spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee. We have achieved considerable results in all our  undertakings. In economy we maintained a relatively good  momentum of development. The provincial GNP reached 114 billion  yuan, up 12.6 percent over the previous year. The 15 years  between the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central  Committee and the end of last year has been a period of great  reform, opening up, and development for Hunan, and a period  which witnessed the fast growth of Hunan's economic strength,  the biggest changes in the urban and rural outlook, and the  greatest practical benefits for the general public, since the  founding of New China.    The brilliant achievements we have scored are a sound  foundation on which we can continue our pursuit in triumph. In  the new year, we must hold high the great theoretical banner of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics, adhere to the  party's basic line, implement the spirit of the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and that of the sixth  enlarged plenary session of the sixth provincial CPC committee,  further emancipate the mind, seize the opportunity, work with  less constraint on speeding up reform and development, and make  more good results and create more brilliant records.</p>

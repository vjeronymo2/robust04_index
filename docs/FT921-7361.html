			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: The pick of single company Peps - The risks and rewards of holding a personal equity plan in one company SINGLE company personal equity plans have been highly popular since their launch on January 1. CC&amp;P Trustees, a division of Bacon &amp; Woodrow, is plan manager for 55 company schemes and reports Pounds 60m-65m invested this year in both single company and old-style corporate Peps. Investors can place up to Pounds 3,000 of one company's shares in a single company plan, in addition to the Pounds 6,000 Pep which they may have taken out already in the tax year. Returns are free of capital gains and income tax, as with other Peps. Many employees will find a single company Pep a useful means of holding shares acquired through an Inland Revenue approved all-employee scheme. By transferring shares into a single company Pep within 90 days of acquisition, the employee can avoid capital gains tax. For non-employee investors, though, the drawback of the new Pep is the fact that an equity-based investment is being limited to the shares of one company. But the golden rule is that risk is minimised by a wide spread of holdings. This makes single company PEPs most suitable for those investors who have a diversified portfolio already. But which single company should they choose? We asked a number of stockbrokers for their tips, with two types of investor in mind. The first is someone who is taking out the Pep primarily as a means of reducing his capital gains tax bill. The other is one who does not normally pay CGT and is, therefore, looking primarily to benefit from the Pep's exemption from income tax. In essence, the division is between growth and income. GROWTH Mark Powell, of Laurence Keen, chose Marks &amp; Spencer as a suitable stock for someone interested in growth. The company showed 4 per cent growth in earnings last year and Powell expects profit to rise from Pounds 620m to Pounds 640m in the year to March, with another 15 per cent increase to Pounds 730m next year. 'The shares are never statistically very cheap but, on a prospective price/earnings ratio for the year to March 1993 of just over 17.5, they seem to me to be an excellent three-year holding,' he said. Paul Killik, of Killik &amp; Co., decided to play safe by choosing 'sound companies with some diversification of interests.' He picked Unilever as his growth stock but does not expect more than a small improvement in profits and earnings from the annual results due next week. 'However, the attraction lies in the medium to longer term opportunities of the Single European Market,' said Killik. 'Among the larger companies, none is better placed to take advantage of the removal of trade barriers in Europe.' Unilever was also the choice of stockbroker Greig Middleton as 'a quality stock which is relatively recession-proof.' But the firm's Brian Tora selected BOC as a company likely 'to offer sound value and operating in industries which, while not recession-proof, should hold up well under current difficult trading conditions.' Tora added: 'The long-term basis of many of its gas supply contracts will help and the management is well regarded.' Andrew Norman-Butler, of Gerrard Vivian Gray, recommended Smithkline Beecham 'A' shares, at 937p for capital growth. 'Despite the outperformance of the health and household sector, we feel the shares still have the potential for a major re-rating once the outlook for their new-product launches is recognised,' he said. INCOME Higher-income seekers should think of buying into Redland, the building materials group, according to Laurence Keen's Powell. He predicts that last year's profit will have fallen from Pounds 245m to Pounds 185m but adds: 'Redland is financially very strong, and the depressed state of many of the markets in which it operates seems likely to provide acquisition opportunities.' Redland is in the process of bidding for Steetley, a large British brick and clay tile manufacturer. Redland shares are now around 475p and the yield is 7 per cent. Killik's choice for income is BAT industries at 660p. He expects the final dividend to be around 22p net of tax (29.3p gross in a Pep), a yield of 4.4 per cent on its own. 'For the 1992 year, expectations are for about 36p in total, a gross yield of 7.2 per cent,' said Killik. Although the price of its shares have been depressed by heavy losses at its insurance subsidiary, Eagle Star, Killik believes the worst is over. 'The company is a fine cash generator in these uncertain times, which gives confidence that it will be able to continue its progressive dividend policy.' The tip from Greig Middleton's Tora is P&amp;O. 'I am not certain that my colleagues would agree that it is suitable for a Pep but, with its double-digit yield, this could be a rewarding share to hold - although it is high risk, given that things could go wrong.' Gerrard Vivian Gray's Norman-Butler picks Prudential which, at 232p, is yielding 5.9 per cent. 'Prudential has a record of dividend growth which we expect to continue at around 10 per cent per annum. Rationalisation and general cost-cutting should help recovery prospects,' he said. Investors should think long and hard before deciding to open a single company Pep. Like all equity-based investments, it should be regarded as a long-term commitment. If the shares of the single company hit the floor, losses cannot be offset against gains elsewhere for CGT purposes. Both Killik and Tora advise investors not to go for the single company Pep unless they already have a general Pep. Now that the Labour party has stated that it will not be abolishing Peps, investors need not be rushed into choosing.</p>

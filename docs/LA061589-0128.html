			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAR-PIT BONES REVEAL AILMENTS OF EXTINCT SABER-TOOTH CATS  </P> <P> Scientists at the La Brea tar pits are studying the illnesses and injuries that  plagued a creature extinct for at least 10,000 years.  </P> <P> Staff and volunteer paleopathologists at the George C. Page Museum are  cataloguing the ills that the saber-toothed cat fell prey to. Knowing what went  wrong with the long-vanished cats, incorrectly called tigers by earlier  researchers, has no obvious utility. But it provides intriguing clues to how  they lived in sickness and in health.  </P> <P> The Page Museum in Hancock Park houses the fossils of countless animals and  plants that were trapped in the area's tar pits, vast deposits of asphalt that  continues to seep to the surface and scent the park. Between 10,000 and 40,000  years ago, giant mammoths, dire wolves and hundreds of other Ice Age species  were trapped in the asphalt deposits like flies on flypaper. Their remains,  preserved by the substance that killed them, constitute one of the greatest  caches of Ice Age fossils in the world.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 5,000 Injured Bones  </P> <P> Fred P. Heald, 75, a retired surgeon who lives in Palos Verdes Estates, assumed  the daunting task of putting the museum's 75-year-old collection of diseased  and traumatized bones in order.  </P> <P> "Paleopathology," the volunteer explained, "is the study of diseases and  injuries present in fossil specimens." Among the 500,000 specimens in the  museum's vast ossuary are some 5,000 saber-toothed cat bones that show evidence  of everything from arthritis to infection with the fungus that causes Valley  fever to a half-broken neck. (The pathology collection includes 4,000 dire wolf  bones as well.)  </P> <P> "I started out at one end of the collection and worked clear through, bone by  bone," recalled Heald, who jotted his description and diagnosis of each  specimen on an index card.  </P> <P> Heald learned about Smilodon californicus, as the saber-tooth is properly  called, as he went along. "Nobody has ever written a textbook on the anatomy  and pathology of a Smilodon cat," he said, "but, fortunately, all animals are  hooked up pretty much the same way."  </P> <P> Heald was delighted to discover that, anatomically at least, the saber-tooth  responded to illness and injury much as humans do. Working with museum staffer  Christopher A. Shaw, who is interested in the relationship of physical form to  function, Heald can make intelligent guesses about how the cats brought down  their prey and even about their social organization.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Social Animal  </P> <P> "I sat for four or five hours a day, just writing down what I saw," Heald  recalled. "Out of the trees came a little better view of the forest."  </P> <P> The scientists are convinced by the asphalt-blackened bones that the  saber-toothed cat was a social animal that hunted with others in a pack or  pride. As Heald explained, the bones show evidence of wounds, fractures and  dislocations disabling enough to have caused death if the animal had been a  solitary hunter.  </P> <P> But from clues such as broken sabers worn smooth over time, the scientists know  that even some cats that had lost their characteristic canine teeth lived with  their disabilities for a considerable period before their sticky demise in the  tar pits. No longer able to kill for themselves, the cats probably lived on the  scraps of kills made by others in the group, the men speculate.  </P> <P> Shaw noted that a modern observer can't help but wince at some of the maladies  reflected in the collection, such as a hip that shows evidence of a massive  infection, which must have caused the animal considerable pain. "I sit there  and think, 'How did this guy get around?' "  </P> <P> Pathological or not, the museum's bones are remarkably eloquent. Page Museum  staffer Antonia Tejada-Flores found evidence that the saber-tooth roared when  she came across a cigar box full of fossilized throat bones called hyoids. The  hyoids of the saber-tooth had relatively elastic connections, similar to those  of contemporary cats that roar. Non-roaring cats have relatively inflexible  ones.  </P> <P> Former museum staffer William A. Akersten found other bones to bolster his  theory that the cats used their sabers, not primarily to stab or slash, but to  execute a calamitous shearing bite to soft parts of their prey, which then bled  to death or died of shock.  </P> <P> As Shaw pointed out, the saber-toothed cat is an especially intriguing animal  "because there's nothing like them around today. It's fascinating to see what  made them go."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stealth Hunter  </P> <P> On the basis of their bones, the scientists believe the cat was a stealth  hunter. "It's not a fast animal like a cheetah," said the 37-year-old Shaw, a  Granada Hills resident who is the museum's curator of collections. "The tail is  the biggest clue. Animals that run down their prey generally have a large tail  for balance. The Smilodon had a very short tail."  </P> <P> In a scientific paper, Heald praised bone as an expressive medium. "Living  bone," he wrote, "is not a hard, unyielding material that holds animals  together. Bone is dynamic, it responds to use and especially to misuse. It has  quite set ways of growing and of healing itself after injury which are common  to all animals."  </P> <P> Heald explained that when an animal's muscles are stressed, little tears occur.  There is bleeding, and then telltale calluses form on the bone. Many of the  cats in the collection sustained terrible, repeated stress injuries to their  necks and backs that cause the scientists to speculate that the saber-tooth  cats leaped on large prey with great force.  </P> <P> The discovery in a Texas cave of another kind of saber-tooth surrounded by the  bones of young mastodons and mammoths leads the men to believe juvenile  elephants were probably a Smilodon foodstuff. Without the cats, Heald  theorized, "the world would have been clear up to its eyes in elephants."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lions Kill Large Prey  </P> <P> Shaw, Heald and others using the paleopathology collection are aware that,  however logical their theories about what the saber-tooth did, no one will ever  know for sure if they are right.  </P> <P> Until recently, Shaw noted, the museum staff thought the saber-tooth's largest  front toe was probably toward the middle of its paw, like a modern lion's. But  the recent find of an almost complete saber-tooth skeleton in the tar pits,  with its bones in place, reveals that the big toes were across from each other  on the inside of the paws -- in the same position as human toes.  </P></p>

			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / International Company News: Tapie disposal plan set back as Testut reveals loss THE fortunes of Mr Bernard Tapie, the controversial businessman who was recently forced to resign from the French cabinet because of his involvement in a fraud case, took another knock yesterday when Testut, a company controlled by the Tapie group, disclosed consolidated losses of FFr68.01m (Dollars 12.8m) for 1991. Testut, a weighing machine business, is one of the companies recently put up for sale by Bernard Tapie Finances (BTF), Mr Tapie's holding company, which owns 88.75 per cent of its equity. BTF has been forced to make disposals in order to reduce the debts incurred by its controversial acquisition two years ago of the Adidas sporting goods business. When BTF recently announced its 1991 results - which showed it had slipped into a net loss of FFr294.9m after net profits of FFr47.97m in 1990 - the holding company said it had made provisions for its losses on both Testut and Teraillon, another weighing machine maker. Testut last year saw its sales rise sharply to FFr446.73m from FFr291.4m in 1990, according to its accounts published yesterday. Mr Tapie has been charged with fraud concerning his role in the disposal of an electronics distribution company to Toshiba, the Japanese technology group.</p>

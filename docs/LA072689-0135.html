			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> DC-9 LANDS WITH HYDRAULIC FAILURE  </P> <P> A Continental Airlines DC-9 suffered partial hydraulic failure Tuesday evening  and fishtailed in an emergency landing at Newark International Airport. None of  the 89 people aboard the flight were injured.  </P> <P> A light indicating a hydraulic problem came on in the cockpit of Flight 354  from Chicago about 20 minutes before its scheduled landing at Newark, spokesman  Ned Walker said in a telephone interview from Continental's headquarters in  Houston.  </P> <P> The plane appeared to have suffered a loss of one of its hydraulic systems, and  a partial loss of the other, Walker said. But unlike the DC-10 that crashed in  Iowa last week, the DC-9 doesn't require hydraulics for maneuverability, he  said.  </P> <P> Four of the DC-9's six tires blew out and the plane fishtailed as it skidded  three-quarters of the way down the 9,800-foot runway shortly after 8 p.m. It  ended up sitting perpendicular to the runway.  </P></p>

			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / India completes key reform of currency The Indian rupee will today become convertible in all current account transactions, in a further easing of currency regulations announced yesterday by India's central bank. The move will give India Article VIII status in the International Monetary Fund, which is a fundamental indicator of 'good standing' in the fund. The change is an important part of the liberalisation programme of Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao's government. It also marks a significant change both for Indians and for international investors. Although India introduced convertibility on its trade account in March 1993, benefiting exporters and importers of goods, Indians have continued to experience severe restrictions on travel and the purchase of most foreign services. Equally, investors have been constrained in the repatriation of dividend and interest income. Indian citizens travelling abroad for personal reasons were allowed only Dollars 2,000 (Pounds 1,300) a year, and all Indians had to get permission from the Reserve (central) Bank to buy foreign exchange for business travel, medical treatment or studies abroad. With yesterday's decision to extend convertibility to the entire current account, these restrictions have been lifted and the Reserve Bank has delegated powers to authorised dealers to release foreign exchange to Indian citizens. The bank has set nominal limits on the release of foreign exchange, but yesterday emphasised that bona fide requests for additional exchange facilities would be cleared. Non-resident Indians will also now be able to repatriate earnings from investments in India, including the interest accrued on previously non-repatriable rupee deposit schemes for expatriate Indians, which will be eligible for repatriation from the quarter beginning October 1 1994. The principal amount of these deposits will remain non-repatriable, but no fresh deposits will be accepted from today. The bank said income on investment by non-resident Indians would be repatriable in a phased manner over a three-year period. Up to Dollars 1,000 would be remittable in 1994-1995. On amounts exceeding Dollars 1,000, one-third of the annual income earned during 1994-1995 would be remittable, two-thirds in 1995-1996, and the entire income from 1996-1997. In general, restrictions on capital transactions remain. But 'India has taken one more giant step towards full convertibility of the rupee on the capital account', said a Finance Ministry official, although he emphasised that that was still at least two years away. 'The finance minister (Mr Manmohan Singh) has kept the promise he made in his budget speech that the rupee would be fully convertible on the current account before the year was out,' he said. The improvement in India's balance of payments, with the current account deficit declining from Dollars 10bn in 1990-1991 to Dollars 0.8bn in 1993-1994, and a rise in foreign exchange reserves to Dollars 21.4bn from just Dollars 1.1bn in June 1991, have allowed the Reserve Bank to relax the foreign exchange restrictions. These improvements have been brought about by an export recovery, the decline of non-oil imports, foreign investment in stock markets and the raising of funds through Euro-issues.</p>

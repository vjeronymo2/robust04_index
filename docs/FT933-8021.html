			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Keating's haul WHEN Mr Paul Keating's Labor party unexpectedly won the Australian general election last March, everybody knew victory had its price. Yesterday's federal budget made clear the cost: a growing problem with public sector and current account deficits, rising taxes and a risk that the government's hard-won grip on inflation may begin to slide. Promises by Mr John Dawkins, the federal treasurer, of sustained job creation seem wishful: despite fiscal stimulus, unemployment remains stuck above 10.7 per cent of the workforce. Reaffirmed intentions to cut the budget deficit from a record ADollars 16bn to ADollars 6bn, or 1 per cent of gross domestic product, by 1996-97 seem more fanciful still in light of hesitant economic growth. For all its strides in streamlining the economy in recent years, the government now has its work cut out to preserve credibility with financial markets and to boost its political capital at home - and another election is less than three years away. Mr Dawkins will no doubt make much of having kept a pledge to reduce personal tax rates this November. But this should not be allowed to hide the government's embarrassment at having to junk a second promised round of tax cuts later. Nor, given the way Mr Keating focused his campaign fire on opposition plans for a sales tax, can he escape the charge that he is doing something similar by raising indirect taxes. More worrying is the impression that the government has no clear medium-term strategy for controlling public expenditure. Mr Dawkins talked yesterday of further cuts in defence spending, and even of tightening up on the social security budget - although Mr Keating had insisted on the stump that there was no fat to cut. With national savings at their lowest for 30 years, the government will thus need to raise new direct taxes as well as broadening indirect taxation if it is to have a hope of meeting its deficit target. Ultimately, however, Australia's biggest problem is slow growth. GDP is forecast to rise this fiscal year by 2.75 per cent - less than is needed to maintain per capita income. Only through faster growth will Messrs Keating and Dawkins create the employment needed to secure re-election - and that, sadly for them, is largely beyond their control.</p>

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Fourth estate stands in as whipping boy: Complaints of distortion by the media figure prominently in all three campaigns IT WAS only a gentle tap on the shoulder in Winston-Salem and the little old lady was very polite. Could I please move a few feet to one side so she could get a better view of the candidate when he arrived and perhaps could I ask some of my colleagues in the press pen to do the same. Blocking the view is a problem. There were approximately 190 members of the fourth estate on the Clinton-Gore bus tour through the small towns of North Carolina, three-quarters of them from television, and it often was difficult for members of the public to catch even a glimpse of the candidates through the forest of cameras and sound mikes. But, if blocking the view were the only problem, solutions could always be found: trenches for cameramen, for example, or the public in the front rows, the zoom-lens press in the back. The candidates' complaint - and it is as bad this year as it has ever been - is that it is their views that are being distorted. President Bush has a bumper sticker that he waves to rallies: 'Annoy the media: Re-elect George Bush.' Hardly a day goes by without his charging that the media depict the economy as being far worse than it is, or that it keeps asking him questions he has already answered, on Iran-Contra, for example. There was nothing wrong with the Republican convention, he said yesterday, only the way it was reported. His son, Jeb, also chipped in yesterday with a letter to the Wall Street Journal about an article that had investigated his business connections, and those of his brother, Neil. It demonstrated, he wrote, 'a predisposition to broadcast any set of facts that may have even a remote likelihood of inflicting damage on the president's family, and by association President Bush himself.' Republicans have always claimed the media is infused with liberal bias. This was clearly daft in the 1980s, when President Reagan got an almost free ride, and even in 1988, when much negative Bush advertising passed largely without comment. It is true that Mr Clinton has picked up more newspaper endorsements than most Democrats have for years, and from some unlikely sources, such as the Portland Oregonian and the Hartford Courant, both for 100 years rock-ribbed in the other direction. Even Mr William Safire of the New York Times, who used to write speeches for Nixon and Agnew, wound up a sharply anti-Bush column on Thursday with these words: 'Any reader who cannot figure out against whom this lifelong Republican is voting this year isn't trying'. The president's particular grouse against 'talking heads' is that they wrote off his election chances too early. Some of them, he even acknowledged in a television interview yesterday, were conservative or Republican. Private cold feet may be found in the studios and newsrooms of the nation in the face of Mr Clinton's narrowing lead, but it is hard to tell that from their public utterances. Two of them, Ms Cokie Roberts of ABC and Mr Kevin Phillips, the political consultant and quondam Republican, agreed on the radio yesterday that the striking aspect of the latest polls was that Mr Bush could not rise much above 35 per cent, simply not enough to win an election. Mr Clinton has had a rough year with the media and, once or twice, when the accusations about his private life have been flying thickest, has stopped being affable and chatty, which is his wont. But nobody has the contempt for the fourth estate that infuses Mr Ross Perot, the purest of populists. He wants no filter between himself and his public and is convinced that the media distorts every self-evident truth he speaks. This is why his campaign relies so much on paid-for 'infomercials', in which only he gets to talk. The extent of this consuming passion was more than evident on Thursday, during his latest appearance on Larry King Live, his favourite talk show. He launched into an endless digression on why it was wrong for the ABC network to ask him to choose between two programmes he had been booked for. 'I've got a say in this,' he said, implying that ABC, which could hardly give him more 'free' air time than his opposition, did not. In reality, the candidates protest too much. When all is said and done, this has not been a 'soundbite' election campaign, not only because of the televised debates but because the proliferation of new media and programme outlets has allowed all of them to talk the hind legs off a donkey. This weekend, President Bush is even appearing on MTV, the pop music channel. Also, after a bit of initial huffing and puffing about displacement, the establishment media really has not minded that much. If nothing else, talk shows are a way of finding out what the great electorate and the candidates do think. And some of the press corps really did heed the little old lady's request in Winston-Salem.</p>

			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Aiming to make the city's housing-inspection program self-sufficient, the San  Diego City Council has voted to increase permit fees for apartment owners an  average of 20% next year.  </P> <P> Besides those higher charges, which will generate an estimated $1.8 million  more yearly, the council also voted Tuesday to establish, for the first time,  an annual $18 permit fee for individuals who rent out single-family homes and  duplexes.  </P> <P> Another $1 per unit surcharge approved by the council will raise about $265,000  annually to pay for expansion of the city's Drug Abatement Response Team  program, which is intended to reduce drug dealing and related problems in  rental properties.  </P> <P> Under the council's action, average permit fees -- which pay for inspectors who  investigate complaints of substandard housing -- will increase from slightly  under $4 to about $4.65. The additional revenue produced through the higher  fees will enable the city's housing-inspection program, which now requires  about a $1.4-million annual subsidy, to pay for itself.  </P></p>

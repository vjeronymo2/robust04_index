			<p>BFN     [Text] The two sides in the ethnic fighting within the  United Liberation Movement, ULIMO, have agreed to a cease-fire,  with immediate effect. The frontline commanders of the Krahns  and Mandingos involved in the fighting are to begin withdrawing  their troops from the main highway linking the Liberian capital,  Monrovia, to Tubmanburg, ULIMO headquarters.    According to the agreement, ULIMO are to remove all of their  checkpoints and turn over areas captured by them to the Nigerian  contingent of the multi-African national peacekeeping force,  ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire  Monitoring Group]. Hundreds of ULIMO fighters have been killed,  along with civilians, in the Tubmanburg area since the outbreak  of hostilities between the Krahns and Mandingos over two months  ago.    The ULIMO ethnic fighting has resulted in the displacement  of  more than 7,000 civilians from Bomi County. A cease-fire  agreement by ULIMO factions follows stern warning by the West  African peacekeeping force to their leaders, Alhaji Koromah and  Roosevelt Johnson, to stop the fighting or expect serious  military measures.    Meanwhile, ECOMOG deputy field commander, Brigadier General  John Addah, says the two ULIMO warlords are expected to meet in  the Liberian capital, Monrovia, on Monday [9 May] to sort out  the obstacles to peace in ULIMO. However, Koromah fighters have  forwarded three conditions, rather the Krahn fighters have put  forward three conditions, for ending the fighting. The Krahn  commander, Roosevelt Johnson, says Alhaji Koromah will have to  withdraw all those initially appointed to the Liberian National  Transitional Government and set up a new committee to appoint  other Liberians to occupy ULIMO positions on the government. He  says this is the basis upon which he signed the agreement.</p>

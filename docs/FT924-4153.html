			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Advance reversed on modest selling THE FOUR day run of gains in the London stock market was abruptly reversed yesterday. Although traders maintained that selling pressure was light, the FT-SE Index listed stocks reacted sharply to a batch of discouraging developments. At least two leading securities houses were buyers of the non-Footsie stocks, however and selected demand from the US was reported in the store sector. At the close, the FT-SE Index was down 27.9 t 2,764.1, a shade above the day's low but lacking support after Wall Street had come in with an early loss of 12 point on the Dow Average. London was 17 points off when its day started and could not sustain an attempt to rally during the first hour of trading. But the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which has been lagging the main market, added 6.3 yesterday and trading volume in non-Footsie stocks well exceeded that in Footsie listed shares. Among factors negative for the stock market yesterday, strategists pointed to criticisms of the European exchange rate mechanism from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank. Although sterling remains outside the ERM, currency distress is unhelpful for international investors in equities. However, a US securities house commented that forced devaluations and cuts in national interest rates would help the re-stimulation of the global economy on which the UK stock market is pinning its faith. Weakness in the Hong Kong markes and in global oil prices continued to unsettle some UK stocks and there was a mixed response to a batch of trading statements from blue chip names. Firmness in sterling together with a lower dollar restrained the international stocks. The premium on the December Footsie futures contract, which had been a positive force for equities, was reined in yesterday, when the contract fell back below the 2,800 mark briefly gained in the previous session. There was a modest sell-off in shares in the afternoon when the market also took aboard warnings against over-confidence on economic growth from both GATT and the European Commission. However, the selling bout was soon over, although share prices made little recovery. Seaq reported trading volume remained high at 624.2m shares against 631.1m, with yesterday's total boosted by good volume in the smaller stocks. Tuesday's retail business was worth Pounds 1.2bn, re-emphasising the weight of investment cash now moving through the stock market. Trading results from Bass, the brewing group, were not well-received in the stock market but Granada, the entertainments company, rose sharply on its profits statement. Traders noted that neither factor appeared to shift the market's overall view of the consumer sectors, which remained relatively steady yesterday. Market strategists appeared alarmed by the shakeout which was regarded as only to be expected after the recent advance. Some believe that confidence could be tested after Christmas if the French and German economies remain sluggish. However, equity chartists believe that the Footsie could be tested down to the mid-2,600 range without abandoning its currently bullish stance.</p>

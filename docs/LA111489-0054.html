			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPAN'S TRADE SURPLUS TAKES RECORD DROP  </P> <P> Japan's trade surplus plunged 39.4% to $4.66 billion in October from $7.68  billion a year earlier, the largest fall ever recorded, the Finance Ministry  said Monday.  </P> <P> Booming demand for imports, dramatically weaker exports and a strong dollar  were behind the data, economists said. They expected the total 1989 surplus to  narrow markedly from last year.  </P> <P> "We should see a significant decline this year," said Soichi Enkyo, an  economist at Bank of Tokyo.  </P> <P> "These are made-to-order numbers, and they get Japan off the hook for the GATT  meeting this week," said Ken Courtis, senior economist at DB Capital Markets  (Asia).  </P> <P> A meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade starts Wednesday in  Tokyo. The world trade body will discuss disputes including those arising from  Japan's large trade surplus.  </P> <P> International Trade and Industry Minister Hikaru Matsunaga was quoted as saying  Monday that the surplus would narrow to about $84 billion in 1989 from $95  billion last year.  </P> <P> "It's not so much that exports are collapsing, but that imports are up,"  Courtis said.  </P> <P> Imports in October surged 16.3% from a year earlier to $18.33 billion.  Economists said exports sank to their lowest level since June, 1985, shrinking  1.9% to $22.99 billion.  </P> <P> Strong Japanese domestic demand for wood, timber, pulp, paper, natural gas and  other raw materials helped boost imports, analysts said. Crude oil imports  surged.  </P> <P> "Strong Japanese domestic demand is helping import growth," said Chiharu  Sumita, economist at investment house UBS Phillips &amp; Drew International.  </P> <P> Analysts noted a 30.6% rise in imports from the European Community in October.  </P></p>

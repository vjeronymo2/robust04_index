			<p>BFN     [Text] Tashkent April 19 ITAR-TASS -- The expansion of  bilateral trade and economic cooperation and the restoration of  the ancient silk way linking China to the Central Asian  countries was in the focus of talks between President Islam  Karimov of Uzbekistan and Chinese Premier Li Peng here today.  Chinese diplomats in the Uzbek capital told ITAR-TASS that the  talks also deal with regional and international problems.    On Tuesday morning the Chinese premier laid flowers at the  monument to great poet and thinker Alisher Navoy.    Both countries now have more ground for further deepening  friendly relations, Islam Karimov said at the state dinner in  honour of the Chinese leader on Monday. He called on the  numerous entrepreneurs, who accompanied the Chinese premier to  establish direct ties with enterprises in Uzbekistan. Islam  Karimov pointed to "great successes of the great Chinese people"  in reforming their economy and said that "the people of  Uzbekistan have a great interest in everything that is taking  place in China".    According to Karimov, Li Peng's visit contributes to the  beginning of a new era in relations between the two countries.    Li Peng recalled that the two countries are "close  neighbours  and countries with ancient civilisations" and said a new period  of relations between them began after Uzbekistan proclaimed  independence. China, he stressed, needs "a good international  situation to accomplish its own modernisation. For this reason  China pays great attention to the development of relations with  the neighbouring countries.    The Chinese premier supported the proposal to restore the  silk way as a means of developing trade, economic and cultural  ties between the two countries. "China intends to make efforts  to achieve this end," he said.    China, a considerable part of whose territory, particularly  the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, is populated by Muslims,  is seriously concerned about the spread of Islamic  fundamentalism in the Asian republics of the former USSR.  Xinjiang has long been known as harbouring strong separatist  tendencies under Islamic slogans.    Li Peng, whose foreign trip will also take him to  Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and Mongolia, is being  accompanied on the tour by chairman of the State Committee for  Nationalities Ismail Aimat, an ethnic Uygur, who stands for the  country's Muslim population in the Chinese leadership.    The head of the Chinese Government arrived for a three-day  official visit to the capital of Uzbekistan on Monday.</p>

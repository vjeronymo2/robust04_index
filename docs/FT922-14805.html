			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / UK Company News: M&amp;G buys 11% of Recovery income shares Trading in shares in the M&amp;G Recovery Investment Trust started yesterday afternoon. By the close of trading, the M&amp;G Group held 14.482m income shares, equivalent to 11.16 per cent of the total income shares on issue. M&amp;G Securities, a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, accounted for 12.882m of these shares. The company said this represented confidence by its fund managers that the shares were a 'good buy', and that they would make a suitable home for part of the company's reserves. M&amp;G's purchases helped stabilise the income shares which had a turbulent day on the market, opening on 35p, falling to 34 1/2 p but then recovering to 35p. Private investors, at whom the launch was targeted, mostly held packaged units including income shares, zero dividend preference shares, and capital shares. The packaged units, priced at 100p, closed at 97p.</p>

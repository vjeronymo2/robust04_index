			<p>BFN     [Text] A Central China Development Symposium was held in  Wuhan from 18 to 19 June.    The symposium was attended by representatives from several  Central China provinces; Chen Yaobang, State Planning Commission  vice minister; and Wang Shengtie, provincial party committee  standing committee member and provincial vice governor.    Chen Yaobang and Wang Shengtie delivered speeches at the  symposium.    The symposium concluded: Central China possesses boundless  economic development potential.    At the symposium, representatives from Hunan Province, Hubei  Province, Henan Province, Anhui Province, Jiangxi Province, and  Wuhan City joined economic experts from the State Council  Development Research Center, the Chang Jiang Water Conservancy  Commission, the State Planning Commission, and other state  departments concerned in exploring and discussing a new Central  China development strategy.    The symposium participants held: The five Central China  provinces have always been China's key agricultural commodities  production bases and have been rich in energy resources, raw and  processed goods and materials, labor resources, and advanced and  convenient communications systems as well, thus being of  strategic importance to the country's economic development.  Exploitation and opening up of Central China will be an  inevitable result of China's coastal opening up. The  exploitation and opening up of Central China will not only  provide the country's industrialization with an important  guarantee but also promote rejuvenation and development of the  country's hinterland, thereby enhancing the country's national  economic reserve strength.    The symposium participants maintained: Located in the middle  and lower reaches of the Chang Jiang and along the Chang Jiang,  Hubei should strive to firmly seize the excellent opportunity at  the moment to learn from Shanghai's Pudong by simultaneously  opening up to the outside world and domestic regions and  simultaneously making full use of foreign and domestic  resources; open up more overseas and domestic markets;  expeditiously carry out multilevel, multichannel, and  omnidirectional opening up; encourage areas where conditions  allow to develop faster and relatively prosperous areas to  assist relatively backward areas; bring into full play the  radiation role of each and every key city and key development  zone; energetically develop a regional economy; speed up  regional industrial structural readjustment; and further improve  regional economic quality with an eye to pressing ahead with the  economic development of the entire Chang Jiang Valley.    The symposium also disclosed: The state will this year draw  up a regional economic development plan aimed at boosting the  economic development of Hubei Province, Henan Province, Hunan  Province, Jiangxi Province, and Anhui Province.</p>

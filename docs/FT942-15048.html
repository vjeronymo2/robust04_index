			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / EBRD credit to rocket group The European Bank for Reconstruction (EBRD), designed to help finance eastern Europe's post-cold war transition to a market economy, yesterday signed a (Pounds 7m) credit line for a privatised Russian company which used to make inter-continental missiles aimed at western targets. Mr Jacques de Larosiere, president of the slimmed-down and re-focused bank, and Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, began the bank's annual meeting yesterday with the formal signature in St Petersburg of a deal which backs the first use of a Russian Proton rocket as the launcher for a western communications satellite. Mr Ron Freeman, the bank's first vice-president, hailed the deal as the bank's first venture into the conversion of the military aerospace industry. Apart from agreeing the standby facility for Khrunichev, the Russian aerospace company, the bank also helped to secure a waiver of former Cocom restrictions needed to import the Dollars 36m high-tech Inmarsat satellite into Russia for launching in 1995 and in obtaining insurance through Lloyd's in London, he added. Saab/Scania of Sweden is adapting the satellite for launch at a cost of Dollars 10m. The EBRD has committed over Dollars 560m to projects in Russia and disbursed over Dollars 100m.</p>

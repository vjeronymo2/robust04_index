			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEAMSTERS SPLIT DESPITE SUIT ACCORD;  </P> <P> NO. 2 OFFICIAL HITS SETTLEMENT WITH U.S. BY UNION LEADERS  </P> <P> Fratricidal warfare in the Teamsters Union, precipitated by the Justice  Department's anti-racketeering suit against the 1.6-million-member union, has  intensified, despite the fact that the case was settled last month.  </P> <P> On Monday, Teamster officials all over the country received a letter from  Teamsters Secretary-Treasurer Weldon L. Mathis, the union's No. 2 official,  attacking the settlement that Teamster President William J. McCarthy and 10  Teamster vice presidents approved March 13.  </P> <P> Last week, McCarthy and his general counsel, James T. Grady, held meetings  around the country defending the settlement, attempting to minimize its impact  on the union and vociferously attacking Mathis as a traitor to the union for  making a separate settlement with the government earlier in March.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Presser Attacked  </P> <P> Sources attending the meetings also said that McCarthy attacked his  predecessor, the late Jackie Presser, as a "stool pigeon" because Presser had  served as an FBI informant for nearly a decade.  </P> <P> In addition, persons attending meetings on the settlement said they were given  the impression that top Teamster leaders will campaign against direct,  secret-ballot election of union officers in 1991. Changing the Teamster  constitution to hold elections this way was one of the key provisions of the  settlement that was reached on March 13.  </P> <P> Mathis' letter defends his own conduct and a settlement he and Teamster Vice  Presidents Donald West of Birmingham, Ala., and Edward Lawson of Vancouver,  Canada, reached with the government, where they pledge to support direct  election of union officers.  </P> <P> "The essential difference between the five-page agreement entered into by Vice  Presidents Lawson, West and me and the 30-page McCarthy consent order is that  our agreement did not relinquish control of our union to the government," the  Mathis letter states.  </P> <P> "The McCarthy agreement, for example, provides the court-appointed  administrator with authority over such things as appointments, expenditures and  union contracts; ours did not," the letter adds.  </P> <P> The letter also attacks McCarthy for bringing a proposed settlement to the  Teamster executive board that would have required five executive board members  to resign. The board unanimously rejected the proposal, and ultimately the  government dropped that demand.  </P> <P> (However, in connection with the settlement, Teamster Vice President Donald  Peters of Chicago agreed to resign, and Vice President Harold Friedman of  Cleveland agreed to take a leave of absence until appeals of his criminal  conviction are concluded.)  </P> <P> Other Teamster officials and attorneys say that the Mathis letter misrepresents  the union's settlement with the government. One characterized the letter as  "the start of Mathis' campaign to run for president against McCarthy in 1991."  </P> <P> Last July, in a special election held by the board after the death of Presser,  McCarthy defeated Mathis, 9 to 8, to be the new president. Mathis had been  Presser's choice to succeed him and had been considered the likely winner until  the day before the vote. Sources close to Mathis say that he was deeply  embittered about his surprise defeat.  </P> <P> The Teamsters' settlement with the Justice Department does not relinquish  control of the union to the government, but it does provide that three  court-appointed officials will have the power to review union appointments and  expenditures until the union's convention in 1991, with an eye toward  preventing any corruption.  </P> <P> In a Teamster brochure on the settlement, Grady states that a court-appointed  investigations officer can "look for corruption anywhere he can find it within  the IBT (International Brotherhood of Teamsters)." The investigator can look at  Teamster books and records and interview persons who may have information on  allegations of corruption.  </P> <P> At the meetings last week, Grady told Teamster officials that only Mathis, West  and Lawson are obligated to support direct elections when that issue comes up  for a vote at the 1991 convention. In the past, top Teamster officers have been  elected by voice vote of delegates at conventions held every five years.  </P> <P> The settlement provides that the union's constitution be amended to provide for  direct secret-ballot election of these officers. However, the settlement also  provides that changes to the constitution are to be ratified by delegates at  the 1991 convention.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Free-Speech Rights  </P> <P> The settlement also provides that the Teamster board members do not surrender  any of their free-speech rights in regard to terms of the settlement, and Grady  reiterated that point in explaining the settlement to persons who attended the  meetings in Washington, Chicago, Los Angeles and Memphis, Tenn.  </P> <P> This left many attending with the impression that Teamster board members will  campaign against a change in election procedures.  </P> <P> When asked about this possibility, Randy M. Mastro, the assistant U.S. attorney  in New York who was the chief prosecutor in the case, said: "That system  (direct elections) is now part of the Teamster constitution and not subject to  change, without prior government approval," or court approval.  </P> <P> "In the event the Teamsters are in breach (of the agreement), the government  retains its right to enforce the order," seek a contempt order against the  union or reopen the litigation, Mastro said.  </P> <P> Today, Mastro, McCarthy and Grady are all scheduled to testify at a hearing by  the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations on the government's use of  the Racketeer-Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) to impose  trusteeships on labor unions and other entities.  </P> <P> Staff writer Ronald J. Ostrow in Washington contributed to this story.  </P></p>

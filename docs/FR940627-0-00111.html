			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Introduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Over 2,300 fuels and 4,800 fuel additives were registered by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA as of March 1994 and, to some degree, each of them produces  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions which may contribute to potentially harmful air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pollution. The primary purpose of today's rule is to establish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registration requirements which will provide information for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identifying and evaluating the potential adverse effects of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designated F/FA emissions and for guiding the direction of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related regulatory actions in the future as specified in section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 211 of the CAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Previous actions have implemented CAA sections 211(a) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 211(b)(1), which govern the general registration of F/FAs, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> well as CAA section 211(f). Today's rule amends 40 CFR part 79  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by adding regulatory provisions requiring the testing of F/FAs as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a requirement for registration, as stipulated in section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 211(b)(2) and section 211(e) of the CAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addressing these additional statutory provisions, this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule focuses on the identification and evaluation of potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse health effects associated with F/FA evaporative and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combustion emissions. The required health effects evaluation is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organized in a tiered structure, and includes emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characterization, literature search, and biological testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. Although this testing framework focuses on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation of health effects, F/FA manufacturers are also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to perform data searches to obtain information on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential welfare effects of F/FA emissions. In addition, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will continue to use existing procedures under CAA section 211(f)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the evaluation of potential effects of F/FAs on ECS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ultimate use of the registration information to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted in compliance with this rule is to guide EPA in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential future regulatory actions under CAA section 211(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 211(c) provides authority for the possible control or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibition of any fuel or fuel additive whose emission products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cause or contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anticipated to endanger the public health or welfare. Evidence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of adverse effects of F/FA emissions on ECS performance, obtained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under CAA section 211(f) or from other sources, could also be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used by EPA to support such regulatory decisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Legal Authority and Statutory History  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The legal authority for the F/FA registration program is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided by section 211 of the CAA. Section 211(a), 42 U.S.C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 7545, authorizes EPA to designate any fuel or fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additive and prohibits manufacturers of designated fuels or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additives from selling such products unless they have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registered by EPA in accordance with CAA section 211(b). In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1975, EPA issued regulations (40 CFR part 79) implementing basic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registration requirements, as stipulated by CAA section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 211(b)(1), that included: commercial identifying information,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> range of concentration, purpose-in-use, and chemical composition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 211(b)(2) of the CAA also gives EPA discretionary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority to establish additional registration requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to this section, EPA ``may also require the manufacturer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of any fuel or fuel additive to conduct tests to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential public health effects of such fuel or fuel additive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (including, but not limited to, carcinogenic, teratogenic, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mutagenic effects),'' and to furnish other ``reasonable and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary'' information to identify F/FA emissions and determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their effects on vehicular emission control performance and on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the public health and welfare. The statute further stipulates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that testing for health effects is to be conducted according to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures and protocols established by the Administrator, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that test results will not be considered confidential. Once the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer has completed registration requirements and has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> given assurances that the Agency will be notified of future  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes in that information, CAA section 211(b)(3) directs the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator to register the fuel or fuel additive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA did not exercise its discretionary authority to require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing of F/FAs under CAA section 211(b)(2) as part of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general registration regulations issued in 1975. However, in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CAA Amendments of 1977 (PL 95&hyph;95, August 7, 1977), Congress added  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 211(e), which made implementation of section 211(b)(2)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mandatory and contained additional provisions requiring the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation of the regulations within one year of enactment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the CAA Amendments. In an effort to fulfill this requirement,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA published an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in 1978 (see 43 FR 38607, August 29, 1978; Docket ORD&hyph;78&hyph;01).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the rulemaking process did not go forward during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> next ten years and the rule was not finalized. Nevertheless,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this action remained on EPA's regulatory agenda and a development  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plan for the rulemaking was created in 1988.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1989, a citizens group brought a lawsuit [ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Thomas  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Browner, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  C.A. No. 89&hyph;6269 (D. Oreg. 1989)] challenging EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure to promulgate F/FA testing regulations within the one- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year deadline stipulated in CAA section 211(e). EPA entered into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a Consent Decree in settlement of this lawsuit which, together  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with subsequent modifications, established the rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schedule. Accordingly, a new ANPRM was published on August 7,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1990 (55 FR 32218) and a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published on April 15, 1992 (57 FR 13168). Public hearings as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> well as periods for written commentary followed both of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publications. On February 24, 1994, EPA published a Notice of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reopening of Comment Period (59 FR 8886) requesting public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment on several compliance-related and technical issues that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needed clarification and/or reconsideration. Today's action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> culminates the rulemaking process by promulgating F/FA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registration requirements under CAA sections 211(b)(2) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 211(e).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

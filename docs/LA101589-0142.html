			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BACKUP TORRETTA LEADS NO. 2 MIAMI  </P> <P> A record passing performance by Miami Hurricane freshman Gino Torretta may not  be enough to keep him from going back to the bench.  </P> <P> Torretta, making his second start for injured Craig Erickson, threw for 468  yards Saturday to break Bernie Kosar's one-game school record in a 48-16  victory over San Jose State.  </P> <P> Erickson, who broke a knuckle on his throwing hand two weeks ago, hopes to be  healthy when No. 2 Miami (6-0) plays its next game, Oct. 28 at No. 19 Florida  State.  </P> <P> Coach Dennis Erickson said Craig Erickson remains Miami's No. 1 quarterback.  But the coach also said he's undecided about who will start against the  Seminoles.  </P> <P> "If Craig is healthy and 100 percent, then we're going to make a decision," the  coach said. "We're going to take a look at it. What we want to do is play the  guy that's going to win games for us."  </P> <P> Against San Jose State (2-3), Torretta completed 32 of 49 passes and converted  10 of 15 third-down situations. He repeatedly beat the Spartans' blitzes and  passed for touchdowns covering 18 yards to Lamar Thomas, 38 yards to Wesley  Carroll and 17 yards to Randy Bethel.  </P> <P> Torretta, who came off the bench to help beat Michigan State and started last  week's 56-0 victory over Cincinnati, hopes he has changed the perception that  he is Miami's backup quarterback.  </P> <P> "If I haven't, I don't know what I can do to change it," he said. "I'm not  worried about who's going to start, who's going to play. I'm just worried about  beating Florida State."  </P> <P> Torretta's 13-yard pass to Randall Hill early in the fourth quarter broke  Kosar's record of 447 yards, set in the famous Hail Flutie loss to Boston  College in 1984.  </P> <P> "After I threw the pass, someone said congratulations," Torretta said. "I  didn't know what they were talking about. But if we hadn't won, it wouldn't  have mattered anyway."  </P> <P> Defense also played a big role as Miami denied San Jose State a first down on  nine of its 12 possessions and gave up only 215 yards.  </P> <P> "Miami is the best team I have ever coached against, perhaps the best I will  ever face," said San Jose State's Claude Gilbert, a college head coach for 14  seasons. "Our guys played the best they could."  </P> <P> The Hurricanes led, 17-8, at halftime and scored 24 unanswered points on their  first four possessions in the second half.  </P> <P> San Jose State scored in the second quarter on a 35-yard pass-and-run play from  Matt Veatch to Kevin Evans, and late in the fourth quarter on a two-yard pass  from Ralph Martini to James Courtney. The Spartans also scored two two-point  conversions.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Department's Work Experience and Career Exploration Program (WECEP), which began in 1969, 14- and 15-year-old enrollees were initially permitted to work up to 28 hours per week when school was in session and up to 4 hours on a school day, any portion of which could be during school hours. Studies of WECEP indicated that limited labor market experience in a controlled school setting had a definite positive impact on the scholastic performance and school attendance of participating 14- and 15-year-old students. These studies also established that the optimum hours_at which students attained the greatest educational benefits_were fewer than the maximum hours originally allowed. As a result, in 1975, the permissible hours of employment under WECEP were reduced to 3 hours per day and 23 hours per week, and these revised standards were adopted in final regulations published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on September 3, 1975. See 29 CFR 570.35a(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department is also aware that some employers of young workers have adopted special programs designed to achieve complementary integration of educational and work experiences. Such employers may, for example, ascertain young workers' grade point averages (GPA) at the time of hiring; arrange work schedules, subject to parental consent, to accommodate the scholastic needs of students; allow young workers to study at the workplace; give bonuses for superior academic achievement or school attendance; monitor young workers' academic performance and school attendance during employment; and ensure that students, prior to hiring, know their employment rights and the regulations applicable to minors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department seeks comments on whether there is a need for changes in the requirements of Child Labor Reg. 3 for students participating in programs under statewide School-to-Work Opportunities systems advocated by the School-to-Work initiative jointly sponsored by the Departments of Education and Labor (see 59 FR 5266 (February 3, 1994) and 59 FR 11154 (March 9, 1994)). Programs developed under this initiative are intended to give youth access to education and training opportunities that will prepare them for high-skill, high-wage careers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department, for the reasons discussed above, is particularly interested in obtaining public comment on the appropriateness and feasibility of the following matters:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Should greater flexibility be allowed in the permissible hours of work for 14- and 15-year-olds whose employers have a formal ``employer-parent-school'' program that links meaningful work experiences with support for the attainment of the student-employee's educational goals and ongoing academic performance? Commenters are requested to include specific recommendations as to the standards or criteria that should be considered for inclusion in any future rulemaking to define such special programs, and as to the changes in permissible work hours that would be appropriate for 14- and 15-year-olds whose employers maintain such programs. Commenters are also requested to provide information regarding the implications for employer recordkeeping that might be necessary for the Department to monitor compliance with the standards for any such programs, and recommendations for how these recordkeeping requirements should be addressed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The current regulations contain an end-of-day restriction of 7 p.m. on days when school is in session. A less restrictive time of 9 p.m. is permitted during the summer vacation period defined in the regulations as June 1 through the Labor Day holiday. When school is in session, the regulations make no distinction between a day preceding a school day and one preceding a non-school day, i.e., typically Fridays, Saturdays, and days before a school holiday. Should there be different restrictions on times of work on days preceding a non-school day and, if so, why? Would any such changes interfere with the schooling, health, or well-being of young workers? If an end-of-day restriction different from 7 p.m. is appropriate on days preceding a non-school day, what should the time restriction be on such days, and why? Should the Department consider a later end-of-day time for work during the summer months when school is not in session? If so, what should that time be and why?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The regulations currently limit the daily hours that may be worked by 14- and 15-year-olds to 3 hours on days when school is in session; 8 hours when school is not in session. Should a distinction be made in the number of hours that may be worked on a day preceding a non-school day (typically Friday, Saturday, and the day before a school holiday) and, if so, how many hours should be permitted and why?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Weekly hours for 14- and 15-year-olds are limited by the regulations to 18 hours when school is in session. While some States permit more hours, only two limit permissible weekly hours to less than the 18-hour standard, one to 16 and another to 15. On the other hand, the child labor reform bill pending in the U.S. House of Representatives (H.R. 1106) and the Model state law drafted by the Child Labor Coalition would limit the number of hours that may be worked each week to 15. Should the existing Federal standard be changed and, if so, how many hours should be permitted and why? Should a distinction be made for those weeks when school is in session less than five days?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei fails to close above the 17,000 level SHARE prices ended marginally higher after index-linked buying by investment trusts overcame selling by arbitrageurs, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average closed 83.85 higher at 16,987.66 after a low of 16,821.36 and a high of 17,050.25. Volume rose slightly to 200m shares from 182m. Declines led advances by 488 to 391 with 194 unchanged, the Topix index of all first section stocks lost 2.12 to 1,290.87 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.29 to 1,040.62. Hopes of lower interest rates were fanned by lower money market rates. The overnight uncollateralised call rate fell to 4.03 per cent yesterday, the lowest since February, 1989. However, some analysts expect only a limited easing in monetary policy. Mr Peter Tasker, strategist at Kleinwort Benson, said that negative fundamentals, such as the stagnant property market and lower corporate profits, would weigh down share prices even if the official discount rate were to be lowered. He added that the near-term ceiling for the Nikkei would be 19,000. Activity was also constrained by the September money supply figures, which were announced after the market closed, indicating negative growth for the first time ever. Some interest rate-sensitive, large-capital issues were bought on hopes of lower interest rates. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the most active stock of the day, gained Y3 to Y553 and Nippon Steel gained Y4 to Y293. Power utilities, also regarded as beneficiaries of lower rates, were in demand, with Tokyo Electric Power rising Y10 to Y2,630. Food companies, whose profits have not been affected by the economic downturn so far, were firm. Kikkoman, the soy sauce maker, gained Y12 to Y967, and House Food Industrial advanced Y20 to Y2,130. Hyogo Bank, a regional bank in western Japan, which announced a restructuring plan to deal with financial problems at its three non-bank subsidiaries, plunged Y191 from Friday's close to Y559. Hyogo failed to trade on Monday, due to a flood of sell orders. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 48.11 to 18,661.56 in volume of 11.4m shares. Roundup AFTERNOON profit-taking took a number of markets in the region off their day's highs yesterday. HONG KONG's gains on Monday's appearance of the senior Chinese leader, Deng Xiaoping, at the communist party congress in Beijing were wiped out by afternoon selling and the Hang Seng index finished 1.40 lower at 6,088.51 after an intraday high of 6,167.02. Selling began shortly after the Hang Seng broke above the record closing high of 6,162.53 set in July, although brokers said many local investors were taking profits ahead of Governor Chris Patten's visit to Beijing, where he is expected to get a cold reception from Chinese officials angered by his plans to expand democracy in the colony. AUSTRALIA also finished off its highs, but still stronger on the day in light trading led by technical support and futures activity. The All Ordinaries index closed 9.3 higher at 1,426.9 in relatively low turnover of ADollars 200.6m. Despite a small upturn in world bullion prices, the golds index dropped 20.8 to 982.7, hit by political uncertainty and civil unrest in Papua New Guinea. The joint owners of the Porgera gold mine suffered the most, with Placer Pacific falling 14 cents to ADollars 1.86, Highland Gold losing 10 to 86 cents, although Renison finished steady at ADollars 3.50. MANILA slid further on the Philippines power crisis, kidnappings and coup rumours, the composite index losing 13.20 to 1,344.41. TAIWAN, however, rescued itself from an earlier slump, the weighted index closing 10.34 lower at 3,724.17 after a fall of 50 points at one stage. BANGKOK was cheered by the resumption of trading in Bangkok Bank of Commerce, which drew buying in other banks as the SET index rose 10.34, or 1.2 per cent to 878.68 in turnover of Bt8.3bn. Bangkok Bank of Commerce, suspended by its management's request since October 12, was the most active stock as it gained Bt2.50 to Bt29.50 in turnover of Bt508m. BOMBAY fell on arbitrage selling as the market re-opened after Friday's brokers' boycott and Monday's closure for settlement work. The BSE index fell 35.55 to 3,050.90 on reports that tax officials had seized unaccounted assets worth Rs8bn, including shares worth Rs7.6bn, from 14 brokers raided last week.</p>

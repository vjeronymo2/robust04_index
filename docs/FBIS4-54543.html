			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Peter Boross by Laszlo </F> Fabian; place and date not given: "What We Did Is the Future!"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Fabian] Mr. Boross, one  cannot rule out the possibility that the left will come to power  after the elections. How stable would such a government be and  how much time would it be able to survive?    [Boross] In principle, we must take every possibility into  account, but I hope only in principle. There are also  differences. The Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] will not find  such an easy ally as that one found by the Polish socialists.  The MSZP will have a lot of problems if it wins, because the  phase of unpopular measures has not yet come to an end. The  Socialists will also have to take unpopular measures, just as we  did; otherwise, they will cause big problems for themselves and  the country as well. If they were more cautious with their  promises and abstained from empty political cliches, their  advance would perhaps not be so alarming. It is not the current  situation, but the prospects for the future that concern me. At  the same time, it is extremely important to preserve democratic  values, and this requires elections. Free elections are the  determining basis of democracy. We must accept the fact that  some people might not understand the historic steps that have  taken place now.    [Fabian] In your opinion, what are the chances of  cooperation between the Christian national forces?    [Boross] If I think of historical analogies, I am  pessimistic. The meeting in Szarszo was convened with similar  slogans; nevertheless, it mostly turned into an excluding  meeting. They excluded the major forces of the Christian  national trend. I think that those who are now declaring a  program have spoiled something. This is quite painful. It is  unfortunate that there are people among those who represent one  trend who come up with bad formulations and make dangerous  formulations from both the international and domestic point of  view. Their formulations are risky. Strong attacks have begun  from within, and the situation is depressing. I must ask where  Jozsef Torgyan belongs, whose activity leads to the fact that he  cannot keep any one of his promises, because he made himself  unable to join a coalition. Therefore, no matter what he says,  the audience must know that nothing will come out of it because  he does not have the power to carry this out; no one will form  an alliance with him. I do not have rosy hopes regarding any  collaboration; instead, I feel a division. This is the real  risk. We know that the left will subordinate everything to its  desire to return to power. [passage omitted]    [Fabian] Political analysts say that two cycles represent  the "wearing out time" of a government in a democracy. This can  even be shorter under certain circumstances, as in the case of a  change in the regime. Are there any resources left for a new  government cycle?    [Boross] Regarding its personnel, a government automatically  undergoes changes in the first cycle. A government can become  worn out by its own awkwardness or by a discrediting campaign  like the one we have experienced in the past four years. Here  we should take a look back to what this country was like in 1990  and how it is now, regarding property relations, administration,  legal independence, constitutional order, and international  relations. We can say that this government has not become worn  out, because it has actually created the conditions for economic  progress under normal and humane circumstances. Fortunately,  there are similar governments in major Western European  countries. Therefore, our foreign contacts are rather positive.  As a propaganda ploy, one can say that the government has  reached the point when it has to be replaced, but a sober  observer looks at what would happen to this country if a change  in direction took place immediately after four years. [passage  omitted]    [Fabian] How is Antall's heritage present in today's  Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF]?    [Boross] It is strongly present, and it is a very good  feeling for me. His personality was suitable for remembering  him in a theatrical way, but this is not what happened. Antall  is present inside the party, at meetings when there is a need to  quote him. This MDF will advance together with Jozsef Antall's  ideas.    [Fabian] If the MDF is again in the position to form a  government after the elections, what partners can it count on?    [Boross] First of all, the Christian Democratic People's  Party is our natural ally. The United Smallholders' Party could  also be another ally, a party that has governing successes and,  with its seriousness, it might be able to win over the sympathy  of village smallholders.</p>

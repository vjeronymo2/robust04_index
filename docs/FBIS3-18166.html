That's  because this intervention shows determination to promote the UN  process, which is enforced with the joint call issued by the  United States and Russia to the two sides to show "political  will and realism for agreement on the CBM's."    U.S. Ambassador Richard Boucher rejected the evaluation that  there is an impasse in the talks on the CBM's, stressing that  things are not idle but that "much work is being done."    We do not know the content of the American proposals but we  trust they do not affect the basis of the talks and do not lift  the security norms that prevent the CBM's from being interpreted  as a direct or indirect recognition of the pseudostate. The  United States is the only superpower able, with its interstate  relations, not to bend the principles of international law and  not to come into conflict with the UN Security Council  resolutions.    We want to believe that the increased American interest  stems  from the possibilities thrown up by some assurances given to  President Bill Clinton by [Turkish Prime Minister Tansu] Ciller.  These assurances are now on trial to test their practical  implementation.    This newspaper has repeatedly stressed the importance of  U.S.  intervention as the most powerful way out of the stalemate. The  White House will and determination to promote a just solution is  known. The road to an agreement cannot be mined with demands  that would overturn the basic principles and directives of the  United Nations, certainly not those contained in the Security  Council resolutions. President Glavkos Kliridhis emphasized  that the assurance that the discussion of the CBM's take place  on condition, among other things, that UN Security Council  Resolution 541, which condemns the declaration of the  pseudostate, demands its dissolution, and calls on all UN  members not to recognize it, is effected. The United States has  repeatedly declared that the status quo in Cyprus is  "internationally unacceptable."    Consequently, both the suggestion of the U.S. ambassador and  the joint U.S.-Russian call for political will and realism  cannot imply that our side surpass the security limits described  in the Security Council's directives for one federated, bizonal  state with a single international identity and the exclusion of  any possibility of separation and final division.    President Kliridhis has the legal knowledge and political  wisdom to deal with any instruction in line with the above,  should any such instruction be expressed by intervention.    Our side's political will is proven. The opposite is true of  the other side, which remains confined to words or appears  contradictory with specific acts of provocative rejection of the  international element's instructions.    President Kliridhis' statement that no Cyprus solution can  depend on Turkey's will, but on the will of the Security  Council, particularly of its permanent members, should be seen  as an expression of goodwill in response to the joint  U.S.-Russian call.    That's because our side considers that international law and  order cannot depend on the will of the aggressor, which in our  case seeks to maintain the faits accomplis of the invasion and  occupation.</p>

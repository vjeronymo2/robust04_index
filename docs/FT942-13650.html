			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: 'We're in the money . . .' / Examining the implications of Lloyds' Pounds 1.8bn bid for the C&amp;G building society Investing in a building society these days is rather like a lottery. But, in the case of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, all 1.4m customers and staff are winners from this week's proposed takeover by Lloyds bank, with the Pounds 1.8bn offer to be split among them. If the takeover succeeds, it will be the first time a bank has taken over a society. It is more usual for one of the weaker societies to be taken over by another - a process known, politely, as a 'merger.' Only one society, Abbey National, has turned itself into a bank and only one society, Alliance &amp; Leicester, has acquired a bank - Girobank. After the initial spoils are divided, the benefits should be more competitive mortgage, and higher deposit, rates. C&amp;G will retain its name and its own board but will shed its mutual status to become a public limited company (plc). The idea is that C&amp;G will continue to market its own property loans as well as designing mortgages for Lloyds to sell in its own name. C&amp;G will continue to tell customers seeking financial advice to see an independent adviser; it will not be authorised to recommend Lloyds' products. In any case, Lloyds is tied to its own life company, Black Horse, and customers seeking a mortgage at the bank's branches will be recommended Black Horse products. C&amp;G says there are no plans at present to introduce cash or credit cards. On what does the deal depend? Since C&amp;G is owned by its members, they will have to decide whether to accept although the unprecedently generous financial sweeteners will provide a large incentive to agree. The vote is scheduled for this autumn; if passed, the takeover is expected to be completed next May. But there are also regulatory hurdles. C&amp;G and the Building Societies Commission - the statutory regulator - are going to the High Court to see if the terms of the takeover accord with the 1986 Building Societies Act. Who benefits? Sometimes, sweeteners are confined only to members of a society, but this is not the case here - although voting members of the society stand to gain more than others. Some members are not voting members. Who is a member? Anyone with a mortgage or one of the society's share accounts: Cheltenham Gold, London Share, Instant 7 and Tessa (tax-exempt special savings account, whether maxi or flexi). Children, and those with less than Pounds 100 in their account, are members but do not have voting rights. Who is a voting member? Voting investors must have been a member on December 31 1993, have at least Pounds 100 in a share account 56 days before voting day, and have a share account on voting day. Voting borrowers must have had a mortgage (of at least Pounds 100) on December 31 1994 and still have a mortgage on voting day. What about the rest? Some 60,000 savers are not members. They hold the London Deposit, standard deposit or charity accounts. Benefits to savers The voting members, including trustees, will receive Pounds 500 each on condition they were members at December 31 1993. In addition, they will receive about 10 per cent of the balance in each of their investment and personal deposit accounts, to a maximum of Pounds 10,000 for each. All savers (whether members or not) are entitled to the 10 per cent payout as long as they had the account at March 31 1994. The payment is conditional on savers holding their accounts with the society until completion day. The 10 per cent will be calculated on the lower balance at March 31 1994, or on the completion date. The maximum investors can receive, therefore, is 10 per cent of their balances on the earlier date - but they must make sure a similar amount is in the account on completion day, too. C&amp;G says the average balance of a voting investor at the end of last year was Pounds 12,000, which will mean an average payment of Pounds 1,700 (including the Pounds 500). Non-member savers had a higher average balance of Pounds 25,000 and would, therefore, receive Pounds 2,500. Children qualify for the 10 per cent payout but not the Pounds 500, since they are not voting members. Benefits to borrowers Those who have a mortgage will receive Pounds 500 for each mortgaged property they own as long as they still hold them on completion day. This is in addition to any amounts owing to them as an investor. Anyone with a mortgage from one of the societies taken over by C&amp;G benefits, too. Creditors Holders of permanent interest-bearing shares (Pibs) on or before March 31 1994 are entitled to Pounds 500 (if they are a voting member) as well as 10 per cent of their holding to the Pounds 10,000 maximum. Issues are in Pounds 50,000 batches, which means anyone holding Pibs would receive a minimum of Pounds 5,500. The price of C&amp;G Pibs has gone up, mainly because the stock now has the backing of Lloyds. Investors in Exeter Balanced, a unit trust investing in Pibs which has a Pounds 300,000 holding in C&amp;G Pibs, will find that the Pounds 10,500 will be added to the fund and divided between all unit-holders. How will the money be paid and is it taxable? Savers will receive both the Pounds 500 and the 10 per cent credited to their accounts. Where this cannot be done (for example, in the case of a Tessa), a cheque will be sent. Borrowers with up-to-date mortgage accounts will receive a cheque for Pounds 500 made out to those named on the account. Those in arrears will have the Pounds 500 credited to their account. C&amp;G expects payments to be made in the 1995/96 tax year and that the money will be subject to capital gains (but not income) tax. This is good news for the many savers who do not use up their annual Pounds 5,800 CGT allowance; they will get the bonus tax-free. When will the benefits be paid? Customers will have to wait until the takeover is finalised before they get the benefits. What happens if an account-holder dies? If a mortgage holder dies, his estate will continue to be entitled to Pounds 500 provided the account remained open on completion day. The estates of savers who die (but still have accounts open on completion day) will receive the 10 per cent. But estates of voting members who die before completion will not get the Pounds 500.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            MERGER SWEETENERS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- It was Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester which made merger history in 1989 when it took over Guardian, the then 19th largest society. For the first time, members of a smaller society absorbed by a larger one were given cash compensation. The bonus was good too - 5 per cent of savers' balances. Until then, building society mergers had not involved compensation for members of the smaller society, even though they are the leg al owners of its reserves - the profits accumulated over the years. Abbey National's issue of 100 free shares, worth 130p each, to members at its flotation in July 1989 seemed to have been the catalyst for change.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Acquired BS          Acquirer        Investors***       Borrowers  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bexhill on Sea       Bradford &amp;

			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AGAINST 'B-1 BOB,' FORGET THE DIGNITY;  </P> <P> POLITICS: VETERAN RON KOVIC ASKS FOR A 'CAMPAIGN OF STATESMANSHIP' IF HE RUNS  AGAINST REP. ROBERT DORNAN IN ORANGE COUNTY. HE WILL HAVE TO SETTLE FOR  BRICKBATS.  </P> <P> Ron Kovic, the paralyzed war hero of "Born on the Fourth of July," is readying  for a new firefight. This time, the terrain will not be the jungles of Vietnam  but the John Wayne politics of Orange County. This time, his rival will not be  the Viet Cong but Robert "B-1 Bob" Dornan, the most hawkish member of the U.S.  Congress.  </P> <P> While the 44-year-old combat veteran has yet to formally declare a challenge to  the reelection of the archconservative Dornan, shrapnel has begun to fly.  </P> <P> Kovic, an out-and-out critic of U.S. policy in Vietnam, says he is "deeply  concerned" by the President's decision to invade Panama. "Are we going into  Nicaragua next? Into El Salvador?" He attacks what he calls the "wall of fear"  put up by the Administration and Dornan toward other countries in this  hemisphere.  </P> <P> "It takes more courage to make friends than it does to pull a trigger," he  says. "As a congressman, I would build bridges of friendship with our neighbors  instead of this policy of fear and hostility."  </P> <P> Kovic hopes that his campaign for Congress will "remind people about what  really happened in Vietnam so it won't happen again." Admitting that he is not  a "professional" in the political world, he hopes his challenge to Dornan will  be a "campaign of statesmanship," conducted on a "high plane of dignity."  </P> <P> Not likely. If Kovic wanted a high-toned debate over America's proper role in  the world, he picked the wrong opponent.  </P> <P> Bob Dornan, the man whose congressional seat Kovic has targeted, despises such  second-guessing of American policy. He has particular disdain for those like  Kovic and filmmaker Oliver Stone who portray Americans as "scum" in the world's  eyes.  </P> <P> "If (Kovic) hadn't been shot," says the man with a 100% conservative,  pro-military voting record, "he'd have been strutting about his two tours in  Vietnam."  </P> <P> It gets worse. The 56-year-old Dornan says that the only reason Kovic is  talking about challenging him is to sell more tickets to "Born on the Fourth of  July," the film Kovic co-authored and which is now the country's No. 1  box-office hit.  </P> <P> "He's going to milk this thing for two months. This guy has no idea whatever of  spending the next two years going back and forth to Washington, getting on and  off airplanes. He's just out to hype the movie."  </P> <P> Dornan mocks the Democrats' decision to recruit Kovic for the race against him.  "They saw a wheelchair and said this guy's perfect for Dornan."  </P> <P> He says the Democrats deserve an " 'F' for candidate research." He accuses them  of finding the wrong man to run in the wrong district.  </P> <P> On this, the peripatetic ex-Los Angeles talk-show host may have a point. Orange  County is one of the most conservative areas in the country. Many of its  middle-class voters honor the myth of an unbeatable, untarnished America, a  nation that can do no wrong.  </P> <P> What will Ron Kovic say to such people? How will a man who knows the crippling  defeat and moral destructiveness of America's worst war campaign among her most  ardent patriots?  </P> <P> "I will talk about the building of a new American house," Kovic says without  hesitation, "with a foundation that is based on truth, what we have gone  through as a country and where we are going. I believe people have the strength  of character to face up to this, to turn our wounds into wisdom. They are ready  to be challenged again, just as they were by John F. Kennedy on that cold  January day back in 1960."  </P> <P> Does someone who speaks in such grand phrases know the hell he faces at the  hands of Bob Dornan?  </P> <P> "If I run, it will be an incredible battle, the most difficult challenge of my  life."  </P> <P> For a Marine sergeant who endured the horror of Vietnam and the inhumanity of a  V.A. hospital and who has spent almost three decades in a wheelchair, this may  indeed be an overstatement. Anyone who has been through what Kovic has can  survive whatever brickbats "B-1 Bob" may throw at him.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] According to the provincial commission for  production safety, the province is facing a serious situation in  this area. Various types of accidents have occurred time and  again. Last year, accidents in eight major categories caused  more than 2,000 deaths and over 20 million yuan in direct  economic losses, both record highs.    At a briefing, the person in charge of the commission  pointed  out: The main problems in safety-in-production work are as  follows: In the course of building a socialist market economic  structure, people have a weak sense of the legal system in  production safety, the existing laws are imperfect, and even  these are neither observed nor strictly enforced. The  government and enterprises relax safety management. Some  enterprise leaders put an undue emphasis on production to the  detriment of safety and on education at the expense of  management. As they invest little in the safety sector, hidden  dangers of safety-related accidents can be found almost  everywhere. The problem of production safety is especially  pronounced in some provincial enterprises, township and town  enterprises, and foreign-invested enterprises. Education and  safety training are not carried out effectively among employees.  Accidents are not earnestly investigated and handled.  Furnaces, mines, and fire protection are still the weak links  of production safety work.    To counter these problems, the provincial commission for  production safety urged to further implement the production  safety responsibility system, do a good job of the investigation  and removal of hidden dangers for safety-related accidents, and  at the same time, make good preparations for conducting this  year's safety production week activities and the 119 fire  production and safety day activities.</p>

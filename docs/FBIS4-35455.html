			<p>BFN     [Text] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has said  the opposition should fulfill its constitutional obligation for  which they have been elected. Talking to newsmen in Islamabad  today, she ruled out the possibility of resignation by the  opposition, saying they are not going to do so as it is an empty  threat. The prime minister said if the members of the  opposition resign, under the constitution, by-elections will be  held for the vacant seats. Ms. Benazir Bhutto said most of the  72 members of the opposition do not believe in the agitational  politics of the leader of the opposition. The prime minister  said the people have elected us to end price hike and  unemployment. She said the government has started various  projects for the uplift of the people and to bring about social  revolution in the country. She held the former prime minister,  Mr. Nawaz Sharif, responsible for the economic crisis facing the  country. She said Mr. Nawaz Sharif set a record in obtaining  foreign loan.    The prime minister said this year's budget will be tough  because of the negative economic policies pursued by the  previous government. She said the present government, instead  of providing ad hoc solutions to the problems confronting the  country, is making all-out efforts to ensure a brighter economic  future by finding permanent solutions. The government will have  to levy taxes in order to bring down the deficit, she added.  She said the budget has to be tough because of four factors  inherited by the government. There was no increase in the salary  of employees during the tenure of the previous regime. Hence  this government has to do so which will result into an extra  burden on the national exchequer.    The Nawaz government, she added, had taken hefty loans which  put additional burden to the tune of 15 billion rupees on the  national exchequer. PPP's [Pakistan People's Party's] last  government, she said, had brought the deficit to 6 percent which  went up to 8 percent during Mr. Nawaz Sharif's regime. There  was no work on the Hab power project during the Nawaz regime  which resulted into acute shortage of electricity. Instead, a  Yellow Cab Scheme was launched which gave taxis to 60,000  people. The national economy would be strong only when there  would be a balance between the income and expenses which is not  there now.</p>

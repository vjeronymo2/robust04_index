			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SKIER BILL JOHNSON HAS SURGERY  </P> <P> Downhill racer Bill Johnson has undergone surgery for removal of a ruptured  disk in his lower back and faces an extensive rehabilitation program.  </P> <P> The surgery Monday at Denver's St. Anthony Central Hospital went "pretty well,"  according to Dr. Courtney Brown, who declined to speculate on Johnson's chances  of returning to ski racing. "That's an impossible thing to say," Brown said.  "So much of this is motivation."  </P> <P> Johnson, 29, the 1984 Olympic downhill champion, had two disks removed in 1987.  </P> <P> Asked about his future, the typically flip Johnson said, "Who cares? Can I play  the piano again? I've never been able to do that."  </P> <P> The Troutdale, Ore., resident said he won't know if he can resume racing until  he begins training. "We'll just have to see how it goes this summer," said  Johnson. "If I'm able to train a lot and get back in shape, I'm sure it will be  no problem. But if there are complications along the way and I'm doubting  myself, I might just hang the boards up."  </P></p>

			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Gardening: Head for the hills - in Spain - Why is a flower somehow better when found unexpectedly in the wild?  Robin Lane Fox muses on the matter while studying Iberia's spring glory WHENEVER I go abroad to look for wild flowers, they go into hiding. In the past fortnight conditions ought to have been perfect. Spring has already broken in the Mediterranean; the Andalusian hills of southern Spain are a botanical wilderness; the British calendar is two months behind the sunlit temperatures of Malaga. When Britain starts campaigning, head for the hills. From bus windows of the past, I remember Spanish fields of yellow bee orchids, purple iris and grape hyacinths, rosemary, pale pink convolvulus and Iberian narcissi. This year, they must have heard I was coming. There has hardly been any rain all season; the ground is already like a brick and if you think the English spring has been dry, spare a thought for mountain homes in the western Mediterranean. Dried out by the weather, the better flowers have hidden their faces. For a week, I have tried hard enough to find them, on foot, two bike tyres and even on four capricious hooves. I have seen cistus by the square mile and enough lavender stoechas to make me slightly less cross that mine has died in the winter. Thistles have dogged my progress and globe artichokes have run wild under the olive trees. As the temperature falls, I have bicycled through the afternoon scent released by yellow coronilla; I have ridden for a day through oak-groves and the thought of maquis which was the home of that childhood favourite, Ferdinand the bull. There were no bees, but one bee-orchid, a few small muscari, two lone plants of the deep blue Aphyllanthes and hectares of a shocking pink erodium with seed heads shaped like a cranesbill. The haul, in short, was below the very low annual average on a Lane Fox World Botanical Index. When it comes to Iberian wildflowers, others have more luck, probably in the north and among the Pyrenees. When it comes to cultivated surprises, I still think that I have had the best of it. In the towns, on the hillsides, you do not have to look far. Spanish gardeners know how best to grow plants on a balcony or mass them outdoors in flowerpots. Their geraniums trail like streamers more than a yard long; wrongly, we think of our varieties in Britain as plants which grow upwards, not downwards. In April, we cannot expect roses, yellow jasmine and wisteria. In Spain, they are already everywhere, as are the first bedding plants. We might perhaps find less ugly lighting for the grounds of our historic castles, but would we have had the idea of massing nothing but scented white stocks in formal beds below a fortress like Cordoba's Alcazar? Having missed the best in wild nature, I have seen it twice in two Spanish towns. Not until late May will the milder parts of England be enjoying Banksian roses. They flower freely on pergolas in Somerset or up the front of sunny houses in London, showing small roses whose double flowers are the colour of lightly scrambled egg. Ten years ago, the king of all Banksians could be seen running wild in Cordoba beside one of the regional bus-parks: I could not relocate it, but in the town's old Jewish quarter there are plants of it whose owners have exercised more care. Their Banksian roses run right across the narrow streets on a friendly wire from one white-washed house to another, cascading above pedestrians, the only traffic. In Granada's great Generalife garden, you can see a magnificent plant of the rarer and frailer white Banksian form. Southern Spanish gardeners have given this wonderful climber its head, since its arrival from China in the 1820s. In Britain, town gardeners could still make more of it. The first wisterias have already opened and a cascade of Banksians make northerners think that they must be dreaming. Andalusian cooking will soon bring you back to earth, but can anyone equal its antidote, an extraordinary sight in the small civic gardens in the centre of the town of Ronda? Beneath the purple flowers of old Judas trees, some genius once planted pale-pink Moutan paeonies. These double-flowered varieties have finely-cut leaves and huge heads of flowers which we tend to expect only in special borders, in shade. Many years old, Ronda's public paeonies are shaded only slightly from ferocious sun. They are growing in no particular compost; the soil is earthed up round them, as if they are young potatoes; I doubt if they are watered throughout the heat of the year. Yet they are flowering stupendously, just as old catalogues always claimed that they would. In England, I have never proved the catalogues right. Before retiring, one great nurseryman once hinted to me that he doubted if any of his customers never had much luck with most of the Moutan plants which he supplied. Perhaps we are all too kind to them, as if they need cool soil, manure and the company of lilies and hostas. In Ronda they now grow as they seem to have been grown in the Chinese gardens where plant-hunters used to remark on them. It may have been Spanish cunning, but I suspect that like bullfighting, it was a matter of hit and miss. In Britain, perhaps, we should try the noble forms of paeony suffruticosa in full sunlight and dry soil: nowadays, Amands of 145 Clamp Hill, Stanmore, Middlesex are the main importers. It is all non-infectious food for thought. Some of us seem to be botanists, quick to see rare orchids in long grass before the cows have grazed them flat. Others, I suspect, are gardeners with an eye for plants in cultivation, growing in the most unlikely settings. Why is a flower somehow better when found unexpectedly in the wild? The finest sight in south Spain last week was a mass of paeonies in an urban space. If you want to see narcissi, is it really any worse to enjoy the best ones all over Hyde Park than to track them, not always successfully, to a habitat in northern Spain? Those who have the botanical knack do not always notice gardeners' oddities: as in nature, so among flower enthusiasts, different species come in different forms.</p>

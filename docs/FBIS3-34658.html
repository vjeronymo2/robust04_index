			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Tawfiq 'Abid] </F>   [Excerpts] Engineer Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman  for the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has stated that the  Cairo agreement reflects Zionist control of all matters and  clearly shows what happens when agreements are signed in the  absence of a balance of power. That's why we were not surprised  at the Zionist military quarters' support and the preliminary  Palestinian reaction of frustration and denuncation.    In an interview with AL-DUSTUR Ghawshah said: Anyone who  reads the Cairo agreement will be angry and furious and will  wonder how any Palestinian side could sign such an agreement?  [passage omitted]    Ghawshah said: This agreement, which was overshadowed by the  negative reactions of even 'Arafat and his entourage, will make  the Palestinian people, after recovering from their shock and  bitterness, forcefully support their basic constants of holding  onto the Palestinian land and liberation, no matter the cost or  the arduous road.    He added: It has become evident that the Zionist octopus,  which clings to every inch of the occupied Palestinian soil,  will give up this land only if a lethal blow is dealt to its  head. [passage omitted]    On the new mediations between Hamas and Israel, Engineer  Ghawshah said: Rabin has failed to solve or emerge from the  security dilemma because five months after the Gaza-Jericho  agreement, and 'Arafat's instructions to halt the intifadah and  his promise to punish those who do not respond to these  instructions, intifadah and jihad operations continue to take  place and to daily constitute a slap on the face of Rabin's  government .    Ghawshah said: The Rabin government sent many ranking  military and influential people to hold a dialogue with some of  the Hamas leaders who are in the Zionist jails. The reply of  the imprisoned brothers was clear and categorical; the refusal  to stop the intifadah and jihad operations. This is the stand  by which Hamas abides, a stand rejecting any dialogue with the  usurper Zionist enemy. All national and popular liberation  movements abide by such a stand in their confrontation of  occupation. [passage omitted]</p>

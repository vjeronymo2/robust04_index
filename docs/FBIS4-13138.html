			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Every Day" column by Tariq Masarwah: "Security Bankruptcy </F> and the Failure of the Peace Game"]    [Text] The Rabin-Peres warnings to Jordan declare the  failure of Israeli policies in the occupied territory. Hamas is  not in Amman, but in 'Afula, Hadera, Gaza, Hebron, and in every  part of Palestine. Hamas communiques are faxed, in moments,  from Jerusalem -- which they call the eternal capital of Israel  -- to Amman, Damascus, and London. Jordan Television broadcast  a very brief report, no more than a minute, about the Hadera  explosion while the Israeli radio carried for one and a half  hours a report about the explosion and the reactions to this  explosion.    These Israeli threats do not scare us; they are a  declaration  of the bankruptcy of the military and security occupation forces  inside the occupied territory and an unconvincing quest for  excuses, outside the occupied territory, to justify this  failure. The occupation is an impasse for Rabin and Peres, not  for Jordan. Violent resistance against occupation has exposed  the game of peace, and turned the doves of the Labor Party --  who preach about the prosperity that will be achieved in the  region once the Middle East market is established -- into hawks  who make threats against others. Violent resistance has also who  turned carriers of olive branches into pilots of lethal U.S.  aircraft. They want the game to play in accordance with their  own rules and, if it deviates from this course, war will be the  alternative.    We say these ridiculous Israeli threats will not scare us.  We will put them in our political calculations together with  the U.S. siege on al-'Aqabah.    We know that the U.S. Embassy [in Amman] has been working,  since the 'Afula incident, to mobilize public opinion against  two youths who carry Hamas faxes to the Jordanian media just as  Arab journalists in London carry Hamas faxes to AL-SHARQ  AL-AWSAT, AL- HAYAH, AL-QUDS AL-DUWALI, and AL-AHRAM AL-DUWALI.  Hamas communiques reach us as they reach every part in the  world.    The Labor Party doves, who turned into hawks, and peace  advocates who turned into warmongers, have reached a deadlock  and the game of peace has deviated from its course and has been  exposed. And Jordan is not responsible for this.</p>

			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SYRIAN SHELLS HIT LEBANESE PALACE, U.S. ENVOY'S VILLA  </P> <P> Syrian gunners blasted the presidential palace, army headquarters and the U.S.  ambassador's residence with mortar fire today.  </P> <P> Gunmen stormed the central prison in Muslim West Beirut, freeing 189 convicts.  A special squad of police, armed with M-16 assault rifles, recaptured 95 of  them despite shellfire across the divided city, authorities said.  </P> <P> Police said 10 people were killed and 89 wounded in today's duels between the  Christian army units of Gen. Michel Aoun and their Syrian and Druze militia  foes.  </P> <P> That raised the overall toll to 337 people killed and 1,323 wounded since the  latest round of fighting, believed to be the most destructive of Lebanon's  14-year-old civil war, erupted March 8.  </P> <P> Within an hour, 60 rounds, mostly 240-millimeter mortars, struck the palace in  the Christian suburb of Baabda and the nearby Defense Ministry in Yarze, where  Aoun has his headquarters.  </P> <P> Only the Syrian army possesses such weapons in Lebanon.  </P> <P> "They've decided to demolish both facilities," a military spokesman said by  telephone from underground shelters at the Defense Ministry.  </P> <P> "Our gunners are responding to silence the source of fire," he said, insisting  on anonymity.  </P> <P> Aides said Aoun, 53, his wife and three daughters have been living in a shelter  at the palace.  </P> <P> "Damage was considerable, but we cannot really give a more precise assessment  because we have all been living in the bunker for four days," an official at  the presidential palace said.  </P> <P> The U.S. Embassy said Ambassador John McCarthy's two-story villa was hit, but  there were no casualties. McCarthy and his family are abroad.  </P> <P> Tank clashes escalated into a savage shelling of Christian and Muslim  residential districts about midnight, the police spokesman said.  </P> <P> "Both sides were using the population as their shield," the spokesman said. He  cannot be named under standing police rules.  </P> <P> Ambulance sirens and thuds from exploding shells echoed across the city until  the fighting slackened three hours later.  </P></p>

			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Pressure on N-arms rivals International mediators pressed India and Pakistan yesterday to renounce their alleged atomic weapons programmes as Islamabad and New Delhi each expelled one of the other's diplomats in a spying row, Reuter reports from New Delhi. A meeting in New Delhi of a US-led group of nations seeking to stem the spread of missile technology urged India to halt its alleged nuclear warfare project. Senior officials from the US, Britain, Switzerland and Australia told the Indian government New Delhi's alleged programme had increased regional tensions. They sought New Delhi's support for the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), which tries to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. It was the first visit by a MTCR team to New Delhi, which has long spurned international pressure to renounce nuclear arms. Some of the MTCR officials later left for Pakistan, India's old enemy, to deliver the same message. Former Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif said last week that Islamabad already had the atomic bomb.</p>

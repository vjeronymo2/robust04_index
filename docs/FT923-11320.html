			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / International Company News: Underwriters take up 50% of Hafnia shares THE underwriters of Hafnia's DKr1.9bn (Dollars 333.5m) rights issue were forced to take up about half the troubled Danish insurance group's shares on offer. Most of the 7.08m A shares were taken up by shareholders, but 77.4 per cent of the 9.30m B shares, valued at DKr977m, had to be accepted by the institutional investors who underwrote the issue, of which Denmark's LD Fund was the main one. The issue was priced at DKr105 a share, but the B shares traded at about DKr95 during the period of the issue. Before the issue, now fully subscribed, Hafnia's equity capital was a negative DKr450m. It is expected that substantial cuts in staff and the sale of some subsidiaries will be announced in the autumn.</p>

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Markets: ITV companies play musical boardrooms - The Bottom Line THE TIME to buy ITV shares was, emphatically, a year ago this month. The bids for the 'blind crap shoot' - or competitive tenders for new Channel 3 licences, as it was known more properly - were about to go in. The uncertainty was great. No ITV company, however grand, could be judged a guaranteed winner and share prices were being held down. The thing to do then was to put together a basket of ITV companies, picking your way around those displaying hazard signs. Forecasting genius was not needed to see that Thames Television was likely to face a potentially lethal threat from Carlton Communications; or that both TV-am and TVS Entertainment probably would have had to bet the shop to survive and would, therefore, not have been very attractive investments. Ironically, TV-am decided not to bet the shop and lost, while TVS did and still lost. But a basket of the others - chosen in the near-certainty that the Independent Television Commission was unlikely to kick out the majority of existing contractors, and even more unlikely to get rid of more than two of the big five programme producers - clearly would have produced dramatic results. Leaks that both Central and Scottish had bid dramatically-low sums - confirmed later as Pounds 2,000 a year apiece - put springs under the share price. Those who took notice were able to buy Central at around 625p in mid-July, a stock that is now trading at more than Pounds 13. But what now? Is there anything left? No, in the sense of dramatic killings of the sort achieved by risk-takers last year. Too much is known now about the ITV companies. Clearly, Central and Scottish are going to have a considerable future, but that is reflected in the share price. There are 'bargains' such as Yorkshire and Tyne Tees but, again, the price merely reflects the difficulties both will face living with the high bids they felt they had to make. There is, however, another raft of ITV companies which made lowish bids  - such as LWT's Pounds 7.58m - but which also took early action to cut costs. It was no coincidence earlier this month that LWT, despite the ferocity of the recession, was able to announce a 21 per cent increase in pre-tax profit. Despite the continued uncertainty, and the threat of increasing competition in a multi-channel future, there are unmistakable signs that ITV companies can make at least another round of significant savings without harming quality. The latest evidence for this emerged yesterday as Central announced that Andy Allan, its managing director of broadcasting, was joining the board of Carlton Television and that Carlton's chief executive, Nigel Warmsley, was joining the Central board. Carlton has a 20 per cent stake in Central. Central, in turn, has a 20 per cent stake and the right to two directors on the board of Meridian, which won the south of England franchise. The daisy chain stretches even further. LWT, Scottish and Carlton are also common shareholders in what was Sunrise and is now Good Morning, the breakfast franchise. Advertising will have to be sold competitively, but the links will make it much easier to establish common cause and common savings in sharing non-contentious services such as computers, outside broadcasting facilities, artists' contracts and perhaps even studios. Although the gold rush days are over for ITV, Mark Beilby, media analyst at Warburg Securities, believes that - excluding the ITV companies which are part of larger groups - those who invest in companies such as Central, LWT, Scottish or Anglia will not be dissatisfied in the longer term. For the romantics there is always TVS, which ceases to be a broadcaster at the end of this year. Its share price has just doubled to 7p. Apart from programme libraries in the US and the UK, the company's main asset is the determination of chairman Rudolph Agnew - the stubborn Irishman who once chaired Consolidated Gold Fields - to bring it back from the dead. Agnew is fired by what he sees as the lack of natural justice dispensed by the ITC. And that might make him worth a small each-way bet.</p>

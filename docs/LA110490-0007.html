			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TURN IN, TUNE ON, SPEAK OUT;  </P> <P> HERE ARE THE RESPONSES TO THE OCT. 14 QUESTION: WHICH SPORTSCASTER DO YOU  WATCH, LOCALLY OR NATIONALLY?  </P> <P> I watch Keith Olbermann because I will see something I won't see  anywhereelse-humor. That is, humor because his work is original, he has a  clever play on words and sometimes he's just plain silly.  </P> <P> More than this, he places events in historical perspective with a knowledge of  tradition and obvious love of the games.  </P> <P> He knows what really matters (i.e. the San Francisco earthquake; Jim Abbott's  signing; the Donnie Moore tragedy) in personal as well as sports perspectives.  </P> <P> And since, in all this, there is a recognition that the viewer might actually  have some intelligence and awareness of sports and something beyond, I will  continue to watch Keith Olbermann.  </P> <P> Lulu Lewis, North Hollywood  </P> <P> Favorite sportscaster, local: Ed Arnold, KTLA.  </P> <P> He is thorough, knowledgeable and straightforward, more interested in  communicating sports news that his own notoriety.  </P> <P> Tony T. Schaeffer, Granada Hills  </P> <P> Someone at KNBC should break the news to Fred Roggin that he has no sense of  humor, and therefore should not try to tell jokes. Jim Hill is L.A.'s best  sportscaster.  </P> <P> Arthur J. Lacher, North Hollywood  </P> <P> My favorite sportscaster is Chris Berman on ESPN. He is articulate, fair and,  most important, he can make us laugh.  </P> <P> Eartha M. Porche, Van Nuys  </P> <P> My answer is Todd Donoho of KABC.  </P> <P> He's great on the news, his show "Monday Night Live" is great and he's also on  radio (95.5-FM KLOS) every morning and he adds the right touch with his sense  of humor. He knows sports backwards, forwards and sideways, and he genuinely  seems to enjoy talking about all sports.  </P> <P> Colette Barwick, Santa Ana  </P> <P> Who is my favorite sportscaster? No question-Jim Hill, KABC.  </P> <P> He's knowledgeable, intelligent, articulate, no pizzas, no gimmicks or hype.  Hegoes about his business of reporting and commenting, which conjures up two  words: competent, professional. He's not afraid to take a stand and back it up.  </P> <P> Gary Traxler, North Hollywood  </P> <P> I don't listen to any of them.  </P> <P> There seems to be a bonus for the sports announcer that gives all the results  of the baseball games in the fastest time, and a second bonus to the cameraman  who flashes the results in less than five seconds.  </P> <P> Sidney Lazarow, Orange  </P></p>

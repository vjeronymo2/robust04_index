			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman to first </F> session of the main committee of the Croatian Democratic  Community (HDZ) in Zagreb on 24 February -- recorded]    [Text] We could speak about the fourth anniversary of the  first HDZ convention for hours. However, that is not my  intention. I would just like to ask you to recall, together  with the Croatian public, what the situation was like four years  ago, at the first convention. In those days, we could still  expect to be imprisoned if we sang Lijepa Nasa  [Croatian anthem]. Taking into account everything we have  experienced over the past four decades and everything that the  HDZ has achieved, everything that the Croatian people have  accomplished in their centuries-long efforts to establish a  sovereign and independent Croatian state, we should occasionally  think about this seriously to be aware of some moments in  history and our responsibility -- the responsibility of the  entire nation -- and the situation in which we live.    I said we would not speak about this, but I want to briefly  remind you of the most current issues facing us and facing  Croatia, which also preoccupy the international public in Europe  and the world. Above all, we are interested in solving the  issue of Croatian areas under UN protection, but in reality  still under Serb occupation. However, this issue is linked to  the overall problem of the breakup of Yugoslavia, that is, above  all to the solution of the military-political crisis in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. I recently spoke in detail about these  issues to the HDZ club of deputies. I believe that you have  read about this, and therefore, I will not repeat myself. I  will inform you about our current position.    All relevant international players -- from Europe to the  United States -- have today for the first time reached a  conclusion that the survival of Bosnia-Herzegovina as it is, is  impossible and recommended to us and, in their own way, they  consider it necessary -- both because of us and because of the  world -- for us to accept a solution according to which the  Croat nation in Bosnia-Herzegovina stays in a union with the  Muslims. Even when I spoke on that occasion, I presented the  reasons for that. You have probably read about it. At the  time, they still had not spoken in such concrete terms and as  publicly as they have in the period since I gave the speech.  They are of the opinion that it is important, as U.S. Secretary  of State Christopher said yesterday or the day before, that at  least two nations in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- Muslims and Croats --  establish cooperation and friendship.    Therefore, we are witnessing some kind of new geopolitical  balance of powers, and as a result of this, a demarcation in  Bosnia- Herzegovina. The demarcation in this area has been  going on since the breakup of the Roman Empire via Yalta to  current efforts to solve the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This  is the first time that we witness main European states --  France, England, Germany -- reaching a consensus with the United  States, which has again assumed the main role in resolving the  crisis in Yugoslavia and Bosnia- Herzegovina. I say again  because the United States already had that role in the  beginning, only to let Europe and the United Nations handle this  hot potato alternately. As this did not lead to a solution, the  United States has now assumed the leading role and established a  consensus. Of course, certain differences still exist, and  Russia has made a separate appearance with tacit understanding.  As I told you before, Russia remains a Eurasian power that will  have a role to play, whatever happens.    Therefore, they have recommended to us, insisted and  persisted, that we reach an agreement with the Muslims. They  are demanding the same thing from the Muslims. The Muslim  leaders, some of them, have accepted that suggestion coming from  the United States and Europe and have spoken out in favor not  only of the need for cooperation between the Croat and Muslim  nations in Bosnia, but also in favor of the confederation  between whatever will remain of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia.    Politically, an agreement in principle has been reached on  this in separate talks. That was also discussed in the presence  of those U.S., German, French, and English representatives whom  I have mentioned. We also reached nominal agreement at the  meeting in Frankfurt. I received the U.S. President's special  envoy, I had phone conversations with the most responsible  people, and currently, our foreign minister, deputy prime  minister, and vice-chairman of the HDZ [Mate Granic] is not here  because he is visiting major European cities to discuss that  issue.    Roughly put, this would mean that some kind of federation  between Croats and Muslims would be set up in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and a confederation would be set up between  that Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. In that respect,  everything seems fine and acceptable for us. Acceptable for us  inasmuch as that would be in the interest of the Croat people.    This would be done primarily to halt hostilities. An  agreement was signed by General Roso, who is the Croatian  Defense Council [HVO] commander in Herceg-Bosna, and Muslim  General Delic along the same lines. The agreement is a big step  forward toward ending the war. If the war continues, Croatia  will find itself in a very unfavorable position. Therefore, we  are interested in an end to the war. The war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina would under such conditions [not further  specified] be very unfavorable for Croatia.    We are also interested because a solution to the Bosnia-  Herzegovina crisis is a precondition for resolving the issue of  the UN protected areas in Croatia. We are interested because  we, the Croatian nation as a whole, as well as Europe and the  world, see this alliance with the Muslims, these mutual  relations in Bosnia- Herzegovina and relations with Croatia as  something that protects the interests of the Western world in  relation to this new division, that is, this separation line  between the major world powers.    And, we are interested because the Muslims, whom this  friendship should steer toward the European, Western  civilization, ought to develop so as to weed out those elements  in Bosnia that wish to create a fundamentalist Islamic state.  This is perhaps the most important reason for our acceptance,  and this is the main reason why the major European states and  the United States suggested we should accept such a solution.  From that standpoint, this serves our interests, the interests  of the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the interests of  the Croatian state in general. The problem now is to implement  this idea in practice.    The signing of yesterday's cease-fire was an agreement in  principle, and this was a giant step in the right direction.  What lies ahead is an arduous task, negotiations, because the  prevalent standpoint in the Muslim leadership is that the common  Bosnia- Herzegovina, the Muslim and Croat Bosnia-Herzegovina  should be organized as a single state with civil rights and not  on a federal basis. and so forth.    We, Croats, have a long historical experience and,  unfortunately, a bitter experience from associations: in the  Hapsburg monarchy, in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, where a  personal [as heard] union became a factual union; then there are  the experiences from the former Yugoslavia, especially from the  socialist period, during which we had a constitutional and  legal...[pauses] not only federal but also confederal elements  of communal life for the peoples of former Yugoslavia, where  Tito -- both as a Croat and a communist internationalist --  sincerely tried to resolve relations between peoples and  nationalities, as they were called in former Yugoslavia, on a  footing of absolute equality. In the last Constitution of 1974,  he really provided the groundworks for full equality, not only  proportionality but also parity in resolving... [pauses] for a  consensus, to granting all rights to the minorities, the  Albanians in Kosovo, the Hungarians, and so forth. Despite these  constitutional and legal tendencies and in spite of the fact  that the Communist Party and the then League of Communists stood  behind such constitutional and legal solutions on the equality  of nations, there was no equality. Not even Croatia could  govern itself here in Zagreb, to say nothing of the Croats in  Bosnia- Herzegovina.    Therefore, the Croats have enough experience not to accept  such ideas suggested to us by unitarists, idealists,  integralists, and communists, who said they would resolve the  problem of democracy, socialist internationalism, and so on.  The Croats in Bosnia- Herzegovina cannot be happy with such an  idea -- the idea to have this community of Muslims and Croats  proclaim itself a democratic state, a centralized state  guaranteeing civil and ethnic rights, and so on. So our task is  to ensure the survival of the Croat nation on the basis of our  overall experience, our historical experience, and on the basis  of what happened during the disintegration of Yugoslavia and the  disintegration of Bosnia-Herzegovina... [pauses] in a  territorial sense... [pauses] because this is not only a matter  of importance to the Croats there but also to the Croatian state  and the strategic interests of the Croatian state.    When I hold talks and when I speak to my friends, I always  say that if we do not secure our interests, we could lose Bosnia  for the Croatian nation in a few decades, because the proportion  of Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina has fallen from 24 percent to 17  percent or even less today. Therefore, we could lose Bosnia not  only for Croatia, but also for the West in the sense in which  they want Bosnia-Herzegovina to be saved from the division with  the eastern world, from the need to ensure that extremist and  fundamentalist elements do not prevail there.    We are ready to negotiate, we have presented our proposals  which point out that, if the Serb part of Bosnia-Herzegovina is  allowed to leave, this means that the rest of the world accepts  the fact that Bosnia-Herzegovina cannot survive as a union of  three republics. Then, naturally, if this is understood, the  problem of division should be viewed in a different light, and  not in the sense in which it is being done and has been defined  so far in the framework of the Geneva negotiations. This is  what things are about now.    This is yet another historic turning point in the life of  the  Croatian people and in the drawing of those everlasting lines,  in the process of demarcation between different worlds and  civilizations in this area. I can tell you that those who  advocate such a solution -- the need for a federal, confederate  [as heard] relationship between Croats and Muslims in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and a confederation between  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia -- at the same time guarantee us  that they will help us solve as soon as possible the problem of  Croatia's areas under the protection of the peace forces, that  they will give us everything they have offered us so far, while  trying to move us in a direction other than that of our  independent policy; therefore, that they will open up to Croatia  all those international institutions, that they will grant us  aid for the reconstruction of Croatia, that the problems of our  membership in the Council of Europe and of partnership in NATO  will be solved, and so on.    In a word, they not only consider Croatia an important  factor  for solving the crisis in this area, but they will also lend it  full assistance in various forms to become one of the more  prosperous countries attractive to others. Therefore, there are  reasons, strategic reasons, for us, Europe, the United States,  and the world to reach such a solution and, on our part, we will  do everything to achieve this.    As I said, Granic is away. He had a meeting in Bonn with  Klaus Kinkel, vice chancellor and foreign minister. In Rome he  held talks with Italian Foreign Minister Andreatta, and he  visited the Vatican. Today he is in Geneva, and then he will  visit Paris and London, which does not mean that we (?only want)  to inform others about our standpoints. We know that the United  States has a crucial role. I again called the U.S.  representative who will either come to Zagreb again soon, or the  talks will continue in a different way.    We should be aware of the delicacy of the issue, of the  solution that is being requested from us. It is delicate  because we should override -- among the Muslim leaders, those  who accept the initiative, who favor an alliance with Croatia --  the liberal-civic concept of state according to which  territorially it is not necessary to make any divisions and it  is not necessary to have any national attributes in the solving  of the issue of Bosnia- Herzegovina borders.    Bearing in  mind that it is being recommended both to us and to them that  [word indistinct] I hope that we shall reach a favorable  solution.    On the normalization of Serb-Croat relations: Apart from  reaching a solution with the Muslims, of which I have spoken, it  remains our objective to normalize Croat-Serb relations, in  order to resolve the issue of the UN Protected Areas in the  easiest possible way and include them into our constitutional  system, and also because it is clear to everyone -- including  foreign countries -- that without this normalization there are  no chances for a new international order in this part of  southeastern Europe and the Balkans.    As I have said, this remains our policy, but at the same  time  we are faced with the fact that the Serb side still has an  insuffiently defined approach to this, that they have in recent  days -- using the fact that all attention was focused on  Sarajevo -- engaged in provocation, and, after a long time, have  shelled the Maslenica bridge and taken the Gradiska bridge. Of  course, these provocations were launched by those elements on  the Serb side who do not want relations to be normalized, who  want war at any cost. We must be consisitent, for our part, in  the implementation of the peaceful solution policy.    In the last six months we have achieved almost amazing  results in stabilizing the economy, in bringing inflation down.  What our government has achieved, headed by [Prime Minister  Nikica] Valentic and his first deputy Skegro, Bank Governor  Jurkovic, and others too, but first of all these people who work  day and night, in this respect amazes the world, and speaks  again about the abilities of our people and about the fact that  we had a program, which I announced as a program of economic  renaissance, and people who knew how to implement it. The  success in bringing down inflation, which we have been doing for  six months now, should continue. We must continue running the  state economy with seriousness. We must adopt a realistic state  budget and stick to the budget that the government is to propose  and the parliament to adopt -- with an extreme degree of  responsibility on the part of each minister, each ministry, each  body, each regional governor, each region, each municipality.    Clearly there are some concrete tasks here. Nikica Valentic  and the others will speak about that later on, so I will not  focus on that, but I am saying that, apart from resolving our  foreign policy issues -- Croatia's position in the contemporary  world -- economic development and stabilization are the main  tasks on the home scene.    I wish to say something that I have been repeating since the  first convention four years ago when I brought people from the  Croatian diaspora to Zagreb and when I invited them to return to  Croatia. I have been saying this at all meetings but there is  still resistance to the integration of these people into  Croatia's state and economic life. There is still a lack of  understanding for this problem. These Croats who had gone  abroad and earned larger or smaller amounts of money, some of  whom made several hundred thousand marks or dollars -- not to  say millions... [pauses] This, to us, is bigtime capital, and if  these people wish to return with such sums, if they also wish to  contribute their experiences and their knowledge and bring their  children back to the motherland and join in the development of  Croatia instead of staying abroad, then we should give them  privileges in all areas, not obstacles. This is still going on  --this is being done by the privatization fund, by some  ministries, and by all lesser institutions. [applause]    If we are making special efforts to attract the richest  Croat  in the world, who is said to be among the hundred richest people  in today's world -- a certain Mr. Luksic from Chile who is said  to be in possession of $7 billion or $10 billion --- if we bring  someone like that to Croatia and ask him to invest here and he  agrees and even brings over his children who were born over  there, what happens? The papers start writing that a Chilean  is taking over Croatia's breweries or whatnot, instead of  writing that the richest Croat, one of the richest people in the  world, wishes to invest in Croatia. This is a form of  resistance. Look, there are people whom I know -- I do not know  if Marjan Petrovic or someone else, Rogic or someone is here --  who helped in the establishment of democracy, who helped us in  the patriotic war, these people are facing such horrendous  everyday difficulties here that they finally say Mr. President,  if it were not for this Croatia, these obligations of ours, we  would have left Croatia.    Gentlemen, please, I am calling on all of you to stop this  because this is a way to prevent these people from returning and  a way for this old managerial class from the communist regime to  survive and stay in control of Croatia's economy.    As you know, I have never advocated, nor am I advocating  now, that the people who managed companies and were leaders of  Croatia should be removed at any cost, or even removed at all,  provided they are able. On the contrary, we need their  knowledge and experience. We must not act stupidly, and we have  not done so, unlike some other former socialist countries.    But at the same time we must be consistent in the  implementation of our HDZ program, the program of Croatia's  economic renaissance, to create conditions for the return of our  people, for the injection of capital and knowledge, and for a  different kind of behavior from that which our people were used  to during the 50 years of socialism.    Hardly a week goes by without my reacting to something, why  something is not being done...[pauses] I have ordered in recent  days that personnel changes be made in some bodies, in the fund,  and in some other bodies [applause] where problems have been  observed.    Gentlemen, as we are overcoming the crisis and resolving the  problems I have mentioned -- Bosnia-Herzegovina, UN Protected  Areas -- new, better conditions will be created for us. We must  be ready for it, to remove in advance all obstacles to the  inflow of fresh capital. We shall not sell Croatia, but we need  the capital for our development. We must also make sure now  that we do not squander the loans we shall get. We must ensure  that production increases, that the employment level is  increased in order to resolve vital questions of Croatian  society, Croatian people, the Croatian state -- the return of  refugees, the restoration of destroyed towns and villages -- all  of this with clear ideas of the need for economic, cultural, and  scientific progress in Croatia.    We necessarily had to neglect the fields of culture and  science in the two war years. But we must be aware that in  these very areas we must make a turn, even with the resources  available to us now, and particularly later in new, more  favorable conditions.    In this connection I would just briefly like to speak about  what I told the HDZ club of deputies at the Croatian Assembly.  We need better cooperation between the assembly and the  government. I told the club of deputies that our government is  an HDZ government. It has been implementing the HDZ program.  Therefore, in this way we should approach its proposals and  cooperate to improve the proposals, if necessary. Our party  should not approach this government's proposals, particularly in  extraordinary circumstances, by creating even bigger obstacles  than is done by opposition parties.    One more thing: Ladies and gentlemen, our deputies have to  be  at their work place, in the assembly, they should not be absent  when decisions are being made. [applause] Within the presidency  we shall particularly tackle the new law and the problem of who  should remain in the assembly and who should discharge other  duties. But those who remain in the assembly must attend its  sessions.    Furthermore, it is a practice in serious parliamentary  democracies that all deputies do not deal with all problems.  Deputies should decide to take up certain areas and become  experts in their field, be it economy, health, or defense.  Everyone keeps chattering about everything, no one about....  [applause; Tudjman pauses] and on foreign policy and so on.    Therefore, in this respect we should be responsible, because  how things are going to be resolved depends on the quality of  our work. We must not get involved in excessive politicizing,  nor allow it. In this connection, please be informed,  particularly the gentlemen from the assembly where some foreign,  not only opposition figures, but also some foreign factors, who  wanted to turn our policy into different directions...[sentence  incomplete as heard]. Do not think that there will not be ideas  in the future about returning to some old and new communities  which would not be....[pauses] Therefore, all these digressions  which have been called distractions and so on, all these stand  in the way of the implementation of the HDZ policy and the  implementation of state policy.    Therefore, I am asking you for full responsibility. We can  have different views when it comes to the resolution of internal  state problems, but there can be no different views on the  implementation of the HDZ program, and the implementation of  state policy. Even though we have so far tolerated such  circumstances, we cannot forever allow obstacles to be made for  us in this way.    I appeal to all of you present here to influence the public  in that respect. People abroad are amazed [words indistinct].  We have spoken about this at the second (?HDZ) convention and at  a presidency session.    Everything that has happened proves how correct our policy  is  but we must know that this also creates obstacles for us. We  have to try to successfully resolve the problems we are facing.    I therefore ask the central committee, the (?legal)  committee, and all individuals to be consistent in the  implementation of the HDZ program. I appeal to every individual  to show reponsibility. Let us recall that we did not have a  united program at the first convention, four years ago -- that  we did not have the majority in the parliament. Without the  support of the majority of the people we would not have achieved  everything we did achieve and we would not have got into the  situation where Croatia and its leader are considered the key  factors in the creation of the new international order in the  area.    We can be proud of all this, but it all also places on us  the  burden of obligation to show great seriousness and  responsibility. Thank you. [applause] [words indistinct]</p>

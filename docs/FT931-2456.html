			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / China warns Patten over trade BRITAIN'S economic ties with China would 'inevitably be affected' if the row over Hong Kong persists, a senior Chinese official said yesterday. Mr Li Lanqing, minister of foreign economic relations and trade, accused Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, of undermining the smooth transfer to Chinese rule by persisting with his plans for democratic reforms. Asked whether the dispute would affect commercial relations, Mr Li replied: 'I believe that if the governor sticks to his present manner of doing things, economic and trade relations will inevitably be affected.' China has a long history of retaliating economically against countries which displease it politically. The most recent example was the freeze Beijing placed on business with France last year after the French announced they were selling advanced Mirage fighter-bombers to Taiwan. According to the UK Department of Trade and Industry, Sino-British trade was worth Pounds 1.38bn last year, with the balance increasingly heavily in Beijing's favour. Chinese exports to the UK amounted to Pounds 954m, up 35 per cent on the previous year. Mr Patten said Beijing might damage its own economic interests if it allowed the row over his political reform package to affect Sino-British trade and economic ties. He said that trade should not be politicised, and warned of the consequences if China were to link Hong Kong's political development to its economic relationship with Britain. China is keen to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and wants its most favoured nation trading status renewed in the US. Mr Patten hopes to meet US president Bill Clinton in late April or early May, and press for unconditional renewal of China's MFN status. Britain has been a supporter of China's entry into the Gatt. In London, Mr John Major, the prime minister, told parliament: 'The governor has acted sensitively, resolutely and correctly and we shall continue to make that clear to the Chinese government.' UK may lose valuable Chinese markets, Page 3</p>

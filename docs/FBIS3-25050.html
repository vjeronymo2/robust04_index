			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President F.W. de Klerk by correspondent Max </F> du Preez on the "Agenda" program -- live]    [Text] [Du Preez] The man who made that speech is here with  me tonight. Mr. F.W. de Klerk, leader of the National Party  [NP], who (?lifts) its election manifesto this morning. Good  evening, Mr. de Klerk.    [De Klerk] Good evening, Mr. du Preez.    [Du Preez] Mr. de Klerk, your manifesto calls you the man  for  justice and peace, and in fact the National Party promises that  through its manifesto it will bring peace to South Africa. I'm  sure there will be many people who will want to ask you tonight:  Why don't you do it now?    [De Klerk] Firstly, let me say that the insert which was  shown referring to the season of violence ....[changes thought]  The season of the violence that we've had up to 1990 indeed was  over, and the violence which occurred since then more and more  became a violence of a different nature. Before 1990, before  the unbanning of the ANC, Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the nation  -- ANC Military Wing] and the security forces were killing each  other. There was an armed struggle between the ANC [African  National Congress], the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] forces,  and the security forces of South Africa. We have succeeded in  defusing that armed struggle.    [Du Preez] But you promise peace now.    [De Klerk] Let me just first come to this. The violence  which has occurred since has a totally different character. We  now have Zulus and Xhosas killing each other. We now have  supporters of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and the ANC at  each other's throats in terms of various findings of the  Goldstone Commission. It's a different violence. I kept my  promise to end that season of violence. The violence that we  now have is of a very complicated nature. There is no quick fix  for it.    [Du Preez] Yet that's what you promised.    [De Klerk] Yes, and that is what we'll get through a proper  democratic process. That is what we'll get if all the leaders  assume their fair share of responsibility. My supporters are  not killing anybody. My supporters are not involved in the  burning down of houses. My supporters are not -- on a daily  basis at each other's throat in Thokoza and Katlehong. My  supporters there are intimidated. I have supporters there. My  supporters there are being killed. We need the leaders of the  ANC and the IFP to take a much more direct interest in  disciplining their supporters as well. But can I just say, with  regard to the trouble spots, the government is doing everything  in its power. We've just -- with a multiparty agreement -- in  conjunction with the TEC [Transitional Executive Council]  launched an imaginative initiative on the East Rand which is  where so many people were being killed. We're not sitting on  our hands.    [Du Preez] I see in your manifesto, and I quote you, what  you've just said: The National Party does not kill people. The  National Party does not threaten people. And again, I'm sure  the relatives of Steve Biko, and Dulcie September, and David  Webster, and Anton Lubowski would want me to ask you when did  you change your mind? When did you stop doing that?    [De Klerk] Well, firstly, in some of the instances you are  referring to, accusations were made where no proof exists. If  at any time in the past and now, and in the future, security  forces are involved in breaking the law, it's wrong. And I have  without fear -- fearlessly -- ordered full investigation. Where  there is evidence we will prosecute. But the National Party of  today...    [Du Preez, interrupting] But the CCB [Civil Cooperation  Bureau], we had evidence, we had a commission, we had evidence.    [De Klerk] And we had one of the best judges and one of the  best prosecutors and they couldn't uncover evidence which really  led to prosecution, because people, in as much as they were  guilty, apparently covered their tracks so well that there was  no evidence, and we live in a civil country. You cannot charge  a man without evidence. We cannot go back to the law of the  jungle because of rumors, because of even well-founded  suspicion. But without evidence in a civilized country where  you say we adhere to the rule of law, you wait until you get  evidence.    [Du Preez] Mr. de Klerk, let me interrupt you there and say  to you that it is my perception that this very fact that you  still, and your government still denies the existence of death  squads, the fact that you killed your opponents. I'm talking  about your party over the last decade or two, that makes it so  difficult for South Africans to forget, to bring up the past  every now and again as you object to sometimes?    [De Klerk] No, no.    [Du Preez] How can people forgive you if the government  doesn't even, is not even prepared to say, yes we did it and it  was wrong?    [De Klerk] No, no I'm sorry, there are policemen in jail  because evidence was uncovered, and they've been found guilty.  There are members of the SADF [South African Defense Force] in  jail. It is simply just not true to say that we are covering  anything up. At the moment, with regard to the death of Goniwe,  there is a judicial commission of inquiry, we've put every piece  of evidence, we've given them every form of assistance. It is  unfair to say that there is any effort on our side to cover up.    But can I come back, you say when did we change. There was  war at a certain stage. Certain things were done which fell  outside the scope of a war. Certain things were done which fell  within the scope of a war. But that war has ended because of  our initiatives, because we became a new National Party, because  we scrapped apartheid, because we removed the cause for the  struggle, because we freed the people, because we repealed all  legislation with regard to discrimination. And that new  National Party is not involved in violence whatsoever. That new  National Party has freed also the security forces from being  used as political instruments. The first thing I did when I  became president, in the first three months I called together  the top management of both the police and the SADF and said  never again will you be asked to act as a political instrument,  you are there to safeguard the lives and property of all South  Africans.    [Du Preez] And do you think black South Africans find this  credible? Is it not your perception that most black South  Africans, especially those in the opposition in the past years,  still firmly believe that those of them who had been killed, and  poisoned, and whatever, had been done by state death squads and  not by some unknown force. Who killed all these people?    [De Klerk] Yes, obviously, obviously many people, including  I, would like to get the real facts. And I have nothing against  crime committed in the past being uncovered. But if we were  constantly to dwell on the past in trying to prepare for the  future, if I were to constantly say I cannot trust the ANC  because they planted the Pretoria bomb in which so many people  were killed, because Mr. McBride killed innocent bystanders by  putting a bomb in a supermarket then where would we be....    [Du Preez, interrupting] But they admitted. You don't you  say you need evidence?    [De Klerk] No, but this election that we're talking about  tonight is about the future. It is about what people now say  and now do. I have publicly said that in as much as in the  past, people have been hurt, their dignity have been impaired,  people became the prey of deeds and action which brought about  hurt and damage, we are sorry.    [Du Preez] Would you reopen the Biko inquest?    [De Klerk] If there is sufficient evidence, yes.    [Du Preez] Mr. de Klerk, let's move on. Analysts find it  significant that you've now lately been reviving the red danger,  the communist danger. At your conference again you spoke about  that. When you demonize your opponents so much in this  campaign, do you keep in mind that in May you will sit with  those very people in a coalition government, in a government of  national unity? When you've demonized them so much, would it  not impair a new government?    [De Klerk] Before I reply directly, let me just say Mr.  Mandela will have to sit with me, a man he accuses of not caring  for black lives, a man he accuses of not caring. So in an  election, politics isn't for sissies. In an election -- a free  and fair election -- you focus on your opponents weaknesses, and  it is a tremendous weakness of the ANC that it remains in  alliance with a totally discredited ideology.    [Du Preez] But are you really scared of communism? Isn't it  dead?    [De Klerk] No, I'm not scared of communism, otherwise I  wouldn't have unbanned the SACP [South African Communist Party].  I think that on their own the SA Communist Party is worth  nothing. They are a pushover. But I think, that the fact that  so many prominent SA communists are sitting in high power  positions in the ANC makes them dangerous, and therefore my  attack is upon the alliance, and I say that the African National  Congress needs to distance itself from communism as the whole  world has done, and even the ex-communists have done. And while  these people remain there, it makes the ANC an extremely  dangerous party because those communists, according to their own  publication, have a hidden agenda.    [Du Preez] Let's move back to violence for a minute. It is  safe to say that our election will not be violence-free. In  your opinion, how much violence can we tolerate on those few  days as to not jeopardize the legitimacy of that election? And  jointly with that, can we have that if Inkatha and Volksfront  [National Front] do not take part?    [De Klerk] Let me deal with the first question first. It  will depend on how widespread it is, on how serious it is. If  it is localized to a few localities then the Independent  Electoral Commission has sufficient powers to isolate those  areas in a certain sense of the word, and to declare the rest of  the election free and fair and not to let those votes count. If  it is widespread, then it will be the duty of the Independent  Electoral Commission to say that the elections haven't been free  and fair, and they have the power to declare it null and void.  I hope that we can avoid it. I believe that yes, while it  won't be totally violence-free, I think that if everybody does  their job from now until the 27th of April -- all the mechanisms  which we have created, all the political leaders who  participate, then we can assure, and especially the TEC by the  way. We can assure that it will be free and fair. If all...    [Du Preez, interrupting] What about an Angolan option if  Inkatha and Volksfront do not take part?    [De Klerk] Inkatha and the Volksfront together still  represent, although a significant minority, but a very clear  minority. Definitely more than 80 percent of all the people in  South Africa want this election to take place, they want it to  succeed, they are committed, and they want to participate in it.  We cannot allow a minority to stop the train of history, to  stop the course of events. We cannot allow a minority to hold  the whole country, which wants this election to take place, to  ransom. And therefore if there is such a boycott, we'll have to  manage it. If it is peaceful, that is for them a democratic  option although I think a very short-sighted one to exercise.  If, however, it is not a passive boycott, but if it becomes  undermining, if it becomes violence related, then we'll have to  act very firmly and ensure that that minority and those who  participate in violence will not succeed in upsetting what this  country needs and wants.    [Du Preez] Let's go to your election manifesto. Like the  other parties, you offer jobs and houses and education and  health care and whatever. But isn't also true that your  government has been in power for 46 years. Why do you promise  them no we don't have those things. Can you with credibility  promise those things if you haven't delivered in 46 years?    [De Klerk] But can I take you on a trip to show you what we  have delivered?    [Du Preez) A very short one.    [De Klerk] No, it will be a very long trip. For years we've  been building one new school per school day. Some of them have  been burned down, some of the have been burned down by whom?  For years we've been successfully making good progress with  regard to housing. Who stopped to a certain extent housing in  the past two years? The boycotts ordered by the civics, the ANC  Youth League. Who is responsible for the breakdown in the  continuance of those programs? The disruptions caused in the  townships under the leadership of ANC surrogates. We have money  which we could have spent in the past years on housing, but  because of the unrest created by ANC-related organizations, we  couldn't spend it. We made two and a half thousand million  rands available for housing and through sabotage and putting up  stumbling blocks, not all of that money could've been spent.    The ANC has robbed the townships of thousands and thousands  of houses. The boycotts frightened off the private sector. We  had a successful scheme going where the private sector started  financing housing on a grand scale, when they stopped paying  their installments all private sector involved in investment  stopped. The ANC....    [Du Preez, interrupting] But you're talking about the  resistance that started because of....    [De Klerk, interrupting] Now I'm saying we have a proud  track  record of -- even under apartheid -- of doing much with regard  to improvement of health care, improvement of education,  improvement of this, that, and the other. Under sanctions, in a  period when as a result of sanctions, as well as a result of  extraneous factors such as the heaviest drought, the drop in the  gold price, a world recession, funds were scarce.    Now that we've had good rains, the sanctions are gone, the  world economy is slowly starting to pick up, the future is rosy.  If we can get investment we'll have more jobs, government  income will increase, and in an economically healthy way we will  be able to expand more on more imaginative development projects.  So, our promise we can make good. But the fundamental  difference is whose economic policy will generate the growth.    We make the same promises than the ANC, but the difference  is  that with their economic policy there won't be foreign  investment. With their economic policy there will be further  capital outflow as there now is as result of the regular wild  statements which they make. With our economic policy we will  attract the investment, and therefore we will be able to make  good on our promises.    [Du Preez] Can I quickly take you to one other field before  we take an ad [advertisement] break. Corruption in the  government over the last 15 years has been of the greatest on  the continent. Some of the ministers have even been jailed, what  guarantee do we have now that if we vote for your party we won't  see a repeat of National Party corruption?    [De Klerk] Well, firstly most of the corruption that you  refer to in the later years occurred in basically two of the  self- governing states. The chief ministers of those two  self-governing states are now on the candidates list of the ANC.  We ordered judicial commissions of inquiry into it.    [Du Preez] But I think by referring to homelands you're  escaping the fact that a lot of that was in the central  government?    [De Klerk] Oh no.    [Du Preez] We had pictures on Sunday newspaper front pages  of  toilets in the veld. As I said we have ministers in jail?    [De Klerk] But then you must define corruption. That wasn't  corrupt to build it. It might have been a misdirected  development action. But that's not corruption. Corruption is  when money is misused, is under the table allocated to something  which wasn't properly authorized, etc, etc. That was a residue  of an effort to create development in a place where people  didn't want to go. It might have been a mistake, but not  corruption.    [Du Preez] I think we'll be back. There'll be more after  this. [commercial break]    [Du Preez] Our guest on Agenda is Mr. de Klerk, leader of  the  National Party. Mr. de Klerk, a question that I think many  people in the world have wanted to ask you, who are interested  in South Africa. On February the second, 1990. That speech  that we watched earlier. Did you have a fundamental change of  heart, or was it a change of strategy because of pressure?    [De Klerk] Well, I and the whole National Party had a  fundamental change of heart, but it wasn't a Damascus Road  experience, that suddenly one morning we stood up and said we've  got to change.    [Du Preez] Did it happen towards the last year of the P.W.  Botha regime?    [De Klerk] It was a process which started in the early  eighties, and in 1986 we formally held a federal congress and  changed our policy and said, we're scrapping separate  development. And we held a special election to get a renewed  mandate from the white electorate to say we now stand for one  united South Africa with an equal vote for all with one  citizenship, and with all forms of racial discrimination to be  disbanded, and we won it. And I won it again in 1989. What  happened on the second of February 1990 is that that change of  heart, which took place over the previous four, five, six years,  and which we actually formalized, then came together in an  action plan to say, we've changed our mind, our heart, now we  must start moving and do what we believe in is right for South  Africa. That was the beginning of an implementation phase  towards working really towards reconciliation, towards bringing  peace to South Africa, towards burying the past.    [Du Preez] I see a right wing newspaper said General Tienie  Groenewald wrote that speech for you. Is that true?    [De Klerk] No. It's absolutely untrue. I would like to call  my wife as a witness. That speech was written in my own hand,  at my own desk, in my own home and if I remember correctly one  evening at a dining room table. That speech was my product, but  it was also the product of a bosberaad [bush summit], a previous  think tank meeting with my whole cabinet, with our advisers...    [Du Preez, interrupting] Do you still have that speech? Is  it framed, or is it somewhere?    [De Klerk] I am not sentimental about such things. I haven't  framed it, but it must be around somewhere.    [Du Preez] Mr. de Klerk you are a boerseun [farm lad] with  deep roots in the Western Transvaal. When you're walking in the  fields and you take the soil and you feel it between your  fingers, what does your heart tell you? Whose soil is that?    [De Klerk] When I do that my dominant emotion is I love this  country, this beautiful country, and yes, I say that country  belongs to all its people. I'm an Afrikaner. My forebears, and  yours, unless they remained in the Cape...    [Du Preez, interrupting] Hulle was ook Doppers [preceding  four words in Afrikaans -- they were also members of the  Reformed Church]    [De Klerk, continuing] ...fought the first anti-colonial  freedom war on African soil in modern history. I am an African.  I am not a European. You are an African, and this country, we  say, we must share with all of us who live here, who will die  here, and whose children will live here.    [Du Preez] Talking about Doppers, they are different from  the  rest of us. Doppers -- from the Reformed Church, for those who  do not know -- are supposed to be more puritan and more honest  than the rest of us, Afrikaners, I mean. What has this  Gereformeerde -- this reformed tradition, what has it meant in  your political style, in your political thinking?    [De Klerk] Well, firstly, inasmuch as Doppers might have  that  image, I think it's a wrong image, and if Doppers think  themselves better than others, then it is a very, very grave sin  that they are committing. I don't think they are better than  anybody else. But yes, theologically speaking...    [Du Preez, interrupting] They have a no nonsense approach?    [De Klerk] ...they are relatively puritan.    [Du Preez] Yes.    [De Klerk] Politically speaking, they have always been  verlig  [enlightened]. It has had a tremendous influence on me. I  studied at the Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher  Education which says that you must look at science, at  everything, in the light of the word of God, and it had a  tremendous influence on my whole outlook on life. It has taught  me, whenever I have to tackle even a practical problem, to ask  what is the principle involved.    [Du Preez] You are also a man with a sense of history, and I  remember reading some day long ago, that you are a great admirer  of General Koos de la Rey [words indistinct] coincidentally.  Does that not mean that you have a real deep understanding of  the fears and the anger of the white right wing at the moment?    [De Klerk] Oh yes. I have a deep understanding. I have a  very deep understanding of it, and I know that there are many,  many people in that camp at the moment who are genuine people,  who are God-fearing South Africans and Afrikaners, and who are  agonizing, and I am going out of my way to try and convince them  that there is a way, that they must turn away from the cul de  sac into which they are moving, that it is wrong to become  emotional and adhere to a policy which cannot work or succeed in  practice. But the ultra radicals there who are planning  violence, I ask them to also go back in history and to know that  from 1910 onward at least twice there were efforts by Afrikaners  to, through violence, try and achieve their ideals. It never  worked.    [Du Preez] But you....    [De Klerk, interrupting] We got our republic through  constitutional means, not the OB [Ossewa Brandwag -- Ox wagon  Guard], not the Gryshemde [Gray Shirts], not the Stormjaers  [Storm Riders], not General de Wet in the 1914 rebellion. But  those who said -- I will use whatever constitutional opportunity  I get to advance my cause -- they had success in South African,  in Afrikaans political history.    [Du Preez] Mr. de Klerk can I ask you a very  straightforward,  almost intimate question? Is there in your heart, or your mind  somewhere, a small bit that wants a volkstaat [homeland] for the  Afrikaner?    [De Klerk] No. Nowhere. In the sense that I am convinced it  is not achievable, in my heart I want the Afrikaner nation,  together with the Zulu nation, together with the Xhoza nation,  together with any other nation which has a sense of pride in its  history, in its traditions, which is proud of its language, to  have room and space in South Africa to maintain that which is  dear to it, to be sure, to have security that they won't be  suppressed by anybody else. But I believe that the Afrikaner  nation and all other nations can only survive in South Africa,  and can only have a proud existence in South Africa if they find  a way in which to coexist peacefully.    [Du Preez] Do you think General Constand Viljoen is a man of  integrity?    [De Klerk] I think that he is a man of integrity, and I  think  that he has reached a moment of truth, because his integrity has  to a great extent been rejected at that congress where he was  shouted down. He said there, he opened a way, he indicated a  direction which could be followed. If he believes in that, I  think he must stand up and give a lead that that direction must  be followed.    [Du Preez] Mr. de Klerk, let's move on and away from the  right wing. South Africans and the world have seen you and Mr.  Nelson Mandela as partners, as a team that brought us where we  are now. What is it that you have in common with Nelson Mandela?    [De Klerk] I think we have in common a commitment that  through negotiation, and continued negotiation -- because after  the election we'll have once again a constant negotiation  situation -- we'll have to find ways and means of fully ending  conflict and of breaking through to a form of cooperation in the  best interests of all the people. There is much which divides  us but I think we have that in common that we want a peaceful  solution. What I'm dissatisfied with, because I don't question  his integrity, is his lack of action against the wild elements  in his party and in his movement.    [Du Preez] Mr. de Klerk, you are sitting in the voorkamer  [sitting room] of the home of Mrs. Gladys Tshabalala and her  family in Zone 13 Katlehong. She says to you I want to vote.  You have exactly two minutes to tell her why she should vote  for your party. What would you tell her?    [De Klerk] I think I will start with the negative and say:  You have really a choice between two parties, because she  wouldn't be interested in voting CP [Conservative Party], and in  all probability she won't be interested in voting IFP [Inkatha  Freedom Party]. If she discusses the IFP with me I'll tell her  it's such a negative party, against anything, not cooperating --  that I wouldn't put my fate in their hands -- and I would tell  her that you have a basic choice between the ANC and the  National Party, and then I would tell her why I think the ANC is  a dangerous party. I would remind her that the ANC ruined her  son's education. I would remind her that ANC supporters burned  down her sister's house, etcetera, etcetera, and then I would  say but why should you vote for me? And I would tell her that  the National Party is really a party of peace, that the National  Party has constantly in the past four years been the only  binding force which kept us on a sane road. It is the only  party which never left negotiations. It is the only party which  never boycotted. It is the only party with an economic policy  which can create jobs for her children because it will attract  investment, and I will show her -- my heart -- that I care, that  I want to improve her lot and I will ask her to accept that this  party is a new party with a vision for the future, that it has  buried its past and I will ask her to take my hand.    [Du Preez] Unfortunately we will not know what Mrs.  Tshabalala is going to say.    [De Klerk] We will on the 27 April.    [Du Preez] Thank you very much Mr. de Klerk and good night.    [De Klerk] Thank you very much.</p>

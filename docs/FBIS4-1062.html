			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Craig Doonan] </F>   [Text] Ulundi April 20 SAPA -- The kwaZulu government has  pledged its full support to ensure an additional 500 voting  stations are established in the territory before the elections,  according to Independent Electoral Commission [IEC]  Vice-chairman Dikgang Moseneke.    Addressing the media after a five-hour meeting with the  kwaZulu Legislative Assembly in Ulundi on Wednesday [20 April],  Mr Moseneke said a tough job awaited the IEC in the six days  remaining before the elections.    But he added the IEC would try its "damndest" to ensure it  was prepared for elections in the region. "It's going to be  very tough. We are going to have to work very hard. We will  literally have to camp in kwaZulu/Natal," he said.    In contrast to the hostile reception afforded IEC Chairman  Mr  Justice Johann Kriegler last month, Mr Moseneke said the IEC had  been met with "nothing less than co-operation in all areas".  "We are delighted to serve this region without any  impediments... We generally reached agreement on all aspects  pertaining to voter preparation."    IEC Commissioner Charles Nupen explained that an extra 500  polling stations had to be set up to supplement the 1,000  already planned. Another 13,000 people had to be trained to  staff the new polling stations.    He said there would be intensive training courses at the  weekend, adding this required "a hell of a degree of commitment".    Mr Moseneke added that traditional chiefs had also given  their full support to the IEC's voter education programme  provided they were informed of the IEC's presence in their  areas. This was in stark contrast to the blatant rejection by  some chiefs in the kwaZulu Legislative Assembly of Mr Justice  Kriegler's request for similar co-operation last month.    Mr Moseneke said the kwaZulu government had pledged its full  co- operation including the use of human resources, transport  and other logistic requirements.    The kwaZulu Police would be involved in securing polling  stations.</p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Separate sale of Grid's generation business advised Professor Stephen Littlechild, electricity industry regulator, is calling on the regional electricity companies to sell the National Grid's generating business separately at its flotation, planned for the middle of next year. The Grid's generation business - pump storage facilities - consists of about 2,000MW of plant at Dinorwic and Ffestiniog in Wales which has typically supplied about 0.5 per cent of the total output in England and Wales. Analysts put its value at between Pounds 300m and Pounds 500m. In a speech to the Institute of Economic Affairs, Prof Littlechild also urged the regional electricity companies to sell their entire stakes in the Grid, rather than keep back some of the shares for disposal later. He said his preference was that they sell their entire stakes at flotation, 'but if not, within a specified, but short, period after'. In addition he said there 'would be merit' in considering greater separation of the regional companies' distribution networks from their other activities. He said: 'A clearer separation between monopoly networks and potentially competitive activities is more conducive to effective competition and the protection of customers.' While Prof Littlechild is not able to force the regional companies to comply with his wishes, his views will influence both industry executives and the government, which has a golden share in the Grid. He said continued ownership of the Grid by the regional companies, acceptable as a transitional measure since privatisation in 1990, seemed increasingly inappropriate. 'But it is important for the development of competition that transmission be clearly independent of interests in generation or supply.' Prof Littlechild has also thrown his weight behind the idea that some of the proceeds of the Grid sale should be given to electricity consumers. The Grid had a book value of about Pounds 1.2bn when the regional companies were privatised but is now thought to be worth more than Pounds 4bn. The Labour party is pressing for a large part of the difference to be handed over to customers and the companies are proposing a 'rebate' of about Pounds 10 for each customer.</p>

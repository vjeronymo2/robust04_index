			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Berkeley builds up to Pounds 12.6m BERKELEY GROUP yesterday vied for the title of Britain's top performing housebuilder when it announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 12.6m for the year to the end of April, compared with just Pounds 925,000 last time. The company also recommended increasing its final dividend from 3p to 3.5p, making a total of 5p (4.5p) for the year. Few British housebuilders will be able to report any increase in profits, let alone one of such magnitude, during one of the worst years the industry has experienced. The absence of provisions against falling property values which cost Berkeley Pounds 760,000 at the corresponding stage last year helped earnings per share rise from 0.3p to 13.6p. Group turnover advanced from Pounds 99.7m to Pounds 126m. Housebuilding profits increased from Pounds 85,000 to Pounds 11.2m as the group took advantage of its strong financial position to buy lower priced land. Mr Tony Pidgley, managing director, said the average cost of a site for each house sold last year was Pounds 35,000 compared with Pounds 55,000 during the previous 12 months, boosting net margins to 10 per cent. 'Buying land is never easy but this is the best market I have known in my 16 years in the business,' said Mr Pidgley. 'We recently paid Pounds 1m for a site near Heathrow airport with room for about 400 homes.' The number of homes sold by the group increased by almost three quarters from 491 to 858. Average sale prices fell from Pounds 204,000 to Pounds 147,000, due mainly to distortion caused by the inclusion, since September, of St George as a wholly-owned subsidiary. St George, formerly 50 per cent owned by Speyhawk, the troubled property development group, builds mainly lower priced social housing in London. The construction of homes largely for housing associations remains one of the few growth sectors in the market, and St George last year made pre-tax profits of Pounds 3m (Pounds 1.6m). Berkeley has also been seeking to invest in commercial property while prices are at basement levels, and its joint venture with Saad Investments of the Middle East has so far spent Pounds 65m. COMMENT The secret of investment is getting the timing right and Berkeley, during the last few years, has got it right in spades. The decision in 1989 to liquidate land holdings and work in progress means that the group's gearing today, is just 2 per cent - leaving it admirably placed to take advantage of distressed land and property sales by others less well placed. There can be few companies better sited to take advantage when the recovery in the housing market finally gets under way. Profits - given any sort of following wind - should top Pounds 20m this year. At Pounds 22m, this would put the group on a prospective p/e of just under 12 - definitely an under-rated stock given ratings elsewhere in the sector.</p>

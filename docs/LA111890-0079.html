			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BENEFITS OF A SMALL DOWN PAYMENT;  </P> <P> HOME BUYING: TAX LAWS ENCOURAGE KEEPING CASH DOWN PAYMENTS AS SMALL AS  POSSIBLE. PROFITS ARE GREATER WHEN BORROWING IN A RISING MARKET.  </P> <P> You are ready to buy a home. Whether it is your first home or a move-up home,  you are probably debating whether to make a large or small cash down payment.  Of course, if you don't have much cash available, you have little choice but to  make a minimal 5% or 10% down payment (or no down payment if you qualify for a  VA home loan).  </P> <P> However, even if you have lots of cash available, you may be better off making  the smallest possible down payment and obtaining the largest available  mortgage.  </P> <P> The 1987 Tax Act encourages home buyers to obtain the largest available  mortgage and make the smallest possible cash down payment. That's because the  government allows you to deduct all your interest up to $1 million used to buy  or build a house.  </P> <P> In addition, homeowners can deduct interest on a home-equity loan up to  $100,000. This means homeowners who make a large down payment and later decide  to refinance can only deduct interest on the amount of their original mortgage  plus interest on a home-equity loan up to $100,000.  </P> <P> Existing home mortgages as of Oct. 17, 1987, are "grandfathered" under the 1987  Tax Act. For example, if your first mortgage balance on that date was $75,000  and you had a $35,000 second mortgage, you can deduct interest on those loans  plus interest on new home-equity financing up to $100,000 additional for a  total of $210,000.  </P> <P> Besides the tax deductions for home mortgage interest, there are other  advantages to making a small down payment. The principal one is called  leverage, meaning you control all the property benefits with a small amount of  cash and a large percentage of borrowed money.  </P> <P> To illustrate, suppose you buy a $100,000 home with a $10,000 cash down payment  and a $90,000 mortgage. If the home appreciates 5% in market value during the  next 12 months, that $5,000 profit is a 50% return on your $10,000 investment.  </P> <P> On the other hand, if you had bought the same $100,000 house with $100,000 cash  and it appreciates 5% in value during the next year, your $5,000 profit is only  a 5% return on your $100,000 investment. That is obviously a very poor return.  </P> <P> If home values in your town should go down, your equity would obviously be  diminished. But if you had only invested $10,000, the most you could lose is  $10,000.  </P> <P> Conversely, if you paid all-cash for the house, you could theoretically lose  all the $100,000 that you invested. In other words, owning a home free and  clear can be very risky.  </P> <P> Your overall return is higher, on a percentage basis, if you make a minimal  down payment. If property values go down, you'll lose more if you made a big  down payment than if you had made a small one.  </P> <P> Special note should be made that whenever possible, home buyers should avoid  personal liability on their mortgages, just in case the property declines in  value.  </P> <P> There can be severe income tax consequences to walking away from a mortgage,  but the situation is worsened if the property is lost by foreclosure and the  lender can collect a deficiency loss judgment against the borrower.  </P> <P> Current tax law encourages homeowners to borrow heavily on their home purchases  so they can maximize their income tax deductions. But high leverage also can be  wise investing because a small equity maximizes the potential profit percentage  while minimizing the cash you can lose if home values decline.  </P> <P> Another way of stating these leverage principles is if you think home values  will go up, high leverage with a small down payment will be most profitable.  But if you think home values will go down, don't buy.  </P></p>

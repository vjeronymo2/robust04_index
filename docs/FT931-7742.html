			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Business and the Law: Cross border manoeuvres - Revised EC rules for vetting joint ventures Business can today cross European Community borders with unprecedented freedom. Succeeding in a new market is never easy, given different national consumer preferences; nor is it seldom cheap or risk-free. Companies that do business across EC borders have a compelling interest in the 'obstruction' - Euro red-tape - posed by the European Commission, as the EC competition authority. Though much reduced today, Euro red-tape can still prove a huge stumbling block for business. Industry views the Commission as the flag-carrier for cross-border mergers and acquisitions: as a champion of the adventurous foreign company against local protectionism. But companies also tend to resent the Commission's powers over their commercial dealings, especially in view of the delays involved, and accuse it of unnecessary legalism. Cross-border joint ventures often bring out industry's ambivalent attitude towards the Commission. The treatment of joint ventures also illustrates the Commission's seemingly contradictory function of encouraging cross-border mergers while at the same time stopping companies banding together in anti-competitive ways. The Commission defines a joint venture an 'institutionally fixed' form of co-operation between independent enterprises. The venture need not be separately incorporated, but it must be active as an entity and owned by the enterprises which set it up. There are two main ways in which the actions of companies can reduce competition: cartels, which are 'behavioural' and, in principle, undesirable; and mergers, which are 'structural' but which can invigorate competition. This theoretical distinction becomes extremely fuzzy when applied to joint ventures, which contain elements of both. The EC Merger Regulation, the Community's vehicle for vetting mergers affecting the European market, has also made matters worse by offering companies a strong incentive to draft their cross-border joint ventures as 'mergers'. A joint venture which is categorised as 'concentrative' (ie, as a merger), falls under the Merger Regulation and because of the regulation's strict procedural time limits may be cleared and up and running within a few months; hence the attraction to companies of ensuring their joint ventures are drafted as mergers. A deal drafted as a 'co-operative' joint venture, however, is beyond the ambit of the Merger Regulation and may fall by the wayside while awaiting approval under EC competition rules; even then, permission is not necessarily final and is often of limited duration. A 'concentrative' joint venture involves a permanent structural change in the market-place, such as the arrival of a new player in a sector. The parent companies of the joint venture enjoy the normal shareholder relationship with a 'concentrative' joint venture; but the venture will not be treated as such unless it is also designed to perform as an autonomous and permanent economic entity. Most important, the venture must not 'give rise to co-ordination of competitive behaviour' - or anti-competitive practices - among the parents or between them and the joint venture. However, difficulties arise with the word 'co-ordination'. If the parents and the joint venture itself operate in the same market, it is likely that the joint venture will be treated as a springboard for developing a common strategy and will therefore be treated as 'co-operative.' If the joint venture is intended to operate in a related market, for example, distributing two manufacturers' products, the Commission may also come to the same conclusion. The Commission is mindful of the divergent treatment of 'concentrative' and 'co-operative' joint ventures, and is now trying to reduce its significance in practice. Until the end of last year, most joint ventures needed individual exemption from EC competition rules before they could proceed. Now the Commission has restated its earlier practice of presuming 'co-operative' joint ventures to be eligible for exemption. It has also extended the general exemptions for certain types of agreement, such as patent and know-how licensing, to joint ventures. The Commission has already issued guidance on the distinction between 'concentrative' and 'co-operative' ventures. Last week a further notice was published defining 'co-operative' ventures and explaining Commission practice in assessing them. The guidance provides some insight, for example, by summarising the questions the Commission will ask companies when judging whether competition between the parent companies is likely to be affected. The differences, even in terms of competition policy, between the two types of joint ventures are hardly sufficient to justify big differences in treatment. Accordingly, the Commission has proposed improving the position of 'co-operative' ventures through an 'internal organisation of procedure'. Since last month, 'structural' deals - including 'co-operative' joint ventures - have been processed more speedily under the Rome Treaty's article 85 exemption or 'negative clearance procedures'. The Commission has promised to give either a 'comfort letter' or a 'warning letter to companies within two months of being notified of a prospective joint venture. A comfort letter means the Commission does not object to the deal or that it intends to grant negative clearance or an exemption; a 'warning letter' would tell the companies that the Commission has serious doubts about the deal (see chart). If the Commission does not issue a comfort letter it will open a second stage inquiry - for which there is no time limit. A swifter timetable has been promised for other cases after April 1. But the new internal procedure may not go far enough. Full information similar to that required for mergers must still be supplied. Even companies which have already given exhaustive information on an unsuccessful application for merger clearance may be asked for further details, and the two-month period may then start afresh. The concept of a 'warning' letter is new and although potentially useful where only minor adjustments are needed in the deal to make it acceptable to the Commission, the letter may have legal effect. Normally companies can proceed with a joint venture while awaiting the Commission's decision, but this carries the risk that the Commission may subsequently block the venture. It is possible that a warning letter will have the same effect as a decision blocking the deal. This would make the joint venture's further implementation unlawful. Finally, it is difficult to understand why there should be no time limit on the second stage of the inquiry, given the amount of information that the Commission will have by then.

Companies which receive a warning letter should stop all progress  towards implementing the joint venture. Commission will open a second stage inquiry to decide whether to  approve or forbid the joint venture. There is no time limit on a  second stage enquiry  ---------------------------------------------------------------</p>

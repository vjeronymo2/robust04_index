Wolfgang K. from Ruesselsheim is said  to be the leader, and is currently in detention pending trial.  The other four, who belong to the inner circle of the FRG  neo-Nazi scene, have not been arrested.    About two months ago DER EINBLICK was disseminated through a  Danish post office box. The brochure contained 40 pages with  names and addresses of political opponents. During a search  last week, police arrested 25-year-old Wolfgang K. He is  accused of having written the text and the introduction. In  contrast with the other four suspects, Wolfgang K. was not  previously known.    In Rodach in Upper Franken, the Bavarian Land Office of  Criminal Investigations searched the apartment of right-wing  extremist Eberhard Hefendehl. Investigations were initiated  against him. For eight years Hefendehl has been publishing the  openly racist, anti-Semitic brochure DER SCHEINWERFER [THE  SPOTLIGHT] in his "ODAL publishing company." The 63-year-old  man is also said to have printed the first 500 copies of DER  EINBLICK. Hefendehl has excellent contacts in the FRG Nazi  scene. He closely cooperates with Kai Dalek, of the Kronach  cadre of the militant "New Front Association of Like-Minded  People" (GdNF), who boasts of having spied on leftists before  the "Rudolf Hess memorial marches" and on the "KOMM" youth  center in Nuremberg.    Hefendehl was not only able to publish materials written by  convicted right-wing terrorist Manfred Roeder and Erhard Kemper,  former chairman of the North Rhine-Westphalia "Liberal German  Workers Party" (FAP) in DER SCHEINWERFER, but also articles by  Christian Worch from Hamburg, who is the chairman of the GdNF  and one of the leaders of the "National List" (NL) in Hamburg.  Via the NL brochure INDEX, Worch plays a leading role in the  anti-antifa [anti-antifascist] activities. The paper of the Aid  Association for National Political Prisoners (HNG), which  regularly contains one anti-antifa page, was also disseminated  via Hefendehl.    Hefendehl is also doing business on the international level.  The Austrian office of DER SCHEINWERFER is headed by  Otto-Rudolf Braun. He publishes articles in BAUERNSCHAFT  [PEASANTRY], which is published by neo-Nazi Thies  Christophersen, who fled to Denmark. DER SCHEINWERFER is  disseminated not only in Europe, but also in South Africa,  Namibia, the United States, Canada, Australia, Argentina, and  Chile. Last spring 23-year-old Stefan Cumic, from Wiesbaden,  traveled through Chile, where he reportedly collected money for  the publication of an anti-antifa brochure. "Over the past two  and one-half months I, myself, was abroad (visiting German  emigrants in Chile and Argentina) to make propaganda for the  idea of DER EINBLICK at the international level," he writes on  24 May 1993. This admission is available to the BAW.    Cumic, who is now being investigated by the BAW for being a  member of a right-wing extremist criminal association, announced  the publication of DER EINBLICK as early as in September 1992,  in the GdNF brochure NEUE FRONT-WIDERSTAND [NEW  FRONT-RESISTANCE]. However, nothing came of it.    Instead, "National Info-Telephone" (NIT) in Mainz regularly  announced the addresses of post office boxes belonging to  regional anti-antifa groups and called for the collection of  material. Neo-Nazis Michael Petri (21) and Sascha Chaves (21)  from Mainz are behind NIT. The BAW had suspected Petri, former  member of the banned German Alternative and now federal chairman  of the newly founded German Nationalists, and Chaves of having  participated in DER EINBLICK since the beginning of December.  Both were arrested following searches of their apartments.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["International Forum" column article by Gu Ping (0657 </F> 1627): "A Chat Commencing With Change of Targets of Nuclear  Warheads"]    [Text] Russia and the United States have recently  announced that beginning 30 and 31 May, the strategic nuclear  warheads in the two countries will aim at the seas instead of  aiming at each other. A similar measure has also been taken  between Britain and Russia. Meanwhile, the Russian and American  armed forces have arranged a joint military exercise for the  first time in early July, however, although only 500 soldiers  will be involved, the details have yet to be worked out. In  light of the sensitive discussions by the Russian press  regarding the areas along the Volga as the site of the exercise,  several American senators have suggested that the site of the  exercise should be changed to a U.S. military base, and now the  two sides are discussing the matter.    Both issues have symbolic significance. The former signifies  an "end to the era of viewing each other as nuclear opponents"  between the two countries; the latter indicates that although  Russia and the United States are no longer "nuclear opponents,"  it is not easy to build a new relationship in concrete terms.  These two matters quite clearly reflect the current situation  of the Russian-U.S. relations.    After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Russian-U.S.  relations once became very "hot," and the press in the West  called the situation a "honeymoon" in Russian-U.S. relations,  holding that this was a "romantic period" after the two  countries experienced a cold war and confrontation for more than  four decades. Since the end of last year, difficulties in  relations between the two countries have begun to increase. In  February this year, Russia acted alone to intervene in the  Sarajevo crisis, using vigorous political mediation to get rid  of NATO's air strike plan, thus, ending the "honeymoon" period  in Russian-U.S. relations. It seems that the relations between  the two countries are changing into a new phase.    There are many reasons for Russian-U.S. relations to change  from "honeymoon" to a condition of cooperation on the one hand  and competition on the other. One important reason is that  although the ideological factor which played a vital role in the  Soviet-U.S. relations in the past no longer exists, the  geopolitical interests of Russia and the United States, the two  big powers in the world, remain unchanged, and to a great extent  this determines the basic orientation of Russian-U.S. relations.  National interests, the status of a big country, and influence  on the world have already become the foundation stone of  Russia's diplomatic strategy. It seems that the United States  has not abandoned the "restraining strategy" it once used in the  past. The suspicious and precautionary mentality in the  relations between the two countries still exists.    Judged from a certain stance, changing the targets of  nuclear  warheads to the high seas also vividly reflects a new pattern of  relations between the major powers after the cold war: Gone are  the days when a clear line between friends and foes could be  drawn and confrontation between groups could be seen. A new  picture, more complicated and characterized by a condition in  which one is neither friend nor foe or both friend and foe, has  emerged. Proceeding from their own basic interests, Russia, the  United States, and other major Western powers attack, defend,  charge, and retreat in the big chess board of international  politics, and maneuver among various political groupings, to  strive for a better position in the emerging new world pattern.</p>

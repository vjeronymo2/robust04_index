			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / The Long View: End of the City gent AN IRA bomb may have blown out the windows, but it is a combination of deregulation and competition that threatens to destroy the heart of the City of London. Two of its greatest institutions, the Stock Exchange and Lloyd's, are in deep trouble. The coffee house origins of Lloyd's and the Stock Exchange go back to 1688 and 1773 respectively - so a lot of history is at stake. That both institutions are in distress at the same time cannot be coincidence, and is telling us something important about the City and its place within the international financial markets. For centuries the City's financial industry has been protected by the British government. This was a key aspect of British colonialism: the finance and trade of the empire would be controlled through London, leading to thriving markets in insurance, banking, securities and commodities. Such matters are comprehensively treated in a two-volume history British Imperialism* by P J Cain and A G Hopkins. The authors develop the concept of 'gentlemanly capitalism' to explain why the UK grew a top-heavy financial system and exported financial services where other countries concentrated on industrial or agricultural goods. From the beginning, they argue, social status was conferred by involvement with aristocratic and imperialist pursuits, leading to an exaggerated role in the UK for the professions and the Civil Service, especially colonial administration. Manufacturing industry, concentrated in the socially subordinate north of the country, was tolerated for the wealth it created but was regarded as a threat to the established social order and, with its huge workforces, as a breeding-ground for socialism. These issues have repeatedly surfaced throughout recent British history. In 1930, for instance, the Macmillan Committee observed that 'in some respects the City is more highly organised to provide capital to foreign countries than to British industry'. The second world war, however, caused a huge loss of Britain's overseas wealth and led to a crippling framework of high tax rates and foreign exchange controls which was not finally dismantled until Thatcherism arrived in 1979. At Lloyd's, ironically, this postwar framework eventually created an enormous boom. Aided by favourable legislation, and a nod and a wink from the tax man, it was able to exploit loopholes on an ever-increasing scale. At home the wealthy Names saw an opportunity to avoid high taxes and exchange controls, while regulatory anomalies in the insurance business overseas (especially in the US) offered lucrative opportunities. By the 1970s, however, huge profits were corrupting the fragile gentlemanly ethics in Lime Street. During the 1980s the rapacious US legal system pounced on a soft target by raising fines and penalties (on asbestosis cases, for example) to levels undreamt of by Lloyd's underwriters. Lloyd's had expanded disastrously out of its original niche in the insurance of ships and had blundered into too many areas it did not understand. It thrived while protected by the old traditions of the British Empire, but what now? Its bleak choices amount either to a retreat to whatever is left of its marine and aviation niche, or an attempt to compete on equal terms with insurers around the globe. Being gentlemanly will not be enough. The similarities between Lloyd's and the Stock Exchange are far from complete. Both have been protected by legislation, being allowed a tremendous degree of self-regulation. Both were clubby and inward-looking, with strong links to the upper class social network. Both kept out corporate interests by insisting on unlimited liability. Unlike Lloyd's, however, after the second world war the London Stock Exchange could find few loopholes and it was forced to suppress its international ambitions. It survived by refining its domestic monopoly, but that made it unable to respond to the opportunity created by the Eurobond market from the late 1960s onwards because Eurobond firms could not be brought within the membership structure. The Bank of England, by that time again actively promoting the City of London's global reach, began to be displeased. In the late 1970s a Labour government referred the Exchange to the Restrictive Practices Court. The incoming Thatcher administration maintained the threat. The eventual outcome was the Big Bang deregulation. At last the Stock Exchange saw a window of opportunity. It would invite in global securities firms and mount a challenge to the even sleepier and more inward-looking bourses of continental Europe. Sure enough its new SEAQ International market has proved an astonishing success, for instance handling nearly 40 per cent of turnover in French shares in 1992. But will this success endure? There is no red on the map to protect it. No longer backed by thousands of individual members dependent on it for monopoly profits, the London Stock Exchange now relies on the doubtful loyalty of a small number of international securities houses. The debacle of Taurus, the settlement system that proved beyond the Exchange's competence to develop, provided a reminder of the dangerous link between gentlemen and amateurism. Cain and Hopkins suggest that the momentum of history is too powerful to be easily reversed. My own view is that they may be underestimating the degree of internationalisation of the whole economy, not just the City itself. What remains of the manufacturing sector is increasingly dominated by powerful overseas interests. Whereas British industrialists could be ignored, or fobbed off with peerages, Nissan, IBM and Siemens will demand a pro-manufacturing attitude. As the British political establishment again displays its liking for an overvaluation of sterling, a battle looms. *British Imperialism: 1688-1914 and 1914-1990 (two vols) by Cain and Hopkins, published by Longman.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Excerpt] Ankara (DUNYA)--The financial cost of the  Economic Stabilization Program announced on 5 April will be  300.7 trillion Turkish lira [TL]. This was announced yesterday  by Social Democratic Populist Party [SHP] leader Murat  Karayalcin during an Assembly group meeting in Ankara.    According to Karayalcin, the TL330.7 trillion will be  derived  thusly: TL70 trillion from tax reforms, TL204 trillion from  increases, and TL58.1 trillion from other reforms. By "other  reforms," Karayalcin stated he means the elimination of the  nonproductive work sector, collection of back taxes, and  avoidance of penalties. Karayalcin described the distribution of  the total cost to the public sectors as follows: (a) wage and  salaried sector (7.2 million people) 27.5 percent (TL91.1  trillion); (b) agricultural sector (8.5 million people) 14.2  percent (TL47.1 trillion); and (c) capital sector (8 million  people) 58.2 percent (TL192.5 trillion).    The breakdown of the wage and salaried sector cost is as  follows: (a) TL16.6 trillion from tax reforms; (b) TL54.9  trillion from increases; (c) TL19.6 trillion from other reforms.  The breakdown of the agricultural sector cost is as follows:  (a) TL3.1 trillion from taxes; (b) TL38.9 trillion from  increases; (c) TL7.1 trillion from other reforms. The breakdown  of the capital sector is as follows: (a) TL90.3 trillion from  taxes; (b) TL112.8 trillion from increases; (c) TL29.4 trillion  from other reforms.    Karayalcin noted the following concerning the Council of  Ministers' new TL70 trillion tax reform package issued the  previous day: (a) additional tax revenues TL13.9 trillion; (b)  additional enterprise taxes TL10.1 trillion; (c) net tax credits  TL29-30 trillion. Karayalcin said that the Council of Ministers  had adopted the principle of deriving taxes not just from  transportation, real estate, and other taxables, but also from  transfers, whichever was higher. He described the distribution  of the burden among the various sectors as unequal, but he said  that the inequality was targeted not at any participating sector  but at capital in general. Karayalcin thanked Motherland Party  leader Mesut Yilmaz and Democratic Left Party leader Bulent  Ecevit for supporting the Stabilization Program, and he asked  for the support of his own Assembly group in order to get the  tax reform package through the Turkish Grand National Assembly  [TBMM]. He also stressed the need for quick approval of the  Radio and Television bill currently on the Assembly's agenda.    Karayalcin further stated that the state enterprise closings  will only take effect at the end of the year. Since there is no  decision on firing workers, it is possible that only those who  work at nonprofitable enterprises will lose their jobs.  Karayalcin stressed that the government's first priority is to  find ways to return these enterprises to profitability. Noting  that at Zonguldak those working above the ground outnumber those  working in the mines, Karayalcin said that efforts are being  expedited to create new jobs for 21,000 people in the region.

The  authors of the draft gave up a few of the provisions that had  been submitted before but that were sharply criticized (as  aiming to make local elections overly political); these  provisions pertained first of all to direct elections of  wojtowie [chief officers of groups of villages] and mayors. The  authors of the draft also gave up the idea of distributing the  same electoral list numbers among the parties as they had during  the parliamentary elections. The authors of the draft think  that the draft should be debated as soon as possible by a  specially created Extraordinary Commission.    "Whatever it is possible to save, from among the principles  applied during elections to the Sejm, must be maintained with  regard to local elections"--this is how Sejm Deputy Ryszard  Grodzicki of the SLD explained, during Wednesday's [26 January]  press conference, why the authors of the draft want to see a  uniformization of the election system and proportionate  elections to gmina councils everywhere. Up to now, this kind of  elections took part only in those gminas whose population  exceeded 40,000 people. In smaller gminas, elections took place  in one-seat districts: Whoever won became the gmina council  member for his particular district. "Such elections were  accidental and did not reflect the configuration of forces  within gminas," Grodzicki says.    "Fears of allegedly rendering local elections overly  dependent on political parties are unjustified," says Professor  Stanislaw Gebethner, an expert for the SLD. According to him,  the June elections will demonstrate a weakness by all of the  parties, with groups of citizens being the primary winners.  "Individual candidates will have no chance," Sejm Deputy  Grodzicki admits. But he also adds that any party wanting to  run in the elections in a particular gmina will have to collect  an appropriate number of signatures, which would support that  party's list. "There is no danger of a formalized structure  submitting its candidates without the inhabitants' support,"  Grodzicki says. According to the draft, 15-150 signatures are  enough for submitting a list.    To secure places in gmina councils for people who are  popular  in the particular gmina regardless of the their political  affiliation, SLD activists are proposing that anyone who manages  to gain 7-percent support can become a council member, even if,  according to electoral-law arithmetic, his list will not be  taken into account in seat distribution.    According to Sejm Deputy Krzysztof Janik, there were three  reasons for the SLD's giving up the idea of direct elections of  wojtowie and mayors by all inhabitants of a gmina. First of  all, there emerged a fear that the Small Constitution might have  to be changed. Second, there emerged "significant opposition by  political groups and by those parts of parliamentary clubs that  have the power of shaping opinions." Third, the SLD wanted to  avoid being accused of settling its own party interests.    "We can see no particular benefits for ourselves from the  introduction of the new electoral law," says Ryszard Grodzicki.  According to Krzysztof Janik, the SLD is eager to see political  parties strengthened, whereas the new election system is  supposed to be conducive to that.    Janik also announced that Sejm deputies for the SLD will  return (although not at the time of the next elections) at some  point to the idea of directly electing mayors and wojtowie.  They will also submit a proposal for an electoral law with  regard to self-governmental powiat [small administrative units]  councils "in the near future." That will be done along with  other draft laws pertaining to powiats.</p>

			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: New levels of strain in ERM THE STRAINS inside the European exchange rate mechanism heightened to new levels yesterday as the stronger D-Mark pushed five ERM currencies close to their floors against the German currency, writes James Blitz. The Bank of France intervened heavily to support the franc when it was one centime above its ERM floor, while the Spanish, Portuguese and Irish central banks all came into the market to buy their currencies as they slipped towards their respective floors against the D-Mark. The Dutch central bank bought the Irish punt and the Danish krone for Dutch guilders, the second strongest currency in the ERM grid. In a rumour-ridden market, French and German financial officials were forced to declare publicly that there would be no EMS realignment, but there were strong rumours in the French market that a 3 per cent devaluation of the French franc against the D-Mark was imminent. The latest stage in the ERM crisis was triggered by a poor figure for M3 money supply in Germany, which rose to 9 per cent on an annualised basis, from 8.5 per cent in July. The rise in the figure underlined that German interest rates will not come down easily and that further intervention by the Bundesbank to support ERM currencies, which has already run to DM60bn in recent weeks, is unlikely. The Bank of France's purchase of francs was not on the scale of the UK's buying of sterling a week ago today, but there were widespread suggestions that France has spent around half of its Dollars 31bn of foreign currency reserves in recent days. In London trading the franc finished at FFr3.4260 to the D-Mark, against a previous FFr3.4150. The weaker currencies in the system slumped even more sharply. The Spanish peseta closed at Pta71.91 per D-Mark, compared to its ERM floor of Pta72.62. The Irish punt was at DM2.6205, against a floor of DM2.6190. The Portuguese escudo dropped to lows beyond Esc89 to the D-Mark, against a floor of Esc92.33. Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist of DKB International in London, said yesterday's events made a near-term realignment very likely, with the D-Mark revaluing against all currencies, and the French franc saving face by appreciating against all the weaker ones. But the French central bank may feel that if it surrenders its franc fort policy against the D-Mark, it may take years to recover credibility. The alternative would be to raise interest rates. The chaos in Europe's monetary system had ripple effects across the globe yesterday. The yen rallied strongly against the dollar, closing at Y121.15 from a previous Y123.70. Japanese investors were reported to be repatriating their investments before the first half of Japan's fiscal year ends this month.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The president, Flight Lieutenant Rawlings, has  held discussions with a nine-member delegation from the World  Bank at the Castle, Osu. Our Castle correspondent, Teye  Kitcher, has the story:    [Kitcher] The nine members of the delegation are all  executive directors of the World Bank and are part of the  24-member board of the bank, its highest management body. The  board of the World Bank is responsible for the approval of  loans, credits, and other forms of assistance. The delegation,  which is led by Mr. Nicholas Flanol, is on a familiarization  tour of the country to see how the bank's assistance has been  utilized so far, and to discuss future prospects with the  government. It is expected that, after discussions with  government officials on the economy, the delegation will  appreciate Ghana's peculiar problems and be in a position to  react favorably when requests for assistance come before the  board of the World Bank. The delegation, which has been in  Ghana for the past four days, has met the ministers of finance,  education, food and agriculture, trade and industry, and mines  and energy. [passage omitted]</p>

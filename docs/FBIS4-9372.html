			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Staff report: "Jovanovic Came Uninvited To Spread </F> Propaganda"]    [Text] Guarded more than Michael Jackson by Bulgarian and  Serbian services, FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic  dropped in uninvited in Sofia on Saturday evening [16 April].  He came without any previous announcement and without an  agenda; however, all measures were taken to avoid unscheduled  media contact. At 1930 on Saturday, the Serbian Embassy informed  the editorial boards of newspapers that there would be a news  conference, knowing perfectly well that there would be no one  there at that time. On 17 April, a carefully filtered and  abbreviated piece of information about the talks with the  Bulgarian foreign minister was faxed.    As could be expected, after the fraternal embraces with the  socialist government in Athens, Jovanovic demanded that the  Bulgarian Government insist on a lifting of the sanctions  against the FRY -- in other words, demanding that the Bulgarian  Government oppose the United Nations. This is something that  the great friends of the Belgrade regime, the former Bulgarian  Communists, tried to do last week.    It was to the credit of Minister Daskalov that he clearly  said to the uninvited guest that regardless of the material  difficulties related to observing the embargo, Bulgaria will  adhere to the UN resolutions, guided by the premise that they  are a peaceful, political means. The issue of lifting the  sanctions directly depends on finding a lasting and peaceful  solution to the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    When the Bulgarian side posed the issue of violating the  rights of the Bulgarian minority, the Belgrade minister said, as  usual, that there are no such violations. Jovanovic did not have  any information about Lyuben Stoichkov, a Bulgarian from  Bosilegrad who was sentenced by the Serbian authorities for  talking to Bulgarian diplomats.    Asked why Belgrade is preventing foreign correspondents,  including Eli Yurukova, Radio Free Europe, and DEMOKRATSIYA,  from doing their job, Jovanovic said that the correspondents  present the regime's policy as "satanical." As a true  Communist, he described the reporting of the truth about the  military activities in Bosnia as an "abuse of journalistic  ethics."    Everything else the Belgrade diplomat said in Sofia followed  propoganda rules. He even utilized the decision of the  Bulgarian Parliament to allow the passage of the UN equipment  convoy through our country in order to voice the slogan that the  Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  -- FYROM] was not threatened from the north, and that the  presence of UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Forces]  observers there was a result of "false claims and  manipulations." A long time must pass before good-neighborly  relations are established between Belgrade and Skopje, Jovanovic  said.    After he decided that his propaganda mission was  accomplished, the minister departed yesterday. This time he was  guarded like Madonna.</p>

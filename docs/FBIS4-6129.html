			<p>BFN     [Text] Kunihiko Saito, administrative vice minister of  foreign affairs, gave a lecture in Chiba City on 13 April and  commented on the meeting between Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata  and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor scheduled in  Marrakech, Morocco, on 15 April. He said: "We have absolutely  no way of knowing whether an agreement can be reached there on a  resumption of the (Japan-U.S.) framework trade talks. The issue  may not be settled so easily, particularly because of the  current political situation in Japan." He thus indicated it  could be difficult to break the ice in resuming the deadlocked  framework trade talks.    Saito then added: "In the past, mutual interests (between  Japan and the United States) on security matters have covered up  bilateral trade friction, but it is unlikely that such a  situation would continue (in the future). Unless Japan tries  harder, bilateral relations will worsen, contrary to what has  happened in the past." He thus stressed the need for Japan to  actively work toward breaking the deadlock.</p>

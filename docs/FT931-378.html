			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: Bobst net income slips 8.6% to SFr65m for year BOBST, the Swiss packaging machinery group, saw consolidated net income fall 8.6 per cent last year to SFr65m (Dollars 43m) on sales of SFr1.01bn, down 10.3 per cent. The directors said there was an accelerated slowdown during the last months of the year, particularly in Europe. They expect a recovery in 1993, particularly in the US, 'but not sufficient to avoid a further slowdown of the overall activity this year'. The group has announced plans to convert its parti-cipation shares into bearer shares and to split the registered and bearer shares on the basis of two for each one held. Forbo, the Swiss floor and wall coverings group, has reported an 8 per cent slide in consolidated net income to SFr46.1m on sales up 1 per cent to SFr1.8bn. The group said the result was satisfactory in spite of the increasingly acute impact of recession, especially in Scandinavia, Britain and Switzerland.</p>

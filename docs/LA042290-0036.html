			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH COURT GOES COLD ON RELIGIOUS LIBERTY;  </P> <P> LAW: THE FOUNDING FATHERS CLEARLY INTENDED RELIGION TO BE PERFECTLY FREE, BUT  ONLY AS LONG AS IT STAYED PERFECTLY PRIVATE.  </P> <P> A central purpose of America's political arrangements is the subordination of  religion to the political order, meaning the primacy of democracy. The  Founders, like John Locke before them, wished to tame and domesticate religious  passions of the sort that convulsed Europe. They aimed to do so not by  establishing religion, but by establishing a commercial republic -- capitalism.  </P> <P> Hence religion is to be perfectly free as long as it is perfectly private --  mere belief -- but it must bend to the political will (law) as regards conduct.  Thus Thomas Jefferson held that "operations of the mind" are not subject to  legal coercion, but that "acts of the body" are. Mere belief, said Jefferson,  in one god or 20, neither picks one's pockets nor breaks one's legs.  </P> <P> His distinction rests on Locke's principle that religion can be useful or  disruptive, but its truth cannot be established by reason. Hence Americans  would not "establish" religion. Rather, by guaranteeing free exercise of  religions, they would make religions private and subordinate.  </P> <P> Twenty-three states and federal law exempt the religious use of peyote from  prohibitions, and Justice Antonin Scalia, who wrote the majority opinion in the  Oregon case, indicates sympathy for that policy. However, he rightly insists it  is not constitutionally obligatory.  </P> <P> If, he says, some religious conduct is thus disadvantaged, that is "an  unavoidable consequence of democratic government."  </P> <P> The Founders favored religious tolerance because religious pluralism meant  civil peace -- order. Thus Scalia is following the Founders when he finds the  limits of constitutionally required tolerance of "free exercise" in the idea  that a society is "courting anarchy" when it abandons the principle stated in  the 1879 ruling: "Laws are made for the government of actions." If conduct  arising from belief, not just belief itself, is exempt from regulation, that  would permit "every citizen to become a law unto himself."  </P> <P> Scalia's position is not only sound conservatism, it is constitutionally  correct.  </P></p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Dublin pledges security review The Republic of Ireland is to review security after a failed bomb attack in Dublin at the weekend, which the loyalist paramilitary group, the Ulster Volunteer Force, claimed responsibility for. At the formal reopening of the Shannon-Erne waterway on the Northern Irish border yesterday, Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, announced a security review and said that efforts would be made to restart political talks in the north. Ms Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, the Irish justice minister, said there was concern about possible further attacks after the Dublin bomb. Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, yesterday blamed the 'ambiguity and uncertainty' of the British government over Northern Ireland for encouraging loyalist paramilitaries 'to achieve a balance of terror'. Yet he said he was encouraged by reports that the combined leadership of the loyalist paramilitaries was planning to meet this week to consider his recent call for a ceasefire. The Rev Roy Magee, a Presbyterian minister, met leaders of the UVF and UFF in Belfast yesterday. He said he believed the Dublin attack was a 'warning shot', not the start of an continuing campaign south of the border. He said the lack of an IRA response to the joint declaration meant the loyalist paramilitaries considered themselves in a 'state of war' and were making the point that they must be dealt with.</p>

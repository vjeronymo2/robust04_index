			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jean-Claude Paye, secretary general of the </F> OECD, by Pascal Aubert; place and date not given: "Jean-Claude  Paye: `Europe Must Revise Its Social Protection Systems'"]    [Text] [Aubert] This time the world recovery seems to be  well and truly underway. In the wake of the recovery in the  Anglo-Saxon countries, economic activity is now reviving in  Europe. Does the OECD agree?    [Paye] Yes. All the reports by economic institutes, national  organizations, and governments agree that, in addition to the  Anglo-Saxon countries which have been recovering for some time  now, there are definite signs of a recovery in continental  Europe and Japan. Spring is not completely with us yet, but  winter is almost over. This will lead us to upwardly revise,  slightly, the forecasts we made five months ago in "Perspectives  Economique" [economic prospects] published at the end of  December 1993. The rise varies depending on the countries  involved, but on average, for 1994 and 1995, figures will be 0.2  to 0.5 percent up.    [Aubert] What about in the specific case of France?    [Paye] At the time of speaking I do not have any fresh data  so I cannot give you a precise answer. I just know that there  are indeed clear signs of a recovery in France and, in all  probability, France will be one of the countries for which we  will be upwardly revising our predictions.    [Aubert] There is still a shadow cast over the generally  improving world picture, namely the problem of unemployment.  Your organization was charged with making an in-depth analysis  of the causes of unemployment and to come up with some possible  solutions. Can you give us some idea of the solutions the OECD  should be unveiling in a few days time?    [Paye] To get an idea of the solutions, you first need some  understanding of the problems.    Therefore we looked into all the possible causes as far as  we  could. We concluded that the fundamental cause of the situation  our countries are in is that they have insufficiently adapted to  the changes in the operation of the economy brought about by the  process of globalization, i.e. the interaction between  competition and technological progress. In today's global  economy, competition has become very fierce. As a result, all  countries, and ours in particular -- since we are the ones who  have been caught up -- have to try and improve their efficiency,  step up creativity, become more innovative, explore new avenues,  and remain at the leading edge of economic, scientific, and  technological development. If you look at what has happened in  the last 20 years, it is clear that the OECD countries' capacity  or will to adapt has not increased in proportion to what was  required by changes on the world stage. A gap quickly opened up  between what we should have done and what we have actually done  to prepare for the future.    [Aubert] What kind of proposals does this diagnosis give  rise  to?    [Paye] To date, our economies have been leading the race.  If they are to remain ahead of the field, they must increase  their innovative and creative capacities. This is a  precondition if we are to have a better standard of living and  if we are to take a full share in the markets that are being  created and are developing at high speed in the rest of the  world. For this, we have to be competitive. The policies we  should implement must strive to create the most favorable  conditions for company competitiveness.    This first means that the macroeconomic policies have to  remain stable in the medium term, reassuring economic operators  and, when necessary and possible, making full use of the room  for maneuver that may exist on the monetary or budgetary levels.  However, we should be under no illusions: Currently the OECD  countries have very little room for maneuver. Especially on the  budgetary level, you will not reassure economic operators by  widening the budget deficit or increasing the public debt.  Instead, it is necessary to continue getting public finances in  order and trying to stabilize and then reduce the burden of  debt, which has reached considerable proportions in some  countries.    Then, above all, you need rigorous structural policies that  help improve the economy's capacities for innovation and  creation. In particular, that means establishing the right  conditions for the creation of economic activity and the  creation of companies. Given the new methods for the production  of goods and services, the reduction in the size of companies,  the use of networks, and the growing share of services in  manufacturing, we are in a kind of economy where activity and  employment are increasingly being created by small work units.  How can we favor the creation of activities and companies?  There are many things we can do to contribute to this process,  and I will mention only a few: By reducing uncertainty and the  weight of administrative tasks, adapting our tax structures, and  adopting new standards for information that are similar and as  far-reaching as those that exist in the rest of the world, since  information has become the lifeblood of the globalized economy  and is the main product that companies now need.    Creating the right conditions for the creation of companies  is all very well, but this alone is not enough. We must also  make it easier to actually employ people, and in any event, we  must not discourage companies from taking on new employees. We  all know that certain aspects of labor legislation are sometimes  counterproductive in terms of employment. In France, for  example, the SMIC [minimum wage] as it currently stands, seems  to discourage the recruitment of unqualified and young workers.    In addition, we have to modernize our education and training  systems. This is now evident, at a time when economic growth is  increasingly based on knowledge, and knowledge that must evolve  quickly. We do have to teach people a trade, but we also have  to teach them how to change professions and learn new skills.  We need education and training systems that cover the whole of  active life.    Lastly, we should not forget that a competitive world also  requires flexibility and mobility, including a certain degree of  wage flexibility. This is a fact that is gradually dawning on  people. Even if no one says so publicly, this policy is  increasingly being practiced. In fact, all countries are  realizing that nothing is more dangerous in the medium to long  term than a section of the population being left out of the  labor market and feeling marginalized and abandoned. It is much  better to have people on albeit low wages than to have people  unemployed. However, this realization, which shocks many  people, will have essential consequences. Firstly, it must not  be possible for someone to be indefinitely locked into a poorly  remunerated job. If you start on a low salary when you are  young and unqualified, you must then have access to additional  education and training. Secondly, we need labor markets that  operate effectively and in which we can see the opportunities  that are being presented. Thirdly, geographic and professional  mobility must be favored by all possible means.    Lastly -- and this is part of the indispensable social  cohesion -- we must make up from other sources those salaries  for poorly qualified workers that are considered to be too low.  This poses redistribution problems that we cannot simply sweep  under the carpet.    [Aubert] In the debates on labor market flexibility, there  is a feeling that the Anglo-Saxon world often serves as the  reference. However, the American economy, seen from Europe,  does not look like a very good model where redistribution of  income is concerned....    [Paye] You will see when you read our report that it is much  more balanced than that. At the recent Detroit conference, the  U.S. ministers said that they were not wholly satisfied with  their system. It is very flexible, very adaptive, and very  individualistic, enabling many jobs to be created in times of  recovery. However, in the last 20 years, the lower half of the  wage scale has lost out in terms of purchasing power. Some 30  million Americans now live below the poverty line. In our  report, we say that in Europe, and in some ways in Japan too,  there is a rigidity in the structures that is born out of the  culture and social victories that have their worth as well as  their disadvantages. This rigidity prevents the European  economies from adapting to the challenges of the world today and  tomorrow. That does not mean that everything has to be  scrapped, though. We have to try and see how, by reducing the  counterproductive aspects that our production systems have, we  can concentrate their beneficial effects on those people who  most need help, those who have to adapt or those who are unable  to adapt but whom we cannot leave behind. This report in no way  recommends scrapping the fruit of a century of social progress  in Europe to adopt the American model in its current form.    [Aubert] Where funding the reduction in company labor costs  is concerned, is there a painless solution?    [Paye] The additional wage costs borne by companies often  discourage them from taking on new employees, especially less  qualified workers or less experienced workers, such as young  people. If we take the path of reducing these costs to encourage  recruitment, we must make up for this reduction since we cannot  arfford to further worsen social security and budget deficits.  This implies reexamining all these systems to see if it is  possible to make savings, in particular by reducing the extent  to which the system is abused. Moreover, this means that, as  far as is necessary, we have to find other fiscal resources.  This is a vast area.    [Aubert] The European Commission, for example, suggests  levying a tax on the amount of energy consumed....    [Paye] That is one of the many possibilities we could  envisage. We do not propose specifically doing one thing or  another, because that would require further specific and  in-depth studies. The measures that would compensate for the  reduction in additional labor costs are liable to reduce  consumption or investment. We would therefore have to evaluate  their net effect on employment.    We have drawn up a report and now the quite general  recommendations we make in it must be tailored to suit each  member state, taking into account all the differences in their  situation, legislation, customs, and culture. Moreover, the  OECD should be used in its capacity as a mutual monitoring body,  to actively encourage the application of the policy guidelines  that we have decided on. In many cases, the reforms that are  needed will be hard to implement. It is helpful if countries  are not alone in trying to buckle down to the task and in  proving that in such and such a country, such and such a reform  has been implemented and is yielding good results.    [Aubert] Let us now return to the macroeconomic level of the  employment crisis. In Europe, governments have reacted in  sometimes quite different ways. On the one hand there is the  British attitude which consisted of a surgical operation with  the devaluation of the pound and accelerated cuts in interest  rates with the subsequent positive results that that had, and on  the other hand there is France which has resolutely defended its  currency to the detriment of everything else. What is the  correct choice?    [Paye] If only there were a "correct choice!" It is very  difficult to answer this question. Anyway, it has lost much of  its relevance. You could understand this intellectual debate  three years ago, when we could see the extent of the crisis  German reunification was going to trigger. Now, however, with  quite similar short term interest rates and long rates that are  lower in Germany and France than in the United Kingdom or  Italy....    [Aubert] Except that the choice made by France was  accompanied by a worsening of the economic situation and rising  unemployment....    [Paye] Of course, the choice had its consequences. However,  I think it is rather late to be discussing the issue now that it  holds much less significance. Above all, we must understand how  the issue looked two or three years ago to the European  countries that were in the exchange rate system. Should they  run the risk of a late economic recovery, increased  unemployment, and thus possible social or even political tension  to steer a course toward a credibility that would maintain the  relatively low long-term interest rates, and continue with the  construction of European economic and monetary union? Those  European countries that ran this risk have long-term interest  rates that, until a few weeks ago, were the lowest on record.  These long-term interest rates are important for investment and  for the long term plans of individuals. As for this second aim,  it did not have immediate economic repercussions, but the fact  of safeguarding the perspective of the creation of an integrated  European monetary area gave companies and institutions renewed  confidence. It was therefore a choice between something easier  and more gratifying in the short term, and something that was  more difficult but which guaranteed the future. France and  Germany chose to take the rocky path. It is true that these  countries have high unemployment, but their credibility is  intact, long-term and even short-term interest rates are  relatively low, and companies are well on the way to adapting to  the new situation -- all things that bode well for future  growth, employment, and competitiveness.    [Aubert] The world has changed a lot in recent years. Does  the recent admission of Mexico mean, as one diplomat has  suggested, that the OECD is starting to change its spots?    [Paye] I do not think it is changing its spots. The OECD is  an organization that is completely unique. Its aim is to make  the world's leading economic countries reflect jointly to define  their policies together. The OECD countries today account for  75 percent of total world trade. There can be no doubt that the  OECD has always been and remains the group of the most advanced  countries from the point of view of social and economic  development.    [Aubert] To date, in any case, your organization has been  perceived rightly or wrongly as a kind of "club of rich  countries...."    There are many countries that are not in the OECD whose per  capita income level is higher than that of Portugal or Greece or  Turkey. It is just a journalistic simplification to call the  OECD the "club of rich countries." The OECD is an area for  working together, a workshop, and an intellectual laboratory for  the leaders of our countries. So that the OECD retains this  nature and this usefulness, it has to continue to unite the  countries that count in the world. The number of these  countries is growing. As a result, the OECD has to make  contacts and open up to a greater extent to bring in more and  more economies as members or observers or partners. To  dialogue, as we have been doing for five years with Korea,  Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand, and to  have brought Chile, Argentina and Brazil into this dialogue,  plus Mexico which joined our organization a few days ago, is a  way of recognizing that we must bring economies that are not  currently members of the OECD into the reflection process. Then  there are the countries of the former Soviet Bloc, with which we  have been cooperating since the start of the freeze in  relations, several of which have recently asked to join the  OECD; and other countries, such as China....    [Paye] You talked of the laboratory-style role of your  organization. It would appear that certain of your member  countries want the OECD to become something other than a  laboratory, for it to play a more visible role on the world  scene, which would therefore imply that this role is scarcely  compatible with you remaining at the head of the organization....    [Aubert] We should start by examining the function of our  organization. I have just described this to you: Ensuring that  the people who define and implement policies in our member  countries, i.e., senior civil servants and maybe ministers,  actually work together. The issue of visibility can be couched  in the following terms: At what time and on what subject should  we become "visible" to better serve the organization, i.e., to  increase its usefulness for the governments? In some cases, it  is good to be very visible, to help public opinion better  understand the problem and the solutions it requires. Where  unemployment is concerned, I think our organization is very  visible. However, the question is whether we should  systematically place everything the OECD discusses on the public  stage and run the risk in some cases of appearing to take sides,  thus making it harder to arrive at a consensus on the policies  to be implemented. With premature publicity you always run the  risk of hardening positions and making it more difficult to  bring people closer together. Thus, publicity and visibility  are important, but you have to be discerning. Having said that,  the member states might think differently from me and  differently from each other. To give the impression that the  OECD is invisible and would do better to permanently remain in  the public eye, is, I think, only creating a false problem.    [Paye] Is the replacement of the general secretary also a  false problem?    [Aubert] No, it is a real problem. I am pleased that there  are so many candidates for the post. That proves it is an  interesting job and that the organization has a future. It is  up to the member countries to choose the person they think is  the most capable of doing the job in the way they want it to be  done. If they believe it is better, out of principle, to have  someone with a political past, it is up to them to decide. For  my part, I do not think this is a necessary requirement for the  job. I think the qualifications needed are as follows: knowing  the issues the organization deals with; heeding the very diverse  nature of the member countries; and being capable of encouraging  a consensus, because the organization cannot work without one.  The only power it has is the power it acquires through the  quality, objectivity, and independence of its secretariat which  directly determines the intimacy and efficiency of the  cooperation between the member countries.</p>

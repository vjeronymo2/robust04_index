			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Mackay to press ahead with legal aid cut LORD MACKAY, the Lord Chancellor, confirmed last night that he is to press ahead 'as soon as possible' with proposals outlined in the Autumn Statement to cut legal aid eligibility. He told the Home Affairs Committee he had been prepared to consider alternative proposals to achieve the Pounds 43m saving needed in the Legal Aid Budget but that time had now run out. The Law Society and the Bar had put forward five proposals including a pay freeze for legal aid lawyers in 1993/94, which they claimed would save the Pounds 43m needed. But the Lord Chancellor said a more realistic assessment of the saving through the proposals was Pounds 8m. Legal aid expenditure is expected to reach Pounds 1.1bn this year. He rejected suggestions that a sharp drop in the number of criminal cases in which legal aid was granted in the last quarter of 1992 would provide almost all the savings. The Law Society told the MPs earlier in the day that the 13 per cent drop in legal aid certificates granted in criminal cases in the last quarter of 1992 would produce a saving of Pounds 37m if the trend continued over the whole year. But Lord Mackay said it was unsafe to plan on the assumption that such a trend would continue. It was notoriously difficult to predict the final outturn for legal aid expenditure even towards the end of a year. He also rejected as 'absurd' the Law Society's contention that 14m people would be affected by the eligibility cuts either because they would no longer qualify for free legal aid or because they could not afford to pay an increased contribution towards the cost of their case. This year just over 3m people would receive financial assistance from the legal aid scheme. Lord Mackay estimated that in practical terms 120,000 people a year would be affected by his proposals.</p>

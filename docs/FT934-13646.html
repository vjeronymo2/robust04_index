			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Belgian set to head European bank EUROPEAN Community leaders are likely to back Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy next week as a compromise candidate to head the European Monetary Institute, forerunner of a European central bank. Mr Lamfalussy was nominated for the post by EC central bank governors yesterday in a move which increases the likelihood of a deal at next week's Brussels summit on the sensitive question of where to site the European central bank. Frankfurt is the leading contender. But his selection, if confirmed, may disappoint enthusiasts for European monetary union who were looking for a political heavyweight to give added impetus to the process of economic and monetary integration. The EMI will prepare for full European economic and monetary union by 1999, strengthening the co-ordination of EC members' monetary policies and supervising all aspects of the development of a single currency. Mr Lamfalussy, a Belgian, is currently general manager of the Bank for International Settlements, which is owned by 33 central banks. He would hold the office of EMI president for three years initially, beginning on January 1, 1994, when the next stage of Emu is due to start. He would not necessarily become president of a European central bank. The governors' recommendation was announced in a letter from Mr Wim Duisenberg, head of the Dutch central bank and chairman of the EC central bank governors' committee, to Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister, who will chair next week's summit. EC leaders will consider the Lamfalussy nomination along with bids for the location of the EMI and the central bank, as well as lesser institutions. EC finance ministers and the European parliament will be consulted on the nomination before the summit, as required by the Maastricht treaty.</p>

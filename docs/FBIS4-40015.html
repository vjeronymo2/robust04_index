			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>   [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] June 11 TASS -- On the eve of  Russia's Independence Day Petr Luchinskiy, chairman of the  Moldovan parliament, gave an interview to TASS. He  congratulated Russian citizens on the occasion and said that  "Russia has been, is and will alway be a great power. It has an  enormous potential. It will overcome difficulties, and its  revival is sure to come." He pointed out further that the  Russian and Moldovan nations have a long record of friendship  and cooperation, and he is sure that those relations will be  continued. It is not accidental that the first legal act,  adopted by the Moldovan parliament after the proclamation of  independence, was the treaty on bilateral relations with Russia.    Speaking about the conflict in the Dniester region,  Luchinskiy said that the problem emerged, when the USSR was  still in existence. Russia and Moldova inherited it together  with a Russian army, deployed on the left bank of the Dniester  River. The political make-up is rather complicated in Russia  today. "We have mutual understanding with the Russian  leadership. However, there are political forces in Russia which  support separatism in Moldova," he said. The chairman of the  Moldovan parliament pointed out that people in the Dniester  region were tired of hostility. They do not want to be hostages  of adventurers. "The region has been turned of late into one of  the strongholds of international terrorism. By the way, I am  quoting the words of Russian General Aleksandr Lebed, the  commander of the army deployed there. He is urging the local  population not to trust the Tiraspol leadership, which is  steeped in stealing and corruption," Luchinskiy said. A  favourable moment has come for settling the problem of the  Dniester region. Tremendous changes took place in Moldova,  especially after the latest elections the the public opinion  poll. People no longer trust extremists.    In the opinion of Luchinskiy, nothing binds people better  that common interests and a common market. We should bring down  the politization of our relations, should give a chance to the  economic agreements, signed within the CIS framework, to start  working. We need a free movement of goods, capital and  workforce. Moldova is tied to the Russian market. We should  cooperate, if this is advantageous for both countries.</p>

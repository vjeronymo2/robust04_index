According to the military assistant, Department  of Defense, Captain Amadu Koromah, the first rebel attack was  launched on Mandoworo, northwest of Pendembu by some 200 rebels  who were repelled by government troops after a four and a half  hour battle. Initial reports put rebel losses at five dead but  the final figure will be higher as a mopping up operation is now  under way.    A combined force of National Patriotic Front of Liberia,  NPFL, and RUF [Revolutionary United Front] rebels also launched  a heavy attack on Jene, east of Pendembu. Reinforcements have  been sent to the area, SLENA [SIERRA LEONE NEWS AGENCY] reports.    In another related development, rebels again launched  another  fierce attack on Joru, 18 miles from Kenema, on Sunday [2  January]. Joru is the headquarter town Guala, Mende chiefdom.  According to government information services, the rebels  bypassed (Bari Serabu), 2 1/2 miles to Joru, following  government troops' defensive posture. Military sources say the  battle at Joru was the heaviest since the rebel incursion in  that area. The rebels were, however, repelled but passed  through Gboyama village where they are believed to have set fire  on several houses.</p>

			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> USDHS SWEEPS INTO PLAYOFFS' 2ND ROUND  </P> <P> After USDHS' three-game sweep of Taft in Tuesday's opening round of the  CIF/Reebok Girls' Southern California Championships it was easy to see why the  idea of forfeiting the match had crossed the mind of Taft Coach Bill Friend.  </P> <P> During the past week, this team from Central California traveled nearly 1,000  miles playing for the right to lose to the second-seeded Dons, 15-4, 15-7,  17-15.  </P> <P> For a while, it looked like the Wildcats (16-2) had recovered from their van  lag as they overcame an 11-4 deficit in the third game to lead, 15-14.  </P> <P> But Michelle Rico, USDHS' 5-foot-9 middle hitter, gave Taft an early dismissal  to get back on the road for the 250-mile drive home. Rico, a senior, had four  consecutive kills, three of which denied the Wildcats the game point and gave  the Dons a sideout. With her last kill, Rico stepped to the service line with  USDHS (22-2) trailing, 15-14, and delivered three aces.  </P> <P> "We were playing tired," Friend said. "You could see the potential in the third  game. But this trip was a killer."  </P> <P> USDHS looked flawless through most of the first two games, with junior Rose  Dowling getting off impressive cross-court sets to the likes of Rico, who had  10 of her kills in the third game, and 5-10 senior Christina Alvarado, who  finished with a match-high and season-high 23 kills. But Dons' coach Rob Gorney  chose to describe his team's effort as average. One reason: Dowling, Rico, and  another starter, Corinne Olvera, were playing with illnesses.  </P> <P> "We're a lot stronger than we showed tonight," said Gorney, whose team has won  18 matches in a row.  </P></p>

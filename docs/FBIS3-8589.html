"The discussion is clearly only being prolonged, and  deputies  are straying from the matter in hand," Ftacnik said, calling on  the premier to "pluck up courage" and make a speech. If he did  not, then it was "clearly time to end the debate."    Chairman of Parliament Ivan Gasparovic said in reaction to  this that the debate could be ended if deputies stopped asking  for permission to speak. Ftacnik's appeal was not passed as a  formal motion, and the debate continues with a speech by Culture  Minister Dusan Slobodnik on the theme of success in the  increasing of Slovakia's profile and the necessity of the  Bojnicky Altar being returned from the Czech Republic.    After Ftacnik's speech, Meciar went to sit next to Deputy  Chairman of Parliament and SDL chairman Peter Weiss and started  talking to him.</p>

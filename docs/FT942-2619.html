			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Labour urges tax pressure on dividends Mr Jim Cousins, a Labour trade and industry spokesman, suggested in the Commons yesterday that a Labour government should consider using the tax system to encourage companies to limit dividends and increase investment. While making clear that he was not advocating statutory control of dividends, he said the government should 'steer and guide' through the right kind of changes in existing financial arrangements. Mr Cousins is one of the few members of the Labour front bench to have nominated Mrs Margaret Beckett for the party leadership. He criticised institutional and other shareholders for failing to devote enough attention to the development prospects of the companies in which they invested. He complained that the banks had put more money into property development 'in five years of the 1980s' than they had put in to manufacturing industry in 15 years. Mr Cousins said this could not be corrected by legislation - but a different kind of relationship was needed between businesses enterprises, banks and institutional shareholders. Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, denied that the government was complacent about the need to encourage allocation of more resources to research and development.</p>

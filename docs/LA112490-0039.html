			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FALLOUT CONTINUES FROM ARIZONA VOTE  </P> <P> In response to your story on Sunday ("It's No Holiday for Arizona"):  </P> <P> Do you really think that forcing people to pay for a holiday would make people  honor Martin Luther King? Quite possibly all the boycotting may force Arizona  into another vote.  </P> <P> The holiday may be voted in. What then? Every year when the King holiday rolls  around, will people remember the great actions of the man as we do now without  a paid holiday, or would they be more likely to remember the way they were  manipulated and coerced into paying for another holiday?  </P> <P> JOHN D. GORDON, Bullhead City, Ariz.  </P></p>

			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Crime wave costs retailers Pounds 2.3bn Crime cost retailers Pounds 2.3bn in the year 1992-93, with about 30 per cent perpetrated by shop staff, a report published today by Nene College School of Business shows. The report, sponsored by Boots, Dixons, Tesco, Entertainment UK, Barclaycard and US security systems manufacturer Sensormatic, is based on reports provided by retailers responsible for almost a quarter of UK retail sales. It provides further evidence of the extent of retail crime, after a British Retail Consortium survey published in January estimated that it cost retailers Pounds 2bn in 1993. The report found that 'ordinary theft' by customers, staff and suppliers totalled Pounds 1,916m - more than the BRC's figure of about Pounds 1,400m - with other forms of robbery and crime accounting for Pounds 377m. Employee theft accounted for about Pounds 690m, or just over 30 per cent of losses, while customer theft totalled Pounds 1bn, or 43 per cent. Theft by suppliers accounted for just under 10 per cent, or Pounds 225m, and burglary for 7.7 per cent, or Pounds 177m. Credit and payment card fraud, ram raids, smash and grab raids, cash snatches, other forms of robbery, and criminal damage each accounted for less than 2 per cent of losses through crime. The report found the average level of theft was about 1.35 per cent of retail sales, with the highest rates found in pharmacies and toys, video and music stores, and the lowest in sports and footwear shops, and furniture and textiles stores. Grocery stores were responsible for nearly a quarter of all losses through theft, however, and department stores accounted for 19 per cent. Shrinkage, which includes theft and administrative error and wastage, equalled about 24 per cent of all retail profits. The report found that more than 80 per cent of UK retailers favoured civil recovery programmes, similar to those operating in the US, where recovery agencies are empowered to make shoplifters pay for thefts and levy exemplary fines, without recourse to legal authorities.

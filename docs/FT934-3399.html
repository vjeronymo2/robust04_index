			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / BR seeks private finance for electrification Network SouthEast is talking with regional electricity companies and National Grid over the provision of finance to electrify large parts of its track in advance of the privatisation of British Rail. The project is designed to open the network to private finance for the first time. It will be one of the first big tasks for Railtrack when it takes over the running of the rail infrastructure next April. Under the discussions taking place the regional electricity companies would pass on the costs of electrifying track to the operators of the trains, which could come in the form of higher electricity bills. Network SouthEast has also decided to put out to tender the design and building of new signalling in parts of Kent. The three companies interested in the contract are GEC Alsthom, the Anglo-French engineering group, ABB Transportation, formerly known as Brel, and Westinghouse Brake and Signal, part of BTR, the UK conglomerate. The company chosen to build the signalling may be offered long-term maintenance agreements. Mr John Nelson, Network SouthEast managing director, said he believed there was a 'window of opportunity' for the private sector in both electrification and the signalling of large parts of the BR network. Many Network SouthEast lines are not electrified - such as Oxted to Uckfield and Ashford to Hastings - while the system of electrification in many other parts of the network was installed more than 40 years ago. Mr Nelson said the need to involve the private sector was underlined by the fact that it would cost between Pounds 450m and Pounds 500m annually to replace parts of the infrastructure which need updating. Network SouthEast has already invited the regional electricity companies to tender for the contract to electrify different parts of the track. The company or consortia chosen would be expected to build the feeder stations, transformers and switchgear necessary to electrify lines. The Department of Transport and the Treasury are being kept informed of the talks. Network SouthEast recently won a year-long battle for new trains to be financed under an innovative Pounds 150m leasing deal. Under this the private sector - in this case ABB - is responsible for financing, building and maintaining the trains, and accepts the risks in the 'residual value' of the equipment after the lease ends.</p>

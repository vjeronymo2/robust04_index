Azerbaijan Prov., Feb. 1, IRNA--A  Turkish delegation on Monday [31 January] visited the victims of  the last Friday bombardment of two villages in Sardasht by the  Turkish jet fighters, hospitalized in this northwestern city.    The delegation headed by Turkey's Foreign Ministry director  general for political affairs, Ogur Dugan, arrived here Monday  to inspect the bombarded areas, visit the wounded and estimate  the damage caused on the villages.    Talking to the victims the Turkish envoy expressed his  government's deep regret over the incident.    Those injured, some in critical condition, gave a detailed  account of the sudden attack of the Turkish warplanes on  Qasemrash region of Sardasht, West Azerbaijan Province, and  called on Iranian Government to follow up the issue.    The delegation also met with Deputy Governor General of the  province Mohammad Ashtari.    Dugan described as irrational statement of the Turkish  officials that they had informed the Iranian Government of the  raid beforehand. He added that upon return he will make it  known that such claims were unfounded.    Ashtari strongly protested the statement of the Turkish  authorities and said in light of the formation of border  security commissions and frequent exchange of visits between the  two countries' officials in the past eighteen months, Tehran has  always introduced Ankara as a friendly neighbor and a brother.  However, he added, the attack raises serious questions in the  mind of the public.    The Turkish official expressed deep regret over the incident  and hoped that such incidents will be repeated in future.  [sentence as received]    The Turkish delegation is to leave for Sardasht later today.</p>

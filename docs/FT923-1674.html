			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Sea pollution treaty close after N-deal ATTEMPTS to salvage a new international treaty on sea pollution appeared close to success last night. Ministers from the 12 countries bordering the north-east Atlantic, were locked in talks until the early hours of this morning to try to find a solution in time for the scheduled signing of the new treaty at noon today. The talks made progress after those campaigning for a complete ban on the dumping of radioactive waste at sea gave way to calls instead for a moratorium on such dumping. Discussions were continuing to try to agree on the period of a moratorium. The treaty, which covers all dumping and discharges into the sea, has been dominated by the radioactivity issue. Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Spain have voiced the fiercest opposition to Britain's position, partly because waters near them were used for dumping low-level radioactive waste from the 1950s until the present moratorium began in 1982. Mr Klaus Topfer, the German environment minister, had said last weekend that Germany might accept a temporary ban, but that it would press for a longer ban than the 10 years that Britain is suggesting. Mrs Segolene Royal, the French environment minister who is chairing the conference, is also understood to favour an extension of the present moratorium. The UK Department of the Environment said last night: 'The UK very much wants to see the new convention signed. 'It has at present no intention of dumping any radioactive waste . . . . (but) at the moment it does not have a workable land-based alternative to sea-disposal.' The DoE added that its proposal covered only low- and medium-level radioactive waste and that before considering any dumping it would promise to consult other signatories to the treaty and the IAEA, the international nuclear watchdog. Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure groups, yesterday accused the conference and the British government of threatening to reduce the amount of publicly available data on pollution in the Atlantic.</p>

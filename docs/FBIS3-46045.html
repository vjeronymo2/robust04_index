By the end of World War II, the struggle of Asian  and African peoples for national independence was spreading like  a storm, and Britain was compelled to withdraw from its former  colonies. However, in the course of its withdrawal, Britain  took great care to use various inglorious means and tricks; it  sowed discord between different races, religious sects, tribes,  and other political forces to spark contradictions and  conflicts, thus implementing "divide and rule"; or forced the  implementation of mergers in the form of a "federal state,"  namely, "merge and rule"; or went all out to prop up a  pro-British government. In a nutshell, it attempted to continue  to maintain British vested interests and maximise political  influence.    "Divide and rule" was one of Britain's usual notorious  methods, and India served as the most typical example. In 1943,  Britain set forth a policy of "divide and rule," and advocated  the division of India into three governing regions, namely,  separating India into a Hindu region, a Muslim region, and a  region of various princely states and feudatories. Lord Louis  Mountbatten, the last British viceroy of India, dished up his  "divide and rule" plan in June 1946, which partitioned India  into three--two dominions, India and Pakistan, and various  princely states and feudatories. At the same time, it was  stipulated that the princely states and feudatories had the  right to decide on their own to join any of the two dominions,  with the aim of using the princes of the Indian princely states  and feudatories as a force to counter the Indian nationalist  movement; and second, it sowed discord in relations between  Muslims and the Hindus, and this eventually led to the partition  of India and Pakistan. Indian and Pakistani historians  indicated this by hitting the nail on the head, saying that the  aim of the partition of India and Pakistan plotted meticulously  by Britain was to make these two countries weak and make things  difficult for them to stand on their own feet. Of course,  history did not develop in the way the British colonialists  hoped for. On the Palestine issue, Britain first encouraged the  Arabs of the Ottoman Empire to resist Turkish rule; later, they  hoisted the banner of supporting the Zionist movement, roping in  the Jews to elbow out the Arabs at one point, then taking  advantage of the Arabs to oppose the Jews at another. In  Cyprus, to split the anti-British struggle of the local people,  Britain encouraged Turkish Cypriots to confront the EOKA, the  anti-British Greek Cypriot organization. Later, Britain led  Greece and Turkey into Cyprus' internal conflict; consequently,  the sovereignty of this island state fell apart. Furthermore,  this resulted in complicated contradictions and conflicts  between Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus, and between Turkish Cypriots  and Greek Cypriots, while turning the Cyprus issue into an  international hot spot.    Sometimes, Britain pushed the strategy of "merge and rule"  in  some regions through forcing together "federations" by force. A  typical example was the "Central African Federation," which  Britain patched up. In 1953, the British Government merged  British Southern and Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland and formed  a so-called "Federation of Central Africa." This was out of  British political and economic considerations. Economically,  Northern Rhodesia abounded in copper, Southern Rhodesia had  skilled Caucasian technicians, and Nyasaland possessed a huge  cheap labor force. Welding those three factors into an economic  federation was conducive to Britain's maintenance of its  economic interests in this region. Politically, the Caucasian  immigrants in Southern Rhodesia were powerful and controlled the  local government; with the organization of the "federation," the  influence of the Caucasians of Southern Rhodesia would extend to  all of British Central Africa, thus suppressing newly rising  black nationalism in Africa. Nevertheless, the "Central African  Federation" went bankrupt in 1963 because of the strong  opposition of its black African inhabitants.    In addition, another important policy target of Britain in  the course of its withdrawal from its colonies was to prop up  pro-British forces, and it transferred power to pro-British  governments. National independence and liberation movements with  a strong momentum broke out in British colonies in south, and  Southeast Asia in the early post-war years. India at that time  was like "a loaded ship on fire in the ocean." Britain was  compelled to make the decision to withdraw quickly from India,  while transferring political power into the so-called "hands of  Indian who have a sense of responsibility" to prevent  catastrophe for Britain. It was precisely in this way that  Britain realized a "peaceful transfer of political power" in  India, while a whole range of organizations of old colonial rule  were retained, while India and Pakistan remained members of the  British Commonwealth of Nations, and British private capital in  India was left intact. In the early post-war years, the Burmese  People's Movement vigorously developed. To avoid being  thoroughly driven out from Burma, Britain rapidly transferred  political power to "moderates," who were acceptable to Britain.  British economic interests and military bases in Burma basically  remained intact. Britain's method in Malaysia was almost  undisguised. The Malaysian people had already emancipated the  country during the war of resistance against Japan. When the  British Army returned to Malaysia, it started to restore the  colonial order in Malaysia. Later, Britain announced a state of  emergency in Malaysia, and Britain eventually transferred  political power in the mid-1950's, when the situation had  basically stabilized.    The various tricks Britain resorted to in the course of its  withdrawal from its colonies left the former colonial countries  endless hidden dangers after independence. This found  conspicuous expression in long-term turbulence in the political  situations of these countries in the wake of their independence,  and endless conflicts between neighboring countries or within  countries, whereas socioeconomic development was impeded and  restricted. In "divide and rule," Britain implemented  artificial partitions or mergers of territory in former  colonies, thus creating numerous complicated nationality and  border issues for the independent countries later on. In August  1947, Britain hastily withdrew from India two months after the  Mountbatten plan was presented, which resulted in slaughter  between the religious sects and an escalation of turmoil.  Statistics show that 500,000 people died directly or indirectly  in the turmoil, and 5 million people fled from their homes.  Based on the Mountbatten plan, Pakistan was founded in two  separate areas in the east and the west, some 1,600 km away from  each other; the inconvenience in transportation resulted in  extremely great difficulties in economic development. The  rivalry between India and Pakistan over Kashmir resulted in  several armed conflicts, and the issue remains unresolved as of  today. Britain's implementation of "divide and rule" in  Palestine left a large number of Palestinian refugees homeless.  The long-running confrontation between the Arabs and Israel and  the four Middle East wars that broke out one after the other all  find their roots in British "divide and rule." Likewise, the  civil war and divisions between the Turkish Cypriots and Greek  Cypriots after Cyprus' independence, and the conflict between  Greece and Turkey are all inseparable from the evil consequences  of what Britain did during its rule in Cyprus.    The British colonialists created divisions in Nigeria by  utilizing contradictions between various tribes to instigate  regional separatism and jeopardize Nigeria's national solidarity  and unification, while sowing the seeds for long-term internal  disturbances after Nigeria's independence. In the late 1960's,  the Nigerian Civil War that centered around the independence of  Biafra cost 1 million lives, and economic and social development  was seriously damaged. Britain bears unshirkable responsibility  for all of this.</p>

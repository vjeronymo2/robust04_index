			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / UK Company News: JIB at Pounds 11m for first half Profits of JIB Group, the international insurance broker ultimately owned by Jardine Matheson Holdings, totalled Pounds 10.7m pre-tax for the first six months of 1992. For the same period last year taxable profits amounted to Pounds 11.1m. However, the results for the two periods are not comparable because of the group's restructuring in June 1991 preparatory to flotation. First half operating revenue came to Pounds 94.4m (Pounds 92.5m) and earnings per share to 5.8p (9.4p). The group is paying a 2.5p interim and forecasts a same-again 5p final.</p>

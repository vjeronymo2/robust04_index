			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: ERM in the balance EUROPEAN markets will be preoccupied this week by whether the Bundesbank will reduce official German interest rates at Thursday's council meeting, writes Stephanie Flanders. As far as many observers are concerned, the French franc cannot maintain its current position in the European exchange rate mechanism without lower real interest rates, and the mechanism itself cannot survive without the French. Last week's renewed speculative pressure was driven by disappointing German monetary figures, which seemed to lower the chances of a cut in German interest rates on Thursday. The latest German cost of living figures, due out this week, are unlikely to paint a more optimistic picture for a Bundesbank monetary loosening. But if ERM central banks cannot restrain further speculation in the run-up to the Bundesbank meeting, many argue that the usual rules for predicting German monetary policy may not apply. Even if German interest rates are lowered slightly on Thursday, some doubt whether this will be enough for a number of beleaguered member countries. French unemployment figures for June, released on Friday, will be an early focus of attention for dogged anti-franc speculators. Similarly, Spanish quarterly jobless data, due out during the week, is likely to intensify recent attacks on the peseta, with or without a German interest rate cut. Once again, events outside the ERM will probably receive less than the usual market attention this week. But it will be hard to ignore some important economic figures coming out of the US. In particular, tomorrow's consumer confidence index for July and Thursday's advance estimate for second quarter real GDP will test the chairman of the Federal Reserve's optimistic prognosis on the state of the American recovery in his testimony before Congress last week.</p>

The arms that were gathered once in the name of the Afghan  jehad by its forces, plus the arsenals that were inherited from  the Kabul regime, are now being used for an extensive massacre  of rival jehadi groups. Those groups that were not so insistent  on wasting their arms so inconsiderately during the 14 years of  jehad as they are now are showing surprising generosity and are  resorting to missile, artillery, and other deadly attacks  against each other.    Actually, the canons, mortar, and missiles that they did not  use during the 14 years of jehad are now being used without any  limit to force the other jehadi forces to kneel. Under such  conditions, it is the people in Kabul and in all of Afghanistan  who are the main losers in the inauspicious war and in the  regrettable confrontation. [passage omitted]    The Islamic Republic of Iran has expressed its regrets over  the renewed fighting in Kabul and has called on the belligerent  sides to end their clashes and to seek peaceful means to solve  their problems.    The truth is that the jehadi forces have never been able to  correctly understand the oppressed Afghan people's wish to begin  the era of reconstruction under the banner of Islam and they  have never acted appropriately on the heavy responsibility that  they shoulder. All this has led to the Afghan people's  disillusionment since none of the jehadi forces has been able to  fulfill their pure wishes.    It was not, and is not, logical for the fruits of 14 years  of  the Afghan nation's struggles to be considered as "war booty"  and for each group to want to gain as much of this booty as  possible and to trample on the blood that was shed by 1.5  million martyrs during these struggles.    It is bitter but true that some jehadi groups are showing  the  kind of determination to annihilate their rivals that they did  not show during the jehad and are more hasty in taking revenge  on their jehadi rivals than they were even at the climax of the  jehad. The role played by the time-serving forces and those  groups who shift their support to one group or another as  conditions call for is perceptible today more than ever before.  But the question is: When will Afghanistan be freed from such  regrettable clashes?    There may not be a clear answer to this question. But  everyone knows that the jehadi forces are willing to pay any  price to annihilate or to defeat each other. Even if this war  of attrition is temporarily stopped, it will still be like ember  under ashes for a long time to come, and it is precisely because  of this that it is in the interest of Afghanistan and of the  oppressed Afghan people that the wise begin to act to bring the  views of the jehadi forces closer and not to waste more time in  extinguishing a flame that is destroying the entire Afghan  nation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] It was learned on 24 May that the Science and  Technology and the Foreign Ministry held a briefing for foreign  embassies on the outline revision of the nation's long-term plan  for atomic energy development. The briefing was held following  requests from several countries, and it was first time the  government has attempted to explain a policy review before  formal approval.    The responses of the foreign officials indicated their deep  interest in Japan's plutonium policy, particularly the light of  the controversy surrounding the DPRK's (North Korea's) nuclear  policy.    The 20 May briefing was intended for science and technology  specialists at foreign embassies. Officials were sent from the  embassies of 11 countries, including energy-advanced nations  such as the United States, the UK, France, and Germany, as well  as Pacific nations such as Thailand, Indonesia, and Australia.    Officials of the Science and Technology Agency and the  Foreign Ministry received those foreign officials, and explained  the future direction of Japan's plutonium policy. During the  90-minute briefing, Japanese officials passed out booklets of  the draft plan written both in Japanese and English, and  received questions from foreign officials after a lecture.    One of the attendants said they severely questioned Japanese  officials "why Japan is so eager about development of fast  breeder reactors," and "if construction of No.2 plutonium  processing plant was postponed in view of the demand-supply  balance of plutonium." Some of them reportedly requested Japan  to explain its plutonium policy in their homelands since "our  homeland is keenly interested in the issue."    The long-term plan on atomic energy development has never  made public before formal approval by the government. However,  the Atomic Energy Commission, the composer of the long-term  plan, disclosed a draft plan on 18 May to secure the openness of  Japan's energy policies in view of domestic and international  criticism of Japan's policy on plutonium use. In response, the  Science and Technology Agency and the Foreign Ministry received  more than a dozen inquiries from foreign embassies in Tokyo.    The Science and Technology Agency said: "We decided to hold  the briefing to help them understand the Japanese Government's  policy to make clear its plutonium policy."    Commenting on this, the Foreign Ministry said: "More than 50  countries expressed their strong interest in the shipment of  plutonium to Japan last year. Japan cannot promote the use of  plutonium without the understanding of the international  community."</p>

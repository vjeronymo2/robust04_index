			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / IMF/World Bank in Madrid: Surprise Russian move on debts - Madrid Conferences Digest Russia surprised and shocked the G7 countries at the weekend by appearing to demand sweeping readjustment of its foreign debt position. Officials said Mr Alexander Shokhin, Russian deputy prime minister, asked for treatment of Russia's debt that would be equivalent to the 1950s London agreement settling Germany's debt burdens after the second world war. Although details were not clear, Mr Shokhin reportedly sought an answer within seven days. Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor, said afterwards the G7 had not been able to make a considered response to the Russian demands. Instead, G7 finance ministers had asked Mr Shokhin to put his proposals on paper. Resolving Russia's debt problems would need much more detailed work by the Paris Club of western creditor nations, he said.</p>

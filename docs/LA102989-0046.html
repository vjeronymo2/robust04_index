			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REMODELING: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> MANTEL AS CENTERPIECE  </P> <P> A FIREPLACE, ONCE the home's primary source of heat, is used today mostly for  decorative purposes. Sometimes it is grand enough to be the centerpiece of a  room; sometimes it's just a subtle accent to a well-thought-out design.  </P> <P> To fit a new design scheme, an old fireplace may need to be altered -- a task  that is not as difficult as it may seem. According to Anthony Zografides, owner  of Newport Mantel &amp; Panel Co. in Newport Beach, a custom-made wooden mantel  can be "designed to fit the ambience of a house and built to order. We pick up  where the contractors leave off, and do the finishing touches."  </P> <P> When considering a new mantel, the first things you need to decide are exactly  how much you want to replace and how much you want to spend. A relatively plain  5-foot mantel shelf costs from $150 to $300; a full surround (shelf, skirt and  legs) from $400 to $650. A hand-carved version can go for as much as $3,000.  Most mantels are made from oak, alder or birch.  </P> <P> Installing a wood mantelpiece is actually not as intimidating as it seems.  Still, most homeowners opt for installation by a professional, usually adding  $150 to $200 to the tab. Removing old mantels is a relatively simple job; they  are attached by screws or nails. The new mantel attaches to a support board  mounted on the wall studs or brick backing.  </P> <P> Style is the next choice. "Today, people want plain mantels; 20 years ago they  wanted extensive routing and detailing," says Don Goodenough of Long Beach.  Zografides, as do most mantel retailers, agrees: "Most want pretty simple lines  -- not Gothic, not heavy-traditional like back East, but more contemporary."  And simple lines get simple treatment: Most contemporary mantels get either a  light stain or a coat of paint.  </P> <P> A caveat: One man's "custom-made" is another man's "factory prebuilt." In many  shops, the customer chooses from a catalogue of models and styles that can be  ordered from the manufacturer. The mantels are assembled from solid moldings;  sometimes carvings are attached to the front of the mantel. Although they are  built to order, they are not exactly one-of-a-kind models.  </P> <P>  Mantels can be found at Newport Mantel &amp; Panel Co. in Newport Beach (mail  order); Don Goodenough Custom Wood Mantels in Long Beach; Korth's Patio &amp;  Fireside in Granada Hills; Mantel Magic in Carlsbad; The Fireplace Shop in  Glendale; Arroyo Hardwoods in Pasadena; Mission Moulding in San Diego.  </P> <P> </P></p>

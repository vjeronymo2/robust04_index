			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Europe's uncommon markets - Motoko Rich on the diversity of consumption among individual countries Marketing executives aiming their products at the European consumer should consider their prime audience as single 30-something homeowners who are health-conscious, employed in the community, social or personal services sector, and own at least one television. That appears the conclusion to draw from the latest survey* of European consumer lifestyles by Euromonitor, the London-based market analyst. In its survey of 23 countries on a range of factors from employment patterns to birth rates since its last poll in 1989, Euromonitor reported increasing homeownership - now accounting for 55 per cent of households in Europe - and particularly strong growth in single-person households. In western Germany and Scandinavia, for example, single people occupy a third of all homes. Birth rate trends mean the youth market in western Europe will fade during the 1990s and the early years of the next century, while the population aged between 30 and 45 will represent the largest sector of consumers. An increasingly health-conscious population, says the report, has resulted in an overall rise of two years in European life expectancy since the mid-1980s, and of 10 years since 1970. The community, social and personal services sector represents by far the largest employment of Europe's citizens. On average, 26 per cent of the workforce in western Europe is employed in social and personal services. This figure represents a move from the traditional large employers in the manufacturing sector, which now employs about 21 per cent of the workforce. However, 23.5 per cent of employees in Greece still work in agriculture, while in the UK 57.5 per cent are employed by wholesalers, retailers, restaurants or hotels. While European unemployment rates have been rising by a rate of at least 2 to 3 per cent since 1988, jobless levels have been rising at much higher rates in some countries. In Sweden, unemployment rose from 1.4 per cent to 5.3 per cent between 1989 and 1992, and jumped in Switzerland from 0.6 per cent in 1990 to 3 per cent in 1992. In Finland, joblessness rose from 3.5 per cent to 13.1 per cent from 1988 to 1992. However, some consumer goods appear to be essential, job or no job. In every country surveyed, televisions are owned by 95 per cent of households. Consumption trends have been affected by stagnancy in west European spending power, while levels in eastern Europe have plummeted as state subsidies have been withdrawn. Although real incomes are beginning to rise, the survey gave a 'poor prognosis' for large spending on consumer items. The survey noted, however, that general wealth was increasing in western Europe, where average per capita production in 1992 was Dollars 21,000, (Pounds 13,550) with two-thirds of that figure devoted to personal disposable income. In southern Europe, per capita gross domestic product ranges from Dollars 7,800 in Greece to Dollars 21,500 in Italy. In eastern Europe it dropped as low as Dollars 600 in Russia and Dollars 3,400 in Hungary, the highest in the region. Spending habits in certain sectors varied widely between markets. Food, for example, accounts for twice as much of the household budget in Greece or Portugal - 27 to 32 per cent - as in Germany or the UK. In eastern Europe, consumers spend 30 to 40 per cent of their budgets on food, although in Hungary the proportion is 17 per cent. As a proportion of total consumption, spending on housing is rising - at the time of the previous survey the rate was falling. The report warns that the current mood in Europe is towards national perspectives in consumption as much as anything else. *European Consumer Lifestyles, available from Euromonitor, 87-88 Turnmill Street, London EC1M 5QU, 071 251 8024.

			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Labour urged to review benefits LABOUR SHOULD consider using the tax system to claw back universal benefits, such as child benefit, from the better-off, the party's largest internal pressure group says today. In a wide-ranging 'manifesto', the soft-left Labour Co-ordinating Committee urges a review of aspects of the party's commitment to the welfare state. Arguing that Labour can never 'overcome the political problems of our commitment to welfare by implying that we can reduce its cost to the point of invisibility', the group nevertheless contends: 'We may have to stop doing certain things so that others can be done better.' 'A modern welfare state recognises that cash benefits are not the only way to assist those in need,' it says. The manifesto, scheduled for formal launch at a joint LCC/Tribune conference in Sheffield on Saturday, identifies four areas that Labour must 'get right' if it is to win the next general election. It welcomes the party's return to a commitment to full employment but says this must take into account up-to-date concepts such as flexibility of working hours and childcare policy. The committee reiterated its commitment to electoral reform, urging a move towards 'collaborative government'.</p>

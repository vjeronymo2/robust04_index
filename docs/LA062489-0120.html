			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 2 SUSPECTS CAUGHT AFTER CHASE IN, OUT OF COUNTY  </P> <P> Two escaped convicts from Michigan led law enforcement officers on a 220-mile  chase from Bakersfield through Orange County to San Pedro before their car,  reportedly stolen, ran out of gas Friday.  </P> <P> Christopher Kaser, 22, of Michigan and Kevin Killingsworth, 29, of Virginia  were captured after the 3-hour chase ended about 3 a.m., said Rick Odom, a CHP  spokesman in Bakersfield.  </P> <P> It all began just before midnight when authorities received a call that a black  Cadillac had been stolen from a man as he was filling his tank at a service  station on Interstate 5, about 20 miles from Bakersfield.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Threw Debris at Officers  </P> <P> CHP officers spotted the Cadillac about 12:10 a.m. and tried to pull it over,  but after the patrol car slowed down to 15 m.p.h., "the (suspects') vehicle  accelerated away and the passenger stood up through the sun roof and began to  throw bottles and debris at the officers," Odom said.  </P> <P> The suspects then drove south on Interstate 5 at speeds of up to 120 m.p.h.,  with three CHP cars and a Kern County Sheriff's Department helicopter in  pursuit.  </P> <P> At the Grapevine area of Interstate 5, the Ft. Tejon office of the CHP took up  the chase, which continued into Los Angeles and Orange counties. CHP officers  joined the pursuit at various points.  </P> <P> "The officers that work each area are more familiar with those freeways,  on-ramps and surface streets, and can handle a high-speed chase with more  safety," Odom explained.  </P> <P> Jurisdictions that assisted were Newhall, West Valley, Verdugo Hills, Central  and East Los Angeles, Santa Fe Springs, Santa Ana and San Juan Capistrano.  </P> <P> As the pursuit turned north from Interstate 5 onto Coast Highway, police  departments in Laguna Beach, Newport Beach, Huntington Beach, Signal Hill, Long  Beach and Los Angeles took turns pursuing the two suspects, Odom said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not a Movie Chase  </P> <P> "This isn't a Hollywood movie where you can catch up to the vehicle, tap the  bumper and have the suspects pull over safely," Los Angeles Police Lt. Richard  Gonzales said. Trying to force the suspects to pull over could "endanger not  only the suspects and officers, but innocent citizens and pedestrians,"  Gonzales said.  </P> <P> The suspects finally stopped at Grand Avenue and 14th Street in San Pedro. They  were taken back to Bakersfield where they were booked for vehicle theft,  possession of stolen property, assault with a deadly weapon (throwing the  bottles) and evading arrest.  </P> <P> Kaser and Killingsworth were being held in the Kern County Jail.  </P></p>

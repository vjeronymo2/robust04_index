			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By BUSINESS-TASS] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 25 TASS -- The Maritime Administration  has put into question a possibility to implement the Russian  summit statements on termination of liquid low-radioactive waste  dumping in the Pacific Ocean, sources at the Department of  Information and Public Relations of the Russian Ministry of  Nuclear Power engineering told BUSINESS-TASS today.    Money for the maritime processing of this waste and  utilization has not been allocated. Russia has a shortage of  money and some projects, including ecological, are scarcely not  financed. In early March an official representative of the  Finance Ministry said the problem will be solved in the near  future, but there have been no results.    The problem of utilization of water from Russian subs'  nuclear reactors aggravated in mid-October. Some 900 cubic  meters of liquid waste was dumped and some 700 cubic meters more  were waiting for their turn. All this provoked a negative  reaction of the international public, meanwhile the dumping was  coordinated with the International Atomic Energy Agency and the  competent Russian ministries.    Great Britain and France have the right to similar dumping  till 2018, and Japan is also dumping its radioactive waste in  the sea.    The problem of Russian radioactive waste utilization can be  solved only by the construction of special decontaminating  installations. Russia has not received the promised Western  assistance, and a special tanker for waste storage offered by  Japan appeared to be useless.</p>

ITAR-TASS learnt  at the press centre of the space military forces that the  launching was successful.    The satellite was developed by the applied mechanics  scientific and production amalgamation (Krasnoyarsk-26) under  the guidance of chief designer and general manager Mikhail  Reshetnev.    The launching pioneers a system of direct space TV  broadcasting, which will consist of five "Gals" satellites, for  all information space of the Commonwealth of Independent States.    The satellite is equipped with a three-segment onboard relay  which will ensure for the first time the reception of regional  TV broadcasting with small-size individual antennae with a  diameter 0.6-0.9 meters over individual Russian regions. The  satellite weighs 2.5 tonnes and will operate for five or seven  years in orbit.    The satellite will be put into orbit close to geostationary  at a point 90 degrees of eastern longitude some seven hours  after the launching. Following this, it will be brought to the  point of "stationing" 44 degrees eastern longitude where it will  be used for the assigned mission.    The "Gals" satellite is the first unmanned spacecraft  blasted  off by Russia this year.</p>

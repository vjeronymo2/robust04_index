			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Construction industry warns of further job losses A FURTHER 50,000 jobs are likely to be lost this year in the construction industry, executives warned yesterday. The construction industry expects its annual output to fall to its lowest level for six years. Mr John Smith, chairman of the Building Employers Confederation, said that at least half of all cons-truction contracts won recently by companies were either loss-making or had been achieved at zero mar-gin. The confederation, which has more than 9,000 members, yesterday published its latest workload survey, showing that more than two thirds of builders expect output to fall during the next 12 months. More than 75 per cent of the 600 companies questioned at the beginning of this year said they were working at between two thirds and three quarters of normal capacity. A fifth of companies said they were working at less than half capacity. Mr Smith said the only chink of light in the survey was that slightly fewer companies were reporting a decline in inquiries for work. There was also evidence that more companies were undertaking repair and maintenance work. The situation facing the industry, however, remained 'terribly serious', he said. The survey will make gloomy reading for ministers who may be hoping that an upturn in the housing market will stimulate greater confidence in the economy as a whole. Mr Smith said that since the start of the year there had been a sharp increase in interest from would-be house purchasers, but that had still to be turned into firm sales. Even if the upturn were sustained, it would be unlikely to benefit house builders until the end of the year - such was the large number of unsold properties still on the market. Mr Smith, chairman and managing director of KL &amp; NR Smith, a family-owned builder in Southampton, said that the number of jobs lost in the construction industry since July 1989 was forecast to rise from 200,000 to 250,000 by the end of this year. Those worst affected by the fall in orders were national contractors who tend to work on larger contracts, he said. Some of those were trading down to smaller jobs, adding to competitive pressures in the rest of the industry. The number of construction company liquidations, which last year rose from 5,000 to 7,000, was likely to remain high. The decline in construction output in 1990-92 was expected to be similar to that which occurred in 1979-81. The decline in company profitability, however, has been much greater during the present recession, said Mr Smith. The collapse in residential and commercial property sales and values has handicapped many construction companies that had moved into speculative development during the 1980s. They are now likely to be hurt further by sharp falls in contracting profits as contracts won at lower margins approach completion.</p>

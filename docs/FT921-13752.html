			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Letter: Senior executives claimed to have no misgivings when headhunting meets psychological testing in the cause of finding the right candidate (2) Sir, I was delighted to read the valid observation by William Gill (Letters, January 11) that there is no conflict between the work of reputable executive search consultancies and corporate psychologists. He asserts, however, that very senior top managers would resent an occupational psychological test. Our experience is totally to the contrary. Most senior executives who have actually participated in psychological assessment, particularly when changing their employer, recognise that it is to their own advantage in reducing the inherent risks to their own career as well as providing an opportunity to learn more about themselves. The appointments section of your very same edition announced elections to the board of two major plcs of externally recruited directors, for both of whom psychological assessment was an integral part of the selection process. There are two underlying reasons for Mr Gill's misconceptions. First, he makes the assumption that psychological testing is synonymous with psychological assessment. It isn't. The test component is, when used correctly, only a part of the complete assessment process. The second more fundamental error is his assertion that candidates are 'head-hunted on the basis of their reputations and their indisputable records'. What such emphasis on track record fails to recognise, however, is that simple extrapolation from success in one organisation to another is fraught with risk. I recall a line from Dryden: 'They rise, they shine, evaporate and fall.' Experience suggests that client satisfaction is greater where the search consultant concentrates on finding candidates who are rising and shining, with the complementary guidance of the independent psychologist on underlying capabilities, potential and capacity for company transfer. The dual input thereby minimises the risks of evaporation and fall, both for the candidate's career - and the client's bottom line.

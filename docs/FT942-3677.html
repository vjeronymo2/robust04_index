			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: Unconvincing win frustrates Socialist hopes - Portugal Portugal's opposition Socialist party (PS) narrowly defeated the Social Democratic party (PSD) of prime minister Anibal Cavaco Silva but failed to mobilise a significant protest vote against a government beset by recession. The margin, of less than half a percentage point, has frustrated the hopes of Mr Antonio Guterres, the PS leader, of using the Europe elections as a springboard for victory in a general election scheduled for October 1995. The centre-left PS increased its share of the vote from 28.5 per cent in the previous European elections to 34.8 per cent, electing 10 deputies to the European parliament, compared with eight in 1989. But the centre-right PSD also achieved a gain of 1.7 percentage points to 34.4 per cent and maintained nine MEPs. The PS's gains were largely at the expense of the communist CDU coalition, which lost one of its four seats. The PS also won the extra seat allotted to Portugal, whose number of MEPs has risen from 24 to 25. After nine years of PSD rule and almost two years of recession, the PS was banking on a more convincing victory to gain credibility as an alternative government party. The margin of less than 13,000 votes may be insufficient to fend off challenges to Mr Guterres's leadership. Figures published before the election indicate the recession has not yet bottomed out as the government had forecast. Real wages have fallen sharply and unemployment is steadily rising. Farmers have seen cuts in production and earnings during the past three years. Industry struggles to compete within the single market. Turnout fell to 35.7 per cent, compared with 51.3 per cent in 1989, the lowest for any election in Portugal since democracy was restored in 1975. Abstention was aggravated by the allure of sunny beaches during a bank holiday weekend. But it also reflected both the failure of the main parties to inspire widespread support and the European Parliament's lack of significance to Portuguese voters.  ------------------------------------------- Population: 9.9m Seats: 25  ------------------------------------------- Results (Turnout 35.7%; 1989, 51.2%)  ------------------------------------------- Party*    Parliament   % vote      Seats             group     '94   '89  '94   '89  ------------------------------------------- PS           PES     34.7  28.5   10     8 PSD      LDR/EPP     34.3  32.7    9     9 CDS          EDA     12.4  14.1    3     3 CDU           LU     11.2  14.4    3     4  ------------------------------------------- Source: Ministry of Interior estimates  ------------------------------------------- *Abbreviations: CDS = Social Democratic Centre; CDU = United Democratic Alliance; PS = Socialist party; PSD = Social Democratic party  ------------------------------------------- Parliamentary group abbreviations: see bottom front page this section  ------------------------------------------- Electoral system:  ------------------------------------------- Proportional from national lists Compulsory voting: No  ------------------------------------------- MEPs  -------------------------------------------- Socialist party Antonio Vitorino, Joao Soares, Luis Marinho, Jose Manuel Torres Couto, Jose Barros Moura, Carlos Lage, Antonio Canpos, Helena Torres Marques, Jose Apolinario  -------------------------------------------- Social Democratic Party Eurico de Melo, Antonio Capucho, Arlindo Cunha, Francisco Lucas Pires, Carlos Pimenta, Manuel Porto, Helena Vaz da Silva, Carlos da Costa Neves, Jorge Ferraz de Mendonca  -------------------------------------------- Centre Social Democrat-Popular Party Manuel Monteiro, Raul Rosado Fernandes, Jose Girao Pereira Unitary Democratic Coalition Luis Sa, Joaquim Miranda, Sergio Ribeiro  --------------------------------------------</p>

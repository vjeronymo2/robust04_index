			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LONGER BAN ON AMMUNITION SALES PROPOSED  </P> <P> Three Los Angeles City Council members suggested Tuesday that a proposed ban on  the sale of ammunition for one week prior to New Year's Eve and the Fourth of  July be expanded to as long as one month.  </P> <P> The one-week ban, proposed last week by Mayor Tom Bradley and two council  members, failed to win enough votes Tuesday for emergency passage and as a  result was sent to a committee for consideration.  </P> <P> The measure is an attempt to cut down on the deliberate firing of guns into the  air that has become a holiday tradition in Los Angeles. Despite the proposal's  failure Tuesday, council members predicted that it will pass in some form and  be in effect by the Fourth of July.  </P> <P> "A week doesn't seem like long enough," said City Council President John  Ferraro, who voted against the proposal. Ferraro said he may support a ban of  as long as a month, but first wants the proposal to be discussed in a committee  hearing.  </P> <P> The proposal was defeated by an 8-3 vote. Ten votes were necessary for passage.  Councilmen Nate Holden and Hal Bernson also voted against the ban, suggesting  later to reporters that a ban of several weeks or a month may be more  effective.  </P> <P> "I may well support a ban when it comes out of committee, but I think it's big  enough that it deserves a full hearing," Bernson said.  </P> <P> Holden said that if a one-week ban would be effective, "there will be more  effect by a cutoff of two weeks."  </P> <P> If a ban is approved, Los Angeles would be the first city in the country to  have one, according to Bradley's office.  </P> <P> Bill Chandler, the mayor's press secretary, said Tuesday that if the city  attorney's office determines that a ban of longer than a week is legally  defensible, "the mayor is all for it."  </P> <P> Deputy City Atty. John Emerson said Tuesday that a longer ban probably would be  legal, but if the measure is too extreme the state Legislature probably will  pass a law preempting it.  </P> <P> Councilman Joel Wachs predicted Tuesday that the council will pass something  that is "reasonable," but said it is important that a measure be passed quickly  so that other cities in the area will follow suit in time for the Fourth of  July.  </P> <P> "You really can't wait until the last minute," Wachs said. "It will be less  effective if others don't follow it."  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors is studying a similar plan.  Supervisor Kenneth Hahn introduced a motion that would ban the sale of  ammunition for one week prior to the News Year's Eve and July 4 holidays. On  Tuesday the board agreed to send the proposal to County Sheriff Sherman Block  and Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates for comment.  </P></p>

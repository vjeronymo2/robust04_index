			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / International Company News: Foreign stake in Total set to rise FOREIGN ownership of Total, the French oil company, will rise from 30 per cent to 40 per cent as a result of the forthcoming government share sale, the group said yesterday. Mr Serge Tchuruk, chairman, welcomed the move as likely to improve the liquidity of the market for Total shares and help dispel an image of heavy state control. The sale, by far the biggest of the socialist government's programme of asset sales, will take place before July 10 if market conditions permit. It will reduce the stake held by the government and state controlled institutions from 33.9 per cent to 15 per cent. The state's direct stake will fall from 31.6 per cent to 5 per cent. State controlled banks and insurance companies will raise their stake from 2.3 per cent to 10 per cent, said Mr Tchuruk. The existing state-owned investors are the insurance groups GAN and AGF, but it is not yet known which groups will buy the extra shares to be offered to the public sector. The sale, organised by Paribas, is expected to raise up to FFr10bn (Dollars 1.84bn) to fund the government's employment policies, but there will be no fresh cash for the company. Most of the new foreign shareholders will be British and American, said Mr Tchuruk. Of the 22.9m shares being sold, 35 per cent will be made available to the French market, 32 per cent will be for the US and 33 per cent for the rest of the world. The government does not plan to create a golden share to defend Total against takeovers, but will have the right to suspend any board decision likely to modify control, said Mr Tchuruk. In addition, Total would be seeking to build up a larger core of loyal long term shareholders, he said. The company's existing statutes oblige investors to declare shareholdings of 2 per cent. Total did not envisage raising fresh capital for its own needs.</p>

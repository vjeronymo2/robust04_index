			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Unilever Unilever's first-quarter figures contained a number of small disappointments. Volume growth has not accelerated from the 1.5 per cent rate seen at the end of last year. Economic turmoil in Brazil has dented profits. Interest costs were higher than expected, partly because preference shares have been refinanced with debt. The interest charge probably has further to rise as Unilever starts to pay more on its dollar debt and receives less on some Pounds 1bn in deposits held in Europe, mostly in D-Marks and Dutch guilders. Profits forecasts have thus been trimmed. But these factors do not fully explain yesterday's 5 per cent fall in the shares. More worrying is the fact that prices across Unilever's vast range of consumer goods are still falling in real terms. True, the price war in US detergents which erupted last summer distorts the overall picture. Year on year comparisons should look more favourable from the third quarter. With Unilever now launching its new range of fabric detergents in Europe, though, there could be further pricing pressure to come. Detergent margins are generally lower in Europe than in the US, so there may be less scope for an all-out price war, yet the slanging match with Procter &amp; Gamble points to a robust competitive response. Despite Unilever's best efforts to defend margins by cutting costs, the threat of instability in another of its main markets will cast a shadow over the shares for some time yet.</p>

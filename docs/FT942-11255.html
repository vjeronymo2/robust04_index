			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Observer: Flushed out? Tut, tut. Is Sir Tim Bell, Lady Thatcher's favourite spin doctor, about to reverse his private PR business into a toilet cubicle maker? Sir Tim was surprisingly silent when Observer contacted him yesterday about a Daily Mail report that he was planning to use Chartwell, a small Gravesend company, to get his long-rumoured stock market quote. He has grown his Lowe Bell business into Britain's second-biggest PR company in double quick time. The presence of a few trophy names, such as Lord Carrington and Sir Ronald Grierson, on the letter head of Chime Communications, his parent company, suggest Sir Tim has public ambitions. But why Chartwell? Its shares were suspended yesterday, pending shareholder approval of a 'proposed substantial acquisition'. Luke Johnson, a former media analyst at Kleinwort Benson and son of writer Paul Johnson, has a stake in Chartwell and was involved in the successful reverse takeover of PizzaExpress. Hence, the gossip that Sir Tim is about to make a move. Given the recovery in the media sector - market leader Shandwick's shares have recovered from 2 1/2 p to 53p - there might be a window of opportunity for PR companies to come to market. But Sir Tim had better be quick.</p>

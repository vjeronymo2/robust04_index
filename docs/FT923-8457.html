			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Simple technology for fraudsters: Equipment to duplicate cards widely available MAGNETIC bank cards are notoriously easy to duplicate if you have a copy of the original. Experts and fraudsters alike claim that duplicates - known as 'white cards' - can be made with just two pieces of information: the personal identification number (PIN) and the account number. Banks say more information is required. Blank cards cost 4p to 5p each and the cheapest machine to write on the magnetic stripe can be bought for about Pounds 750. The same technology costs Pounds 300 in Germany. 'The market in magnetic-stripe machinery is fairly open,' says Mr Chris Bell, managing director of Data-stripe, a specialist company based in Surrey, which makes the Magnetic Stripe Card Writer. 'Plastic cards have a wide range of uses, so it is quite difficult to keep a close eye on the market.' Datastripe subjects customers to rigorous questioning and reports suspicious inquiries to the police. The secondhand market is less well controlled and the technology is readily available elsewhere in Europe, the Far East and the US. PINs are not for sale, but can be obtained by 'shouldering' cardholders  - watching them to discover their PINs. There are three main methods, according to Mr Ross Anderson, a Cambridge University cryptologist. Fraudsters can stand behind holders and watch them tap in their numbers; they can use a pair of binoculars; or they can use a high-definition video camera to record people using auto-tellers, with the time of the transaction coded on the videotape, so the receipts frequently discarded by users can be identified later. Account numbers are printed on many receipts. Technological expertise is not required to make the cards, according to Mr Bell: 'Sixth-form colleges and universities are teaching their engineering students how to make magnetic-stripe cards.' It takes a couple of seconds to write the PIN and account number on the blank card. All cash cards conform to international formats that are detailed in published documents. 'The method will not work every time, but the success rate seems to be quite high,' says Mr David Leiper, managing director of Innovative Electronic Technology, an access-control-card specialist. Mr Richard Tyson-Davies, of the Association of Payment Clearing Services, denies that this kind of fraud can be done. 'It is not possible to copy a card with just the PIN and the account number.' However, Mr Stephen Edell, one of the building society ombudsmen, is investigating whether a 'white card' could be produced with just a PIN and account number. Banks maintain that auto-tellers are secure and can be breached only if cards are lost and PINs given away. Nevertheless, a number of cases of 'shouldering' have occurred. In post-trial testimony, Mr Andrew Stone told how he stood in queues watching people type their PINs. He picked up the receipts and made duplicate cards. If he failed to see the PIN he would use the card in a supermarket, sometimes signing his name as 'Mickey Mouse'. Mr Stone was eventually prosecuted for defrauding the Switch system. Mr Tyson-Davies says he did not believe Mr Stone's post-trial testimony. However, Mr Stone's techniques were not novel. The first recorded case of 'shouldering' occurred in New York in the mid 1980s, where a dismissed auto-teller technician withdrew substantial sums through the system. Other techniques employed to defraud auto-tellers include the use of dummy machines. In 1988 US fraudsters set up a cigarette-vending machine in a shopping mall that would accept bank cards and PINs. Information was recorded and used to forge cards. UK fraudsters are now operating similar scams. In High Wycombe market, a gang set up a stall where cut-price goods could be bought only with a bank card. Internal bank fraud is also a possibility, although banks maintain that tight security procedures rule that out. In March, however, Mr Anthony Pratt, a computer engineer for Clydesdale Bank, was found guilty of stealing Pounds 17,000 from auto-teller machines belonging to the Clydesdale and TSB. He attached a hand-held computer to machines and it collected data from the cards fed in.</p>

			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ERRION REMEMBERED AS COACH AND FRIEND  </P> <P> I knew Jack Errion for 18 years as my boss, as a coach and most of all as a  friend. Though a quiet, rather shy man, Jack had a great influence on quite a  number of people.  </P> <P> He was an intense competitor during a basketball game. His many assistants over  the years, myself included, were more than once the recipient of a flying elbow  to the ribs from Jack, accompanied with the exclamation, "Did you see that?" or  "How could he do that?" or "How can they call that?"  </P> <P> Jack was always seeking perfection from his teams in an imperfect game (world).  One of his favorite phrases was -- "Let's go over it again!" I heard that said  countless times, in scouting meetings, practices or pregame meetings.  </P> <P> His philosophy was, just like the man, simple and direct. He would always say  he wanted "to get 'em (his team) to play better than they think they can." His  1975 St. Anthony's High School and his 1980 Corona del Mar teams were  outstanding examples of his philosophy.  </P> <P> In spite of his successes, Jack was always generous with his time, especially  with younger, inexperienced coaches. He would patiently listen to any question  asked of him and then quietly give his own opinion to the questioner.  </P> <P> Thursday, Jack was buried in a simple ceremony in Tucson. He left this world as  he lived it -- quiet and unassuming. I will miss him. Even though he is gone  now, his spirit and philosophy will live on in those of us that he touched.  </P> <P> MICHAEL PAUL SEIL, Newport Beach  </P></p>

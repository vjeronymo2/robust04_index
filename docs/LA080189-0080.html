			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MCCAW BID TOO LOW, LIN SAYS; MULLS OPTIONS  </P> <P> Lin Broadcasting, declaring that McCaw Cellular Communications failed to meet a  Monday deadline for reaching a friendly merger agreement, said Monday that it  intends to pursue alternatives to the McCaw proposal.  </P> <P> "Lin has given McCaw every reasonable opportunity to enter into a merger  agreement" at the price of $6.1 billion, or $127.50 a share, Lin Chairman and  Chief Executive Donald A. Pels said in a prepared statement. "McCaw's  continuing inadequate $110-a-share tender offer is clearly not in the best  interest of Lin stockholders."  </P> <P> Lin, the New York-based cellular telephone and broadcasting concern that holds  a 35% stake in Los Angeles Cellular Telephone, has said it is considering  spinning off its seven television stations into a separate company or a  financial restructuring that may include a special dividend to shareholders.  </P> <P> McCaw on Monday insisted that its $110-a-share offer is "full and fair."  </P> <P> Kirkland, Wash.-based McCaw, the nation's largest independent cellular  telephone company, has been actively pursuing Lin since early June when it made  a $120-a-share, or $5.8-billion, bid for the 90% of Lin it doesn't own. Lin's  board rejected that offer.  </P> <P> McCaw later agreed to discuss a $127.50 cash-and-stock offer but abruptly  suspended talks July 21.  </P></p>

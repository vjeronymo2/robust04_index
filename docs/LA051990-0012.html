			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMBIA RIVER SURPLUS WATER  </P> <P> I first thought of the idea of bringing water to California from the Columbia  River more than 40 years ago when I served as a Los Angeles City councilman. At  that time I was given a tour of the California aqueduct by the Department of  Water and Power. During that tour, a water engineer told me that our water  supplies would one day be insufficient and that it was important to study new  sources. The Columbia River, he said, was one possible source.  </P> <P> Today, as we enter our fourth year of drought -- the worst in 400 years -- the  words of that water engineer are ringing true. Water rationing has already  started in many parts of our state and if this situation continues to worsen,  our huge agriculture industry, upon which so many parts of this country depend,  will be severely hit.  </P> <P> The Columbia River each day dumps 90 billion gallons of fresh water into the  Pacific Ocean. My proposal to divert just 3 billion gallons a day from that  huge surplus, by way of aqueducts connecting the Columbia River to Shasta Lake  and the Snake River to Lake Mead, would help to meet California's critical  water needs without causing hardship to our neighbors in the Northwest. That  small fraction of the Columbia's runoff would not endanger the fisheries, nor  will it drain their water supplies. That small fraction will, however, help to  save our agricultural regions and provide an estimated 20,000 jobs during the  long-term construction of the aqueduct system, not just for Californians but  for people throughout the Northwest.  </P> <P> The idea of diverting surplus water from the Columbia River is not a "weird  notion" ("Wringing Out Weird Notions," editorial, May 10), but I remember  people saying the same thing when I wanted to place emergency telephones on the  freeways and when I wanted firefighters trained as paramedics in Los Angeles  County. Those ideas were considered "far-fetched" when I first proposed them,  but they save lives and are worth every battle I fought to make them a reality.  I have always believed that "without vision, people perish." KENNETH HAHN  </P> <P> Supervisor, Second District  </P> <P> Los Angeles County  </P></p>

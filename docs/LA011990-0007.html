			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXPORTING MORALS TO EAST EUROPE  </P> <P> Playboy magazine was unfairly maligned in Cal Thomas's column on American  exports to Eastern Europe (Op-Ed Page, Jan. 3). He laments the introduction of  Playboy into Hungary and criticized the magazine for placing an advertisement  celebrating the new freedom in the Eastern Bloc.  </P> <P> If Thomas had his way, the yoke of communism would be replaced by the yoke of  puritanism. But he's missing the point of the dramatic events of recent months.  The people of Poland, Hungary, Romania and East Germany risked their lives for  the right to be free from domination and censorship by any ruling class. In  short, they want the same access to information and entertainment that Thomas  enjoys in the United States.  </P> <P> Playboy magazine helped change attitudes in the United States and will likely  do the same in Eastern Europe. That's what the free exchange of ideas is all  about.  </P> <P> RICHARD S. ROSENZWEIG  </P> <P> Executive Vice President  </P> <P> Playboy Enterprises Inc.  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

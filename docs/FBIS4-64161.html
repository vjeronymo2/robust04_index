			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Oleg Panfilov report in the "Tajikistan" column: "The </F> Opening of Talks Has Been Postponed by Three Days. Will a  Cease- Fire Agreement Be Signed?"]    [Excerpts] As NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent has  learned, the second round of talks between the government  delegation and Tajik opposition, scheduled to be held in Tehran,  has been postponed by three days. This is due to the fact that  Iranian Foreign Minister Velayati will not be able to  participate in the official opening ceremony until 7 June.  [passage omitted]    The Tajik-Afghan border remains the most unquiet place. And  although the Islamic Revival Movement has repeatedly assured  that its actions are not aimed against Russian frontier guards,  the peacekeeping force command is constantly reinforcing its  units. In this context the INTERFAX report that peacekeeping  force commander Col.-Gen. Patrikeyev had excluded Tajikistan  armed forces from the "peacekeepers" contingent was rather  unexpected. On one hand, Tajik Defense Ministry units are not  numerous and do not have influence in the coalition forces.  Their participation in the "peacekeeping" mission was all the  more strange because the Dushanbe regime is in a state of civil  war with the opposition. On the other hand, government troops,  regularly supplied with arms and ammunition, can now conduct  operations independently, without exposing the Russian 201st  Division.    In any event these reshuffles will hardly change the  military's attitude to the political situation in Tajikistan  even though in the past six months the opposition has stated on  several occasions that it is not against the Russian military  presence in Tajikistan.    It is also possible that a new peacekeeping force commander  will not be just as straightforward as Boris Pyankov who  presented the opposition with an ultimatum this spring, which  was apparently a deliberate action, seen by the opposition as  interference in Tajikistan's affairs. This apparently  conditioned the government delegation's behavior at the first  round of negotiations in Moscow when it refused to sign a formal  cease-fire agreement proposed by the opposition (this,  incidentally, confirms the truth long understood by political  scientists and experts: The war against the opposition is not  being waged by the Dushanbe regime). At preparatory meetings  before the second round the opposition delegation is again  preparing a proposal on a cease-fire on the Tajik-Afghan border  which is regarded with understanding among Russian diplomats.

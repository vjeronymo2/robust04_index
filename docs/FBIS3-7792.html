			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Pawel Reszka: "Solidarity-Walesa; Short Tactical </F> Flirt"]    [Text] "Solidarity" and the president, two political  forces that have found themselves in opposition to the governing  configuration, are at first glance sentenced to cooperation.  However, there is not much hope for a lasting alliance between  them. There are too many differences, too much distrust, and too  few possible advantages--for one of the two parties at least.  The president and his entourage are encouraging the trade union  to cooperate; Solidarity may fear that the main beneficiary of  the possible alliance would be Walesa.    In the last conflict with the parliament, the president  resorted to anticommunist rhetoric. He started seeking allies  that he could count on in this dispute, and in the long run--in  the presidential elections:    "My dear Solidarity," he said at the last press conference.  "I will never cut my links with 'Solidarity,'" he added.  Andrzej Drzycimski has been recently persuading Marian  Krzaklewski to meet with the president.  <H5>  A Good Partner </H5>   Solidarity is a good, possible partner for Walesa. It is  beginning to regain strength and overcome the postelection  crisis. It proved this during the 40,000-people demonstration  which marched through the streets of Warsaw. The main slogan  was "Down with Communists" and it was clear that the  politically-diversified "Solidarity people" felt good in the old  role, when they could jointly protest the return of the forces  of the old configuration to power. The president is protesting  against the same today; he even said that the people who protest  are right, because "it was not supposed to be this way, but it  is worse," even though he encouraged a fight on other platforms.    During the demonstration, Solidarity authorities saw to it  that it did not reach the Belvedere; at the lead of the  demonstration was the Gdansk Region, with a strong  representation of the Gdansk Shipyard, which did not really feel  like demonstrating against the president--there are more persons  with similar views in the union. In an interview for  RZECZPOSPOLITA, Solidarity Senate Speaker Stefan Jurczak did not  rule out the possibility that the union may for the second time  back up Walesa in the presidential elections.  <H5>  Not Even A Step Further </H5>   Solidarity and the president may soon start cooperation with  each other. It seems, however, that this will not be a lasting  cooperation. Members of the Solidarity authorities have several  reasons why they should not go even a step further than it is  necessary in an alliance with the president.    "It is Walesa who wants cooperation with Solidarity. Our  question is what will we get out of that," says one member of  the National Committee. The president may contribute to this  marriage the authority of his office, the right to veto laws,  the possibility of holding a referendum (the trade union wants,  for example, a referendum on giving property to citizens), and  the right to launch a legislative initiative. The problem is  that the authority of the president is slightly eroded, which is  shown by opinion polls, and the other rights may be difficult to  take advantage of in a war with the parliament: The veto may be  overridden, the Senate must approve the referendum, and the fate  of the last legislative initiative of the president, which was  rejected in the first reading, will discourage Lech Walesa from  any new actions in this area. What the partners can do, then,  is to take joint action in the opposition. This motivation may  turn out to be sufficient only for a short time. All the more so  because the relations between the president and Solidarity will  become increasingly complex as  <H5>  The Presidential Elections </H5>   draw closer. Walesa will certainly want to lean on the trade  union, where he still has numerous supporters. The present  Solidarity leadership is rather skeptical about this idea. A  similar situation developed last year, when the president wanted  to come to the Solidarity congress and persuade the trade union  to run in the parliamentary elections jointly with the Non-Party  Bloc in Support of Reforms. The union leaders, who were  determined to run separately, were indignant at the president  and invited him only to the last day of the congress, when all  the decisions had already been made. The president was offended  because he was not given a chance to give it a try.    "I would not like to be in such a Solidarity, he said at  that  time. Now Walesa wants to give it a try once again. However,  past animosities linger on--all the more so because after the  congress conflict the influence of supporters and personal  friends of the president within Solidarity considerably waned.  We should also not forget about numerous Solidarity members who  are firm opponents of Walesa, supporters of file-checking and  cooperation with the right wing. Exceedingly close cooperation  with Walesa would, then, have to cause greater or lesser  quarrels within Solidarity.    Adding to all that are also personal ambitions of Marian  Krzaklewski; some of his aides do not rule out the possibility  that he is thinking about the presidency. He would be a  candidate acceptable to the right wing--he is the chairman of  the Constitutional Commission of the extra-parliamentary  rightist groupings.</p>

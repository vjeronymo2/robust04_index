			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Spain to curtail budget deficit: Solbes proposals criticised for failing to attack public spending more severely Mr Pedro Solbes, Spain's economy and finance minister, yesterday presented to parliament what the government calls the most restrictive fiscal plan of the past decade. Public spending will grow by 3.4 per cent next year, just below the forecast inflation figure of 3.5 per cent. The budget expects a rise in government revenue of 7.1 per cent and plans to lower the deficit from an estimated 6.7 per cent this year to 5.9 per cent next year. Although prime minister Felipe Gonzalez's Socialist government lacks a majority in parliament, the budget will be passed with backing from the Catalan nationalist party. It is understood that the more restrictive features of the budget, as well a reduction in the social security contributions made by employers, were introduced by the right of centre Catalan party in its negotiations with Mr Solbes. Mr Solbes said the budget had been drafted 'in the context of clear economic recovery' and that GDP would grow by 1.7 per cent this year against an initial forecast of 1.3 per cent. The 1995 budget is based on growth next year of 2.8 per cent. The chief feature of next year's growth, according to the economy ministry's projections, is that it will be led by strong recovery of private consumption in part due to the first net creation of jobs since 1991. Private sector demand is forecast to contribute 2.5 per to the growth rate against 0.1 per cent this year. Mr Solbes hopes that between 175,000 and 220,000 jobs will be created next year although Spain's high unemployment - currently just over 24 per cent of the working population - will only come down marginally because of new entrants into the labour market. Conservative critics of the budget say that the government has failed to use the economic upswing to cut back more severely on the structural component of the public deficit. Mr Solbes claims that he has stemmed former spiralling deficits and that he has begun to make inroads on fixed expenditure: the structural component of this year's 6.7 per cent public deficit represents 4.2 per cent of the total and it will represent 3.6 per cent in next year's planned 5.9 per cent deficit according to Mr Solbes. There are also doubts about whether the government will be able to meet its 3.5 per cent inflation target next year in the light of a 1 per cent increase in value added tax built into the 1995 budget and increased private sector consumption. Mr Solbes had planned on a 3.5 per cent inflation rise at the end of this year but he said yesterday the year end figure would be 'in the region of 4 per cent'.</p>

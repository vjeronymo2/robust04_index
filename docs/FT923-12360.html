			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Trade deficit, IBM figures hit equities Wall Street US stock prices fell sharply yesterday on news of disappointing earnings at IBM and an unexpectedly large monthly trade deficit, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 29.99 at 3,331.64, although above its lows for the day when the index had given up more than 40 points. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended lower, down 1.92 at 415.62, while the Amex composite slipped 1.79 to 386.55 and the Nasdaq composite fell 5.67 to 570.52. Turnover on the NYSE was 189m shares and declines outpaced rises by 1040 to 602. The markets opened weaker, partly unsettled by news of a big lead in the polls for Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, over President George Bush, but more unsettled by the wider-than-expected Dollars 7.38bn May trade deficit. Particularly worrying was the 2.5 per cent decline in exports, the third consecutive monthly fall, which provided further confirmation that economic growth in the second quarter will be weaker than the 2.7 per cent growth achieved in the first quarter. Second-quarter corporate earnings again dominated trading. Yesterday it was the turn of IBM, often regarded as the market's bellwether stock, to announce its figures. Although IBM unveiled net income of Dollars 1.25 a share, well up on the meagre 22 cents a share earned a year ago, the results were below market estimates, which had centred around Dollars 1.33 a share. Consequently, there was heavy selling of IBM stock, which dropped Dollars 5 1/4 to Dollars 95 in turnover of 5.3m shares. The rival computer group, Digital Equipment, fared much better, rising Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 43 3/8 as investors reacted positively to the news late on Thursday that Mr Kenneth Olsen, the company's founder and president, will step down in October to make way for a new generation of management. The Dutch electronics giant, Philips, plunged Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 15 5/8 on reports from the Netherlands that the company is having trouble with its HDTV project. Philips denied the story. In the latest of a long line of bank mergers, NationsBank was steady at Dollars 45 7/8 and MNC Financial down Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 10 7/8 on the news that NationsBank had agreed to invest Dollars 200m in MNC with an option to buy the company at a price between Dollars 11.75 a share and Dollars 15 a share. On the Nasdaq market, Apple Computer fell Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 45 after the company reported fiscal third-quarter profits of Dollars 131.7m, a big improvement on the Dollars 53m loss incurred at the same stage a year ago but still below market estimates. The news from Apple triggered selling in other technology stocks, leaving Microsoft Dollars 2 lower at Dollars 70 1/4 , Intel down Dollars 2 at Dollars 56 and Novell Dollars 1 lower at Dollars 54. Canada TORONTO closed lower in moderate trading boosted by a large block trade of 3m shares in Barrington Petroleum. The TSE 300 composite index fell 12.58 points to 3463.00 with advances just ahead of declines by 272 to 255. Trading value was CDollars 268.5m. All but one of the 14 stock groups closed lower, the gold group bucking the trend with a rise of 1.24 per cent as the New York spot gold price jumped Dollars 4.75 to USDollars 357.00.</p>

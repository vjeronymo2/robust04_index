			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Leading Article: G7's Russian gamble IN RUSSIA, amid the turmoil and confusion which has characterised the past fortnight, two conclusions can be drawn with some certainty. First, the threat of hyperinflation is growing by the day. Second, Russia's apparently reform-minded government cannot hope to restore some semblance of economic and political stability, and start to restructure the economy, unless it receives substantial western financial help as soon as reforms begin. Western governments are right to be cautious. But they must be ready and willing to act decisively if the balance shifts decisively in the reformers' favour. For the moment, the west is right to limit its support to words. The unstable balance of power between President Boris Yeltsin and his opponents make it doubtful that the reformers have the political clout to pursue reform, even with external aid. Nor can the parliamentarians planned April 25 referendum, in its current unrealistic form, or President Boris Yeltsin's alternative plebiscite, be relied on to resolve this power struggle. Even after 18 months of Mr Yeltsin's rule, the central bank remains opposed to reform. Despite calls for resignations at the bank from Deputy Prime Minister Boris Fyodorov, it is still increasing credit at the rate of 20 per cent a month, financing the budget deficit and keeping enterprises afloat at the expense of accelerating inflation. Yet while western governments are right to be cautious, they would be wrong to be inactive. The success of the reformers' draft programme will depend as much on the organisation and resolve of the western members of the Group of Seven industrialised countries as on the reformers. The west should use the coming weeks to draw up a joint economic strategy with Mr Fyodorov and his team, and arrange multilateral funds which can be disbursed quickly once the programme begins. This requires a shift in western strategy. The G7 and the International Monetary Fund have spent the past year waiting for the Russian government to establish a track record before releasing notionally available aid. This strategy is misconceived. The Russian government can only bring inflation under control by halving the flow of central bank credits. But this can only occur, in the absence of alternative sources of finance, through huge cuts in social spending or mass unemployment, neither of which are politically conceivable. Only with up-front western aid, in the region of Dollars 2bn-Dollars 3bn over the next three months, can the government bring inflation under control. This aid should only be disbursed when the G7 governments are confident that the central bank has stemmed the flow of credits to enterprises. And future aid flows, preferably conditional on deeper economic reforms, must be cut off if the government fails to meet its budgetary targets. But only by filling the budget gap, and thus stabilising the exchange rate, can the Russian government persuade investors to hold roubles rather than dollars and stem the flight of capital to Swiss bank accounts. This is the enlightened, if risky, strategy. The alternative is for the G7 to procrastinate, using the caution of the rule-bound IMF as an excuse for its inaction while the reforms wither. The west's reputation in Russia will then deteriorate further, leaving Europe to deal with the fall-out from Russia's inevitable and dangerous journey through hyperinflation to political disintegration.</p>

			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Management: Russia's Harvard gets down to business - John Lloyd visits a pioneering school which is teaching advanced market economics to graduates Arkady Dvorkovich is one of the stars of the first graduating year of a remarkable university which lives precariously on the 17th floor of a former Soviet institute of great prestige. Behind him is a blackboard covered with econometric equations. 'It's a different way of thinking about life,' he says. 'That's what is most difficult at first.' Dvorkovich is no longer at the university, but has just dropped by for a chat. The class is on a break and the students sit about comparing notes or smoke in the corridor. The New Economic School, two years old, is still a pioneer in the teaching of market economics to a new generation of Russian managers, economists and professors. It is indeed a different way of thinking about life. The Soviet Union trained its managers and economists to be part of a system in which there was no division between state and economy; where the State Planning Agency and the ministries directed inputs and outputs, demand and supply; where choice, quality and convenience were of no interest; where the provision of raw materials and components was handled by one agency, distribution by another, personnel matters by the Communist Party and the trade unions - and the managers left with technicalities. Economic life thus came to be seen as a series of discrete areas existing within an overall framework of control - oppressive but secure. Economics within this system was, in theory, Marxism and, in practice, keeping the show on the road without questioning how it moved. The collapse of the system, and with it the doomed efforts of the perestroika period to give managers more independence while retaining the integrity of a socialist planned economy, pitched Russian management and economic teaching into a void. While the basics of a market were easy enough to pick up - and had anyway been sanctioned in peasant markets - the larger issues of enterprise management and, beyond that, the macro-economic framework within which the enterprises fit, were largely unknown. In 1991, Professor Gul Ofer, an economist and Soviet specialist at Hebrew University, thought he could address the problem by starting a school for graduates which would teach market economics, in English, at advanced level. To start anything in Russia is to invite grief. Ofer and his colleagues spent months haggling for office space - finally finding their exiguous premises in the Central Economic-Mathematical Institute, an Academy of Sciences institution built up in the 1960s. It was important in the Gorbachev period as a centre of reformist thinking, particularly associated with Professors Nikolai Petrakov and Stanislav Shatalin. Importantly, they got support from Professor Igor Makarov, head of the institute and dean of the school. Funding came from the ubiquitous Soros Foundation and (now) from the Eurasia Foundation, a recently created US fund devoted to projects in the former Soviet Union. Together they put up Dollars 750,000 (Pounds 457,000) a year. This allows the school to pay half a dozen professorial salaries and take in some 30-40 students each year - many from Moscow State University, the country's most prestigious, but others from elsewhere in Russia and a few from former Soviet states. It is formidably hard. The students in Professor Eden's class - in their early 20s - were following a discussion on inflation. 'If you have a government with a fiscal problem,' says Eden, speaking to citizens of the country with one of the greatest fiscal problems on earth, 'it can print money and sell the money for goods. There's always a temptation to do that; it may not make sense in the long run.' The students scribbled in their notebooks. 'I find the speed of it most difficult,' says Muscovite Anna Pavlova after the class. 'We must learn subjects in a few weeks if we are to pass the exams and write a master's thesis. It's much faster work than at the university.' The course clearly means that the bright - like Dvorkovich, who will go on to further study in the west - flourish and the weaker are left behind. 'The hardest thing is to find out what the teachers really mean,' says Pavlova. 'But their performances and style of teaching are much more exciting than at university.' This last comment is hardly surprising. These students come out of universities which are being starved of funds, are taught by professors who must take an extra job or jobs to make ends meet and who themselves struggle with new concepts they once viewed - or still view - as reprehensible. 'The professors have only recently learned about the new economics,' says Anton Afanasiev. 'They mix things up. Most of them are for state regulation of some sort, or maybe for some kind of mixed economy. Very few are for a market economy.' Eden, who normally teaches at the Technion Engineering Institute at Haifa and is an adviser to the Israeli Bank, says that 'these students match up or are even better than the ones I teach. They work terribly hard'. Ofer, a big humorous man who shuttles between Moscow and Israel, faces the perennial problems of a Moscow manager. 'We need more space but we can't find it, and our rent-free status is now in doubt. Makarov got us in without rent but now his people are putting pressure on him to ask us. After all, the rest of the institute is full of people paying rent for office space - why not us?' Ofer's connections ensure that the school gets some of the stars of the international economic circuit stopping by. Michael Bruno, now chief economist at the World Bank, gave a talk at which he floated the idea that Russia might find a unique way to the market with privatisation playing more of a role than macro-economic levers. Professor Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard, former adviser to Russian ministers, has talked twice; Boris Fyodorov, the former finance minister, made time in a ministerial schedule to treat the students to a scathing description of how decisions are avoided in the Russian government. In the computer room, students eschew the games which are played monotonously in every office with a screen and keyboard and instead pore over spreadsheets and columns of figures. Others sit in the corridors or on the hard seats, reading textbooks and articles. The scruffy, makeshift offices and classrooms have the life about them of young men and women actively grappling with a system of knowledge they are meeting for the first time in such a concentrated way. It is not Harvard Business School - it is something at once poorer and purer.</p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Jardine Fleming cements position with Dollars 202m net Jardine Fleming yesterday cemented its position at the top of Hong Kong's merchant banking league, posting a 166 per cent rise in 1993 net earnings to USDollars 202m from Dollars 76m in 1992. The company - a joint venture brokerage between Jardine Matheson and UK merchant bank Robert Fleming - is strongest in investment management, broking and corporate finance. Commenting on his company's results, Mr Alan Smith, executive chairman, said: 'What I think these results show is this is Asia and this is where you should be.' Mr Smith said that for the past decade Jardine Fleming had made an average 60 per cent annual return on shareholders' funds. In 1993, the return was 91 per cent on funds of Dollars 303m. Last year funds under management more than doubled to Dollars 21.3bn on the back of strongly rising share prices in most Asian markets. Inflows were particularly strong in Hong Kong, where sales of unit trust products reached Dollars 3.7bn. A flood of applications at the beginning of this year forced the company to place a temporary halt on new subscriptions. The company said that it achieved a higher share of agency broking business last year and was active in introducing new products, particularly derivatives and Euro-instruments. It claimed it held first position in the trading of 'B' shares in Shanghai.</p>

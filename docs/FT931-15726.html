			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / International Company News: ASC reviews Fletcher insider probe result THE Australian Securities Commission (ASC), the federal corporate watchdog, is considering the results of an insider trading inquiry into Fletcher Challenge, the New Zealand conglomerate. The investigation follows volatility in Fletcher's share price between June and December, which coincided with the disposal of more than NZDollars 1bn (USDollars 510m) of assets. The investigation was initiated by the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) and carried out in conjunction with the New Zealand Stock Exchange and the corporate regulatory authorities in Wellington. The ASX said the report was a 'routine' result of its normal monitoring of share price movements. Fletcher Challenge said it was confident no breaches of securities legislation had occurred. All asset disposals had been widely publicised in advance, and the market had been kept informed. Fletcher put a large number of assets up for sale in mid-year after its shares came under selling pressure, mainly because of investors' concerns about its operational performance and high level of debt. Asset disposals included the Rural Bank, sold to the National Bank of New Zealand for NZDollars 450m, and a stake in the NZ Natural Gas Corporation, sold for NZDollars 305m. Fletcher shares fell to a record low of ADollars 1.24 in Sydney on November 20, but recovered to ADollars 1.68 on November 30, one day after news of the Rural Bank sale. In October, Mr Hugh Fletcher, managing director, suggested the low share price could lead to a takeover. 'I would not be surprised if some corporate started buying the company; there are billions to be made in buying Fletcher Challenge at this level.' Fletcher said it had no plans to set up an internal inquiry into the asset sales.</p>

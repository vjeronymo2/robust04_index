			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO EVIDENCE THAT 'SYNERGIES' THEORY WORKS, THEY SAY;  </P> <P> SOME QUESTION ADVANTAGE OF TIME-WARNER DEAL  </P> <P> Sony buys CBS Records. A big French publisher buys Women's Day and 11 other  U.S. magazines. Rupert Murdoch snatches up 20th Century-Fox movie studio, the  Metromedia television stations, TV Guide. And now the biggest of all: Warner  Communications merges with Time Inc.  </P> <P> Is the media and entertainment world merging into a few global titans that will  eventually squeeze out smaller players in a competitive world war?  </P> <P> Officials of Time and Warner say their worries about the emerging competition  was a primary reason for their union, announced Saturday. They see a handful of  giant concerns buying up publishing houses, movie and TV studios, distribution  businesses, record companies, television stations and cable systems.  </P> <P> It won't be long, they warn, before communications companies that don't follow  suit will find themselves in financial danger.  </P> <P> "The minute you let your guard down, you'll be swallowed up," Time Inc. Chief  Executive J. Richard Munro said Monday as executives of Warner Communications  and Time explained the reasons for their merger, which will create the world's  largest media and entertainment concern.  </P> <P> Warner Chairman Steven J. Ross added that competing in the business will be  like driving a car up a steep grade. "The minute you put it in neutral, you're  going to be at the bottom of the hill," he warned.  </P> <P> A lot of other people say, "Nonsense."  </P> <P> The skeptics say that despite the recent torrid pace of media mergers, the  advantages of the communications conglomerates may not be as great as they  appear. They certainly aren't great enough to keep strong new companies from  elbowing their way into the business, as they always have in the past, critics  contend.  </P> <P> "The communications business has so much activity and change that I just don't  believe it's possible for a few giants to control the information flow around  the world," said J. Kendrick Noble, an analyst with Paine Webber in New York.  </P> <P> The goal of these new media giants is to cut the high risks of producing their  various products by selling them in many forms and markets around the world.  </P> <P> Warner and Time will gain complementary advantages -- "synergies," in the  threadbare term -- as soon as they merge. The expertise and inventory of  Warner's Warner Bros. studio will provide programming for Time's Home Box  Office pay-TV unit in new ventures as well as current ones.  </P> <P> Time will benefit from the overseas marketing and distribution strength of  Warner, which distributes its own records and films, and the films of Walt  Disney Co., abroad. Warner should be assisted in selling its products by the  direct-marketing expertise of Time Inc., which is the largest in the business,  analysts speculate.  </P> <P> Executives of the company say they expect that their mutual strengths will  allow them to capitalize on the new television markets that are opening with  deregulation in Europe and Asia. They decline to be specific about their plans,  but analysts speculate that they may try to provide not only movies and  television programming, but also cable systems and direct-broadcast satellite  systems.  </P> <P> "As Asia follows Europe in deregulation, we expect to be the blue chip provider  in the market," said Nicholas J. Nicholas Jr., Time's president.  </P> <P> The company may envision a day when it will have the kind of close integration  that many media companies admire in Murdoch's News Corp. The programs that are  produced on Murdoch's Fox studio can be broadcast through the Fox Broadcasting  Co. stations in the United States and on Murdoch's Sky Channel satellite  operation in Europe.  </P> <P> News Corp. can offer advertisers package rates in its publications. And it can  buy newsprint and equipment for its 150 publications at a discount.  </P> <P> But many experts question how great those advantages really can be.  </P> <P> The drawbacks of such attempts at "vertical integration" have been apparent in  the past. Harcourt Brace, for example, once purchased a paperback publishing  operation, called Jove, with the intent of using its Harcourt's hardback books  as a source of paperbacks, Noble recalled.  </P> <P> But Jove's editors didn't feel that Harcourt books were the best for their  paperback line. Ultimately, the business was sold to MCA.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Conflicting Interests  </P> <P> Taft Broadcasting -- which has since been broken up -- owned not just  television stations but Hanna-Barbera Productions, the renowned producer of  cartoons. But while this arrangement was expected to give the stations a ready  source of product, the TV station managers often found programming they  preferred, and sold the cartoons to others.  </P> <P> "Whatever you might say about synergies, the interests of the producers and  distributors aren't the same," said Alan J. Gottesman, also an analyst with  Paine Webber.  </P> <P> Noble said the idea of dominant media companies came from Europe, where, in  fact, some companies have historically dominated large shares of newspaper and  book publishing and printing businesses, and other media.  </P> <P> But while such Europeans as Robert Maxwell, chairman of the Great Britain-based  Maxwell Communications, do believe that a new class of media giants is  emerging, "lots of smart people believe too many different businesses can lead  to management neglect of some of them," said Noble.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Worldwide Ads  </P> <P> CBS and Playboy Enterprises were among the companies that diversified into  other media, then sold off their holdings to pay closer attention to their core  businesses. Others, such as newspaper giant Gannett Co., have made conscious  decisions to concentrate on the United States from reluctance to take on such  unpredictable factors as foreign regulation, labor practices and currency  exchange rates.  </P> <P> It has also not been established that worldwide media enterprises can attract  advertisers willing to buy ads in the media of different countries. Some blame  the disappointing performance of Murdoch's Sky Channel on the sharp cultural  differences between viewers in various European nations.  </P> <P> Some analysts question whether Time and Warner officials would have faced a  competitive threat if they chose to remain alone. "I just can't see how any  competitors could keep the magazines of Time Inc., or the programming or  records of Warner, from making money," said Andrew Horneck, research director  of the Veronis, Suhler &amp; Associates investment bank.  </P> <P> Some analysts even question whether the two companies' executives are truly  motivated by a fear of the new global competitors. "It sounds good to say  you're worried about these foreign threats, but I think other factors, like  their fear of a takeover, were probably much more important in this," said  Peter Wade, president of the New York office of J. B. Were &amp; Son.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE FOREIGN MEDIA GIANTS  </P> <P> Maxwell Communications (England)  </P> <P> Financial Data: 1987 revenues of $1.61 billion and profits of $244 million  </P> <P> Publishing:  </P> <P> Macmillan Inc.  </P> <P> Pergamon Press  </P> <P> Scientific Research Associates (textbooks)  </P> <P> Webb Publishing (farming magazines)  </P> <P> Official Airlines Guide  </P> <P> Printing: Newspaper inserts and magazines such as Parade, TV Guide, Time and  Sports Illustrated  </P> <P> </P> <P> News Corp.

			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALTER ZELMAN  </P> <P> Walter Zelman's political-therapy-revelations ("Why One Mr. Smith Couldn't Even  Make It to Sacramento," Nov. 11) epitomize the malaise that has laid low the  entire liberal bloc of the American political scene.  </P> <P> His preoccupation with self-fulfillment apparently overshadows any concept of  "serving the people."  </P> <P> The narrative is, admittedly, entertaining. But this is due mainly to his  divulging the fact that just about anyone may be successful in getting  themselves on the ballot and, what is even more curious, getting people to give  them money.  </P> <P> If we learn nothing else from Zelman, here is a great tribute to the basis of  our American democratic system.  </P> <P> EARL CARTER  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

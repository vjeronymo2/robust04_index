He said the move came in an effort to counter the  inflationary effects of the 50-percent devaluation this week of  the CFA franc.    The goods whose prices are frozen include bread, flour,  rice,  cooking oil, soap, sugar, milk, meat and fish, he said. "Price  controls are being strengthened for existing stocks of goods to  avoid improper price increases," he said.</p>

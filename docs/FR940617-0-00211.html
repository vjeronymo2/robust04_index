			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;89.507&hyph;96 Sample selection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Engines comprising a test sample will be selected at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the location and in the manner specified in the test order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a manufacturer determines that the test engines cannot be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> selected in the manner specified in the test order, an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative selection procedure may be employed, provided the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer requests approval of the alternative procedure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior to the start of test sample selection, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator approves the procedure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The manufacturer must assemble the test engines of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the family selected for testing using its normal mass  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production process for engines to be distributed into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commerce. If, between the time the manufacturer is notified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a test order and the time the manufacturer finishes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> selecting test engines, the manufacturer implements any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change(s) in its production processes, including quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control, which may reasonably be expected to affect the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions of the engines selected, then the manufacturer must,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the audit, inform the Administrator of such changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the test engines are selected at a location where they do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not have their operational and emission control systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installed, the test order will specify the manner and location  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for selection of components to complete assembly of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines. The manufacturer must assemble these components onto  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the test engines using normal assembly and quality control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures as documented by the manufacturer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) No quality control, testing, or assembly procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be used on the test engine or any portion thereof,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including parts and subassemblies, that have not been or will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not be used during the production and assembly of all other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines of that family, unless the Administrator approves the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modification in assembly procedures pursuant to paragraph (b)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) The test order may specify that an EPA enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> officer(s) or authorized representative(s), rather than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer, select the test engines according to the method  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified in the test order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) The order in which test engines are selected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determines the order in which test results are to be used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applying the sampling plan in accordance with &sect;89.510&hyph;96.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) The manufacturer must keep on hand all untested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines, if any, comprising the test sample until a pass or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fail decision is reached in accordance with &sect;89.510&hyph;96(e).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The manufacturer may ship any tested engine which has not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failed the requirements as set forth in &sect;89.510&hyph;96(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, once the manufacturer ships any test engine, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relinquishes the prerogative to conduct retests as provided in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;89.508&hyph;96(i).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;89.508&hyph;96  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Test procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)(1) For nonroad engines subject to the provisions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this subpart, the prescribed test procedures are the nonroad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine 8-mode test procedure as described in subpart E of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part, the federal smoke test as described in part 86, subpart  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I of this chapter, and the particulate test procedure as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted in the California Regulations for New 1996 and Later  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Heavy-Duty Off-Road Diesel Cycle Engines. This procedure is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporated by reference. See &sect;89.6.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The Administrator may, on the basis of a written  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application by a manufacturer, prescribe test procedures other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than those specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any nonroad engine he or she determines is not susceptible to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfactory testing using the procedures specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (a)(1) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)(1) The manufacturer may not adjust, repair, prepare,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or modify the engines selected for testing and may not perform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any emission tests on engines selected for testing pursuant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the test order unless this adjustment, repair, preparation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modification, and/or tests are documented in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer's engine assembly and inspection procedures and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are actually performed or unless these adjustments and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests are required or permitted under this subpart or are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved in advance by the Administrator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The Administrator may adjust or cause to be adjusted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any engine parameter which the Administrator has determined to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be subject to adjustment for certification and Selective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Enforcement Audit testing in accordance with &sect;89.108&hyph;96, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any setting within the physically adjustable range of that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parameter, as determined by the Administrator in accordance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with &sect;89.108&hyph;96, prior to the performance of any tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, if the idle speed parameter is one which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator may not adjust it to any setting which causes a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lower engine idle speed than would have been possible within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the physically adjustable range of the idle speed parameter if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the manufacturer had accumulated 125 hours of service on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine under paragraph (c) of this section, all other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parameters being identically adjusted for the purpose of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comparison. The manufacturer may be requested to supply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information needed to establish an alternate minimum idle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> speed. The Administrator, in making or specifying these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustments, may consider the effect of the deviation from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer's recommended setting on emission performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characteristics as well as the likelihood that similar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> settings will occur on in-use engines. In determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likelihood, the Administrator may consider factors such as,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but not limited to, the effect of the adjustment on engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance characteristics and surveillance information from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar in-use engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

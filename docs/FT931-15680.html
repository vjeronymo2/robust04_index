			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / IADB launches Latin America investment fund The InterAmerican Development Bank yesterday launched its much-delayed Multilateral Investment Fund to promote private sector investment, financial market deregulation and other economic reforms in Latin America, writes Nancy Dunne. President George Bush proposed a Dollars 1.5bn fund in June 1990 as part of his Enterprise for the Americas Initiative. He envisaged that the US, EC and Japan would each give Dollars 500m over five years to get the fund established. Contributions, however, have totalled less than Dollars 1.26bn. Although Japan has pledged its Dollars 500m, Europe has been less generous. Spain is contributing Dollars 50m, Germany Dollars 30m, Italy Dollars 30m, France Dollars 15m, Portugal Dollars 4m. The US Congress has authorised Dollars 90m for the first year, rather than the Dollars 100m requested by the president. Latin American countries are contributing the rest. The fund will have three separate facilities. One will provide technical assistance to identify and implement policy changes needed to boost the private sector. A 'human resources' facility will lift productivity by funding education and worker retraining programmes. Another facility will establish a revolving fund to make loans and equity investments in support of micro- and small-business enterprises run by women, minorities and the poor.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Volodymyr Chikalin: "We Have Cooked a Nuclear </F> Dish, But Can We Serve It?"]    [Text] The tripartite agreement on Ukraine's nuclear  weapons signed by the Ukrainian, Russian, and U.S. presidents  still remains the center of attention of the international  community and media. There is the widespread opinion that this  document has decisive importance for our state and conforms to  the goals of its policy and people's hopes. Are there different  opinions on this issue? Scientists from the Academy of Sciences  Institute of Semiconductors received an answer to this and many  other questions at a meeting with Ukrainian People's Deputies  Yuriy Kostenko and Ivan Zayets.    Yuriy Kostenko, Ukraine's minister of ecology and head of  the  Committee for Issues of Nuclear Disarmament, outlining his  position on the tripartite agreement, emphasized that one should  have proceeded on the path to nuclear disarmament gradually.  What happened in Moscow did not comply with the interests of  our state.    Explaining his viewpoint, People's Deputy Yuriy Kostenko  recalled certain facts. In particular, he said that there are  no nuclear warheads which have surpassed their predetermined  shelf life. The majority of them will expire in the year 2005.    The terms of payments for nuclear weapons cannot satisfy us.  The tactical nuclear weapons which were transferred to Russia  contained 90 tonnes of highly enriched uranium and 10 tonnes of  plutonium. Estimating that 1 kg of uranium costs $100,000 and 1  kg of plutonium -- $1 million, Russia's debt for our nuclear  components exceeds our debt for energy sources.    In the opinion of Yuriy Kostenko, the widespread belief that  we would have ended up in complete isolation if we had not  signed the documents on nuclear disarmament are not true. While  proceeding on the path to nonnuclear status, we should have  concentrated our efforts on accelerating economic reforms.    The same opinion was voiced by Ivan Zayets, head of the Kiev  branch of Rukh, who dwelled on ways of reforming the executive  branch. He appealed to the participants for voting for  politicians who endorse the interests of an independent Ukraine.    Listening to the people's deputies, I recalled something my  grandmother would say when somebody failed to complete his work:  "She could cook, but she could not serve."    Having cooked a nuclear dish, we probably did not serve it  well at the tripartite meeting's table.</p>

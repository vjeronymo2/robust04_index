			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Chretien appoints new cabinet MR JEAN CHRETIEN was sworn in as Canada's 20th prime minister in Ottawa yesterday, returning the Liberal party to office after nine years of Conservative rule. Mr Chretien, 59, a 30-year veteran of federal politics, immediately appointed a centre-right cabinet of 23 members. Mr Paul Martin, 55, a former businessman and son of the late Senator Paul Martin, takes over the department of finance. He is a fiscal conservative, committed to gradual deficit reduction and more efficient government. A former Toronto businessman, Mr Roy MacLaren, 59, becomes minister for international trade and in charge of the North American Free Trade Agreement portfolio. Mr Maclaren is a Nafta supporter. A veteran of the Pierre Trudeau government, Mr Andre Ouellet, 54, becomes minister of external affairs, while Mr Lloyd Axworthy, 53, another Trudeau veteran, is minister of human resources and will represent western Canada. Mr Arthur Eggleton, a former mayor of Toronto, heads the Treasury Board and Mr Marcel Masse, a federal civil servant under Liberal and Conservative governments, shoulders inter-governmental affairs, covering constitutional problems looming with Quebec and western Canada. Mrs Sheila Copps, 40, a leading Liberal parliamentarian, becomes deputy prime minister, one of four women in the cabinet. The cabinet must address a federal 1993-94 deficit of about CDollars 40bn (Pounds 20.5bn), external debt of USDollars 225bn, high unemployment, lagging recovery and exploding health and welfare costs. The new prime minister has proposed a CDollars 6bn crash infrastructure programme to create new jobs. The funds would come partly from defence cuts, including cancellation of a CDollars 5bn helicopter order from Westland of the UK and Agusta of Italy, but this has raised protests from three provinces which stand to benefit from work on the order.</p>

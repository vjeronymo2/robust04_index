			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ernesto Lopez from the "YSU Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Nationalist Republican Alliance [ARENA] crowned  its successes in El Salvador by winning 24 April's presidential  elections. During the first round of elections, the party had  already ensured control of the assembly as well as a majority in  the country's local governments. The party will now be  responsible for leading the country through a key phase of  economic recovery and consolidation of peace.    With Armando Calderon Sol as president, ARENA has agreed to  encourage a government of national accord in order to continue  advancing in the process of pacification, democratization, and  implementation of an economic adjustment program. It is  expected that in addition to macroeconomic stability, the  economic program will also ensure an improvement in the  standards of living of the 5.6 million Salvadorans.    Calderon Sol was elected 24 April with 68 percent of the  votes, as opposed to the 32 percent received by his closest  adversary, Democratic Convergence candidate Ruben Zamora. The  new president promised to ensure the participation of all forces  which support the governability and political stability of the  country, which ended a bloody war in 1992 that lasted more than  a decade.    With 39 of 84 seats, ARENA will control the Legislative  Assembly through a simply majority of 44 seats, as a result of  obtaining the support of the right-wing National Conciliation  Party, which obtained four seats in the elections.    The former guerrilla group Farabundo Marti National  Liberation Front [FMLN], which won 21 seats during the 20 March  parliamentary elections, has stated it believes ARENA will  control the legislative branch with intolerance, despite  assurances it is planning to seek an accommodation with all the  political parties.    ARENA also secured clear-cut control over the local  governments by winning 206 of the 262 municipal offices open to  elections. The Christian Democratic Party was able to secure 29  municipal offices; the FMLN won 16, and the Authentic Christian  Movement was only able to win one mayoral office.    Monday, Calderon Sol said that with these results, ARENA has  further consolidated itself as the country's leading political  force. He added its main opposition will now be the FMLN, which  has become the second leading political option as a result of  its strong showing in the elections.    ARENA was founded in September 1981 by deceased Major  Roberto  d'aubuisson, who was cited by the Truth Commission as the  organizer of the death squads, which assassinated an unspecified  number of individuals during the past decade for political  reasons.</p>

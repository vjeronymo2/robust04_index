			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Wace chief acts to stem IRA rumour WACE Group, the world's largest pre-press printing specialist, yesterday took the unusual step of denying it was a front for the IRA. Wace made the statement at noon after market rumours linked it with a report in the Sunday Telegraph that a listed UK company was under investigation for laundering funds for the terrorist organisation. The company's shares fell from 177p to 155p in relatively heavy trading, wiping Pounds 14.5m from its market value. After the statement, the shares recovered to close at 166p. Mr John Clegg, chief executive, said he was 'mystified' as to why some traders had associated his company with the Sunday Telegraph report, which referred to an unnamed company with an annual turnover of Pounds 200m. Wace's brokers, BZW, were routinely contacted by the Stock Exchange after the sudden drop in price. BZW informed Mr Clegg that Wace was one of several names about which traders were speculating. Mr Clegg said: 'Our group was the only one of them which saw its share price fall, so we decided to put out the statement. It was a very difficult decision.' Wace has grown rapidly by acquisition in the last six years, mainly funded from rights issues and placings. About 70 per cent of its shares are held by financial institutions. Mr Clegg said Wace had no Irish operations or directors. He has been a director of the Anglo-Irish Bank for several years, due to an historic family connection: 'My mother is Irish. I suppose we all have some Irish blood.' Wace's shares have fallen sharply from their peak of 284p last year. BZW said it again suspected that yesterday's rumour came from 'bear raiders', who at the end of last year had circulated 'totally unjustified' stories about the group.</p>

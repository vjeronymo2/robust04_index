			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Sport: The mind of Seles vs the body of Graf - Wimbledon TODAY'S singles final at Wimbledon between the top two women's seeds is the perfect climax to an absorbing fortnight. Monica Seles, 18, of Yugoslavia, the world champion, faces Steffi Graf, the 23-year-old German who is the Wimbledon title-holder and was her predecessor as world No 1. It is a battle for the world's premier title between the holder of the Australian, French and US Open titles (Seles) and the golden grand slam girl of 1988 - the two women who have dominated the world scene since the eclipse of Martina Navratilova and the retirement of Chris Evert. Graf has won five of her eight meetings against Seles, including a 6-0 6-1 fourth round victory at Wimbledon in 1989. But Seles was a frail 15-year-old then, a matchstick, all arms and legs, who had just given Graf the scare of her life in a thrilling three-set semi-final in the French championship. I well remember that day in Paris, and could see what Steffi's father, Peter, had meant when telling me three years earlier: 'I have seen a young Yugoslav kid called Seles who hits the ball with two hands both sides - she will be the one to beat.' In those days, Monica was training under Nick Bollettieri at the American's academy in Florida. Bollettieri realised that too much competition would impose too great a strain on the growing girl and encouraged Monica to perfect her early-ball attacking ground strokes in long sessions on the practice court. When Graf again beat Seles in the Brighton final at the end of 1989, a narrow 7-5 6-4 win on a fast indoor carpet, it had become apparent that the double-handed teenager hit the ball harder than any of the other leading players. The following March, the family left Bollettieri because, they felt, he was spending too much time with his other star pupil, Andre Agassi. Monica's cartoonist father, Karoly, again became Monica's coach. By May 1990, Seles needed no inducements to fire her ambitions. She had grown a full 5 ins in 12 months and now, much stronger, was covering the court with greater speed. In Berlin she beat Graf for the first time and repeated the feat a few weeks later in Paris to win her first grand slam title. Last year, Graf enjoyed two successes against Seles - on hard courts in San Antonio and on clay in Hamburg - as the two of them swapped the No 1 ranking five times. Their rivalry was growing as the younger player finally usurped Steffi's position in September by winning her first US Open crown. Four months later Seles increased her lead in ranking points by claiming a second Australian title in a tournament Graf was forced to miss because of illness. As a result, their showdown in the French final last month was more than routine. It was Graf's chance to prove that she had regained her full powers after suffering from the effects of prolonged family problems surrounding her father's private life. What a match it was. The first set went to Seles in a whirlwind of powerful two-fisted driving; the second to Graf as the German raised the level of her counter-hitting. As the fluctuating 18-game final set built towards its tail-twisting climax, with both players responding magnificently to ever greater challenges, it became apparent that we were watching a battle between two intense personalities, neither of whom could bear to admit defeat. Four times Seles was denied her win as Graf saved match points in the ninth game. Twice Seles had to hold serve to keep her hopes alive as Graf surged ahead 6-5 and 7-6. Then, when Seles at last broke Graf again to lead 8-7, her own serve was ruthlessly dismantled by an opponent who found a new level of ground stroke aggression. Immediately Seles broke again with a grunting ferocity that was almost frightening, and then served out to retain the title she held since first beating Graf two years earlier. Today, then, is a very special occasion. Graf is still smarting from the Paris defeat (which she refuses to discuss), and secretly believes that on grass she can at last lay the Seles ghost that her father had seen creeping up on their ambitions all those years ago. Graf's performance in beating Gabriela Sabatini in Thursday's semi-final was impressive, light-years ahead of her stuttering win against the same opponent in last year's final. Improved serving was the key. By creating momentum at the start of the point, Steffi was able to fire her famous forehand into the corners and could launch some well prepared net attacks. She has her Swiss coach, Heinz Gunthardt, to thank for restoring sorely-needed confidence in these crucial areas of her game. Seles, too, came through her semi-final test with flying colours. In beating the nine-times champion, Martina Navratilova, 6-2 6-7 6-4, Seles demolished the doubts about her ability to cope with a rampant volleyer on fast grass. Her return of serve was the key to her success because it never allowed Navratilova to dominate in the forecourt. Her own serve, too, though not as efficient as it had been in helping her through five matches without the loss of a set, still presented problems, and her clinical despatch of mid-court balls was as ruthless as ever. In the tense closing stages the younger player's remarkable coolness and her courage in going for risky winners turned the tables. The firmer courts this year have provided a higher bounce than usual and make it possible for the ground stroke artists to hold their own against the power servers, as Andre Agassi has proved along with Seles. It should be a fascinating confrontation. Graf is undoubtedly the finest natural athlete in the game, while Seles has the sharpest mind. All will depend on their ability to produce their best shots when it really matters. Seles will attempt to apply the pressure on service return and from mid-court. Graf will try to unleash her deadly forehand. But unless Graf can keep her serves and drives really deep she will be out-hit by the fiercest ground strokes the women's game has seen. Fasten your seat belts. We could be in for a bumpy ride.</p>

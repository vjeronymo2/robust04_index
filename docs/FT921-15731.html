			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Engineering a solution THESE ARE dark days for the UK engineering industry. It is beset by a recession, the severity of which took most companies by surprise, and frustrated that the government's mishandling of macro-economic policy is forcing it once more to fight for its survival. The industry also accuses the government of failing to provide a supportive long-term framework for investment, research and training. The substance to this charge is more difficult to judge and more central to any assessment of whether the relationship between the public and private sectors needs reform. A report to be discussed today by the National Economic Development Council should be an opportunity to float new ideas on how the government and the industry might work together. Unfortunately it is as revealing about Nedo's shortcomings as it is about the weaknesses of the engineering industry. The report is good on its analysis of the industry's record: strong increases in productivity and relative reductions in labour costs have not been matched by improvements in profitability, investment and innovation. The industry is still handicapped by a huge skills deficit. But Nedo's policy prescriptions are a feeble restatement of conventional wisdom. It presents sensible recommendations for how government and industry might more effectively identify and promulgate world class standards of management, training and manufacturing systems. Consensus This is all so uncontroversial that the government can and no doubt will claim it is already doing much of it. Yet there is no indication that these measures will play a critical role in enabling the industry to meet the competitive challenge it faces from its continental and Far Eastern competitors. It fails to exploit the way the market for ideas could be opening up a year after Mrs Thatcher's departure. Nedo still sees its role as creating a consensus between political parties, employers and unions over issues such as industrial policy and training. It was so battered by Thatcherism that it could only survive by becoming timidly uncontroversial. It has, in a word, been marginalised. Building consensus over policy is not the problem it was in the 1980s. The main political parties are increasingly converging on economic policy. What they lack is not agreement but ideas. If Nedo's reports are to be of more value to industries such as engineering, it needs to shift focus. Right issues The starting point is to pick the right issues. If Nedo confines itself to promoting consensus between political parties, employers and trade unions, it will be limited to the terrain which the parties have chosen, for their own reasons. Instead Nedo needs constantly to point out where current policy debates are too short sighted or closed; a confident government would welcome a more unruly approach. For example, the engineering report does discuss the problem for aerospace companies of falling defence spending; but it is mute or timid upon more controversial issues such as science policy and standard setting. Second, Nedo should audit the effectiveness of policy. The widespread concern within the engineering industry over the way training has been disrupted by the creation of Training and Enterprise Councils is not reflected in this report. The report is bland and predictable where it should have a critical edge. Third, it should expand the imagination of policy makers by provoking new ideas. In engineering this could have meant looking at the future of innovation policy; the impact on industrial relations of the proposed merger of the industry's two main unions, the engineering union, AEU, and the electricians union, EETPU; the way that utility regulation and public procurement might affect supplying industries; and the way policies on inward investment might be developed to attract more research and design facilities. Nedo needs to move out of the shadow of Thatcherism. It needs to agitate the policy debate, not send it to sleep.</p>

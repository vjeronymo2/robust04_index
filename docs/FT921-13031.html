			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Heseltine hints at legislation - Poll Tax Non-payment THERE were signs last night that the government was ready to take urgent action to legislate in response to pressure to ease confusion surrounding the use of computer evidence in poll tax cases. The uncertainty threatens to deprive local authorities of any realistic possibility of recovering outstanding poll tax. The increasing difficulties about computer evidence come as the poll tax is emerging as a critical election issue. Its political profile is likely to raise even higher in the coming weeks, as more local authorities set their budgets for the coming year. Camden Council in north London called on the government to 'act now to end the poll tax chaos', after a decision yesterday by the Clerkenwell stipendiary magistrate that the council was not allowed to rely on computer records as evidence of non-payment in default actions against 12 Camden residents. 'We shall review the situation most urgently and come forward with the answers very shortly. Obviously it requires a legislative decision. The government has to decide how to act in the circumstances,' Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, said last night on Channel Four news. Ministers are aware, however, that if they legislate to close the loophole in the law, they will effectively admit that it exists, casting doubt on the validity of 5m poll tax cases dealt with since April 1990. Meanwhile, Labour highlighted the continuing sensitivity of the Poll Tax by stepping up claims that ministers were considering delaying sending out bills. Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, challenged ministers to say whether the requirement for those on low incomes to pay a minimum 20 per cent contribution to the poll tax would be removed in the Budget. Ministers, who attacked opposition MPs for involvement in non-payment campaigns, have ruled out fundamental changes to the poll tax, and the government emphasised yesterday that those required to pay the minimun contribution were given the money to do so through social security benefits. Labour, however, remain convinced that the government intends in some way to soften the impact of the tax in its final year.</p>

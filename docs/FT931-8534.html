			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading BARGAIN hunting, together with the release of favourable UK retail sales figures, boosted trading in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo. The poor opening of trading in the March contract on the FT-SE at 2,794 followed the continued overnight falls on Wall Street, and initially led dealers to believe a dull and quiet session lay ahead. By 9am the contract had declined to 2,788, which proved to be the day's low. However, a feeling that Tuesday's falls had been overdone soon took hold and caused a turnround in the fortunes of March as independent traders, followed by some of the bigger securities houses, went bargain hunting. The renewed buying gathered momentum with the release of buoyant retail sales figures and continued into the afternoon, with the quiet opening on Wall Street a relief to many traders. The day's high of 2,827 was reached at around 3pm but was quickly followed by a bout of profit-taking. The March contract closed at 2,815, up 17 from Tuesday's poor finish and at a small discount to the underlying cash market. Turnover was 11,253 lots. In traded options, volume totalled 32,790 contracts, of which 14,586 were in the FT-SE 100 option and 1,416 in the Euro FT-SE option. BP was the busiest stock option with 1,761 lots transacted, followed by BT with 1,563. Glaxo and BTR were also active.</p>

			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / International Company News: Carrefour sells catering arm CARREFOUR, one of France's largest food retailing and hypermarket groups, has sold its catering division, Eris Restauration, to Phenix Richelieu, an investment company. The disposal, for an undisclosed sum, comes as Carrefour's retailing activities are under pressure due to the economic slowdown in France. Consumer spending has been hit by concern about rising unemployment and the impact of high real interest rates. Mr Michel Bon this autumn resigned as Carrefour's chairman after reporting a sharp fall in interim profits. Earlier Mr Jacques Fournier, his successor, said November sales had been 'the worst in the company's history'. He also warned that Carrefour's chances of meeting its forecast of a 10 per cent profit growth this year - from FFr1.21bn (Dollars 224m) on sales of FFr100.38bn in 1991 - would be entirely dependent on the pattern of December trading. The disposal of Eris will provide capital for Carrefour and enable the management team to concentrate on its core retail interests. Eris, which owns France's fourth largest chain of cafeterias and four fast food outlets, is expected to record sales of FFr400m this year. Phenix Richelieu is linked to Banque du Phenix, part of the Assurances Generales de France insurance group, and the Societe Marseillaise de Credit bank.</p>

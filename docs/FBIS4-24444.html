			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong 23 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--The State  Administration for Industry and Commerce has recently adopted  measures to tighten the supervision and investigation of  foreign-funded enterprises' capital contributions.    The measures stipulate that enterprises in this category  with  registered capital up to and including $2 million should  contribute the whole sum within six months after the operational  license is issued. Those with registered capital between $2  million and $5 million inclusive should contribute the whole sum  within a year after the issuance of their operational licenses,  and those with a registered capital between $5 million and $10  million inclusive should contribute the whole sum within two  years after the issuance of operational licenses. Those with a  registered capital ranging from $10 million to $30 million  inclusive may have the deadline appropriately extended according  to their conditions, with the approval of the organizations in  charge of examination and approval and the organizations in  charge of registration. If enterprises violate the regulations  of the departments in charge of registration, these departments  may directly decide to suspend their operating licenses.    The new measures also provide:    It is totally unacceptable for the Chinese side in a  foreign-funded joint venture to contribute the registered  capital on its foreign partner's behalf. When the organizations  in charge of registration discover that this has occurred, these  cases will be handled as failures to contribute capital. If the  Chinese side in a joint venture is found to have provided  foreign investors with nominal shares as a reward or has  borrowed the name or materials of some foreign businessmen to  deceitfully acquire an operating license, as soon as the case is  verified, the joint venture's license should be suspended and  the appropriate penalty should be meted out according to the  relevant laws and decrees.    State-owned enterprises that use their stock assets to apply  for running joint ventures or enterprises in cooperation with  foreign business enterprises should simultaneously submit the  Chinese side's asset evaluation reports, which must be certified  by the administration of state assets.    For joint ventures in which a foreign partner invests by  providing equipment or other goods in kind, the real prices of  the equipment and goods must be explicitly stated in the  contract, which must be certified by an intermediary notary  authority acceptable to the two sides.    When a central-level enterprise sells shares to foreign  firms  or uses part or all of its state-owned stock assets to launch  joint ventures or cooperate with foreign firms, it must submit  documents to the relevant state department for examination. At  this moment, no approvals or registrations will be granted to  the local authorities who want to use the stock assets of the  state enterprises -- the enterprises operating a single trade or  running a business which incorporates various trades -- to  launch joint-venture projects with foreign firms. For the  projects of this type that are already in existence, a good job  should be done of weeding them out in coordination with the  organizations in charge of examination and approval.    In the contracts submitted by joint ventures with Chinese  and  foreign investment or cooperative enterprises, if there are  clauses which violate the principle of shared interest and  responsibility for running risks, separately provide guarantees  for investment loans according to the investment proportion of  the two sides involved, or make the Chinese side guarantee  profit rates of foreign investment through loans, bonds or other  instruments, the organizations in charge of registration are  authorized to require the parties involved in joint ventures to  revise them according to the stipulations of state laws and  decrees; otherwise, their examination and registration will not  be granted.    Figures from economic circles have indicated that these  measures presented by China primarily target the low rate of  foreign capital actually contributed; presently, the foreign  capital contributed as investment in China accounts for only 20  percent or so of the negotiated amount.</p>

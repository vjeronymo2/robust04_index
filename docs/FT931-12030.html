			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Burton in Pounds 163m cash call to pay for face-lift BURTON GROUP, the clothing retailer, yesterday became the sixth UK company this week to launch a rights issue, with a call on shareholders for Pounds 163m. The company wants the cash to reduce its Pounds 324.6m net debt and finance a face-lift for most of its 1,800 stores. The announcement brings the total sought from shareholders this week to Pounds 714m, including a Pounds 347m issue from Asda, the supermarket chain, and a Pounds 144m cash call from Wessex Water. Burton's one-for-four rights issue at 60p is its second call on shareholders in 19 months. The previous Pounds 161m share issue, one-for-one at 30p, rescued the group after huge writedowns in its property portfolio. Mr John Hoerner, chief executive, said yesterday: 'The last one was damage repair. This one makes it possible for us to explore opportunities.' Mr Hoerner was promoted a year ago from Burton's Debenhams department store chain to lead the group's revival. Mr Steve Oldfield, an analyst with Smith New Court, said the issue would 'provide the financial foundation to develop a store base which will provide recovery. I think they have timed it very acutely.' Burton's shares, which have risen from 30 1/2 p since September, yesterday slipped 2 1/2 p to close at 72 1/2 p. The proceeds are expected to enable Burton to finance a three-year refurbishment programme for its shops - including Top Shop, Dorothy Perkins and Principles. Mr Hoerner said about two-thirds of the group's space was in need of a face-lift. More than half of the stores had not been refurbished for at least six years. The cost of the programme would be about Pounds 130m at today's prices. Mr Richard North, finance director, said the rights issue would leave the company with a controllable debt, even after capital expenditure plans. Analysts are forecasting that Burton will achieve about Pounds 30m pre-tax profits for the year to August 29. Debt is estimated to be Pounds 240m by the year-end. About Pounds 150m would relate to the group's property portfolio. On those forecasts, operating cash flow is expected to be roughly neutral. Burton forecast an unchanged interim dividend of 1p. Members of Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, have called off a strike planned for today at branches of Burton Menswear and Top Man shops. An agreement was reached between management and the union at the High Court yesterday to hold talks next week at Acas, the arbitration service. The dispute is over job losses and bargaining rights.

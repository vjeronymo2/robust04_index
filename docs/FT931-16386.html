			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Supermarkets have good season's sales TESCO and Kwik Save, the grocery chains, said yesterday they had traded well over Christmas. They added to the growing belief among industry observers that December was better than expected for food retailers. Mr David Reid, finance director of Tesco, said the group had seen like-for-like sales growth in its existing stores of 1.5 per cent, and total sales growth, including new stores, of 9.5 per cent, over the four weeks to January 2. That was a 1-point improvement on the 8.5 per cent sales growth disclosed by the company in its interim results in September. Analysts said Tesco's announcement followed reports of like-for-like sales growth of between 4 per cent and 5 per cent for J. Sainsbury; 3 per cent for Argyll - owner of the Safeway chain - and 6.5 per cent for Wm Morrison. Gateway is also believed to have surpassed its budget. 'From our point of view, it's very good news,' Mr Reid said. He added that the figures would help to dispel rumours that performance had been disappointing at Tesco's new stores. Mr Reid added: 'But we would not want to over-hype things as to whether recovery is on the way. You can get flurries at Budget time and at Christmas.' Mr Bill Currie, analyst with brokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said: 'It does seem that food retailers saw a general pick-up over Christmas.' BZW has upgraded its 1992 pre-tax profit forecasts for Tesco from Pounds 570m to Pounds 580m, and for J. Sainsbury from Pounds 735m to Pounds 740m. Mr Keith Lovell, group finance and planning director with Kwik Save, the discount food chain, said Christmas trading had been 'satisfactory, up to expectations'. Stock Exchange, Page 32</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["kr"-signed report: "Equal Rights With Europeans"] </F>   [Text] Frankfurt/Main -- Subsidiaries of U.S. banks in  Germany can expect regulations to relax considerably in the  future. The Association of Foreign Banks reports that the  Finance Ministry has completed a regulation based on an  agreement between the governments and banking supervisory boards  of the United States and Germany. This will give U.S. banks much  the same rights as banks from European Union [EU] countries.  The Association thinks that this regulation might guide other  non-EU countries as well.    The Association of Foreign Banks, which has advocated  extending the EU model to other non-European banks for some  time, points out that U.S. banks will continue to be subject to  approval and control by the Federal Banking Supervisory Board.  The banks will, however, no longer be required to support risk  assets by capital.    In the field of big loans, European regulations must be  observed, which limit the risk for the individual debtor to 25  percent of the bank's capital resources. What remains in force  is the (costly) annual audit and a minimum capital of ECU5  million per subsidiary, which, according to the association, is,  however, insignificant in terms of banking supervision.</p>

			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> IN DEBT, OREGON MAY QUIT PAC-10  </P> <P> The University of Oregon will be forced to decide whether to leave the Pacific  10 Conference unless the state helps cover its athletic department deficit, the  school's president says.  </P> <P> University President Myles Brand said Thursday it would be better for Oregon to  drop intercollegiate athletics than join a less prestigious conference.  </P> <P> He said Oregon's membership in the Pac-10 is "the most important affiliation we  have as an academic institution."  </P> <P> Brand's comments were among the first intended to persuade the state Board of  Higher Education to seek state funds to help eliminate a combined deficit of $6  million in the athletic department budgets at Oregon, Oregon State University  and Portland State University. The board is expected to take up the issue when  it meets next week.  </P> <P> The Oregon athletic department projects an accumulated deficit of $1.8 million  at the end of this month, school officials said.  </P></p>

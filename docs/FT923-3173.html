			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / People: Philip Chappell decides to retire from AITC Philip Chappell, a well known merchant banker who has tried his hand at several different jobs, is to retire as director of the Association of Investment Trust Companies in November, after several months of serious illness. Chappell, 63, joined Morgan Grenfell in 1954 and spent over 20 years as a director. He was chairman of the National Ports Council between 1971 and 1977 and in 1980 spent a brief spell as chairman of computer makers ICL. However, over the past few years he has switched from being a merchant banker to being a tireless campaigner for popular capitalism. His main interests have been wider share ownership, personal pensions and of course investment trusts, having joined the AITC in 1986. Chappell says he has been gradually recovering over the past few months and is still bubbling with ideas for the savings market. The chances are that he will continue as a regular correspondent on the FT's letters page. Although Chappell only worked at the AITC around two days a week, the association is set to advertise for a full-time director general to replace him. ***** Kiyohiko Ito has been appointed md of KONICA BUSINESS MACHINES (UK). ***** Andrew Tansley has been appointed a director of the TUSSAUDS GROUP. He had been general manager of Madame Tussaud Scenerama, Amsterdam. ***** Maurice Wood moves from Hillsdown's Maple Leaf Foods to become md of TIBBETT &amp; BRITTEN Group South Africa, formed to acquire South African Warehousing Services, and Martin Peters is promoted to become its operations director. ***** John Taylor has been appointed deputy md of YORKSHIRE WATER SERVICES.</p>

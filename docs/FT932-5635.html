			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Gaidar to foster reform effort MR YEGOR GAIDAR, the former prime minister who launched market reforms in Russia, is to help fund and organise reform-minded candidates in next year's parliamentary elections, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow. He said yesterday that the new Association of Privatised and Private Businesses, of which he is president, would promote the political interests of a new class of property owners, as well as help former state-owned enterprises operate like market-driven companies elsewhere in the world. Mr Pyotr Filippov, the association's vice-president, said it would try to substitute for Russia's lack of strong political parties by rallying qualified candidates around a single reformist bloc to produce 'a pro-market, anti-inflationary parliament'.</p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Warning on performance rises: Recommendations of the public-sector pay review bodies - Doctors and dentists THE review body for doctors and dentists warned about the difficulties of introducing performance-related pay as it recommended rises of 5.5 per cent for all of the group covered except general dental practitioners (GDPs) who were awarded 8.5 per cent. It said it was concerned about government plans to constrain money available for performance-related pay after health-service officials said they would not be looking to 'fund pay flexibility' from outside recommended general increases The review body said the incentive impact of performance-pay schemes would be weakened if they were seen as being automatically set against future pay rises. Its recommendations will mean a 6 per cent rise in the pay bill for 106,000 doctors and dentists at a cost of Pounds 314m. In recommending an increase of 8.5 per cent for GDPs, the review body said it took into account the business difficulties experienced by practices and the evidence of an increased workload under a new contract. It also noted the trend in the values of pensions and fringe packages which showed GDPs at a particular disadvantage to comparable professions outside the health service. In spite of the review body's recommendations the British Medical Association said that doctors would see average earnings rise by only 3 per cent because of a clawback of money paid this year which resulted from targets being exceeded. It is understood that some dentists will suffer a similar effect. The review body's recommendations would take the average net remuneration of a general medical practitioner to Pounds 40,010 from April 1 and that of general dental practitioners to Pounds 35,815. Review Body on Doctors' and Dentists Remuneration, HMSO. Pounds 7.70.</p>

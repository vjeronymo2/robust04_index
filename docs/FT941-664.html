			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Holliday pays Pounds 52m for Reckitt's Blue division Holliday Chemical, the industrial dyes company which went public last year, is buying one of Britain's oldest chemicals businesses from Reckitt &amp; Colman, the consumer products group. Holliday is paying Pounds 52m for Reckitt Colours International which has been making synthetic ultramarine for use in clothes laundering since 1883. Based in Hull, where Isaac Reckitt first started making washing blue in the 1850s, RCI now supplies mainly industrial markets, particularly for use in colouring plastics. Reckitt &amp; Colman said the disposal was in line with its strategy of concentrating on consumer goods. Most of RCI's 'laundry grade' product goes to a separate Reckitt division which will continue to sell laundry blue under the Reckitt's Blue and Robin Blue brands. The latter is a leading brand in India. Demand has dried up in the developed world because of the introduction of other whiteners in washing powders. Holliday is funding the acquisition largely by a one-for-four rights issue at 180p, raising a net Pounds 36m. Mr Michael Peagram, chairman, said he first approached Reckitt about the business four years ago and a deal was nearly agreed last November. But Holliday was forced to pull out after its shares slumped following a profit warning. The shares have since recovered allowing the deal to proceed. 'I would have been very peeved if we had missed it,' said Mr Peagram. The original plan for a rights issue of convertible preference shares was scrapped last week as market yields rose. But Mr Peagram stressed that the deal would still enhance Holliday's earnings per share. RCI made a Pounds 6.2m pre-tax on sales of Pounds 29.4m last year and Holliday is paying only 12.5 times historic earnings. Its shares fell 9p to 201p. After the write-off of goodwill Holliday's pro forma gearing will rise to 65 per cent but Mr Peagram said it could still afford to make another Pounds 20m acquisition without issuing more shares. He ruled out a further rights issue before the end of this year.</p>

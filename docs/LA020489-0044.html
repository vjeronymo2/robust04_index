			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRAN TO FOCUS ON REVIVING DEVASTATED ECONOMY  </P> <P> Recovering from eight years of fighting, Iran will devote the second decade of  its Islamic revolution to rebuilding the war-devastated nation, Parliament  Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani said Friday.  </P> <P> Addressing tens of thousands of worshipers at Tehran University, Rafsanjani  said the next decade of the fundamentalist-led Islamic revolution will be "the  decade of construction and economic independence."  </P> <P> He said war-devastated Iran has "all the potential needed to step in that  direction," Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency quoted him as saying.  </P> <P> Iran this week began celebrating the 10th year of its Islamic revolution and  the return to Tehran from exile of Iran's supreme leader, the Ayatollah  Ruhollah Khomeini. It was the first time in eight years the celebration was not  held under the shadow of combat and followed the August cease-fire with Iraq.  </P> <P> Two senior Iranian officials echoed Rafsanjani's call for economic  reconstruction.  </P> <P> Central Bank Governor Majid Qasemi said Iran is on the verge of economic  revival and will borrow from abroad to finance viable projects. It was the  first time in almost a decade that a senior official confirmed that Tehran will  solicit large loans from Western money markets.  </P> <P> Earlier, Oil Minister Gholamreza Aghazadeh said in New York that his country  plans to raise $3 billion in foreign loans in the next five years to set up  "revenue-producing projects," the news agency of the Organization of Petroleum  Exporting Countries reported Friday. The report was monitored in Manama,  Bahrain.  </P> <P> Khomeini had banned such loans when he took power and established an Islamic  regime.  </P> <P> Iran almost entirely self-financed its war with Iraq, while the Baghdad  government remains heavily in debt, especially to Arab Persian Gulf states and  Japanese banks.  </P> <P> Aghazadeh added that Iran is close to agreement with the Soviet Union on the  export of Iranian natural gas once a price has been agreed upon.  </P> <P> The absence of ties with the United States has pushed Iran to develop closer  economic links with Moscow and its East European allies.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 2 May (PL) -- Cuba is preparing to exert  itself to the utmost and achieve better results in the current  sugar harvest, within the framework of a national effort the  priorities of which also include placing the economy on sound  footing.    The immediate goal of that effort, according to an editorial  published today by the weekly TRABAJADORES, is to combine during  May and June the cutting and processing of all the available  sugar cane with a sowing effort that has been termed colossal,  as well as to carry out extensive cleaning of the sugar cane  fields before spring.    In an effort to use existing manpower to its maximum  capacity, men and machinery will be transferred from various  provinces to other territories so that they can complete the  harvest in their places of operation, to cutting down and  processing all of the sugar cane.    The newspaper, published by the Central Organization of  Cuban  Trade Unions [CTC], explained that this will be a concerted  effort among forces and teams that have achieved the highest  yield and discipline. It will include tens of thousands of  workers, while other contingents will devote themselves to  sowing, fertilizing, and manual cutting.    The newspaper tells the country that it is necessary to win  in the current sugar cane harvest and adds that the goal is to  surpass the last harvest's production by several thousand tons,  thus starting the agriculture industry's recovery.    Decisions on these matters are occurring at the same time as  deputies of the National Assembly of the People's Government  (parliament) are discussing the general guidelines of a package  of measures designed to end the country's financial imbalance  and decrease the amount of excess currency in circulation, thus  restoring the value of salaries.    TRABAJADORES says that, aside from being the country's  leading source of revenue, sugar production is also a measure of  the country's heartbeat. The current sugar harvest is vital to  halting what it terms the depression afflicting the national  economy.    It added: This will be an indicator of Cuban capacity for  countering enormous shortages and difficulties that now exist.    Within this strategy, Cuba intends to have within the next  few years the necessary raw materials to achieve former levels  of sugar production. But in 1994 it defines its eventual  success only as a harvest which surpasses that of 1993, which  was 4.2 million tons.    The state of mind which prevails among workers who  participate in the sugar battle is at its highest, the CTC  publication's editorial concludes.</p>

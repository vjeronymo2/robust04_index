			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Social costs plea by machine tool makers EUROPEAN machine tool manufacturers yesterday called for a European Community industrial and trade policy to deal with the industry's deep-seated structural problems, Andrew Baxter reports from Hanover. They unveiled a five-point plan aimed at correcting 'flagrant imbalances' between Europe, Japan and the US, according to Mr Yves de Boisfleury, president of Cecimo, the umbrella body for Europe's machine tool organisations. It was launched on the second day of EMO, the world's largest machine tool fair, in Hanover. Production of machine tools in the 12 Cecimo countries has fallen from a peak of SFr27.2bn (Pounds 12.5bn) in 1990 to SFr22.6bn last year. Employment in the industry has fallen by 32,000 to about 167,000 in two years. The Cecimo document says competitiveness is mainly influenced by the social costs that industry must pay. It says a comparison of hourly costs in Germany, Japan and the US shows a disparity of 27 per cent in favour of Japan and 37 per cent in favour of the US. Cecimo says this position is untenable in the short and medium term. It also says methods should be devised to enable industrialists to keep under contract the maximum number of personnel during a period of recession so that the industry is fully equipped for recovery. Its three other recommendations are: An EC study that should produce concrete proposals for stimulating specialised training for technicians; The urgent establishment of a specific research and development programme in European manufacturing, adapted to the needs and means of small to medium-sized companies A strong trade policy to maintain the European machine tool industry's competitiveness. This means 'a positive and rapid conclusion of the Gatt negotiations and a co-ordinated policy to promote exports'.</p>

			<p><P> June 26, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: MEDIA / KEVIN BRASS;  </P> <P> SAGON PENN SURFACES IN NEW LEGAL HASSLE: TUCK'S DIVORCE  </P> <P> Sagon Penn's name continues to pop up in the strangest places, evidenced by its  appearance in the divorce papers of Channel 10 newsman Michael Tuck.  </P> <P> A clause in the otherwise typical divorce agreement, reached last year,  stipulates that any profits Tuck receives from an NBC miniseries on Penn will  be donated to charity. If Tuck doesn't give the money to charity, the court  retains jurisdiction to divide the property, according to the agreement.  </P> <P> "I've never heard of a miniseries being part of a divorce," the program's  producer, Stockton Briggle, said with a laugh.  </P> <P> Briggle is the producer of the recent television movies "A Bridge to Silence"  and "The Alamo: 13 Days to Glory." In 1987 he struck a development deal with  NBC and dispatched two writers, Travis Clark and Steve Duncan, to San Diego to  research the Penn story.  </P> <P> In 1985, Penn, a young black man, shot two San Diego police officers and a  civilian ride-a-long, killing one of the officers. After his attorney argued  that Penn was defending himself from a racially motivated attack, Penn was  acquitted in two trials that struck the raw nerve of racial tension in San  Diego.  </P> <P> The two writers gave Briggle an outline for a 4-hour miniseries on Penn, and  the movie deal has lain relatively dormant since then. But it is not dead.  </P> <P> The program is still on NBC's production schedule, said Briggle, who is  producing the program in conjunction with Fries Entertainment, producers of  recent television docudramas on Lyndon Johnson and the Hillside Strangler case.  Briggle said he is looking for a new writer for the project, after Clark and  Duncan were called away from the project to work on a television series, "A Man  Called Hawk."  </P> <P> Although Briggle has discussed paying key players for their cooperation, he has  not signed any of the principals to contracts.  </P> <P> "We have maintained a close relationship with some of the principals," Briggle  said, with the notable exceptions of Donovan Jacobs, the officer accused by  Penn of initiating the confrontation, and Colleen Riggs, the wife of slain  policeman Thomas Riggs.  </P> <P> Briggle's representatives contacted Tuck, along with most people involved in  the case, in 1987, seeking cooperation in the development of "The Sagon Penn  Story." Tuck, who often supported Penn's story in his "Perspective" segments,  made it clear at the time that any money paid him for his cooperation would  have to be donated to charity, if indeed he received any money at all. The  clause was put into the divorce agreement at the insistence of his ex-wife's  attorney, Tuck said, in case he changed his mind about donating any profits to  charity, something he said he has no intention of doing.  </P> <P> Tuck says the producers were talking about "$50,000 or $75,000" for his help,  figures Briggle says are "optimistic."  </P> <P> Since most of the story already has been played out in San Diego courtrooms,  making it part of the public domain, it may not be necessary to pay any of the  principals, Briggle said.  </P> <P> The movie he envisions would not seek to portray Penn as a hero, or to  concentrate on the racial overtones of the case, Briggle said. He's fascinated  by the vastly different perceptions people have of the same incident.  </P> <P> "There are so many stories of so many things gone wrong," Briggle said.  "There's Sagon Penn, who was going to apply for a job with the Police  Department. There's Donovan Jacobs, who was doing his job to the best of his  ability as he saw it. There's (former San Diego Police Lt.) Doyle Wheeler, who  felt he had to tell the truth as he saw it. (Wheeler testified against Jacobs  and later was injured by a gunshot to the head in his new home in Seattle in a  still-unexplained incident.) There are a lot of broken lives in this.  </P> <P> "There are no good guys or bad guys; there are vast areas of gray here."  </P> <P> Since it was never his intent to portray Penn as a "big hero," Briggle said  Penn's recent legal troubles -- initially charged with suspicion of attempted  murder after a confrontation with his ex-girlfriend's boyfriend, he has been  charged with misdemeanor battery -- would not affect the project.  </P> <P> "It's just more ripples in the pool," Briggle said, adding that once a writer  is found, the project should "gel very quickly."  </P> <P> Want your restaurant to be featured on a "Sun Up" cooking segment? It's not  hard. Just buy a commercial on the morning program. KFMB-TV (Channel 8)  recently sent a letter to restaurants inviting them to participate in the  morning show's cooking segment, in conjunction with "an inexpensive broadcast  schedule," i.e. paid commercials. Channel 8 has a "full service production  department to aid in the development of a strong, memorable commercial to  coincide with your Sun-Up cooking segment." The quid pro quo offer is new,  according to Channel 8 local sales manager Randy Bixler. "You have to  understand, it's a select invitation list," he said, declining to specify how  many restaurants were "invited.". . .  </P> <P> XTRA-AM (690) producer Jackie Gladfelter put together a list of more than 100  names, ranging from President Bush to Don Rickles, as possible guests for Steve  Garvey's new morning show, which debuts this morning. Garvey's office approved  all of the names except one -- "Today" show host Bryant Gumbel. Apparently  Gumbel and Garvey don't get along. . . .  </P> <P> The BBC has purchased the rights to air "Break of Dawn," the locally produced  biography of Pedro Gonzalez, the first Spanish-speaking radio star in Los  Angeles who was falsely imprisoned for rape after challenging the local  bureaucracy. . . .  </P> <P> Officials at XTRA-FM (91X) proudly talk of the station's call letters appearing  on tickets for the Who, part of the station's exclusive deal to promote the  group's August concert in San Diego. Indeed, the station's logo will be on the  front of all the tickets, including 20,000 commemorative tickets specially  printed for the event. But the rest of the tickets will also bear the logo of  another station -- KIFM (98.1). The jazz station's name appears on the back of  all Ticketmaster tickets. . . .  </P> <P> Beginning this morning the 91X morning team of Russ T. Nailz and Katy Manor  won't have to drive to Tijuana anymore. They will be broadcasting from San  Diego, under the provisions of a special permit which allows the Mexican-based  station, owned by San Diego-based Noble Broadcast, to send signals from San  Diego to Mexico for broadcasting. XTRA has used the permit for the AM side, and  now it is extending it to include the 91X morning team, but not the other 91X  shows. "We're going to see how it works out," XTRA Chief Operating Officer Norm  Feuer said, refusing to elaborate. . . .  </P> <P> Funding for the Soviet Arts Festival may be moving right along, but last week  the city moved to cut funds for several social programs, including a grant to  KPBS' reading service for the blind. Last year, the city gave the reading  service $10,000, about one-tenth of its budget. This year the reading service  asked for $20,000 and received nothing. "We're kind of stunned about it,"  reading service director Donna Warren said. Though new revenue sources will  have to be found, she doesn't expect any changes in the service. Currently  there are 90 people on the service's waiting list for receivers.  </P></p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / International Company News: New Banca Nazionale del Lavoro chairman The Ciampi government has moved to prevent the void from growing at the helm of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, Italy's biggest state-controlled commercial bank, by naming as the new chairman Mr Mario Sarcinelli, an EBRD vice-president. Mr Sarcinelli will be replacing Mr Gianpiero Cantoni, who temporarily suspended himself on February 7. Mr Cantoni was forced to step down following the disclosure of a Bank of Italy inspection that revealed a potential conflict of interest between his approving BNL loans that allegedly benefited one of his family owned businesses. However, Mr Cantoni is still refusing to formally resign. Mr Sarcinelli's departure came as a surprise at the EBRD, where he is the number three in the organisation. His colleagues on the executive committee were not told until 6pm last night, after the Italian government had released the news in Italy about his appointment. The bank's operations were restructured at the end of last year and Mr Sarcinelli took charge of the new southern division, making investments and developing infrastructure in the more backward countries in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.</p>

			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / The Markets: A world without Treasury bonds - Global Investor Next month, America's newly triumphant Republicans will seek to amend the US constitution to make it illegal for the government to borrow money. The permanently balanced budget is an old dream of the right in more countries than the US, and few give this latest attempt even a fighting chance. But these are strange times, and it pays to allow for contingencies. From an investor's point of view, what would a world without Treasury bonds actually look like? To begin with, it would not happen all at once. The Republicans' plans are still imprecise, but the general notion seems to be a steady reduction of the budget deficit to zero over the next decade or so. Further borrowing would then be outlawed, and any occasional surpluses would be used to pay off the backlog. This would presumably take several decades again. At present, the total of US Treasury bonds outstanding is about Dollars 3,500bn. Annual issuance, net of redemptions, is about Dollars 175bn. These numbers, big as they are, need to be put in context. US Treasuries are the classic international investment, and global savings run at about Dollars 3,000bn a year. The annual supply of T-bonds, in fact, soaks up only a small part of the cash looking for a home. All the same, Dollars 3,500bn is a lot of money. If T-bonds did disappear, the market would require them to be replaced by some other instrument as like them as possible. A number of financial institutions have long-term cash liabilities which they need to match with long-term, fixed-rate assets. The obvious candidates to fill the gap are corporations. At present, most companies use equity and bank finance more often than they would like; logically, fixed-rate bonds would make their long-range planning a lot simpler. But they tend to be crowded out by governments, which can command lower yields. Take the government out of the equation, and the yields on corporate bonds would decline to the level at which long-term savers could persuade corporate borrowers to provide an alternative home for their money. Much of this would presumably represent new capital for companies, rather than a replacement for old. After all, investors would still demand equities as before, and banks would still need to lend. As Mr John Lipsky, Salomon's chief economist, suggests, the result would be a sharp rise in capital expenditure by corporations, accompanied by a lowering of their required rates of return on investment to reflect the changed cost of capital. The resulting investment landscape might look familiar to the historian of the late 19th century. Mr David Hale of Kemper Financial points out that in the decades following the Civil War, the US government punctiliously repaid its borrowings. By the 1890s there was no US public debt left: so British savers, for instance, had to resort to financing US railroads and factories instead, with sometimes patchy results. How corporations would spend their money this time round is an open question. It seems fair to assume, though, that faced with an abundance of capital, they would continue to substitute capital for labour. There have been huge advances in manufacturing productivity in recent years. Much remains to be done in the service sector. The next obvious question is how many of the people whose labour is replaced can be usefully re-employed. At this point, what might otherwise seem a wholly benign process turns potentially ugly. One need not be a Republican hawk to concede that for global savings to be allocated by Adam Smith's invisible hand, rather than by civil servants, is likely to improve economic efficiency. But corporations are not in the business of providing safety nets. What happens if the invisible hand throws people out of work, while at the same time civil servants are deprived of the funds to help the unemployed? There are other pressures in the same direction. As Mr Lipsky argues, governments - take Italy as an example - will eventually have to face the fact that their unfunded liabilities in pensions and other benefits represent an unsustainable burden on future generations. The obvious answer is to privatise those liabilities, so that people take upon themselves the whole responsibility for their pensions or healthcare. The result of that would be a sharp rise in personal savings and a corresponding drop in government borrowing. Mr Hale takes the argument a step further. The whole idea of balancing the budget through a constitutional amendment, he argues, has a sub-plot. One of the biggest burdens on the Federal budget is the vast panoply of tax breaks and subsidies enjoyed by middle class America. Give the balanced budget constitutional teeth, says Mr Hale, and you have the means to enforce the revolutionary next step: the means testing of social security. Here again, the result is the same: higher saving, less government spending and more money for investment by the corporate sector. If America moved any distance in this direction, it would not move alone. The natural result of a systemic shift of funds away from government towards corporate investment would be higher productivity and increased competitiveness. In a world of weakening trade barriers, this competitiveness would translate into pressure on America's trading partners to follow suit. One need not regard the objectives of the Republican right as plausible, or even desirable, to find the trends they represent thought-provoking. Even a move in the direction of a balanced budget, after all, would have sizeable implications. One final investment tip from Mr Hale; three-quarters of the business on the Chicago futures exchanges is in Treasury bond futures. So if you think the Republicans are going to have their wicked way, go short of seats on the Chicago Board of Trade.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL RETURN IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO 15/12/94  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 -------------- % change over period --------------                   US    Japan   Germany   France    Italy       UK  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash   Week          0.11     0.04      0.10     0.10     0.16     0.11   Month         0.45     0.19      0.42     0.45     0.69     0.47   Year          3.75     1.88      5.25     5.63     8.13     5.06  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year   Week          0.27     0.23     -0.13    -0.76    -0.73     0.17   Month         0.08     0.96      0.02    -0.17    -0.20     0.57   Year         -2.58    -1.09     -0.12    -1.38     0.64    -1.19  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year   Week          0.22     0.35     -0.58    -0.87    -1.11     0.36   Month         0.85     1.25     -0.06     0.79    -0.82     1.18   Year         -5.52    -3.54     -4.53    -7.15    -6.70    -5.51  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Equities   Week           1.1     -1.6      -1.3     -1.7     -3.7     -2.1   Month         -2.9     -1.7      -4.2     -2.1     -8.8     -5.7   Year           0.8      3.7      -5.3     -7.7     -1.0     -6.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Cash &amp; Bonds - Lehman Brothers.

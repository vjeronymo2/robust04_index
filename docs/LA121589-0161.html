			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STILL SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE AT CABLE SHOW;  </P> <P> MARKETING: THE ZESTINESS ONCE ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXHIBITION IS GONE. THE  INDUSTRY IS TOO LARGE TO BE CONSIDERED THE YOUNG UPSTART ANY LONGER.  </P> <P> Howie Mandel was over at the Showtime exhibit, joking about his days as a  salesman in Canada. Miss December was autographing photos of herself at the  Playboy at Night booth while the Comedy Network distributed packages of  Chuckles candy.  </P> <P> But this was not enough to keep George Opacic of DCA Cablevision, the company  that provides cable TV to Rancho Cucamonga, from being a little nostalgic about  the old days of the Western Cable Show.  </P> <P> "All the glitter seems to have gone," he said.  </P> <P> It was like past shows in most respects: Cable industry executives converged in  Anaheim this week to check out new cable channels and programs, chew the fat  with friends and say terrible things about their rivals, the broadcast  networks.  </P> <P> Across the vast space of the Anaheim Convention Center, exhibitors displayed  samples of their new shows and handed out pens, breath sprays and keychains  with their logos on them while trying to sign up buyers. There also were  exhibitors selling technical equipment to cable system operators.  </P> <P> There were a lot of places where people could win something like a T-shirt by  throwing a basketball through a hoop. Nonetheless, the zestiness once  associated with the cable show was gone, a sampling of veterans said. The Wild,  Wild Western Cable Show it wasn't. The cable industry has grown too big and is  bringing in revenues too large to be considered the young upstart any longer.  Serious business was being discussed at the three-day affair, which ends today.  </P> <P> "There used to be a million new gimmicks," said Herbert L. Golden of the  Bankers Trust Company, which lends money to cable companies. "Everything was  new. It was all exciting."  </P> <P> Now, he says, because of the industry's success, the technical equipment on  display at the show offers "minor improvments" at best. No more of the  grandiose breakthroughs that have helped the industry explode. And he noted  that the mom-and-pop cable operators, who ushered in the cable era running  small outfits in their local areas, have been "folded into bigger systems." A  lot of the small operators who sold their companies "are living in Hawaii or  the Caribbean now," he said. "They made a lot of money."  </P> <P> Also noticing changes was Stephen Abram, vice president of Wellington-Ross  Insurance Services, an Encino firm that insures cable companies. "There's a lot  less flash," he said. "The business is maturing."  </P> <P> As Abram sees it, the layout on the exhibition floor is a reflection of the  business in general. "There's bigger booths," he said. "And less of them."  </P> <P> The cable operators have been been consolidating, with the smaller companies  gobbled up by the giants. Meanwhile, a different, but comparable trend has  marked the programming side, with the biggest entertainment companies adding to  their menu of cable offerings.  </P> <P> Under one roof at the cable show were MTV, Nickelodeon/Nick at Night, VH-1, the  forthcoming HA! comedy network, Showtime and The Movie Channel. All are owned  by Viacom International Inc. Ted Turner oversees the Cable News Network, CNN  Headline News, Superstation TBS and one-year-old Turner Network Television.  </P> <P> There was a pervasive feeling this year that cable had finally grown up. Cable  now reaches more than half the TV homes in America. And while the broadcast  networks' share of viewers has steadily declined in recent years, cable's  audience share has risen.  </P> <P> Still, the cable show was not exactly a stroll through a widget factory,  either. The industry still has room for entrepreneurs ready to try something  different or find an untapped niche. The people trying to launch the Sci-Fi  Channel were trying to sign up buyers. At the American Movie Classics booth,  which not only looked like a '50s diner, but actually offered pie, a trio of  waitresses crooned oldies.  </P> <P> Bravo, the highbrow network, remained true to form, displaying an exhibit of  modern art. The Weather Channel people showed lots of storm footage on their TV  monitors. Black Entertainment Television brought in Tim and Daphne Maxwell Reid  to announce that the channel had purchased reruns of "Frank's Place."  </P> <P> Perhaps the spirit that made cable what it is today was best exemplified by the  people at the Prevue Guide. At first reluctant to break their news prematurely,  they confided quietly, but proudly, that they were now reaching 15 million  viewers who could turn to their channel at any time -- to find out what was on  all the other channels.  </P></p>

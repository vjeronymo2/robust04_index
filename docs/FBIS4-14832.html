			<p>BFN     [Text] As of 4 April 1994, Lithuania will begin airing the  "Polonia" station instead of the first Polish television  channel. This decision was adopted by the Council of the Baltic  Television which relays programs of neighboring countries,  because Polish television did not resolve the copyright problem  and could not continue broadcasting its first channel, but  proposed to transmit the satellite station "Polonia."</p>

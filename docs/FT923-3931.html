			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tractor makers pay heavy price for reform THE UK tractor market is likely to decline further over the next four years as farmers realise they will have to pay the heaviest price for the reform of the European Community's common agricultural policy. A market that 20 years ago saw annual sales of 25,000 to 30,000 units has fallen sharply since 1988, when 22,521 units were sold, and will continue downwards to 13,000 units in 1996, according to a study by the London-based Corporate Intelligence Group. 'Arable farmers will be farming less land and accepting a cut in the price which they gain for their produce. Fixed costs will have to be reduced and there will be more intensive use of the available machinery by means of machinery rings and contractors,' it says. On a worst case basis, it adds, most farmers could probably farm 25 per cent more land with their available machinery. Although farm amalgamations will be slowed by recent moves to make inheritance taxes more lenient, there will still be a trend to farm in larger units, spreading good quality 'lean management' over more hectares. On the other hand, the study says, the fiscal changes will probably be relatively small and there will be ways of reducing the damage from the CAP reforms, for example by moving into other crops. The study says farmers have seen their net incomes fall every year and have become increasingly disinclined to invest for the future. With a huge pool of existing tractors to fall back on, they have to be attracted by unusual factors if they are to buy a new machine. One of the best could be a real advance in features such as more gears or better controls in the cab. The UK is still one of the largest tractor markets in Europe, with a preference for relatively large, sophisticated machines. The average horsepower of a tractor bought last year was 88.6, up from 83 hp in 1987, mainly reflecting a rise in importance of tractors over 100 hp. According to the study, Ford - now part of the Fiat-controlled NH Geotech, was market leader with a 23 per cent share last year, followed by Massey-Ferguson (19 per cent), John Deere and Case IH (18 per cent each).</p>

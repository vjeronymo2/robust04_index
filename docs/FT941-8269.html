			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / People: Jenrette eases up at Equitable After nursing the Equitable through some of its blackest hours, Richard Jenrette, chairman of the 135-year-old US insurance group, is easing his grip on the reins of power and allowing a new generation of managers a chance, writes Richard Waters. Jenrette, 65 in April, last week gave up the chairmanship of Equitable's US life assurance subsidiary - though he remains chairman and chief executive of the whole group. The move allows Joseph Melone, 62, the subsidiary's chief executive, to become chairman, in turn making room for James Benson, 47, to become president and chief operating officer. Benson, a marketing expert who learnt the trade at Pacific Mutual Life, was brought in less than a year ago by Melone (himself a former president of Prudential Insurance) to drive the life business forward. Now that Equitable has sorted out the mess in its balance sheet, Melone says it is looking to make its capital grow 'the old-fashioned way - by making money'. For Jenrette - a founder of Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the investment bank now owned by Equitable - the 1990s has proved a busy decade. Just months after being thrust into the top seat, he brought in French insurer Axa as a 49 per cent shareholder in 1991 (when losses plunged to nearly Dollars 1bn) and took the insurance group public the next year. The question now is: how long will he stay? Last week's announcement was studiously vague on the matter, saying only that Jenrette had 'no near-term plans to retire'.</p>

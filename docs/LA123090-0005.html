			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: NONFICTION  </P> <P> IN THE COMPANY OF WRITERS: A Life in Publishing by Charles Scribner Jr.  </P> <P> (Scribner's Sons: $22.50; 157 pp.). There was a time when the Scribner name  carried prestige in the publishing world, back when Maxwell Perkins edited  Hemingway, Fitzgerald and Thomas Wolfe. That's not true today, however, as hard  as Charles Scribner Jr. tries in these bland, overpriced memoirs to put a  positive spin on the house's decline. Scribner, who ran the company from 1952  to 1986, does offer, however, a few nice recollections of well-known writers,  one a classic -- the letter of condolence the author received from Hemingway  when his father died: "Since he had to die at least he has gotten it over  with."

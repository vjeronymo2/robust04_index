			<p><P> December 26, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> INSTEAD: County firefighters will help in the effort to "recycle" trees.  </P> <P> Following the lead of Irvine and Orange last year, six other cities will pick  up discarded Christmas trees and grind each one into about a bucketful of  garden mulch. . . . The process saves dwindling landfill space. "The flocked  trees we do not need; they gum up the machinery," a spokeswoman said. . . . New  to the effort his year: Costa Mesa, Fountain Valley, Laguna Niguel, Los  Alamitos, Mission Viejo, Seal Beach. Call your city hall for information. Tom  Hamilton and Mark Landsbaum  </P></p>

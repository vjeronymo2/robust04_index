			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Sweet reason is introduced to life assurance - Gary Mead meets Allied Dunbar's chief executive There are perhaps only three informally acknowledged international 'universities' of marketing, where it forms the very marrow of corporate philosophy; Procter &amp; Gamble, Unilever and Mars. And perhaps the greatest - certainly the most private - is Mars. Senior Mars people do not normally up sticks and move on, but last year one of their top executives did just that. George Greener left in 1991 after 20 years with Mars to become chief executive of Allied Dunbar, itself known for placing considerable emphasis on marketing. Headhunted by BAT Industries, which owns Allied Dunbar, Greener was head of Mars confectionery in the UK since 1986. At first glance it looks an odd move - exchanging a life in chocolate bars for one in life assurance. But only at first glance. What Greener feels himself to be now engaged upon is almost precisely the same task he had at Mars - building and defending brand reputation which, in Allied Dunbar's case, has not been all that it might have been in recent years. The company has acquired a reputation for aggressive marketing of its policies and while Greener is equally intent on growth as his predecessors, his Mars schooling means achieving that by finding out what the consumer wants and giving the best deal possible. As a former Mars man, Greener gives priority to consumer demand. He says the future brand definition of Allied Dunbar products will require persuading the consumer that they offer a 'rewarding partnership'. Greener says: 'Treating people fairly, meeting claims even when we are not obliged to do so - these are the sort of things that are really important, where we want to earn our reputation. If we tell people the truth we will sell more, not less.' Greener has a deep-structured view of the marketing process which 'is not just image. It has to be underpinned with the product. Our marketing strategy is our business strategy and I'm the chief marketing officer. The market-led approach here, which is new, shapes the whole business. Consumers are going to become the dominant factor in this marketplace.' Moreover Greener relishes the challenge he faces in reversing the relatively poor image the life assurance industry currently has. 'The industry has a very bad name. That was an attraction to me because our business is necessary; what we do most of the time is essential, in a way that lots of consumer products are not.' The difficulty will be in measuring consumer response to the Greener approach in life assurance. But measurement, Greener believes, is only of limited value, a precursor to making managerial decisions. 'Mars, almost beyond anybody else, tried to measure everything possible, everything in sight. We charged the advertising agencies with producing results in accord with the quality parameter on the model that they had agreed they were going to accept as being right,' he said. 'But having measured everything in sight, there was still no way of actually relating any of the figures to the performance of any individual brand. The best you could do was to get a view of the effectiveness of the total budget. 'If you are going to advertise you have to be very clear about what it is you want to communicate. Allied Dunbar in its early days of TV advertising tried to get across certain basic messages. What I would prefer to do, is to get to the point where we are communicating, in a relatively simple way, something about our essence which really fits what we do out there.'</p>

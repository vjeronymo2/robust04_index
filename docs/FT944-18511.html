			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Biology weapons talks to go ahead Negotiations on measures to strengthen the 1972 treaty which outlaws biological weapons will start next January, treaty members decided at the weekend. After two weeks of difficult talks in Geneva, some 80 governments agreed to establish an ad hoc group to draft proposals on verification, anti-cheating measures and other compliance issues. However, industrialised and developing countries could not agree on how quickly to advance. The industrialised countries want the group, open to all 131 treaty members, to push on with a draft protocol for approval at the next treaty review conference, in 1996. But some developing countries want to proceed more cautiously. They have succeeded in qualifying the group's mandate in ways that would allow it to produce non-binding recommendations or to delay completion of its work beyond 1996. Thus the stage is set for arduous negotiations when the group convenes in January. Unlike related accords, the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the chemical weapons convention, the biological weapons convention has no provisions against cheating. Third World countries are worried by the threat which tougher measures to enforce compliance could pose to technology transfer and development of their own biotechnology industries. They also fear intrusive inspections of military facilities.</p>

			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CITY REJECTS STUDENTS' PLEA FOR PARKING HELP  </P> <P> Glendale Community College student leaders appealed to the City Council on  Tuesday to remove parking restrictions on residential streets near the campus,  but were told the city is not responsible for providing school parking.  </P> <P> Mercedes Delaney, student body president, told council members that the city's  decision in August to post two-hour parking signs on Sweetbriar and Swarthmore  drives would worsen an already severe parking crisis at the college.  </P> <P> The city restricted parking on the two streets, west of the Glendale Freeway  and just south of the campus, after residents complained about students parking  in the area.  </P> <P> "We were unaware that this was going to be in effect," said Delaney, who  presented council members with a petition signed Tuesday by 220 students.  "Although this may seem to be a solution for the residents of Swarthmore and  Sweetbriar, it is merely putting a Band-Aid on an infected wound."  </P> <P> But council members told Delaney and other students that the college should  seek alternatives, such as car pools, before asking the city for help.  </P> <P> The college, with enrollment expected to reach 14,000 by the end of this week,  has up to 8,000 students on campus at any one time, said Michael Southerland,  director of campus safety and security. The campus has only one parking lot for  students, with 161 day and 260 evening parking spaces for students with  permits. About five city-owned lots near the college provide nearly 1,000  spaces, Southerland said.  </P></p>

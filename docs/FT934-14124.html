			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Chief executive of Welsh agency resigns THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE of the Welsh Development Agency, Mr Philip Head, resigned last night on the eve of the government's response to a highly critical report about the agency by the Commons public accounts committee. Mr Head has been chief executive of the government-funded agency since January 1991. His resignation is one of a number of sweeping changes in the management structure which are expected to be announced today. Mr Head told the board he wanted to resign to 'enable a totally fresh approach to be taken to the management of the agency'. He felt this would be in its best interests. He will remain in the post until a replacement has been found. The report into the agency's accounts for 1991-92, which was published in July, questioned the accountability of the agency and said poor management practices had developed both in personnel matters and financial control. Standards had fallen 'well below' what parliament had a right to expect. The MPs called on the Treasury and Welsh Office to take urgent steps to ensure the problems did not recur. The report led to the agency's new chairman, Mr David Rowe-Beddoe, setting up an internal inquiry under Sir John Caines, formerly permanent secretary at the Department for Education. The findings of his inquiry are due to be published today, and the response of Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, is also expected. Mr Rowe-Beddoe, a businessman from the private sector who took over as chairman from Dr Gwyn Jones, will detail the measures being taken by the agency's board in the light of the public accounts committee report and the Caines inquiry. It is likely that the management structure will be revamped and some senior executives, in addition to Mr Head, are seen as vulnerable. Mr Head, who is in his early 40s, joined the agency in 1978, only two years after it was set up. Mr Rhodri Morgan, Labour MP for Cardiff West, said last night: 'I bear Mr Head no ill-will, but his departure is part of the long-needed root and branch overhaul of the WDA to bring it back to political and financial respectability.' The MPs' report criticised, among other matters, an unauthorised redundancy scheme which incurred a loss of Pounds 1.4m, a scheme for free private motoring for senior executives, the appointment of a fraudster as a marketing director, and an apparent attempt to conceal the so-called Operation Wizard to consider partial privatisation. The MPs also blamed the Welsh Office for lack of supervision. Mr Redwood said he took the criticisms very seriously and subsequently warned chairmen of Welsh Office independent bodies that they must insist on the 'highest standards of conduct'. Mr Rowe-Beddoe, who was appointed the agency's chairman on July 1, promised 'appropriate remedial action' following the accounts committee report.</p>

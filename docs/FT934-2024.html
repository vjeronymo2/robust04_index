			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / The GATT Deal: 45 years of doing the rounds 1947 Geneva (23 participants). Gatt's founding countries establish 20 tariff schedules which become an integral part of Gatt. These cover some 45,000 tariff reductions relating to Dollars 10bn in goods trade, half the world total. 1949 Annecy, France (13 participants). Some 5,000 tariff concessions exchanged. 1950-51 Torquay, England (38 participants). Some 8,700 tariff concessions exchanged, equivalent to a 25 per cent cut in 1948 tariff levels. 1956 Geneva (26 participants). About Dollars 2.5bn-worth of tariff reductions. 1960-62 Geneva (26 participants): The Dillon Round. Only 4,400 tariff reductions made, covering Dollars 4.9bn of trade. Agriculture and certain sensitive products excluded. 1964-67 Geneva (62 participants). The Kennedy Round. Uses a formula approach to cut industrial tariffs by 35 per cent across the board, staged over five years. Tariff concessions cover about Dollars 40bn of trade. Separate agreements reached on grains, chemical products and a code on anti-dumping. 1973-79 Geneva (99 participants): The Tokyo Round. Tariff reductions and bindings cover more than Dollars 300bn of trade and lower the weighted average tariff on manufactured goods in the world's nine biggest industrial markets from 7.0 to 4.7 per cent. The round also recognises preferential treatement for developing countries and liberalises trade in many tropical products. It revises the anti-dumping code and establishes Gatt codes on subsidies, technical barriers to trade, import licensing, government procurement, customs valuation, dairy products, bovine meat and civil aircraft. 1986-93 Geneva (115 participants): The Uruguay Round. Launched in September 1986 in Punta del Este, Uruguay, the eighth Gatt round has been by far the most complex and ambitious. Its 28 separate accords extend fair trade rules for the first time to agriculture, textiles, services, intellectual property and foreign investment. Tariffs on industrial goods will be cut by over a third, and farm export subsidies and import barriers will be substantially reduced. Gatt, the new accords on services and intellectual property, and the various Gatt codes such as those on government procurement and anti-dumping, will all come under the umbrella of a Multilateral Trade Organisation. Trade disputes between members will be settled by a single streamlined disputes procedure, with provision for appeals and binding arbitration.</p>

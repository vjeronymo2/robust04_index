			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Accountants get the bird from S&amp;L regulators: Nikki Tait and Andrew Jack on the Dollars 400m settlement agreed by Ernst &amp; Young SENIOR partners in the leading US accountancy firms have some unpleasant after-dinner reading to do this week as they digest their Thanksgiving turkey - a weighty document detailing the Dollars 400m (Pounds 263m) legal settlement just reached by Ernst &amp; Young with the US federal savings and loan industry regulators. The settlement is the largest agreed by an accounting firm, and will be closely scrutinised by its competitors for both the terms and the potential it brings for negotiations by other auditors to failed S&amp;Ls across the US. It has been privately welcomed by the regulators, the firms and insurers alike, although it continues to fuel the arguments of the accountants for litigation reform to provide protection against the escalating costs of defending themselves in court. The professional firms are coming under additional pressures to settle on S&amp;L audits in the face of punitive regulatory penalties introduced by Congress in the wake of the collapse of thrifts across the country. Mr Michael Cook, chairman and chief executive of Deloitte &amp; Touche in the US, which also faces a number of S&amp;L suits, says: 'This is an unfortunate example of what people are coerced to do because of the level and risks of litigation. There is a lot of logic to it. Going to the courts would make the lawyers very rich and the taxpayers would not end up with the proceeds.' The Ernst &amp; Young settlement results from a wide variety of charges levelled against the accounting firm by three federal agencies  - the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Resolution Trust Company and the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS). These are the bodies that regulate the savings and loan industry in the US, and which are still trying to recoup some monies from the widespread and extremely expensive failure of thrifts during the 1980s. The allegations related to audit work which Ernst &amp; Young, or Arthur Young, one of its predecessor firms, had undertaken for failed thrifts. The firm audited 400 of the 2,500 S&amp;Ls, some of them among the sector's most notorious casualties - notably Denver-based Silverado, Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in California and Western Savings and Loan in Phoenix. The charges ranged from claims that E&amp;Y failed to review adequately property appraisals or make adequate allowances for loan losses, to assertions that it did not require necessary disclosure of transactions between the thrift and 'related parties'. While E&amp;Y has neither admitted nor denied guilt, the decision to settle looks thoroughly pragmatic, particularly as the deal appears to have been shaped to penalise the firm without seriously undermining its viability. That also seems to offer hope for other smaller firms facing similar legal action. For a start, Dollars 300m of the Dollars 400m cash payment is covered by insurance. While the annual cover provided to the firm is below this level, it relates to many different claims spread over 10 years and so in no way threatens to approach the upper limits of professional indemnity. The remaining Dollars 100m will be delivered over four years - solely by the US firm - and, according to E&amp;Y, will be funded out of current earnings. This, in turn, might reduce the firm's future payouts to partners, but for a business which had US fee income of Dollars 2.2bn last year, a Dollars 25m-a-year penalty looks manageable. The settlement is also a fraction of the total damage claims, which would have run to several billions of dollars. Potential litigation costs, had the charges been contested, could have topped Dollars 100m. For its Dollars 100m, E&amp;Y gets immunity from prosecution for both the specified charges and from any potential charges. Meanwhile, the regulatory agencies have scored a well-publicised PR coup. 'This settlement shows that the government is ready, willing and able to resolve disputes through alternatives to costly litigation,' claimed the agencies on Monday. The settlement agrees to some partners being retrained and others banned from working on insured financial institutions. But E&amp;Y insists that any lessons to be learnt from the S&amp;L audits have long been taken on board. With hindsight, the accountancy firms admit they would not have taken on many of the S&amp;Ls as clients. Partly under pressure from insurers, they continue to enhance the risk assessments they make of prospective clients before agreeing to future audits. It should be noted that accountants are not the only professionals targeted by the thrift regulators. Earlier this year, the New York law firm of Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays &amp; Handler agreed to pay Dollars 41m to settle a federal lawsuit from the OTS, which charged the lawyers with withholding information about Lincoln S&amp;L from regulators. The question now is whether other accountancy firms will fall in line. Ernst &amp; Young is by no means the only firm targeted by the regulators for its audit work on failed thrifts, although its suits were among the largest and were dealt with first. The FDIC, for example, says it has a dozen pending lawsuits against other accountancy firms (see table), although some relate to bank organisations rather than thrifts. Officially, neither the FDIC nor the OTS, which pursues its complaints against professionals who undertake work for thrifts, will comment on whether negotiations with other accountancy firms are underway. But both KPMG and Deloitte &amp; Touche have confirmed that they have held preliminary discussions. These talks have been temporarily stalled by changes in key personnel in the regulatory bodies, partly a result of the US presidential election. There have already been some, much smaller, settlements between accountants and the thrift regulators - Coopers &amp; Lybrand, for example, signed a 'cease and desist' order with the OTS over Silverado in 1990. Earlier this year Arthur Andersen reached an out-of-court settlement with investors of American Continental Corp, holding company for Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan. There is clearly an expectation that more will follow.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                            LAWSUITS PENDING  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                        Damages claimed Institution                     Suit                  (Dollars million)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- First South                    FDIC v Deloitte, Haskins                                       &amp; Sells and Touche                                       Ross                     480  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Sunrise S &amp; L                  FDIC v Jacoby et al                                       (Including Deloitte,                                       Haskins &amp; Sells)         250  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Sunbelt SA of Texas            FDIC v Edwin McBirney                                       (Including Grant                                       Thornton)                200  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Continental Illinois National Bank &amp; Trust          FDIC v Main Hurdman              60  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Cardinal Federal Savings       FDIC v Hausser &amp; Taylor          19  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Rooke County S &amp; L             Roger Comeau et al v                                Terry Rupp et al                 15  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Territory S &amp; L                FSLIC* v Regier, Carr &amp;                                Monroe and others                15  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Ramona S &amp; L                   FDIC v KMPG Peat Marwick         10  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Montgomery National Bank       MNB v Withum, Smith &amp; Brown     9.5  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- First Mutual Bank for Savings  FMBS v William J.

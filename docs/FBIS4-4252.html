			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Gao Anming: "Experts Look to the Farm </F> Future"]    [Text] Chinese agricultural experts predict a possible  grain output decline this year unless the weather is extremely  good.    The drop, however, would not greatly affect food supply.    But there is concern about the further damage it would do to  farmers income levels, which have increasingly fallen behind  those of their urban counterparts.    The disparity between rural and urban incomes will last at  least another 10 years.    And experts at an economic Green Paper launched last  Saturday  urged authorities to increase investment in agriculture, improve  the government-controlled marketing of farm products and abandon  the existing household registration system that prevents labour  flow.    The Green Paper, co-authored by the Institute of Rural  Development of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the  Division of Rural Society of State Statistics Bureau, reviews  the country's agricultural performance over the past year and  outlines a plan for this year.    Two dozen officials and experts from various government  departments and research bodies exchanged views on agricultural  conditions. Although they differed on specific issues, a  general consensus was that the sector is confronting tougher  challenges than ever before.    Luo Yousheng, head of the Policy and Law Division of the  Ministry of Agriculture, said the summer grain harvest would  probably be less than last year.    The acreage of winter wheat, which makes up one quarter of  the year's grain harvest, is 600,000 hectares less than it was  last year.    Worse, 27 percent of the sown area, or more than 6.7 million  hectares, was damaged by the freezing winter. Rainy weather in  the South, drought in the North and inadequate investment by  farmers have all resulted in weak seedlings, Luo said.    Miao Jianping, director of the Research Centre of Rural  Economy of the Agricultural Ministry, said 109 million hectares  of cereals have been sown, 1.3 million hectares less than the  ministry-set minimum. Alarm bells are starting to ring.    Farmers have planted 5.4 million hectares of cotton, a mild  increase over last year but still substantially less than the  government-planned 6 million hectares, Miao said.    And the country produced only 3.76 million tons of cotton  last year, down 17 percent from the previous year, causing  nationwide concern.    To ensure enough grain and cotton planting, local  administrators have adopted a carrot-and-stick approach -- harsh  administrative measures combined with economic incentives.    But, even so, Miao suspects output will still fall short of  target.  <H5>  Worries </H5>   Wang Xiyu, vice-director of the Agricultural Division of the  State Council Development and Research Centre, shared Miao's  worries. He said administrative measures ran contrary to the  demands of a market economy and went against the will of central  government.    But at least the fall in grain yield will not prove too  serious, according to most of the experts at the launch.    It should not affect food supply much. Although, they  anticipated food price hikes because of entrepreneurial  speculation and the inflationary pressures.    Rural industry, one of the country's most dynamic sectors,  will continue its rapid growth, Miao said. Latest figures show  enterprises at the township and village levels manufactured 474  billion yuan ($54 billion) worth of products in the first  quarter. An increase of 47 percent over the same period last  year.    Miao said rural enterprises growth would slow to 20 percent  from 30 percent by the end of the year due to reduced monetary  supply.    Luo said rural firms had been burdened with heavy taxes  since  central government introduced its tax reforms at the beginning  of the year.    The State coffers now take 33 percent of profits, which is  more than was previously taken. The taxes are likely to block  investment in farming and rural infrastructure .    Luo reckoned the reforms will cost rural businesses an extra  45 billion yuan ($5.2 billion) and will send more and more firms  into the red. Last year, rural firms paid 95 billion yuan ($11  billion) in taxes.    The output of vegetables, domestic animals and aquatic  products would continue to increase Luo said.    The experts said the income gaps between rural and urban  residents, and between the more affluent coast and the  hinterland, would further widen. And no effective way of  reversing the trend had so far been found.    Chinese farmers, who make up 70 percent of the population,  earned an average of 921 yuan ($106) last year, an increase of  3.2 percent after inflation. By contrast, city dwellers made an  average 2,337 yuan ($269) each, a rise of 10.2 percent over the  previous year. Urbanites now earn almost two and a half times  as much as their country cousins.    A meagre 3 percent growth in farmers incomes is forecast for  this year, which is half that prescribed in the official Eighth  Five Year Plan (1991-95).    Deng Yingtao, vice-director of the Rural Development  Institute, blamed the slow increase of farmers' incomes on  falling farm profits and lack of new labour opportunities among  rural enterprises. Declining consumer demand for farm products  has hit the agricultural sector hard, said Deng, chief editor of  the Green Paper.    And the rising price of agricultural materials and equipment  has virtually ruled out the cutting production costs as a way of  increasing profits.    And the government is financially incapable of subsidizing  cereal production, Deng said.    A logical way out was to cut the number of farmers and  transfer them to non-agricultural businesses, he said.  <H5>  Orientation </H5>   Unfortunately, an increasing number of rural industrial  firms  have ended their labour-intensive strategies and gone for  capital-intensive policies instead. So job opportunities have  been reduced.    And China's relative dearth of cities has blocked the  development of the service industry, a major job market in any  country.    The service sector made up only 14 percent of rural output  last year, half the national average.    Building and expanding cities to create efficient industry  and services could be the only solution. Although this would  take a long time considering the huge population base.    The experts concluded that Chinese farmers were unlikely to  see their income grow significantly for a long time.    Deng advocated the developing environmentally friendly  agriculture, accelerating urbanization, expanding the service  sector and boosting value-added farm product processing.    Other experts said that the government should immediately  reform the household registration system, which is a  planned-economy practice, and open the cities to farmers.    Most government departments now agree that the old system  must be abolished, it's just a question of how fast.    And the Ministry of Public Security is drafting a decree on  changing the registration system in counties and towns, which  will be publicized soon.</p>

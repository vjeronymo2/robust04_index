			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / India urged to safeguard local industry Indian industrialists yesterday urged the government to safeguard the interests of domestic companies when opening up the economy to foreign investors. Import duties should be cut 'gradually' to protect domestic industry and special temporary duties should be introduced to insulate Indian companies from violent swings in international prices, says the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, a national employers' organisation, in a formal pre-budget report to the government. The federation says Indian groups should not be obliged to compete at a disadvantage to foreign groups and need a 'level playing-ground'. The federation's call echoes the fears expressed by an informal group of conservative industrialists called the Bombay Club, who have already conveyed their worries to the government. The industrialists' concerns have surfaced at a time when multinational groups have started making high-profile investments in India in the wake of the government's economic reforms. The purchase by Coca Cola, the US soft drinks group, of Parle, India's leading cola maker, prompted suggestions from some critics that Indian industry faces a mass takeover. The federation's report carries proposals for changes in tax, trade and financial regulations which Indian companies feel discriminate against domestic groups. In its most controversial, protectionist-sounding suggestion, the report demands planned cuts in import duties should continue but should be 'gradual keeping in view the interests of the indigenous industries.' It also wants duties to be lowest on raw materials and highest on finished goods to give 'the requisite support to the domestic industry.' The federation calls for stronger anti-dumping measures and a new 'regulatory duty' which would be imposed for limited periods on imports when international prices fell sharply to allow Indian industry to adjust. The report says corporate tax rates in India, which range between 51.75 per cent and 57.5 per cent, are higher than rates in other countries. Foreign financial institutions investing in India enjoy special low rates of capital gains tax of 10 per cent on long-term gains (against 40 per cent for domestic companies) and of 25-30 per cent on short-term gains (compared with 51.75 per cent.) The federation says interest rates should be cut from the current range of 17-22 per cent to 10 per cent, nearer international levels. It wants an end to restrictions on inter-company loans and investments and on the use of shares as security for loans. The report said: 'Unless the reform measures are properly sequenced and a level playing-ground is provided to the domestic industry, the national economy will face serious adverse impact.' Exports in October grew 15.2 per cent to Dollars 1.7bn, extending a surge which started at the beginning of the financial year in April, according to figures published yesterday. But the pace of growth has fallen from an average of 21 per cent in the six months to September. Imports remained flat due to continued stagnation in Indian industry.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA intends to propose treatment standards for K162 through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> K166 in a separate rulemaking. However, EPA specifically is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> soliciting comment and data on the following as they pertain to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed listing of dye and pigment industries wastes K162  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through K166 as described in this action:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Technical descriptions of treatment systems that are or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could be used potentially for these wastes;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Descriptions of alternative technologies that currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> might be available or anticipated as applicable;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Performance data for the treatment of these or similar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes (in particular, constituent concentrations in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both treated and untreated wastes, as well as equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design and operating conditions);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Information on known or perceived difficulties in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyzing treatment residues or specific constituents;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Quality assurance/quality control information for all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data submissions;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Factors affecting on-site and off-site treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capacity;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Information on the potential costs for set-up and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation of any current and alternative treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technologies for these wastes;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Information on waste minimization approaches.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Request for Comment on the Agency's Approach to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Capacity Analyses in the LDR Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the land disposal restrictions determinations, the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must demonstrate that adequate treatment or recovery capacity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exists to manage a newly listed waste with BDAT standards before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it can restrict the waste from further land disposal. The Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performs capacity analyses to determine if sufficient alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment or recovery capacity exists to accommodate the volumes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of waste that will be affected by the land disposal prohibition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If adequate capacity exists, the waste must be treated to meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the BDAT standard before land disposal. If adequate capacity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not exist, RCRA Section 3004(h) authorizes EPA to grant a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> national capacity variance from the effective date of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment standard for the waste for up to two years or until  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequate alternative treatment capacity becomes available,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whichever is sooner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To perform capacity analyses, the Agency needs to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the volume of the listed waste that will require treatment prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to land disposal. The volume of waste requiring treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depends, in turn, on the waste management practices employed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the listed waste generators. Data on waste management practices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for these wastes were collected during the development of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule. However, as the regulatory process proceeds,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generators may decide to minimize or recycle their wastes or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> otherwise alter their management practices. Thus, EPA will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> update and monitor changes in management practices because these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes will affect the final volume of waste requiring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial treatment capacity. Therefore, EPA needs information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on current and future waste management practices for these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes, including the volume of waste that are recycled, mixed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with or co-managed with other waste and discharged under Clean  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Water Act provisions; and the volume and types of residuals that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are generated by various management practices applicable to newly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed and identified wastes ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , treatment residuals).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

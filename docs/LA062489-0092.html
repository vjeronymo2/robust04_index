			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROCK HUDSON CASE LAWYER 1 OF 3 AIR CRASH VICTIMS  </P> <P> A prominent Los Angeles lawyer who represented celebrities and recently won a  landmark, $21-million award for Marc Christian against the estate of Rock  Hudson was identified Friday as one of three people killed in a plane crash a  day earlier in Santa Clarita.  </P> <P> Harold Rhoden, 66, of Northridge was killed with his wife, Sheila, 40, and his  mother-in-law, Ceil Rauch, 61, of Lake Worth, Fla., said Los Angeles County  coroner's spokesman Robert Dambacher. Rhoden's daughter, Lorraine, 13, who was  also in the aircraft, was reported in critical condition at Henry Mayo Newhall  Hospital in Valencia.  </P> <P> Rhoden, who had practiced law in Los Angeles since 1952, was piloting the  single-engine, four-seat Trinidad TB-21 that went down after it apparently  developed engine trouble and struck some power lines.  </P> <P> In recent years, his clients included Christian, who was awarded $21.75 million  from the late actor's estate earlier this year. A jury had found that Hudson  and his personal secretary were negligent because they hid the actor's AIDS  from Christian, Hudson's homosexual lover.  </P> <P> In April, a judge slashed the award to $5.5 million, but attorneys for Hudson's  estate have appealed. Robert Parker Mills, an attorney for the estate, said  Friday that he did not know how Rhoden's death will affect the case. Both sides  were in the process of filing their opening briefs, and no oral arguments had  been scheduled, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Investigating Crash  </P> <P> Investigators for the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal  Aviation Administration were investigating the cause of the crash, which  occurred about 2:10 p.m. Thursday in a ravine near Sierra Highway in Santa  Clarita, officials said.  </P> <P> According to witnesses, "as he was going down, the tail of the airplane clipped  a high-voltage wire which caused him to nose-dive down into the ground," Los  Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. David Stunson said.  </P> <P> Minutes earlier, Rhoden had spoken twice by radio with air traffic controllers  at Van Nuys Airport, his destination on a flight from Sacramento, Van Nuys  Airport spokesman Bob Hayes said. Rhoden reported having engine trouble and  asked for directions to a closer airport before the crash, Hayes said.  </P> <P> Rhoden's secretary said she did not know precisely why her boss was in  Sacramento, saying she knew only that the trip "had something to do with the  plane" and "had nothing to do with law." Rhoden's family had gone along for the  weekend, secretary Tip Phillips said.  </P> <P> Phillips said Rhoden left for Sacramento June 16 and had intended to return two  or three days later, but on Monday, he phoned to say "he was detained; he had  engine trouble."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Licensed Pilot  </P> <P> Rhoden, a licensed pilot since 1947, called Phillips again Thursday morning to  report that the problem had been fixed and that he was returning to Los  Angeles, Phillips said.  </P> <P> "We didn't really go into what was wrong with the plane," Phillips said. "He  just complained about it and made a few jokes" about the problem, she said.  </P> <P> NTSB investigators could not be reached for comment Friday.  </P> <P> Rhoden's career included several high-profile cases. He was a close associate  of celebrity divorce lawyer Marvin Mitchelson, who said he worked with Rhoden  on at least 50 cases in the last 30 years.  </P> <P> Rhoden and Mitchelson repre sented Bianca Jagger in her 1979 divorce from rock  star Mick Jagger. The duo also represented the wife of international arms  merchant and Iran-Contra figure Adnan Khashoggi in a 1982 divorce.  </P> <P> Last month, Rhoden represented Mitchelson when a jury cleared the lawyer of  charges in a $6.5-million civil suit filed by a former Mitchelson client who  accused him of rape.  </P> <P> "I would describe him as a lawyer's lawyer," a tearful Mitchelson said of  Rhoden. "He was absolutely erudite . . . knew the law, in all the time I had  seen him, better than his opponents and much of the time better than the  judge."  </P> <P> Mitchelson said he introduced Rhoden to his second wife, Sheila.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Fine Gentleman'  </P> <P> "His most outstanding quality was that he was a very fine gentleman," said Los  Angeles Superior Court Judge Bruce R. Geernaert, who presided over the Hudson  case. "The jurors liked him very much. . . . Mr. Rhoden was very, very calm and  cool."  </P> <P> Mills, who opposed Rhoden in the case, described him as "a hard-nosed bulldog."  He said Rhoden "chose to try this case all the way through . . . even if it  might mean that they could get less money at some point in the future."  </P> <P> Rhoden also played a prominent role in a contest over the estate of Howard  Hughes. One of Hughes' associates designated Rhoden as the substitute executor  of a handwritten will that named a gas station attendant, Melvin Dummar, among  the beneficiaries and that was contested by four Hughes cousins not named in  the will.  </P> <P> Rhoden spent two years trying to prove the authenticity of the will, but a jury  ruled in 1978 that the document was a fake.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lengthy Battle  </P> <P> In the 1960s, Rhoden waged a lengthy legal battle against Litton Industries on  behalf of a man who claimed a founding interest in the company. He won a  $7.5-million award for his client in 1965. During the course of the case,  Litton filed a $40-million libel suit against Rhoden and others, but the suit  was later dismissed.  </P> <P> Rhoden served in World War II as a tail gunner on a B-24 bomber and was a  prisoner of war in Germany after the plane crashed in Austria, Phillips said.  </P></p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Technology in the Office (19): Ease and speed top the list - Monica Horten finds fierce competition in electronic information It's not what you've got, it's how you access it. In the fast expanding world of electronic information services, that is becoming the rule which differentiates service offerings. Business information has been available on-line for many years from service providers such as Official Airline Guide, Infocheck, Kompass Online, various newswires, and the Financial Times's Profile news and reports database service. Most are supplied through third-party network providers such as Compuserve, as well as by direct connection. But none of the services have yet achieved the widespread use that they deserve. One reason is that they have proved difficult to use, often providing users with very little on-screen assistance. 'Most on-line databases are not particularly friendly, and by design are geared towards information services professionals,' said Mike Sullivan, of Reuters business information products group. Another issue is charging. Services traditionally charge users by the minute, making searches expensive. And researchers may have to access more than one database to conduct a comprehensive search - for example, to find competitive product information they would check news archives, companies listings and research reports. Reuters Business Briefing, a new Reuters service launched last year, has improved the user interface with new Windows-based software. It lets people search its 600 sources information by clicking through pull-down menus of subject codes. It also has a simplified charging structure - a monthly subscription of 495, for which users get 20 hours free search time. A Windows interface is becoming de rigeur for all new information services. According to Mr Sullivan, users today tend to be business executives, who need to search data for themselves. The executives demand that a system is easy to use. In the past, the typical user was a librarian - an information professional - who did the search at the request of an executive. Users also demand fast data retrieval. Business Briefing claims to pull up data in less that three seconds. So does a rival service called Tel-Me from Birkenhead-based start-up company Phone-Link. Tel-Me's concept is to take a number of commonly used databases and develop a common interface to make searching simpler. The 10 services offered include the Automobile Association and BT databases, as well as UK railway timetables, companies database Infocheck, and news wires. Tel-Me charges only 300 annual subscription, but adds a fixed charge per data retrieved: from 12p for a phone number, up to 24p for a company report. Compuserve, the on-line service based in Columbus, Ohio, not only has a Windows interface but uses a special interface to third-party databases which makes them easier to use than the original service provided direct from the information provider. And it lets users save information to their hard disk, so they can read it off-line, cutting on-line costs. Compuserve's philosophy is to offer as much variety of information as possible. It has more than 2,000 databases, including the Associated Press, Deutsche Presse Agentur and Press Association newswires and business services such as Dun and Bradstreet, Kompass Online, Extel Financial. Market reports from Mintel and US and UK trade marks are also on the system. Users have to pay each time they access these services - except for the newswires which are provided free with the Dollars 7.95 monthly subscription. The advantage is that there is no need to pay an individual subscription to each database. So a user can do a credit check, look up a share price, get a company report and so on, with relative ease. Compuserve has a great appeal for smaller businesses, which cannot afford subscriptions to so many services at once. It has made a concerted drive into European markets in the past two years and has made the greatest inroads in the UK and Germany, where it has 65,000 subscribers in each country. 'There are up-market bulletin board services and there are high cost business services, which sell direct. The wedge is in the middle where people want a broad service,' said Neil Laver, of Compuserve's UK office. The most immediate rival to Compuserve is the Internet, which claims to have 30m users worldwide. However, the Internet began as a network for academics and boffins, and this remains its prime function. According to UK company Pipex, which supplies Internet connections, the leading business information suppliers have yet to come on-line. Some, such as Dow Jones and Dun and Bradstreet are in the process of connecting. Industry observers point out that searching the Internet can be difficult. It has no central organisational focus, which means that technical help may be minimal, depending on the supplier offering the connection. It may also be complicated to hook up to some of the information suppliers. Commercial information suppliers will not offer their services free of charge - as is the academic information - and users may have to contact the information supplier directly to obtain an account. This is not necessary on Compuserve. Neither is it necessary on Maid, a London-based company which claims to offer a much more intuitive means of searching multiple databases. With Maid, one can search all the databases on the system - including news wires, company checks, stock broker reports and research material - just by entering a single query. Thus, if one enters 'telecommunications in Thailand', it will provide news cuttings, broker, company and analyst reports that are relevant. Maid has also invested in a novel indexing system. Professional indexers provide links between information which is related even though the actual word being searched on is not included. For example, if asked to search on 'toothpaste' it would pick up an article on oral hygiene that did not mention the word 'toothpaste'. But clearly, the article would be relevant for someone interested in the subject. According to founder Dan Wagner, customers are switching from other services to Maid. So far, the company has only targeted large financial institutions and major companies. The client list already includes 93 banks, and one third of the UK's largest companies. However, it will be made available for smaller businesses next year, when a Windows version of the interface software becomes available.</p>

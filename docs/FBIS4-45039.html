			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. Diabali: "Annaba: When the Fabric of the </F> Economy Unravels..."]    [Text] Oran--Annaba, one of the country's most important  economic development hubs, is on the verge of foundering. The  steelworking capital is leaking at every seam, as indeed it  should be, since a large number of enterprises, having taken on  too much debt, have gone under.    The consequences of a decade of extreme mismanagement are  going to end up destroying the last vestiges of its economic  potential. One by one, wilaya-owned, parastatal, and state-owned  enterprises have been shaken by labor crises that have seriously  compromised their future, means of production have been  sabotaged or shut down for diverse reasons, bank accounts have  been blocked, and equipment has been sold off cheap to local or  foreign buyers.    Enterprises like Ferrovial, Real-Sider, Enriest, Ferphos,  Ecotec, Enafroid, and many others are begging the banks for  money to pay workers' wages and desperately seeking even the  smallest contract to write into their almost empty order books.    The two state-owned companies, Asmidal and Sider, are in a  tight corner. The first, operating in the red, financially  unhinged, and burdened by a swollen personnel roster, survives  only by tapping the public treasury. The second, a veritable  monster of heavy industry, manages somehow to limp along with  its decrepit equipment and 50 percent manpower excess, reeling  under the weight of utopian projects. The Bellar project (Jijel)  is probably typical: Although the project seemed feasible in the  1980's, what was supposed to become Algeria's second-largest  steelworking complex has been abandoned to its fate after tens  of billions of dinars were plowed into it.  <H5>  Corruption, Malfeasance </H5>   Beyond the economic recession that is generally blamed for  the current situation, one must consider the fact that some of  the enterprises implanted or represented in the wilaya of Annaba  have been weakened by poor business management, embezzlement,  and other sorts of malfeasance that have ended up in the courts  (Edimco, Orelait, Emifor, Sidal, Asmidal), or stirred up  scandals in APCs [people's communal assemblies], technical  agencies, the customs service, banks, etc., altogether depriving  public coffers of billions in revenue.    The two largest scandals to date, the container scandal at  the port of Annaba--still a murky affair--and Orelait Annaba's  importation of date-expired powdered milk and palm oil, are very  significant in terms of the way they were handled. Whereas the  former scandal is still in the courts, no one--neither the  participation fund, nor the board of directors, nor the state as  principal shareholder--has demanded that Orelait account for  this palm oil, which was too old to sell only a few months after  being unloaded at the port of Annaba.    Annaba has certainly seen a record number of corruption and  malfeasance scandals. The ceramics and wood for the 19 May  stadium complex, the concrete benches now adorning villas in  Chrea, near Blida, the large quantity of cement originally  destined for Maquam Echahid for the Seraidi road and diverted to  the construction of "si flen" [as published]: Resource  diversions and abuses of power were an everyday reality between  1985 and 1990, but the perpetrators have never been "punished."    In 1994, in addition to business failures and bankruptcies  (due in part to poor management), arson has gutted the plants of  socioeconomic units such as Enatb, Ecotec, the Civil Protection  Unit of Drean, the Annaba APC, EPEA [expansion not given],  Sonelgaz, ENATB [expansion not given] and Ecotec at Oued Zied.    As if that were not enough, the future of other units has  been thrown into serious doubt by labor conflict, sometimes  latent but in other cases flaring into open confrontation--for  example, at National Highway Transport Company/Chaiba, where  workers have been on strike since 5 April, and Hydro-Transfert,  where tools were downed on 10 April.</p>

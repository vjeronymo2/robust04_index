			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nestor Martinez] </F>   [Text] On 19 April, Carlos Sales Guerrero, president of the  Senate's Commerce Committee, said money is leaving the country  because of an "instability which I hope will be temporary."  During an interview, Sales expressed his confidence that  political and economic stability will soon "improve the  situation in the country." Nevertheless, he said he neither  rules out nor disregards Mexico's serious problems.    He denied this movement is a "flight of capital." The  phrase, he said, is currently being used to describe an  uncontrolled departure of people afraid of losing their assets,  which they try to protect at all costs. "We are dealing with a  movement of capital; this is to say, a financial market  instability caused by internal and external factors."    Sales is in charge of negotiating NAFTA as the legislative  branch delegate. He said it is evident there are very marked  "financial fluctuations" everywhere and higher federal fund  interest rates in the United States, all of which have  repercussions on the yield of all stock exchanges in the world.  "We have additional problems, and this brings about  adjustments. I cannot predict the extent and duration of those  adjustments. I can only say that, fortunately, those stock  market fluctuations never last long."    Asked whether there is any connection between a recurring  drop in the stock exchange indexes and the country's  pre-electoral situation, Sales replied that many factors are  involved in this situation. "To deny the influence of any one  of them would be like trying to shield the sun with one finger.  To regard the effect of one of them, however, would be an  oversimplification."    He summed up the situation by saying: "There is indeed  instability, which I hope will be temporary. In the world's  history, however, there has not been one single permanent  downward trend. An upward movement always follows. This is why  I think the degree of political and economic stability in the  country will soon reassure us. I neither rule out nor disregard  the problems affecting us."</p>

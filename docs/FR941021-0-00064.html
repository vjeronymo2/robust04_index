			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Award of Costs and Expenses: Applicability to Judicial Proceedings and Administrative Proceedings under EQA Sections Other than W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Wyoming Enrolled Act No. 4 revises W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f), the State counterpart to section 525(e) of SMCRA, by providing in part that costs and expenses (including attorney's fees) incurred by parties in connection with a proceeding under the EQA may be assessed against one or more of those parties only if the proceeding is a contested case proceeding or subsequent judicial review proceeding. In relevant part, the revised statute reads as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> At the request of any person, a sum equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses (including attorney's fees) as determined by the council to have been reasonably incurred by the person for or in connection with his participation in the proceeding, including any judicial review of agency actions, may be assessed against either party as the court or the council deems proper. This subsection shall apply only to contested case proceedings or subsequent judicial review proceedings under the provisions of this act relating to the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations in accordance with P.L. 95&hyph;87, as the law is worded on August 3, 1977. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the decision announced in the January 24, 1994,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the Secretary did not approve the introductory clause of the first sentence of W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) (``Whenever an order is issued under this section,''), the words ``only'' and ``administrative'' in the second sentence of this subsection (``This subsection shall apply only to administrative contested case proceedings *&blank;*&blank;*''), and paragraph (i) of this subsection (``The issues resolved in the contested proceeding are those in the original complaint that were raised within the statutory time frames under W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;406(p) or within an enforcement action''). In concert with this action, the Secretary modified the condition of program approval at 30 CFR 950.11(c) by adding paragraphs (1) and (2) to require Wyoming to clearly authorize the award of costs and expenses incurred in connection with participation in (1) judicial review proceedings concerning agency actions, and (2) with respect to awards from the State, any administrative contested case proceedings under the approved program, not just proceedings concerning enforcement actions under W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437 or actions taken under W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;406(p). (See findings 3 and 6, 59 FR 3915&hyph;17, January 24, 1994.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current submittal repeals paragraph (f)(i) and the disapproved introductory clause discussed above and modifies the remainder of W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) to clarify that this subsection applies to contested case proceedings and subsequent judicial review proceedings under any SMCRA-related provisions of the EQA, not just enforcement actions under W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437 or proceedings pursuant to W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;406(p). Therefore, the Secretary finds that the State has satisfied the requirements of 30 CFR 950.11(c) (1) and (2). Accordingly, he is approving the proposed amendment and removing 30 CFR 950.11(c) (1) and (2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Award of Costs and Expenses: Eligible Issues [W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f)(i)] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Wyoming Enrolled Act No. 4 revises W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) by repealing paragraph (i), which provided a participant in a proceeding is eligible to receive an award of costs and expenses from the State only if the issues resolved in the contested proceeding were raised in the original complaint and within the statutory timeframes of W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;406(p) or within an enforcement action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed in finding 3 of the January 24, 1994,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  document (59 FR 3515&hyph;16), the Secretary did not approve the now-repealed provision because he found it to be inconsistent with section 525(e) of SMCRA and 43 CFR 4.1290 through 4.1295. In addition, the Secretary modified the condition of program approval at 30 CFR 950.11(c) by adding a paragraph (3), which, in part, required that Wyoming revise its statute to remove the provision limiting awards to expenses incurred in connection with proceedings involving issues raised in the original complaint. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

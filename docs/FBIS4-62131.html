			<p>BFN     [Text] The working meeting of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet  commission for planning, budget, and finances has addressed the  issue of noncash accounts between enterprises. Representatives  of the Belarusian National Bank, the Ministry of Finances, the  High Economic Court, and the Cabinet of Ministers participated  in its work. The experts emphasized that given the recent  economic slump, the breakdown of monetary and credit policies,  the process of trading in [products] and balancing mutual  accounts between suppliers and consumers has considerably  exacerbated. As a result of inadequate finances, working  capital is slow to be replenished. Debts for gas, electricity,  and thermal energy are growing. Though current legislation  regulates mutual accounts between economic sectors rather  efficiently, some legal acts, particularly Clause No. 16 of the  Law on the National Bank of Belarus, must be supplemented. The  commission adopted a decision to discuss this issue at the  session of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and the Supreme  Soviet session; to repeal and declare a range of legislative  acts -- formulating economic pressure on enterprises -- as no  longer effective; to task the Belarusian National Bank with  determining the amount and mechanism for applying economic  sanctions when balancing the noncash accounts of those who  violate the law.</p>

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Bangkok's tiger roars - At a glance The Bangkok stock market was one of the little tigers roaring loudest last year, gaining 88.4 per cent over the course of the year. It hit yet another new high at the start of this week, but the last few days have seen the market slip back on profit taking. The foreign money pouring into south-east Asian markets, particularly from US fund managers, is one reason behind Bangkok's performance, but local investors have also been looking for higher returns than those from bank deposits. The economy is growing strongly, at about 8 per cent, but shares, particularly in the banking, financial and property sectors, are already fully priced to take account of prospective earnings.</p>

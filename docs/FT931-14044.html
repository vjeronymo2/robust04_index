			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent subdued as hopes of rate cut recede ACTIVITY was generally subdued yesterday as hopes of a cut in interest rates receded, writes our markets staff. FRANKFURT continued to improve but some traders commented that the momentum was decreasing with hopes fading for a cut in interest rates at tomorrow's Bundesbank council meeting. The DAX index gained 5.70 to 1,578.83 but off the day's high of 1,585.44 as turnover rose to DM6.2bn from Monday's DM5.2bn. With most stocks showing gains Schering disappointed with a DM28 fall to DM707 after some brokers issued sell recommendations and lowered 1992 EPS forecasts below DM40 from around DM42. Disappointing fourth quarter sales in the agrochemical division will affect earnings, brokers say. Thyssen was another loser, down DM3 at DM169.70, after the steel division reported lower earnings for the year ending September 1992. In the car sector Volkswagen slipped DM5.50 to DM270.50 in spite of improved December sales figures as a number of analysts still consider that the group's recent cost cutting measures do not go far enough. BMW advanced DM10.50 to DM509.50 on a 7 per cent rise in December sales. ZURICH ended easier but above the day's lows after a session dominated by a German television report that a research institute had found minute particles of asbestos in two drugs produced by Roche. The Roche certificates ended SFr110 down at SFr4,120 after trading as low as SFr4,000. The SMI index finished 20.7 lower at 2,063.9. Among other actively traded issues, Alusuisse registered shares put on SFr7 to SFr440 in response to the company's plans to close Switzerland's last aluminium smelter as part of a restructuring forced by overcapacity in the world aluminium industry PARIS was subdued and the CAC-40 index finished 0.20 ahead at 1,837.74, off the day's high of 1,840.44. Turnover slipped to FFr2.3bn from FFr2.8bn. BSN rose FFr6 to FFr914 after news that it was to co-operate with Unilever in the development of new yoghurt and ice cream products. AMSTERDAM lost a little ground as the CBS Tendency index fell 0.1 to 98.3. Philips went against the trend with a 90 cents rise to Fl 22.60 after reporting that its US lighting division had made its first operating profit in eight years in 1992. Royal Dutch lost Fl 1.80 to Fl 143.90 after the group forecast disappointing 1992 earnings. MILAN closed off the session highs as domestic institutions began to take profits. Foreign interest was also muted and the Comit index registered a 3.03 rise to 487.96. Shares in Gemina, a financial holding company with links to Fiat, was a strong performer, adding L65 to L1,275 before retreating to L1,245 in after-hours trading. MADRID eased on profit-taking after recent gains and the general index closed 0.51 lower at 229.57. BRUSSELS was supported by Tractebel, up BFr160 or 2 per cent to BFr8,010, as the Bel-20 index put on 5.08 to 1,145.67 in turnover of BFr1.1bn. STOCKHOLM finished little changed after a dull session which saw the Affarsvarlden index edge up 1.0 to 934.8 in moderate turnover of SKr639m. Bank shares turned back after three straight sessions of strong advances. OSLO saw slight gains but activity remained subdued and the all-share index put on 1.49 to 386.52 in turnover of NKr152.6m. Norsk Hydro added NKr2 to Nkr163 while Saga Petroleum free shares lost NKr2 to NKr69. COPENHAGEN advanced further with the KFX index gaining 1.53 to 81.16 in solid turnover of some DKr1bn. VIENNA was encouraged by neighbouring markets and the ATX index rose 11.56 to 730.64. Austrian Airlines gained Sch36 to Sch1,455 on unsubstantiated reports that it was seeking a cut back in staff salaries. ISTANBUL weakened with the 75-share market index closing down 20.92 at 3,996.24 in turnover of some TL175.5bn. Eregli shed TL150 to TL2,275.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- January 19                                          THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes              Open       10.30      11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1091.79    1093.53    1094.29    1092.13 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1161.04    1163.21    1163.56    1160.91  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                  Jan 18     Jan 15     Jan 14  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100             1097.15    1089.58    1076.93 FT-SE Eurotrack 200             1166.50    1160.32    1154.08  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes              13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1090.79    1091.29    1091.13    1090.81 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1160.04    1159.22    1156.82    1155.89  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                  Jan 13                Jan 12  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100             1063.02               1071.43 FT-SE Eurotrack 200             1144.79               1152.84  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 -  1094.32 ; 200 -  1164.37 Low/day: 100 -  1089.68  200 -  1155.65.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

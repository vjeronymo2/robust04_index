			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / UK Company News: C&amp;J Clark agrees to detailed takeover talks THE BOARD of C&amp;J Clark, the UK's biggest shoe manufacturer, has agreed to detailed talks over a possible bid from a consortium comprised of Electra Investment Trust and Specialist Research Unit, a firm of consultants. SRU, which has been associated with Clark for more than 25 years, approached Electra Investment Trust some weeks ago about backing a possible bid. Clark said the talks were centred on a price 'substantially more than Pounds 100m.' The discussions have been welcomed by the Clark board as 'friendly and constructive'. Electra has previously said it would not back a hostile offer. Clark said it would be 'helpful' if the discussions could be settled before its extraordinary general meeting on October 16. That is when shareholders will vote on resolutions calling for the resignation of Mr Walter Dickson, chairman, and another director. The resolutions were put forward by a minority group of family shareholders dissatisfied with corporate strategy and falling profits. Clark is some 70 per cent held by more than 500 family members and six of the 11 directors belong to the Clark family. Mr Colin Fisher, managing director of SRU, is well known to the Clark board. If SRU decides to make an offer, it is likely that Mr Fisher would be given a place on the board. Any successful offer is unlikely, however, to result in wider board changes.</p>

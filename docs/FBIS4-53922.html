			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 23 (YONHAP) -- The United States,  looking to hold a third round of negotiations with North Korea  in early June, held a working-level contact in New York Monday  afternoon to prepare for the proposed talks.    Meanwhile, the South Korean ambassador in charge of nuclear  affairs, Kim Sam-hun, met with Robert Gallucci, chairman of the  Clinton Administration Policy Group on Korea, to coordinate  their countries' positions on the next round of  Washington-Pyongyang high-level talks.    In New York, the U.S. side was said to have proposed a date  for the negotiations after reiterating its conditions for the  talks.    Depending on North Korea's attitude, there is a strong  possibility the talks could be held in early June, sources said.    State Department Spokesman Mike McCurry confirmed that an  unofficial contact with North Korea had taken place in New York.  McCurry also said that Gallucci, in addition to his meeting  with Kim Sam-hun, is expected to hold several days of talks with  officials from Japan and China on the North Korean nuclear  dispute in New York beginning Tuesday.    Speaking at a regular weekly press briefing, McCurry said  that if North Korea could agree with the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) on the question of maintaining nuclear  safeguards, there would be no obstacle to the third round of  talks.    "The IAEA's ability to conduct the activities it needs to  maintain safeguards on spent fuel -- as long as that is  preserved, we would see no obstacle to another round of  high-level talks," McCurry said.    The spokesman called on Pyongyang to accommodate the  activities of the IAEA inspection team as soon as possible.    "We certainly urge North Korea to agree to the procedures  the  IAEA needs as soon as possible and not to jeopardize the IAEA's  ability to conduct activities necessary to maintain safeguards  on the spent fuel," he said.    The United States has not decided on the date for the third  round of talks, McCurry said.    "We wouldn't proceed to announcing a date without a full  range of consultations with others that we share an interest in  this subject with," he added. "That would include the Government  of Japan and obviously South Korea."    But one senior State Department official said further talks  with Pyongyang could be held early next month, when the two  countries are expected to discuss the nuclear issue as well as  problems related to normalizing political and trade relations.    Following his meeting with Gallucci, South Korean Ambassador  Kim hinted that the conditions for third-round talks between  Washington and Pyongyang have pratically been satisfied.  Specifically, Kim said the principal condition for the talks is  additional IAEA inspection of a key radiochemical laboratory and  servicing of surveillance equipment.    As for the refueling of the 5-megawatt reactor at Yongbyon,  Kim said that if North Korea continued to remove spent fuel  rods, the basis for dialogue could "collapse." But discussions  on the refueling between the IAEA and Pyongyang can proceed in  parallel with the U.S.-North Korea talks if measurement of the  spent fuel rods by the IAEA later is guaranteed, Kim said.    McCurry said that should the discharge of fuel from the  5-megawatt reactor continue without any of the IAEA's proposed  steps being in place, then North Korea would inevitably  undermine the basis for dialogue.    "We'd have no choice but to return the matter to the United  Nations Security Council," he said.</p>

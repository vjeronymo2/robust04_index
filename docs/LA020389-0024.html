			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Rioters threw rocks and bottles and set trash bins on fire in Tampa, Fla., in  the second night of violence after a suspected drug dealer died in police  custody. Police cordoned off the same predominantly black neighborhood where  about 100 officers in riot gear quelled the first outbreak Wednesday night by  about 75 people. That melee erupted following the arrest of Edgar Allen Price,  40, in an undercover operation. In an effort to prevent further trouble in the  College Hill section, authorities released details of the arrest, saying Rice  died of cardiac arrest after struggling to fight off six police officers. Price  had not been beaten or choked, Deputy Chief Thomas DePolis said. He said an  officer was hurt in the melee when she was hit by a rock, although he didn't  know the extent of the injuries.  </P></p>

			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news Monday: After a week in which the US and Japanese trade talks grabbed the attention of many traders, there will be spate of US and Japanese data for the markets to watch in days ahead. In the US, September's purchasing managers' index will be watched for signs that the recent surge in industrial production is being maintained. In Japan, data on September's car sales is due today. Wednesday: US factory order figures are expected to show a rise in August. Meanwhile, data on German manufacturing orders, due in the middle of the week, is likely to indicate that orders are growing, particularly in the capital goods sector, although demand for consumer durables remains weak. Friday: The US September non-farm pay roll figures are expected to paint a slightly mixed picture of employment trends, although most analysts believe the underlying trend is healthy. In Japan, August's current account is likely to show that the trade surplus narrowed slightly in the month. Meanwhile, UK trade data is expected to show a further narrowing of the trade deficit.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow May 26 BUSINESS-TASS -- Chairman of the  Russian Central Bank Viktor Gerashchenko refuted mass media  reports that he opposed the package of economic decrees recently  issued by President Boris Yeltsin.    Gerashchenko told BUSINESS-TASS that those documents had  actually been prepared by specialists from the Central Bank,  along with other departments. They were then only polished up  by the president's staff.    "The aim of the published decrees is to raise contract  discipline and achieve the honoring of responsibilities before  each other and before the state", the chairman noted, adding  that the decrees would be fully implemented by the Central Bank.    The only thing that might have given rise to the rumours of  his opposition, said Gerashchenko, was his comment, made at a  recent meeting of the government, that the system of final  editing of decrees and documents could be improved. He said the  government should avoid changing documents which have already  been fully prepared, since that might lead to some  misunderstandings.</p>

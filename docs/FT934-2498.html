			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Last of Britain's pit ponies to be put out to pasture Britain's last deep-mine pit ponies are to be put out to pasture by the end of March when the final eight are to be made redundant at Ellington colliery in Northumberland, Chris Tighe writes. Ponies have been working in British mines for two centuries, and their use grew rapidly from 1860 when women and children were forbidden from working underground. In 1913, there were 68,000 ponies in mines from Kent to Scotland. In spite of the increasing mechanisation of coal mining, ponies have continued to play an important role at many collieries. At Sacriston pit in County Durham they were used until eight years ago, being led out for the last time (above) in 1985. At Ellington the pit ponies work up to seven miles out under the North Sea pulling tubs of salvaged steel girders. At present they live about 300 feet underground in their stables, with a round-the-clock team of horsekeepers and a number of fat, mouse-eating cats for company. Each pony is assigned to a three-man team of miners and works the 8.30am to 3.15pm shift. They have one week's holiday a year above ground. Contrary to mythology, they are not blind. By spring, British Coal hopes to have found all eight, mares and geldings aged from nine to 20, suitable homes. However, the ponies cannot be ridden because they have never been broken in. 'There's a great feeling of comradeship between man and pony,' said Mr Ian Lavery, NUM miners' union lodge secretary at Ellington, where 650 men, more than half the human workforce, are to lose their jobs by 1996. There would be mixed feelings and sadness at the ponies going, he said, but they had been well cared for. He added: 'British Coal probably look after the ponies better than their own men.'</p>

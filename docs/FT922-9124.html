			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Tough choices now kitty is bare: The German people are resisting the costs of reunification The sight of rotting garbage piling up in normally immaculate marketplaces, of empty trams, cancelled trains and silent airports, has done more to worry the world about the state of Germany than a barrage of budget deficit statistics. Throw in the rise of right-wing parties in the polls, the palpable confusion in the heart of the ruling coalition, left-wing riots on the streets of Berlin, and the apparent collapse of government resistance to trade union pressure in the latest public sector strike, and it all adds up to an image of a Germany in serious crisis. From the inside, it does not look so catastrophic. To be sure, there is a malaise in the land. In a country which has become used to steadily rising material well-being, there is a gloomy conviction that it cannot go on for ever. There is also a dawning awareness of the challenge ahead of uniting a country divided not just ideologically but psychologically for 40 years. But it is not yet a crisis. Take the public sector strike, 11 days of severe disruption to the life of ordinary citizens, the first such stoppage in 18 years, and the worst in the public sector since the war. It may have caused consternation to the outside world, but ordinary Germans took it in their stride. It was a thorough inconvenience to be without trams and buses, without garbage collection and with erratic mail services. The overwhelming response was to get on with the job as best one could. There were very few incidents of picket-line violence. There was a surprising degree of public sympathy for the strikers. Bicycle shops and car hire companies did a roaring trade. 'In such a situation, the Germans have proved far more relaxed than in the old days,' says Mr Jochen Thies, editor of Europa Archiv, a foreign policy magazine. 'In the 1950s and 1960s it would have been much more traumatic. The fact that we were able to handle a strike of almost two weeks is a sign of being very normal. We were not crying for the state to intervene, as we would have in the past.' As for the 5.4 per cent strike settlement, which comes against a background of doom-laden warnings of rising inflation, bankrupt budgets, and which stands as a red rag to the Bundesbank to hike its interest rates once more, it is all being taken with remarkable equanimity in the finance houses of Frankfurt. 'Naturally the deal is too high in terms of what we can afford overall, in the economy and for the public purse,' says Mr Jurgen Pfister, head of economic research at Commerzbank. 'But look at last year, when it was 7 per cent. It would have been naive to expect that after that we could get it down to 4. Even if 5.4 is too high, it is not so bad in those terms.' He adds: 'The stock market is not bothered. Investors discounted the strike. People are still looking a bit anxiously at the Bundesbank. The commercial banks have put their own rates up and put a squeeze on credit. If it were just a question of prices, wages and the exchange rate, it would be five to one against any interest rate increase. The only negative sign is the money supply.' Last week, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, sought to discourage the 'almost daily debate and discussion of the last and next decision of the central bank; monetary policy is in our view fundamentally a medium and long-term business'. He gave no hint of any intention to increase rates but he did warn that, with money supply growth running at an annual rate of 8 per cent in the first quarter, it was 'too early for any monetary all-clear signal'. This gives little encouragement to other European governments which are seeking to cut their own interest rates to stimulate growth. The unruffled response in Frankfurt was expressed by Mr Hans-Helmut Kotz at the Deutsche Girozentrale. 'The strike was obviously unnecessary,' he says. 'The end result could have been agreed with less damage. But there is no serious economic damage, and the figure is exactly what we have already written into our spreadsheets: around 5.5 to 6 per cent. It is still a significant slowdown on last year.' And yet there is a mood of growing unease in the country, a fear of economic recession, a disaffection with the political establishment, and a rising protest vote in the polls for the fringe groups like the radical right and the Greens. Yesterday's poll by the Allensbach opinion research institute revealed that the numbers showing 'anxiety' about the state of affairs in the country have risen sharply in the past two months - to 74 per cent in the west, and 80 per cent in in October 1990, the comparable figures were below 40 per cent in the west, and below 50 in the east. As for the main political parties, they are also almost uniformly on the slide: Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU) and the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) are down from 36.6 to 32.2 per cent. The opposition Social Democrats (SPD) are scarcely better on 33.9 per cent, and the Free Democrats (FDP), junior partner in the coalition, have slipped from 12 to 11.6 per cent. In contrast, the right-wing Republicans are up from 4.6 to 8.5 per cent, and the Greens from 10.1 to 10.6 per cent. Both would easily win seats in a future parliament. So what is up? It all comes back to the traumatic process of unification. The euphoria of those days when the Berlin Wall came down has worn off, and only the hangover remains. The trouble was that the German people were persuaded - at least in the west - that they would not have a hangover. They were told by Mr Kohl that it could be done for free. And now they are bitter that they are beginning to pay a real price in the form of higher taxes, higher prices and lower pay rises. Reunification requires such financial sacrifice, but also change in ingrained thinking. Old assumptions die hard. Last week a middle-ranking civil servant gazed morosely at his lunchtime asparagus, and complained about his pay. 'If the government is only prepared to pay 4.8 per cent to higher officials, that means I am going to get practically nothing above the rate of inflation,' he declared. His unstated assumption was that, whatever the state of the budget or the national economy, he deserved a real pay rise above inflation every year. The strike tells the same story. The conviction of the trade unions is that only their members - the little people - are paying the cost of unification. They point to the string of record profits recorded last year by almost all the big banks and manufacturers, as they reaped the windfall of new (subsidy-financed) spending in the east. Chancellor Kohl has simply failed to get it across to the great mass of the population that the kitty is bare. It is partly his fault, because he promised unification could be accomplished without tax increases. It is partly because nobody seems to want to hear. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, insists that the central government deficit can be brought down from DM45bn (Pounds 15.3bn) this year to DM25bn in 1995. His colleague Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister, has suggested the deficit could equally rise to DM55bn over the same period. The public sector strike settlement in itself may not be too disastrous. It will add DM16bn to total public sector spending, including the postal system and railways. The cost to the central government alone will be DM2.3bn. That is close enough to what was allowed for. What is more serious is what comes next. Industry is next in line for a bruising battle, with IG Metall, the mighty engineering trade union, IG Bau, the construction workers, and IG Druck, the printers, all calling warning strikes or working to rule in support of their pay claims. The government's 5.4 per cent (or 5.1 per cent if it is averaged over the full 12 months) will almost inevitably become the floor below which no new deal can be done. The public sector pay deal 'ignores the economic realities and the financial constraints on the public purse', the German industry federation (BDI) said yesterday. 'It is damaging to the whole economy, and can in no way be a yardstick for the coming wage agreements in the industrial sector.' That would appear a forlorn hope. The other concern lies at the heart of government - central government, the states, even the communes. There is a doubt that they have the political will to bring their combined deficits under control. The truth is that for years Germany has succeeded in buying itself the consensus on which its coalition governments, and its social and industrial harmony, depends. 'We have thrown a lot of money at problems in the last two years alone,' says Mr Thomas Kielinger, editor of the Rheinische Merkur, a weekly newspaper. 'There was the Gulf war, unification, eastern Europe. We now have to choose options and set priorities. That will require a new awakening and this society will have to review its agenda. 'That is a tall order to ask of people used to having money left over to throw at problems. They feel threatened by the advent of the need to make choices.' Given that challenge, clear leadership is required. That is where Chancellor Kohl, with his instinctive commitment to the consensual school of coalition government, is under fire. The Allensbach poll shows a leap from 14 per cent to 22 per cent in the last month of those saying government is too weak. Yet Germans are torn on the issue. Would they have preferred a government which stood up to the unions, and smashed them, like Mrs Margaret Thatcher did in Britain? 'No, we had enough of that sort of leadership with Hitler,' one senior diplomat said on Thursday after the settlement. 'Chancellor Kohl hasn't come out of this too badly.' That view is common enough in Germany, which means the country has probably got the government it deserves and wants: a muddled coalition which does not threaten anyone. It is the mentality revealed by a government negotiator as he emerged from Thursday's pay talks: 'We are damned to agreement.'</p>

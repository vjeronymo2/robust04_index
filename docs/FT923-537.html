			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Gains tax far too high, says think tank CAPITAL gains tax is 'seriously flawed' and the rate at which it is levied should be halved in order to increase revenues, according to the Institute of Economic Affairs, the free-market think tank, Emma Tucker writes. Five analysts of tax systems say in an IEA pamphlet published yesterday that the existing UK rate of 40 per cent - among the highest in the world - may be more than twice the rate that would maximise government revenue. 'The tax yield from CGT in Britain would probably increase substantially if the rate were cut to 20 per cent or less,' they write. The IEA claims that every instance of a capital gains tax rate cut in the US has been 'rapidly followed by a significant increase in capital gains realisations and by higher taxes paid on those gains'. It accuses Lord Lawson, who as chancellor was responsible for 1988 reforms of capital gains tax, of ignoring supply-side arguments that lower taxes would boost activity and hence revenue. The pamphlet's authors argue that the taxation of venture capital is heavy - even prohibitive - in the UK, a fact which gives other countries in the European Community a competitive advantage.

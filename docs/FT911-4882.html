			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Italy's Republicans caught between principle and the wilderness THE decision by Italy's small Republican party not to support the five-party coalition, within which it has helped govern the country since 1983, is surprising even by Italian political standards. It followed the party's refusal last weekend to accept the three ministries offered in Mr Giulio Andreotti's new government, and reflects Republican leaders' fury at what they see as the premier's bad faith. Although the Republicans held only three ministries under the previous government, which collapsed last month, they had not expected Mr Andreotti both to change those posts and sharply reduce the powers of one of the new ministries under offer. Mr Andreotti's task in forming a government - his seventh and Italy's 50th since the Second World War - has been complicated by the need to find room for the left wing of his own Christian Democratic party which has decided to end its self-imposed exile from government posts begun in 1990. The Republicans, however, may also have invited trouble within their own ranks by excluding Mr Oscar Mammi, the long-serving minister for posts and telecommunications, from their ministerial candidates. They replaced him with Mr Giuseppe Galasso on the grounds that Mr Mammi had enjoyed enough ministerial exposure. That decision incensed Mr Mammi, whose ministry has been growing in importance because of the role it will play in rationalising the country's private broadcasting bonanza by allocating frequencies. It also provoked a substantial row inside the party. However, their 40-5 vote on Monday not to support the new government shows that Republican party leaders are reserving their ire for Mr Andreotti. The party has still to clarify whether it will vote against his new government when it presents itself to parliament today, or just abstain. Whichever way it jumps, a four-party coalition without the Republicans could still muster enough parliamentary support to survive. So are the Republicans in danger of shooting themselves in the foot? The party, which stands out because of its commitment to lower public spending and more disciplined government in general, has long enjoyed an intellectual weight appreciably greater than its relatively small electoral size. In the June 1987 general election, its share of the vote shrank to 3.7 per cent, against 5.1 per cent four years earlier. The 1983 elections marked a high point for the party, which was still basking in the prestige provided by the 18-month stint of its then leader, Mr Giovanni Spadolini, as Italy's first non-Christian Democratic prime minister since the war. Since then, the Republicans' political influence has waned, despite Mr Spadolini's move from party secretary to president of the Senate in July 1987. It is his successor, Mr Giorgio La Malfa, who is now in the limelight. Despite offering his resignation following the debacle over the new ministries, he looks set to stay in the saddle. He and his senior party colleagues now face a new dilemma in their perennial struggle to maintain an independent identity while sharing in government, without being crushed by the Christian Democrats and the Socialists. They must now decide whether the stress on principle and independence they want to show by remaining outside the coalition might instead increase the dangers of their own extinction. MR GIULIO ANDREOTTI'S new government was yesterday set to be a coalition of four parties, rather than the five which have ruled the country since 1983. Amid a hectic round of meetings between President Francesco Cossiga and political leaders yesterday, the emphasis was on minimising the effect of the Republican party's refusal to participate in the coalition. Last night Mr Andreotti's Christian Democrats joined their Socialist, Social Democrat and Liberal partners in agreeing to carry on as a four-party government. At the same time, the Christian Democrats issued a renewed call to the Republicans to reconsider their decision. However, the uncertainty caused has prompted Mr Andreotti to postpone to today the new government's presentation before parliament. So far, only the small, far-right Movimento Sociale Italiano has called for an early election in response to the crisis.</p>

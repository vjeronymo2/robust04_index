			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, April 14 (XINHUA) -- The shareholding  system has become a new force in advancing the development of  the Pudong area in East Shanghai.    In 1990, the central government approved the opening of  China's first stock exchange center in Pudong. Now the center  has 501 member companies, with 152 kinds of stocks listed. It  became the country's largest stock market in 1993 when its  business volume reached 500 billion yuan.    To date, 27 companies in Pudong have had their stocks  listed.  They raised 15 billion yuan through issuing stocks, relieving  the fund shortage to some extent.    The Lujiazui financial and trade district is accelerating  the  construction of some one hundred commercial buildings and  business centers.    The Jinqiao manufacturing district is also speeding up the  official operation of close to a hundred projects and the  construction of 200 other projects. The district is expected to  become a new center of export-oriented industries.    Other listed companies at the Shanghai stock exchange center  also value Pudong as a "golden area". More than half of these  corporations have invested there, with the total sum exceeding  10 billion yuan.    Some large companies listed at the Shenzhen stock exchange  have also made inroads in Pudong.</p>

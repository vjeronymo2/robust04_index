			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "Russian-Chinese Talks in Beijing"] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 26 Jan -- Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev arrives in Beijing Wednesday on a four-day official  visit. This trip, which is regarded here as an important event  in rapidly progressing Chinese-Russian relations, is being made  in line with the accords reached during Russian Federation  President Boris Yeltsin's visit to the PRC in December 1992.    The head of Russia's foreign policy department will hold  talks with his Chinese counterpartue Qian Qichen and will meet  with Jiang Z emin, president of the PRC and general secretary of  the CPC Central Committee, and with Li Peng, premier of the PRC  State Council. One of the main topics to be discussed by the  sides is the preparation of the second top-level Russian-Chinese  meeting, this time in Moscow.    The sides will examine regional and international problems  of  interest to Russia and China as permanent members of the UN  Security Council. It is believed here that the situation in  Northeast Asia, where the nuclear problem of the Korean  Peninsula is most acute, also will not be overlooked.    Key aspects of bilateral relations -- trade-economic and  military-technical cooperation and border questions -- will be  touched on during the talks between Andrey Kozyrev and Qian  Qichen, which are being held within the framework of regular  consultations between the two countries' Foreign Ministries.    The talks are expected to result in the signing of an  intergovernmental agreement on crossing points on the  Russian-Chinese border and also a protocol on consultations  between the Russian Federation and PRC Foreign Ministries.    The Russian minister will address Chinese political experts  at the Institute of People's Diplomacy in Beijing and will visit  the Shenzhen special economic zone in the south of the country,  which is an experimental base in implementing reform and a  policy of openness. He will also visit the ancient capital of  the Middle State -- the city of Xian, the cradle of Chinese  civilization.</p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Tomorrow, the world: Kevin Done examines the restructuring which underpins Ford's ambitions to become a global car company Ford, the world's second-largest vehicle maker, yesterday threw down the gauntlet to its rivals in the auto industry. For the first time in its history it is seeking to become a global corporation, breaking down the national and regional barriers that have blocked its drive to create common vehicles for the world market. 'This is a worldwide business that requires the broadest thinking and execution,' Mr Alex Trotman, Ford chairman and chief executive, said yesterday. In a bold move aimed at freeing it from the shackles of its corporate history, Ford is planning to move to a single set of processes and systems throughout its product development, manufacturing, supply and sales activities. If it succeeds, Ford will set new benchmarks that will be hard for most of its competitors to match. All the world's carmakers face the same challenge of trying to increase the efficiency of their enormous investment programmes, while at the same time producing a greater diversity of products. They must increase the speed at which they can bring products to the market while jumping into emerging markets, be it for multi-purpose vehicles, sport-utility vehicles or micro cars. They must squeeze their massive materials purchasing bills by moving to global sourcing for parts and systems. What they can no longer afford in a world of overcapacity and shrinking margins is the luxury of duplication. It is too wasteful, for instance, to develop an Escort-sized car for Europe, and in parallel to develop a similar but yet entirely different vehicle for North America. With its deeply entrenched traditions of independent regional fiefdoms that is exactly what Ford has been doing, but now it is calling a halt. Ford's problem - and one that it has in common with General Motors, its arch domestic rival and the world's biggest vehicle maker - is that it carries a much heavier burden from its history than its more agile Japanese rivals. The big Japanese players, Toyota, Nissan and Honda, have only been moving into world markets in a significant way in the past 20 years. With the benefits of modern communications, their organisations have been more streamlined. Essentially the same car has been sold in all markets around the world. A Toyota Corolla is little different whether it is sold in North America, Europe or Japan. In its main features it is designed and engineered only once, even though it is assembled in four continents. By contrast, Ford of Europe and General Motors Europe have developed as fully fledged independent vehicle makers. For many years most of their products have been designed, developed and engineered solely for the European market, perhaps with some exports to the rest of the world. They have duplicated rather than complemented their parent organisations in North America. In its corporate revolution Ford plans to create Ford Automotive Operations, which will effectively merge its European and North American operations as well as its automotive components group into a single operating unit. In place of its largely independent regional companies, Ford is reorganising itself along global product lines through five vehicle programme centres (VPCs), four in North America and one in Europe. The European VPC, with its research and engineering centres split as now between the UK and Germany, is to become responsible for small and medium frontwheel drive cars. This will be a worldwide responsibility and will include the manufacturing plants around the world building such vehicles, whether in the US, Mexico or Europe. It will cover the development of Fiesta, Escort and Mondeo-sized cars in Europe and in North America. Headquartered in the US at Ford's research and engineering centre in Dearborn, near Detroit, Michigan, will be the other four vehicle programme centres: for large frontwheel drive cars, such as the Ford Taurus, for rearwheel drive cars such as the Ford Crown Victoria, but ultimately, too, the Jaguar range, though Jaguar will maintain resources in the UK, for personal-use trucks, such as the Ford Windstar multi-purpose vehicle, and for commercial trucks. This VPC in North America, for example, would take over responsibility for the development of the highly successful Ford Transit van from Europe. 'By integrating all our automotive processes and eliminating duplication of effort, we will use our creative and technical resources most effectively,' said Mr Trotman yesterday. He claimed that Ford's new way of doing business would provide customers with a broader array of vehicles in most markets and would ensure that the group was fully competitive in quality and value against the best in the world. At the same time the simplification of engineering, purchasing and other processes would 'substantially reduce the cost of operating the automotive business'. Ford estimated the potential cost-saving from the reorganisation of at least Dollars 2bn-Dollars 3bn a year by the end of the decade. The group has been feeling its way for more than a decade towards ways of increasing the global punch of its organisation. Its top management has long been tantalised by the holy grail of the so-called world car, and by the savings that should be achieved by developing a product once for both manufacture and sale in different continents. It tried in the late 1970s with a common programme for Ford Escorts in Europe and in North America, but the cars launched at the beginning of the 1980s ended up with little more in common than the name and the blue FORD oval badge on the bonnet. Ford has come closer in the past few years with the Mondeo world car programme, a Dollars 6bn attempt to develop a largely common car to replace both the Sierra in Europe and the Ford Tempo/Mercury Topaz in North America. This car, launched in Europe early last year and this year in North America, is the biggest roll of the dice in Ford's history in terms of the financial resources it has consumed. The six-year Mondeo programme was the most ambitious and costly programme undertaken by the US vehicle maker. Ford had to reform its engineering and manufacturing infrastructure in America and Europe to break down entrenched barriers between the two in order to develop in Europe a mainstream car acceptable in both markets. The Mondeo/Ford Contour/Mercury Mystique is being assembled at Ford's Genk plant in Belgium, at Kansas City in the US, and in Mexico. The same family of four-cylinder engines is being made at plants in Bridgend in the UK and at Cologne in Germany for Europe, and at Chihuahua in Mexico for North America. A top-of-the-range aluminium V6 engine is being made at Cleveland, Ohio, for both the US and European-produced cars. Manual transmissions are being made in Europe at Halewood, Merseyside, in the UK, and at Cologne, while an electronically controlled, four-speed automatic gearbox is being made in the US. After a global search, common component producers have been chosen to supply both the European and North American assembly plants. Mondeo was the one-off programme that began to show the way forward for Ford. Now the lessons are to be institutionalised throughout its organisation. Product development in North America and Europe will become fully integrated with the five vehicle programme centres. They will have specific worldwide responsibilities and will report to one product development executive. Supporting the changes in the product development process, Ford's manufacturing, purchasing and marketing and sales operations will each become integrated worldwide. An automotive strategy office will co-ordinate strategic planning. These are huge steps and will take several years to complete, but they are still only the first steps. Looming on the Ford agenda are the issues of how it should integrate Mazda into this new organisation, its loss-making 25 per cent-owned affiliate in Japan. And how it should tackle the integration of its Latin American operations, where the group owns 49 per cent of Autolatina, with Volkswagen of Germany controlling 51 per cent. In both cases it must take into account the sensitivities of its partners, and they must wait for tomorrow. The merger of Ford Europe and North America is more than enough for today.  ---------------------------------------------           AUTOMOTIVE PROFIT (LOSS)  --------------------------------------------- by region Dollars m          1992       1993  --------------------------------------------- Canada                       (200)      (91)  --------------------------------------------- US                           (400)    1,500  --------------------------------------------- Europe excl Jaguar                  (647)     (407)  --------------------------------------------- Europe incl Jaguar                (1,288)     (960)  --------------------------------------------- Latin America                 211       459  --------------------------------------------- Asia Pacific and other                     148        50  --------------------------------------------- Total foreign automotive                 (1,129)     (542)  --------------------------------------------- Financial services worldwide                   1,043     1,600  ---------------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------------                   FACTORY SALES  --------------------------------------------- WORLDWIDE '000 UNITS                 1993  --------------------------------------------- Cars US                            1,950 Cars Canada                          126  --------------------------------------------- Total cars                         2,077  --------------------------------------------- Trucks US                          1,876 Trucks Canada                        126  --------------------------------------------- Total trucks                       2,002  --------------------------------------------- Total US &amp; Canada                  4,078  --------------------------------------------- Germany                              831 UK                                   422 Spain                                211 Taiwan                               114 Mexico                                91 Australia                            127 Japan                                 53 Other                                 37  --------------------------------------------- Total overseas                     1,886  --------------------------------------------- Total worldwide factory sales                       5,964  ---------------------------------------------</p>

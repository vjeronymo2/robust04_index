			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Veronika Romanenkova] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 27 TASS -- Judging by the intensity with  which specialists of the Russian research centre Kurchatovskiy  Institute, and their colleagues from the United States, Germany,  France and Japan are working on a new project, all nuclear power  plants will be disaster proof in a few years. Vice-President of  the Kurchatovskiy Institute Ponomarev-Stepnoy told ITAR-TASS the  theoretical part of the project is nearing completion and the  first experiments will be carried out using simulators in a year  or two.    The project aims to develop a multi-tier system of nuclear  plant protection with the help of which all radioactive  emissions will be "trapped".    Even if the worst happens and the reactor active zone melts  as it did in Chernobyl, specialists are sure that the heightened  radioactivity will never leave the boundaries of the reactor  proper.    The problem of safety in nuclear-power engineering is one of  the most acute now when Russia is marking the fortieth  anniversary of its first nuclear power station. In the first  six months of this year, sixteen incidents were reported at nine  Russian nuclear power stations (down from nineteen in the same  period last year). If the world average emergency protection  incidents are to be viewed as a unit, Russia's index equals  0.79. And although most of such incidents entails no  irradiation or pollution of the environment, and the number of  incidents is decreasing from year to year, researchers and  engineers are far from resting on their laurels.    Disruptions are unavoidable in principle in the operation of  nuclear power stations, as in any technical system. This is why  the main task is to minimise their effects. It is simply  impossible to give up nuclear power engineering. The 29 nuclear  power units in Russia provide approximately 13 per cent of all  the electric energy consumed in the country, its share being 25  per cent in central Russia, more than forty per cent in  north-western Russia and up to 70 per cent in the Kola Peninsula.    Russia is now carrying out a set of measures to ensure  greater safety of its nuclear power plants. Many of them are  being modernised, new equipment is being installed, including  simulators to upgrade the skills of the operators.    At the beginning of the twenty-first century many units  which  will have exhausted their resource by then will have to be shut  down and dismantled. This refers first of all to the Leningrad  and Kursk power stations, where the Chernobyl-type reactors are  being used, and the Novovoronezh and Kola nuclear power  stations, which use the water-water reactors.    Vice-President of the Rosenergoatom concern Yevgeniy  Ignatenko said in an interview with ITAR-TASS that a new  generation reactors will replace the old ones, including on fast  neutrons. A special decision will have to be made every time,  proceeding from the price of the reactor and its effectiveness.</p>

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC proposes using satellites to spy on fishing THE European Commission yesterday proposed using spy satellites to track fishing vessels suspected of breaching quotas in EC waters. Surveillance of all boats longer than 10m in length would be phased in from early next year to the end of 1995, according to the Commission. The idea is to strengthen monitoring of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) to protect depleted fish stocks in the face of 'chronic overcapacity' of EC fleets, an EC official said. In addition, the Commission would like to introduce a new licence regime for fishing vessels, applicable to all boats at high sea and in Community and third country waters. The new licensing regime will apply to all Community and foreign vessels operating in EC waters. The principle of reserved access inside the 12-mile limit would remain intact. In line with the new emphasis in Brussels on 'subsidiarity' - devolving decision-making to the lowest appropriate level - the Commission stressed that member states will be responsible for operating the proposed new regime. However, Commission inspectors would ensure that the CFP rules are applied equitably throughout the Community. Separately, Mr Manuel Marin, the Spanish Commissioner responsible for the CFP, appears to have retreated from his plan for the Commission to decide the annual break-down of fishing quotas and the total allowable catch (TAC). This would have implied a transfer of power from the Council, a course not acceptable in the present political climate where any move by the Commission to extend its authority is viewed with suspicion. A Commission official said yesterday that the rules needed to be tightened because it was clear that the regime operating since 1983 was not adequate. The Commission proposals will be considered in detail at a meeting of EC fishery ministers on October 19. The Commission hopes that the new rules will take effect from 1 January 1993 when the current regime expires.</p>

INA's correspondent in the governorate cited informed  sources  as saying the two flares burned out before reaching the ground  without causing any damage.    It is worth mentioning that the Ninawa Governorate includes  the archaeological city of al-Hadar. The first al-Hadar  festival opened on 14 April with the participation of dozens of  Arab and foreign art groups.</p>

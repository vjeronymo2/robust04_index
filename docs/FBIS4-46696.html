			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vitaliy Karpenko, editor in chief of VECHIRNIY </F> KYYIV, under the rubric "Column of the Editor in Chief":  "President Torpedoes Elections"]    [Text] The Message of the President of Ukraine to the  Supreme Council of Ukraine has been published. There would be  nothing peculiar about it--it is the right of the president to  address anybody with any words--were it not for certain nuances  which make this document somewhat strange.    First, the president is appealing to a Supreme  Council whose election was undesirable for him; this was shown  by his appearances on television before the elections when,  instead of appealing to the population to come to the polling  stations and do their civic duty, he started to consider in  public whether a parliament would be elected or not, and whether  it would be full-fledged or not if it in fact was elected.  Naturally, many people interpreted this step as a signal to the  effect that the election to the Supreme Council was a secondary  thing, and that it was not necessary to turn out for it.  However, contrary to the prophecies and efforts of certain  forces to frustrate the election, it was held, and the Supreme  Council, although not its full membership, was elected after  all. This is why the presidential message to it sounds somewhat  hypocritical.    Second, the president is addressing the supreme  legislative organ of the country for the one and only purpose of  postponing the next presidential elections, which, incidentally,  are already going ahead full tilt; there are already candidates  for the post of president who have collected the necessary  number of citizens' votes in their support. This is happening  after the president--to be sure, under pressure from the  population and the threat of a miners' strike--himself agreed to  the early elections but suddenly changed his position.    Third, the president himself agreed to run for  another term, having previously announced publicly that he would  not take part in the early elections and reversed his position  yet again by then.    Such, putting it mildly, inconsistency is not random: It is  the main trait of our president. Any number of examples can be  given, but let us recall the most characteristic one when,  heading to negotiations with Yeltsin in Massandra, our president  had in hand the proposals for the even division of the Black Sea  Fleet between Ukraine and Russia that had been developed by  professionals, but at the last hour suddenly changed his mind  and agreed to sell Ukraine's part of the fleet to the adjacent  state. This is precisely what became the main reason that  Morozov, minister of defense of Ukraine at the time and an  honest and principled man, felt compelled to resign.    However, let us revisit the content of the message.    In substantiating the undesirability of early presidential  elections, the president referred to three aspects--political,  economic, and legal. The president thinks that, in terms of the  political aspect, early elections will not only fail  to consolidate the state but will also polarize political forces  and exacerbate their confrontation.    Well, it is no secret that the struggle in the elections  will  be between various political forces. However, this is precisely  what democratic elections provide for, and it is the will of the  people to make a particular force preponderant. The state may be  consolidated precisely during the elections if the people make a  specific program preponderant, for example, the idea of rallying  all national-patriotic forces on the basis of the results of the  1991 referendum--this will be the consolidation of the state all  right.    On the contrary, the postponement of the early elections,  which the president desires, will not only tighten the noose  around the neck of Ukraine, as the well-known economist  Volodymyr Chernyak aptly indicated, but may also cause a social  explosion. So, let us recall that the decision on early  presidential elections was made on the initiative of and under  pressure from the miners. Is it really necessary for them to  also become the guarantors of holding the elections, assembling  once again in front of the Supreme Council or the presidential  residence?    Further on the president intimidates us with the possibility  of the election campaign bringing about the federalization and  dismemberment of Ukraine. This is not quite comprehensible, if  for no other reason than because none other than our president  comes out in favor of establishing special economic zones in  Ukraine, thus creating a nutritive medium for the idea of  federalization; none other than our president saw through a law  on the autonomization of the Crimea during his tenure as  chairman of the Supreme Council; it was his subsequent apathetic  and passive position with regard to the development of events in  the Crimea that caused the Crimea to be virtually lost to  Ukraine.    As far as the economic aspect is concerned, the  president believes that the June elections may "bring about the  destruction of the instruments of state influence on the  condition of the economy." However, it was precisely this "state  influence" that brought about the current condition of our  economy and the impoverishment of the people. It has been  commonly recognized that reforms are not advancing in Ukraine.  Nor will they advance because they are not advantageous for the  supreme echelon of power, which to this day advocates this  "state influence" on the economy which makes it possible for  this echelon to effect, under the guise of privatization, the  redistribution of public property in its favor. By now it has  become clear to all that economic reforms will only advance once  profound political reform has been implemented. The June  presidential and local elections are the first step toward the  reform and the change of power which Ukraine desperately needs  at present.    The largest section of the presidential message is devoted  to  the legal aspect of the consequences of the  forthcoming early elections. It contains discourse and thoughts;  however, once again, everything is subordinated to proving the  truth--the only one to the mind of the president--that the  elections are infeasible. He said that the Constitution should  first be adopted, the status of the president should be  determined, and only later should elections be considered.  Certainly, the Constitution should be adopted, but it would be  feasible for it to be adopted by a Constitutional Assembly or a  Constitutional Convention elected for this purpose alone rather  than the Supreme Council, which is objectively interested in a  Constitution "tailored to itself." However, in either event the  adoption of the Constitution is a complex and lengthy process;  if we were to follow the president, the Constitution may be in  the process of adoption for so long that the state of Ukraine  itself may no longer exist.    In summation, let us ask this question: To whom is it  advantageous to postpone the early presidential and local  elections? Which forces stand to win by this? If we proceed from  the fact that the forthcoming elections are nothing but a form  of the aggravation of the struggle for the redistribution of  power and property (or property and power), it will become  understandable that postponing the elections means conserving  the current authorities headed by the president for a period of  time and giving them an opportunity to grow stronger and to  complete "grab-it-ization." It is not early presidential  elections that are a factor of instability in our state but  rather the inconsistency of the president, the ineffectiveness  of his policy, and the fact that an integrated effective program  to overcome the crisis and develop Ukraine has not even been  developed in three years.    It is hard to predict what stance the Supreme Council will  take with regard to the message. However, if it were to follow  the president's lead it would, first, be guilty of a  transgression against the miners who have ensured this early  election and, second, would exacerbate the political and  economic agony of the state, the possible outcome of which is  easy to predict. However the June elections might end, they are  acutely necessary from the political, economic, and social  standpoints. Ukraine must go through these elections. There is  no other way. Virtually all states of Eastern Europe, in which  several governments and parliaments have changed over these  years, have travelled this painful path. As you can see, Ukraine  is late on this score, too. The mistake needs to be corrected,  and the frustration of the June elections should not be allowed  to occur, no matter how this frustration might be packaged for  us.</p>

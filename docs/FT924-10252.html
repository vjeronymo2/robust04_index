			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / What future for Coal?: Review sparks nuclear reaction - A nervous sector is preparing its case for survival AS Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, tries to find more room in the energy market for coal, he is making the nuclear power industry nervous. Dogged by controversy and high costs, its members sense that the industry may be a ready candidate for scaling back, and the fact that the UK's earliest reactors are approaching the end of their lives anyway provides a convenient excuse for replacing them with coal. Also, since the nuclear industry is one of the few energy sectors left in public ownership, it is available for manipulation by the government. But the nuclear industry will fight back. Within hours of the announcement of Mr Heseltine's review, Mr Bob Hawley, Nuclear Electric's chief executive, was promoting its virtues. To cut nuclear power, he said, would be a 'quick fix' that would ignore the industry's long-term benefits. This week the Nuclear Forum, the industry's trade group, launched its own campaign. Nuclear's case is built largely on claiming to provide the cheapest large-scale electricity supplies in the long term. It is also environmentally friendlier than fossil fuel and could help the coal industry by offsetting heavy emissions. At present, nuclear accounts for about 20 per cent of the electricity generated in the UK, and its share is rising fast. It is produced mainly by Nuclear Electric, with 12 stations in England and Wales, and Scottish Nuclear, which has a further two plants. NE operates at a heavy loss, as it was incorporated by the government without financial provisions to decommission its nuclear reactors. The deficit is made up by a Pounds 1.3bn levy on electricity bills which is due to be phased out by 1998, although NE hopes to be making a profit before then. Scottish Nuclear has provisions and already makes a modest profit. The real question facing Mr Heseltine is whether coal has a stronger claim to subsidy than nuclear power. Although the latter claims to produce some of the cheapest electricity available, that has been challenged by its competitors. Professor Peter Jones, a consultant to Nuclear Forum, says nuclear would be able to generate power at 3p a kilowatt hour by the year 2000. Other power generators estimate that NE's costs are anywhere between 3.5p and 8p a kWh, compared with less than 3p for coal-fired power stations. They maintain that keeping nuclear going at coal's expense is vastly uneconomic. It would be more sensible to phase out the early stations rather than extend their lives, as seemed to be the government's plan until recently. Mr Hawley vigorously denies the figures. The early stations, he says, have had all their costs written off and are generating electricity at a mere 1.2p a kWh. It would be crazy, he says, to shut down such a cheap power source, particularly since that might lead to higher energy imports. The Treasury would also have to stump up decommissioning costs running into billions. It is not just a question of whether existing stations should be phased out, but also whether additional ones should be built. That is central to the nuclear industry's argument that it can become truly economic only if allowed to build many stations to achieve economies of scale. NE makes much of the fact that the only station under construction, Sizewell B in Suffolk, is ahead of schedule and on budget. Although its cost is a huge Pounds 2bn, the station should be able to generate power for 3.8p a kWh, according to Mr Hawley. If NE was allowed to build a proposed Sizewell C, the generating cost would fall below 3p. Those figures, though, are based on financing costs of 5 per cent for B and 8 per cent for C. Other power generating projects being planned in the private sector assume 12 per cent. 'Where would Nuclear Electric get money at 8 per cent?' asks a senior electricity industry executive. Mr Stephen Ogle, NE's financial control director, says finance would be available either from the government, with its new interest in large job-creating projects, or from the private sector, which, he maintains, is showing signs of overcoming its suspicions about nuclear power. Mr Heseltine's review comes too soon for nuclear power. The government had previously promised to review the industry in 1994, and both NE and Scottish Nuclear were gearing up for then: Sizewell B would be up and running, the sector's financial performance would have improved, and the environmental case might have strengthened. If nuclear does now face the axe, it will argue that it has not been given a fair chance to prove its case.</p>

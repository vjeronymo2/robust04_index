			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Fewer punters flock to BT3 sale RETAIL investors have shown a weaker appetite for the latest offer of BT shares than they did in the previous sale in 1991. With applications closing yesterday morning, they had applied for at least 800m shares, representing 1.3 times the minimum number of shares offered by the government. In 1991 the subscription rate was 1.6 times with applications for 1.7bn shares chasing the 1.05bn sold. The Share Information Office and larger share shops reported around 1.4m applications, although this figure could rise a little after the final count. The government has earmarked 600m shares for UK retail investors, half of the 1.2bn new BT shares in total on offer but has retained the right to raise this figure to 67 per cent. Institutional shareholders have made bids for more than 1.2bn, equal twice the number offered at the moment. Analysts said the Treasury was less likely to claw back more shares from the institutional offer to sell to retail investors. The government will raise more money from the Pounds 5bn sale if it gives institutions, which are paying more for the shares, half of the total allocation. The final decision on allocation will not be taken until tomorrow morning. More than half of BT shareholders and employees have applied for shares compared with 15 per cent in the last sale in 1991. Retail investors have on average applied for 600 shares at a total cost of Pounds 900, which is similar to the last sale. The first instalment for small shareholders is 150p, compared with 160p for institutions. The international offer remains open until 4pm tomorrow. The government will over the weekend announce the price of the third instalment in the partly-paid issue. SG Warburg, the government's global co-ordinator, may buy back the partly paid shares after they start trading on Monday as part of its stabilisation programme to create an orderly after-market. Warburg has warned institutions not to dump their existing shares before the sale in the hope of buying them back cheaply. Analysts say that the lower than usual volume of share trading before the sale shows that the share price is artificially high. Lex, Page 20</p>

			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Hungary cuts value of forint Hungary yesterday lowered the forint by 2.9 per cent, increasing the pace of an exchange rate policy of creeping devaluations, Nicholas Denton reports from Budapest. The National Bank of Hungary, the central bank, passed off the devaluation as a one-off technical move to compensate for the recent appreciation of the US dollar, to which the forint is partly linked. The central bank said that the rate cut was part of this year's strategy of lowering the forint in small steps in line with producer prices. But independent analysts saw yesterday's move as confirming a fundamental softening of the government's policy of maintaining a strong forint to suppress inflation. Yesterday's currency step is the largest for over a year and comes just six weeks after the last, 1.9 per cent devaluation.</p>

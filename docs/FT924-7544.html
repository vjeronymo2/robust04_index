			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Tide against agents Securing a decent distribution network is crucial to the success of any insurer. That is why last week's fine by the regulatory organisation Lautro on Guardian Royal Exchange will not be lost on the rest of the industry. At issue is the future of tied agents, or appointed representatives, to give them their polite title - those insurance salesmen who trade under their own name but who exclusively offer the products of one company. GRE's record fine is a reminder that while independent advisers and direct sales forces have not escaped the wrath of the regulators, tied agents have presented the biggest headaches in the wake of the 1986 Financial Services Act. Life insurers initially fell over each other to sign them up, as polarisation forced intermediaries to choose between genuine independence and attachment to a single supplier. Golden hellos, subsidised development loans and commission advances were features of a typical introductory package. More recently, however, disillusion has set in. According to Lautro, 10 per cent of tied agents on its register were removed in the 12 months to June as companies took a more hard-headed look at the costs associated with these relationships. Low quality business and the complexities of supervision have been among the life companies' complaints. So are embarrassing knuckle wraps from the regulator for inadequate monitoring, of which GRE's is only one example. To be fair to the agents, Lautro is flexing its muscles and some of the fall-out is recession-related. The trend towards direct sales forces, though, shows no sign of slowing.</p>

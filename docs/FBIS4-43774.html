			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, June 16 (CTK) -- All the Visegrad group  countries (the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland)  consider joining NATO and the Western European Union (WEU) a  priority of their foreign policies. The weakening of regional  cooperation in Central Europe could threaten this goal, Slovak  Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan said today.    Czechs, Poles, Slovaks, and Hungarians have created the  Visegrad group to be able to "coordinate their final liberation  from the sphere of influence of the former Soviet Union," Kukan  told a WEU meeting. He said Slovakia considered cooperation  between the Visegrad countries very important. Through good  neighborly relations and cooperation with its neighbors Slovakia  seeks to contribute to stability in Europe as well as to its own  security, he said. However, Bratislava is expecting a similarly  accommodating approach from its neighbors, Kukan stressed. He  admitted that individual Visegrad countries attached different  weight to their mutual cooperation but expressed the conviction  that all of them understood the inevitability of close  cooperation.    Kukan appealed to Western countries' representatives to  speed  up Central Europe's integration into its security structures.  Cooperation with NATO and WEU and the clear prospects of  Slovakia's membership in these organizations is necessary for  the success of economic and democratic reforms in the country.  "The prosperity and security are inseparably connected," he  said, adding that the consequences of the forced division of  Europe would disappear at the time when individual areas on the  continent would have similar security guarantees.    NATO and its European pillar -- WEU are the basis of  European  security. That is why Slovakia is seeking to join these  organizations. "I would like to emphasize that this orientation  is based on the political consensus of all political entities in  the country and on the public support," Kukan said. He pointed  out that Slovakia had proposed that international peace-keeping  and humanitarian forces could train on its territory.    Kukan rejected the view of some deputies that serious  problems existed between Slovakia and Hungary. He also stressed  that the division of the former Czechoslovakia did not mean that  the Slovak population was against European integration. "We are  expecting to join the European Union at the turn of the century,  maybe already as soon as in 2000," Kukan said.</p>

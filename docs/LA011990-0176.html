			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BHAGWAN RAJNEESH DIES AT 58; HEADED ORE. COMMUNE  </P> <P> The Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, the guru who drew thousands of followers to central  Oregon by preaching a blend of Eastern religion, pop psychology and free love,  died today of heart failure, his spokesman said. He was 58.  </P> <P> Rajneesh, known as Osho Rajneesh in recent years, died at his commune in the  southern city of Poona, where he had lived since being deported from the United  States in 1985.  </P> <P> "Osho left his body at 5:30 p.m. The doctors say it's heart failure," spokesman  Swami Kirti said. Disciples carried Rajneesh's body on their shoulders to a  funeral pyre built on a nearby riverbank, and it was cremated, Kirti said.  </P> <P> As the bhagwan, a Hindi word for god, Rajneesh presided over a 64,000-acre  commune in central Oregon from 1981 until 1985, when he pleaded guilty to  violating federal immigration laws.  </P> <P> In its heyday, the commune known as Rajneesh Puram was home to 4,000 red-clad  followers who toiled for 12 hours a day and showered Rajneesh with jewels and  Rolls-Royces that he used for daily drives past lines of singing, clapping  fans.  </P> <P> Residents of nearby communities resented the intrusion, and Rajneesh's top aide  was eventually convicted in an elaborate scheme designed to gain political  control of the county.  </P> <P> Rajneesh pleaded guilty to immigration charges in 1985 and under a plea  agreement received a suspended 10-year sentence, paid a $400,000 fine, and  agreed not to return to the United States for five years without the written  permission of the U.S. attorney general.  </P></p>

Khmer Rouge Lieutenant General Sok Peab told reporters at a  border site 20 kilometers (12 miles) south of Aranyaprathet of  fighting in Battambang and Bantay Meanchey provinces. He said  the Khmer Rouge had received word that the government was  preparing a major offensive for January 5-7, coinciding with the  1979 installation by Vietnam of a friendly government in Phnom  Penh headed by Heng Samrin.    The government has brought up personnel, heavy arms and  tanks  for an offensive in the northern and eastern border provinces,  but Khmer Rouge forces are ready to counter the offensive, Sok  Peab said. [passage omitted]    Sok Peab reported fighting between Khmer Rouge and  government  forces in northeastern Cambodia, within 25 kilometers (15 miles)  of the Thai border. Mortar and artillery fire could be heard at  a great distance from the scene of the battles, he said. He gave  no indication of casualties.</p>

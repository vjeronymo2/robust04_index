The 493-ton vessel, "Igor Maksimov," entered the  Pusan harbor on last Friday carrying 22 Korean-Russian tourists.  The ship was originally scheduled to leave Pusan Sunday  afternoon. But, the Korean agency of a Russian state firm to  which the vessel belongs had the Pusan court distrain the ship  pending the payment of a repair fee. An official of the Korean  agency said on Wednesday "Igor Maksimov" was repaired for one  month last August at Choyang Shipyard at Yong-to, Pusan. But,  the Russian firm failed to pay the repair fee totaling about 35  million won. The vessel has a crew of 23 in addition to the  ethnic Korean passengers.</p>

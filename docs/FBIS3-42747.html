			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Stepanovich Tonchuk, head of Balti </F> municipal administration, by Viktor Starika in Balti (Belts in  Russian, formerly Beltsy); date not given: "The One with the  Most Rights Is Right"]    [Text] I first met Vladimir Tonchuk almost 10 years ago,  after the city party committee had "enlisted" him to "cure" the  chronically ill building materials combine. At that time the  young director-"therapist" was diagnosing the illness. A great  deal depended on the accuracy of the diagnosis. It would decide  whether the enterprise could manage to climb out of debt and the  labor collective could escape the constant threat of poverty and  social disorientation. In the event of an error, the "physician  of record" would be in a hopeless situation. Expulsion from the  CPSU was tantamount to the loss of respect and prestige in  society, however honest and decent a man he may have been. His  knowledge and ability seemed dubious at first, irrespective of  the conditions in which he was doing his work. It is clear,  however, that although personal preferences were rarely  considered at that time, only a courageous man would have agreed  to take charge of a lagging enterprise.    I do not know whether Tonchuk gave this any thought or not.  I  remember that he was completely preoccupied with finding the  reasons for the combine's inefficiency.    He soon found a way out of the impasse and the protracted  economic slump, but this was not the end of his difficulties. It  was much more difficult to carry out his plans when everything  had to be approved and "okayed" from above, and no one even  dared to think about autonomy or the freedom from tutelage the  young director wanted.    Not everyone could or would make the only correct decision  at  a crucial time and assume all of the responsibility for the  consequences. This takes more than physical stamina and a strong  will: It also takes a somewhat prophetic nature. Otherwise,  self-destruction is a distinct possibility.    They say that someone who never takes risks never drinks  champagne. This is only partly true. Risks have to be reasonable  unless a person wants to break his neck.    Tonchuk had checked and rechecked everything, and for this  reason he did not retreat from his own convictions until he had  demonstrated the accuracy of his approach. The collective he  headed climbed out of the hole where it had been buried almost  up to its chin and became the leaseholder of the building  materials combine.    Now almost 10 years have gone by, and this is the fourth  year  that Director V. Tonchuk of the building materials combine has  occupied the biggest, most spacious office in the Balti  municipal government building, with direct telephone lines to  the president and government of the Republic of Moldova. He is  the head of the municipal administration in Balti. My  conversation with him, oddly enough, was about the same kind of  autonomy with which he began his tenure as director of the  building materials combine.    [Starika] Judging by the constant calls from Chisinau, it  appears that there have been no significant changes in  administrative methods in spite of the changes in our country's  economic and political goals. Am I mistaken, Vladimir  Stepanovich?    [Tonchuk] It is easier to exercise rights than to fulfill  obligations. It is easier to change laws than to change human  habits, and the most difficult thing of all is to surmount  bureaucratic obstacles and break through the web of interlocking  interests and long-standing faulty ties and instructions.    [Starika] The human being is an intricate mechanism.  Experience has confirmed, however, that he can be led in  virtually any direction: toward good and evil. We know this from  specific cases and general trends. Remember how a whole nation  turned toward fascism in the 1930s under Hitler's influence....    [Tonchuk] And I will remind you of Stalin's crimes--the  forced collectivization, the firing squads, the prison camps,  and the resulting spiritual corruption.    The effects of Stalinism and the communist totalitarian past  will continue to be felt for a long time. Announcements,  resolutions, and sporadic anti-bureaucratic measures are not  producing the necessary results yet. Every remedy has been  tried, but the illness continues. It is as if we are fighting a  phantom.    [Starika] Are you saying that we will not have  self-government soon?    [Tonchuk] The experience of the last few years has convinced  us that we will have to begin by surmounting not only  doctrinaire obstacles and ideological jingles, but also the  frequent and understandable anxiety caused by changes in rules  and guidelines. We are seeing signs of inflexibility, passive  resistance, and the fear of violating individual and regional  interests, which are often concealed behind pseudo-reformist  verbosity. In the simplest terms, these are signs of a difficult  and sometimes fierce battle between the old and the new, between  statewide interests and emerging private interests.    [Starika] Let us imagine the ideal situation or one close to  the ideal. You, as the head of the municipal administration,  have been entrusted with all of the reins of government. Will  you be able to guarantee the normal economic and political life  of Balti?    [Tonchuk] Life is normal in the city. Residential  neighborhoods have a constant supply of heat and scheduled  supplies of hot water. Vegetables, fruit, dairy products, baked  goods, and other foods are delivered to stores on schedule and  in sufficient quantities. The municipal transport network is  operating without any interruptions.    Believe me, this is not such a simple accomplishment under  present conditions.    [Starika] But what about municipal industry, construction,  and freight deliveries? They are on their last legs, so to  speak....    [Tonchuk] The difficulties all of us have had to endure are  mainly the result of shortages of crude resources, materials,  and money. We have also encountered a form of resistance caused  by conservative tendencies and the inability to act under the  new conditions. Furthermore, this is true of enterprises and of  republic agencies of economic administration.    Measures in priority fields--the economy, education,  medicine, and other socially vital areas--should be coordinated  by the center. All other administrative prerogatives, after  certain sums have been deposited in the republic budget, should  be transferred to the local level. And the main one is the right  to dispose of generated revenue. Incidentally, one such attempt  was already made. In the middle of 1991 the government issued a  provisional statute on so-called municipal self-government. It  was impossible, however, to use this statute as a guide. Each  ministry and department still felt obliged to interfere in  municipal affairs, and particularly in the municipal economy. It  seemed that people there thought they knew more about what we  should be doing here. Therefore, there is no reason yet to think  of the city as an autonomous administrative and economic entity.  This can only be finalized after the passage of the appropriate  laws and, in particular, the strict observance of the law on the  budget.    [Starika] Nevertheless, at the recent conference of  representatives of local government agencies in the north of  Moldova and the heads of regional gas utilities, which was held  in Balti by General Director Boris Karandyuk of the republic  State Department of Gasification, the first step in this  direction seemed to have been taken.    [Tonchuk] It has already become impossible for the  Department  of Gasification to fulfill its obligations or even to exercise  its rights. This is why its powers have been transferred to the  local level. It was a civilized decision. Now we have been  self-reliant for a long time, and others will have to make their  own decisions on the installation of gas supply lines.    Other sectorial ministries should follow the example of this  state department, especially if they cannot give weak  enterprises any help. Let them turn their resources over to the  city, and we will use them wisely.    [Starika] Then we will reach the point at which the Balti  administration will have to conclude its own agreements, on  shipments of apples or cucumbers, for instance, directly with  Glodeani or another region in Moldova.    [Tonchuk] I do not see anything bad about this. The existing  economic, cultural, and other ties between Balti and the  Glodeani, Riskani, Falesti, Floresti, Singerei, and other  regions of the republic and with nearby and distant foreign  countries have proved that it is simpler, easier, and safer to  work without middlemen.    [Starika] In view of this, do you believe it would be  advisable to establish a free economic zone in the northern  region, with all of the ensuing obligations and rights? After  all, it is no secret that dozens of vehicles race from the  regions to Chisinau, burning up tons of scarce and costly fuel,  on every minor pretext, but our problems generally remain  unresolved.    [Tonchuk] I believe this might be a good thing, but I have  no  jurisdiction over the administrative structure of Moldova.    [Starika] Nevertheless, as the head of the administration of  one of Moldova's largest cities, you must have your own opinion.    [Tonchuk] We already have autonomous regions--the  self-proclaimed PMR and the Gagauz Republic....    [Starika] You have misunderstood me, Vladimir Stepanovich. I  am referring to economic self-rule and the obvious benefits this  would mean for an independent, indivisible, and sovereign  Moldova and the people living in it.    [Tonchuk] I am not afraid of defending my own point of view  on any level when I am certain that I am right. As far as the  creation of what you propose, a Balti economic zone or something  similar, is concerned, I can only repeat that I believe this  might be a good thing. As they say, however, we have to be  certain that we are not leaping from the frying pan into the  fire. We are not entitled to any more mistakes. Hasty decisions  can cost too much. We have seen the result of the forced  institution of the official state language and the threats of  certification. We know that the pitiful state of our economy is  a result of severed economic ties with the republics of the  former USSR and the implacability of the Moldovan parliament and  the different parties that blocked the ratification of the  republic treaty on membership in the CIS economic union.    History does not forgive mistakes. It does not allow us to  ignore the laws of economics with impunity. It also does not  tolerate implacability and contempt for the feelings of the  laboring public. This is why we have to hear the voice of the  people and tell the people the truth, even when it is  disturbing. We can see farther from above, but details can be  seen more distinctly from below.    [Starika] Recently the city has made a great effort to  become  a political center as well as the economic and cultural center  of northern Moldova....    [Tonchuk] It is true that political parties have been more  active in our city.    [Starika] As the head of the city government, what kind of  relationship do you have with the parties, to which party do you  belong, and which do you support?    [Tonchuk] None of them, although several have offered me  their hand and heart. They have promised me a place on their  party tickets in the elections for the new parliament.    It takes time to be active in politics, and I do not have  the  time. I hardly have enough time to keep up with municipal  affairs. As for my relationship with the parties and their  leaders, it is as it should be--detached and impartial. I  support those who can do something good for the city and for  Moldova as a whole.    [Starika] What if the party that wins the election does not  care for Tonchuk?    [Tonchuk] Then I will start selling sneakers....    [Starika] But seriously?    [Tonchuk] I am an engineer, and I am not afraid of  resigning.  Besides, people today are being judged on their ability instead  of their political views.    [Starika] It seems to me, however, that the upcoming power  struggle will not bypass Balti and the head of its  administration.    [Tonchuk] Fights, arguments, and conflicts have always been  part of our life. We have to be ready for them. It is difficult  to imagine that they will disappear someday.    We are instituting reform in a time of dramatic  difficulties.  This is just like making major repairs on a ship in a severe  storm. I am certain, however, that the storm will soon be over  and we will finish the repairs. The Moldovan state will be  strong, capable, and just. It will have the respect of its  citizens and, in turn, it will respect their dignity and  beliefs. I have to repeat, however, that democracy cannot exist  without a legal system. We will be able to attain our goals  after we have reinforced the structures securing the observance  of laws for the government and for all citizens.</p>

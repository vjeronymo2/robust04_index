He was speaking at a news conference at the  Union Buildings after meeting Swedish Foreign Minister  Margaretha af Ugglas.    [Begin De Klerk recording] We think that the anxieties and  concerns of the Zulu king and Zulu leaders can be accommodated  and our proposals will be aimed at formulating such  accommodation. It will require from their side the will to find  a compromise and it will require from their side also  preparedness to move on very fixed stands on certain issues  which have been taken, but I think there's a way out and we are  not giving up until the very last moment.

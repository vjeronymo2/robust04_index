			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INNER-CITY KIDS AWAIT ROSE AS ROLE MODEL  </P> <P> They were in line at the LeBlond Boys/Girls Club Thursday, waiting for lunch --  giggling, seemingly carefree youngsters, momentarily forgetting and escaping  the problems of the street.  </P> <P> "Typical inner-city neighborhood," said Bob Wallace, the club's project  director. "Low income. Lots of high-density projects. Considerable drug use and  sale. High crime rate."  </P> <P> Pete Rose will fulfill part of his community service obligation next year at  LeBlond, during summer, when school is out.  </P> <P> After pleading guilty to two counts of filing false income tax returns, Rose  was sentenced Thursday to five months in a federal correctional institution,  followed by a year of supervised release, including three months in a halfway  house and 1,000 hours of community service at LeBlond and specified schools.  </P> <P> Judge S. Arthur Spiegel, in his sentencing report, said Rose can be an  inspiration and role model to the children of the inner city, that he can  encourage them to succeed with the same dedication and determination he  displayed and that he can demonstrate how to learn, profit and become a better  person through mistakes.  </P> <P> Wallace agreed.  </P> <P> "Pete has a lot to offer, but he has to be frank and open regarding his  mistakes," he said. "If you're phony, they don't care if you're Pete Rose.  They'll just walk away. I mean, Pete can help these kids, and I think they can  help Pete."  </P> <P> LeBlond, which houses a gym, swimming pool, weight room, cafeteria, arts and  crafts area and recreation room, has 1,200 members. Located in what are known  as the West End and Over the Rhine areas of Cincinnati, it is only about 10  miles from where Rose first achieved athletic prominence at Western Hills High  School, but seems in another world contrasted with the estate Rose owns at  Indian Hills.  </P> <P> The kids, of course, are happy that this hometown hero is coming. They don't  care from where, even if it's prison, which they think he deserved.  </P> <P> Taxes they're not sure about, but gambling is wrong, a lot of them were saying  Thursday.  </P> <P> Tony Harris, an 11-year-old would-be pitcher and second baseman, was typical.  </P> <P> "He should have known better," Harris said of Rose. "He should have known you  have to follow the law. It don't make any sense. Why would he do the wrong  thing when he was making all that money in baseball? Maybe he can tell us about  it."  </P> <P> That and more.  </P> <P> "He'll probably show us how to hit home runs," Harris added, beaming at the  thought.  </P></p>

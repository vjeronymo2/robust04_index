			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / The cost of flying without a harness: US airlines' experience of deregulation bodes ill for European carriers It seems heretical to ask the question at a time when the merits of market liberalisation have become so widely accepted. But if deregulation is such a great idea, why is the US airline industry in such a mess? Barely a day passes in the US without news of continuing turmoil in the industry. This week alone has brought an announcement of another 1,000 job cuts at Continental Airlines as part of a cost-cutting drive, a decision from American Airlines to lay off a further 50 pilots as it continues to shrink its route network, and a reorganisation plan from America West Airlines aimed at bringing the troubled carrier out of bankruptcy. Yesterday it emerged that Trans World Airlines, itself only just out of bankruptcy, had said in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission that it would have to consider selling all or part of the company if its financial results failed to achieve planned levels this year. Some 15 years have passed since the US air travel market was deregulated: long enough, you might think, for it to have found some sort of equilibrium. Instead, the industry seems to exist in a state of perpetual crisis. In the past four years, its losses have exceeded all the profits made by US airlines since the invention of powered flight. Small wonder that European airlines are unenthusiastic about open skies. When deregulation came to the US market in 1978, American carriers looked better prepared for it than their European counterparts do today. Admittedly, federal government control over domestic routes and fares had left them with limited experience of competition; but at least they were creatures of the private sector, and generally profitable too. As expected, deregulation attracted dozens of entrepreneurs into the US airline industry - some starting new services where none had existed before, and others undercutting fares on existing routes. It also gave the big carriers the freedom to expand services and compete on price. Over the next few years, lower fares and new services produced a big increase in passenger numbers, but the combined effects of fare cuts and excess capacity sent the industry into heavy losses. Bankruptcy not only took its toll of the new entrants, but started hitting established carriers such as Braniff International and Continental Airlines. All this could have been predicted: deregulation is supposed to eliminate the weak. But the process did not stop there. In spite of a brief period of profitability during the economic boom of the late 1980s, the airline failures went on. By 1992, bankruptcy had claimed 117 carriers including some of the best-known in the industry, such as Eastern Airlines, Trans World Airlines and Pan American World Airways. Today, the US airline industry looks in as bad a state as ever. The competition is crippling, with big carriers besieged by small, low-cost operators attacking the most profitable markets. The industry as whole lost about Dollars 1.2bn last year. This year, thanks to robust growth in the US economy, low fuel prices and drastic cost-cutting by the big carriers, it may show a small profit: but few can foresee a day when the industry will deliver an acceptable return on its assets. At least two special factors suggest that the US experience might not necessarily be replicated in Europe. One is that overcapacity in the US has been exacerbated by chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code, which has enabled carriers such as TWA and Con-tinental to bounce back when they would otherwise have failed. Another is that the financial weakness of the industry is in some measure the result of a flurry of highly leveraged buy-outs in the 1980s which left some of the largest carriers heavily burdened with debt. However, two other factors that have emerged from US experience could apply to a deregulated air travel market anywhere. First, the airline industry is notoriously cyclical, and each general economic downturn results in a surplus of unwanted aircraft and personnel. This presents entrepreneurs with an opportunity to snap up cheap aircraft and employees and undercut existing carriers with low fares: so when things are bad, they get worse. Second, the airline industry - like one or two other sectors such as newspapers and hotels - seems to be imbued with a perceived glamour that causes otherwise sensible people to enter it and remain in it, regardless of the potential for making money. Of course, by the only criterion that really matters - customer satisfaction  -airline deregulation in the US has been a staggering success. Passenger numbers have risen by more than 70 per cent since 1978. Why? Full fares are a third lower in real terms, and more than 90 per cent of tickets are sold at discounts averaging two-thirds off the full price. People have 37 per cent more flights to choose from: smaller cities in particular have far more flights to far more places than ever before. The fight for customers has brought innovations such as frequent-flyer programmes and ultra-cheap, no-frills flights. The safety record is first class. Deregulation should do for Europeans what it has already done for Americans. That is why it is such a great idea. But the US experience leaves little room for doubt about what it will do to Europe's airline industry. In short, it looks like being a bloodbath.</p>

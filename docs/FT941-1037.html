			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Food &amp; Drink: A pork pie to ponder - Cookery Street foods in Britain are not what they were. Where is the gingerbread man? Where are the sellers of ripe cherries and hot warden pears? Where is the bell-ringing travelling pieman? All we hear now is the megaphoned tinkle of Teddy Bears' Picnic as Mr Whippy vans cruise the housing estates. In some rural areas mobile fish and chip kitchens splutter from village to village. In cities the stench of over-stewed onions belches from hamburger stands. Only as Christmas approaches do things improve when the chestnut vendors take over. Pies were once the most popular of all street foods and piemen were familiar figures with their trayloads of wares. Fillings of mutton, beef, eel, and fresh fruits in season were relished. Pork pies, however, were always hot favourites. Recipes for pork pies abound. Strong regional tastes are evident and there are some very localised versions indeed, particularly in the hunting shires where the wisdom of carrying a good pie in your saddlebag (and a hip flask) was well understood. Just the ticket to sustain an energetic sportsman all day - or to comfort an unseated rider ditched by his steed. Melton Mowbray pork pies are still famous, spiced with anchovy and cayenne. Nutmeg and allspice were favoured elsewhere, and herbs such as thyme, parsley and sage in other places. In some areas the addition of apples, onions and/or cheese was favoured. Elsewhere the inclusion of eggs, chicken or veal was preferred. Some of the pork pies made and sold in earlier centuries were probably as dire or worse than the sawdust-dreary, mechanically recovered meat pies that late 20th century publicans microwave for their customers. But the best must have been very good indeed with their thick and decorative pastry casing and their filling of succulent, flavoursome meat. The pie crust frills that now flute our collars and cuffs began life as pastry decorations of course. And the flesh of large, free-ranging, long-lived pigs is unquestionably superior to that of juvenile runts factory farmed by producers obsessed with low-fat meat. PORK &amp; PIPPIN PIES (serves 6-8) These can be served hot or cold and would make a good choice for Easter picnics. I have used lean end of belly of pork - partly for economy but mostly because of the rich texture it gives the gravy. Hannah Glasse, writing in 1747, recommended a more refined version of the pies using small steaks cut from a loin of pork, white wine instead of vinegared water, and no onion. Loin, being more tender and drier, needs no pre-cooking before baking. For the filling: 3 lb lean end belly of pork or 2 1/4 lb thick boneless slices of belly of pork (in other words enough belly to yield 1 1/2 lb pork after bones and rind are removed); 6oz onion; 9oz sharp aromatic apple (Braeburn from New Zealand make the best choice at this time of year); a little butter; freshly grated nutmeg, 1 tablespoon tarragon or white wine vinegar mixed with 1 tablespoon soft brown sugar and 4 1/2 fl oz cold water. For the crust: 6oz wholewheat flour; 6oz plain white household flour; 3oz butter; 3oz lard; beaten egg to seal and glaze. Bone the pork, if not already done, de-rind it and cube the meat. Chop the onion finely. Peel, core and chop the apple. Put all three ingredients into a lightly buttered casserole. Season with salt, pepper and plenty of nutmeg and pour on the vinegared and sweetened water. Lay the pork rinds on top and cover with a well fitting lid. Cook at 300`F (150`C) gas mark 3 for 2 1/2 hours. Discard the rinds, letting the juices drip back into the casserole. Check seasoning and set aside until cold. Make the pastry, seasoning it well. Use half to two-thirds of it to line the base and sides of two 6 1/2 in-7in springclip cake tins or two small oval pie dishes. Divide the pie filling between the pastry-lined containers and cover with lids rolled out from the remaining pastry. (NB: if using pie dishes, do not lay the pastry on the rim of the dish in the usual way but seal the pastry sides and lid with an upward movement to make a frilly collar, as though making a raised pie.) Glaze the pies with beaten egg and make steam holes. Bake on a pre-heated baking sheet for 15 minutes at 425`F (220`C) gas mark 7, then at 325`F (160`C) gas mark 3 for 1 1/2 hours. Let the cooked pies rest for at least 5 minutes between baking and serving if they are to be eaten hot. Better still, serve them cold when they can be cut into jellied wedges.</p>

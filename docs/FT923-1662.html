			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Loss of licence helps TVS return to profit TVS ENTERTAINMENT, the ITV broadcaster for the south of England, achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.6m for the six months to June 30, compared with losses of Pounds 10.9m last time. The results accompanied an agreed Pounds 38.2m offer for the company from International Family Entertainment which runs The Family Channel, a general entertainment cable channel in the US. The offer, which values each TVS ordinary at 25p and each preference share at 45p, has the support of main shareholders such as Canal Plus. Mr James Gatward, a founder and former chief executive of the company is leading opposition to the bid on the grounds that TVS is worth much more. The offer is partly in cash and partly in shares in IFE, which was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in April. TVS has come on the market because it failed to win a new broadcasting licence in last's year's competitive tenders for ITV franchises and ceases to be a broadcaster from the end of this year. The loss of the licence is the main explanation for the improved financial position. The company has reduced its UK broadcasting activities and cost base as quickly as possible. The sale of its 50 per cent stake in the CBS/MTM studio company in Los Angeles for Dollars 27m in February has also helped to reduce group borrowings to Pounds 3.5m at the end of June, compared with Pounds 25.4m at the end of 1991. Losses at MTM, the US independent production company whose purchase caused many of TVS Entertainment's problems, have increased although sales marginally improved. MTM reported a loss of Pounds 5.7m in the first half, against Pounds 2.4m, because of the weak dollar and an increase in the amortisation of US programme costs. Turnover was up from Pounds 102.1m to Pounds 106.3m. Because TVS continues to have a deficit on its own profit and loss account no dividend is declared. Mr Rudolf Agnew, TVS chairman, said that the process of winding down UK broadcasting operations and cutting costs would continue in the second half, 'with a view to leaving the group in as strong a financial position following the expiry of its Channel 3 licence as is possible in all the circumstances'. If the IFE offer is confirmed the American company will take over on January 1 and base its operation at the TVS studios at Maidstone, Kent. TVS has already sold its Southampton studios to its successor. For each TVS ordinary, the offer is worth 0.041195 of the new IFE shares, while each TVS preference share is worth 0.074152 of the new IFE shares. The partial cash alternative offer is worth a maximum of 23p for each ordinary and 43p for each preference. The maximum amount of cash available under the partial cash alternative is Pounds 18.5m, with Pounds 6.3m being available for ordinary shares and the rest for preference shareholders. If all TVS shareholders elect for cash, then the cash offer for ordinary shares will be scaled down to a minimum of 10p cash plus 0.021422 new IFE shares, while preference shareholders will receive a minimum of 25p in cash plus 0.029661 new IFE shares.</p>

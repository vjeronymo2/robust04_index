			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Japan Has Emerged as a Dangerous Force </F> of War"]    [Text] It is the invariable ambition of Japanese  reactionaries to realize reinvasion of Korea and their old dream  of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.    Today the Japanese reactionaries, holding a wicked intent to  become the chief [maengju] of Asia just as the Imperial Army of  the past, are accelerating Japan's becoming a big military  power, its armament, and overseas expansion. Thus, Japan has  become a new hotbed of war. This is proven, first of all, by  Japan's reorganizing its self-defense forces into leading  aggressive forces of the world.    Japan has already adopted and put into effect the law on  cooperation for UN peacekeeping activities. With this, Japan  legalized dispatching of its self-defense forces overseas, and  is now attempting to create legal conditions for executing a war  of aggression while raving about amendment of the law on  self-defense forces and about research and formulation of the  law on emergency.    What one should not overlook in particular is that the  Japanese Defense Agency is turning the core combat power of its  ground self-defense forces into the stronghold deployment system  [kochom paechi cheje] in order to effectively cope with an  emergency on the Korean peninsula by reviewing the main points  of the defense plan.    This clearly illustrates that the Japanese reactionaries,  openly exposing their attempt to invade Korea again, are  accelerating the preparations for reinvasion on a full scale.    The Japanese reactionaries' maneuvers of aggression against  the Korean peninsula have been clearly seen in the fact that  Japan is dashing to become a big military power and toward  nuclear armament.    Japan is drastically increasing its military expenditure.  The  rate of increase in Japanese military expenditure cannot be  compared to any nation in the West, marking the second highest  rank in the world in terms of the amount of military expenses.    The Japan self-defense forces have grown into a top leading  aggressive force of the world. The plan of adjusting defense  power during the period from 1991 to 1995, pushed ahead by the  Japanese Government, is designed to reinforce self-defense  forces so that they can independently execute local wars by  arming them with ultramodern military equipment.    Today the Japanese reactionaries claim that Japan is not a  big military power by pointing to the number of active military  personnel of the self-defense forces. However, more than 70  percent of the troops of the self-defense forces consists of  officers and noncommissioned officers. As the result, Japan's  self-defense forces will be increased to several millions on a  single morning in an emergency.    The Japanese reactionaries, attaching an importance not only  to quantitative expansion of armament and equipment of  self-defense forces but also to their qualitative reinforcement,  are actively accelerating promotion of fire power, introduction  of ultramodern technology and equipment, and increase in  mobility and remote control capability.    The Japanese Defense Agency is trying to drastically  increase the offensive ability of self-defense forces by arming  them with ultramodern equipment, including war command  airplanes, Patriot antimissile missiles, new-type tanks,  large-size transport ships, and aircraft carriers.    The Japanese militarists, engrossed with the ambition for  overseas invasion, have reorganized the defense structure of  self-defense forces into offensive, and changed their military  strategy from the total defense strategy to preemptive attack  strategy. Besides, they expanded their operational zone into  wide areas in Northeast Asia and the Pacific with the Korean  peninsula as the center.    Furthermore, Japan is running amok with nuclear armament in  a  bid to realize the ambition for its overseas expansion by all  means. As the result, Japan's nuclear armament maneuvers have  reached a dangerous boundary.    As has been widely known to the world, Japan has stockpiled  scores of tons of plutonium--a basic material for producing  nuclear weapons--and completed construction of the plant with a  view to producing a large quantity of plutonium at any time.    In addition, Japan has armed self-defense forces with  various  artillery guns capable of firing nuclear warheads and with F-15  fighter-bombers that are capable of loading nuclear bombs. Japan  has also completed domestic production of cruise missiles that  are capable of loading both nuclear and conventional warheads.  By staging test firing of a domestic-produced satellite rocket,  Japan is creating daily-increasing danger on the Korean  peninsula and in Northeast Asia.    Today the Japanese reactionaries' overseas aggression  maneuvers have become even more grave. As has already been  reported, the reactionary Japanese government is scheming to  provide a legal basis for overseas aggression under a pretext of  coping with an emergency on the Korean peninsula.    In a speech in Washington, Aiichi, former director-general  of  the Japanese Defense Agency, confessed that the Japanese  Government is working measures to cope with an emergency on the  Korean peninsula, and openly stated that Japan is going to  establish a crisis management system. The Japanese  reactionaries' maneuvers for formulating laws for the state of  emergency and for establishing a crisis management system are  aimed at invading our country and dispatching of unlimited  troops overseas, thus arousing worries and concerns of the Asian  countries.    All facts show that the Japanese reactionaries' maneuvers of  aggression have an extremely haughty nature, and have reached a  reckless stage. Today our people, the Asian people and the  peaceloving people of the world, are closely watching with high  vigilance the military moves of Japan which has emerged as the  dangerous force of war.    The Japanese reactionaries should not forget the historic  lesson of their disgraceful defeat in the past. They must look  straight at the trend of the time and act with discretion.</p>

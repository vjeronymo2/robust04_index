			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Corpses in the Lake"] </F>   [Text] Two weeks ago, two four-engine Antonov-12 freight  planes carrying a mysterious load landed at the Sperenberg air  base near Wuensdorf, the location of the supreme command of the  Western Group of Russian Forces in Germany (WGT). The following  day, the freight, a total of 327 crates, was taken away in a  German truck, escorted by several cars.    But the trip came to an end after a few kilometers. German  police stopped the convoy, having been tipped off by the  military prosecutor at Wuensdorf.    They arrested 11 people, including an honorable Russian  lieutenant colonel: Anatoliy Golubev (33), head of the Wuensdorf  Army Hunting Club.    An inspection confirmed the suspicion against the  recreational hunter. The freight documents indicated "sports  guns" addressed to a Hamburg trading company, but what the  crates actually contained was much hotter stuff: 9,810 9-mm guns  of the "Makarov" type.    This mishap of the Golubev group showed for the first time  to  what extent Russian troops in Germany are involved in arms  trading. Colonel General Matvey Burlakov, supreme commander at  Wuensdorf has disputed such links up to now.    Concerned about the image of his troops, which will finally  withdraw during 1994, the supreme commander emphasized time and  again that his people were not involved in Mafia-like activities  around the garrisons, where officers are blackmailed, wagons of  cigarettes are traded, and supply goods trafficked. In the  surroundings of the garrison, the jobbers, who mostly come from  the CIS, carry out their rivalries with guns: police quite  frequently recover corpses of dead gangsters from hotel rooms  and lakes in Brandenburg.    On Christmas Eve, a Russian civilian died in a shootout  among  mafiosi near Sperenberg. When a fight among dealers in front of  the WGT headquarters got out of hand last week, a guard fired  his gun. An asylum-seeker from Azerbaijan was killed.    Colonel General Burlakov says that his garrisons are  downright beleaguered by radical dealers: "The circle is getting  ever closer." But the arrest of gun shipper Golubev shows that  many an insider has a finger in the pie. Both the majority of  officers at Wuensdorf and the Army leadership in Moscow have  seen it that way for a long time. At the end of November,  Burlakov received a very embarrassing coded telegram ("No. 2267,  2268", "No copies"). In this telegram, Defense Minister Pavel  Grachev told his governor at Wuensdorf to increase discipline  and order within his troops. Following this, Burlakov made a  written note saying that he wanted to effect the direction  "forcefully, if necessary."    The leadership in Moscow criticized generals and officers  for  increasingly misusing their ranks for private affairs. Grachev:  "A lack of control in the distribution of funds designated for  the troops encourages such affairs."    There have also been instances where high-ranking officers  were involved, such as Colonel Alexeji Varlevich Belikov, who is  stationed near Magdeburg. The son of a former commander in  chief at Wuensdorf was suspected of smuggling cigarettes.    While the final withdrawal of the troops, scheduled for the  end of August, is approaching, greed amongst the WGT troops is  on the increase. Military prosecutors are investigating the  case of officers selling off a complete set of aerial  photographs of the former GDR territory from the headquarters  "topography section" to a Berlin company via middlemen.    The 11,000 photographic plates on the scale of 1:22,000,  were  made in the early 1950's, and were used, among other things, to  spot inherited environmental problems. The 48 crates were  traded in return for a shipment of computers from Singapore  worth 90,000 German marks [DM] -- a nice bargain for the  Russians who are getting worried about their future: Later on,  back home in Russia, a colonel has to make do with the  equivalent of DM120 per month.    Even more bizarre is a deal that is currently being  investigated by the military authorities, and that again  involves Lieutenant Colonel Golubev, who has established a  trading company at Berlin-Karlshorst, together with other  partners. Recently, Golubev received 17 wagons containing parts  for prefabricated houses produced by the Russian Army.  According to Army lawyers, the imports are to be sold as  hunting lodges in Germany for DM50,000 each.    The contract was signed by resigned Lieutenant General  Maganov, the head of the Army's Hunting Club in the Moscow  Defense Ministry.    Another officer who profited from good German contacts is  the  former deputy chief of staff of the Western Group, General  Lieutenant Leonid Cherbakev. He was deputy head of the  Konversion Wohnraum [living space conversion] company, which  also owns Army enterprises and WGT land.    Investigators accuse him of trying to smuggle money and raw  material out of the country in an Army aircraft last April,  controlling the action from Moscow. When the load was checked,  trading documents on weapons, raw material, and radioactive  material were seized.    Another officer accused of embezzlement and customs offenses  is General Lieutenant Seliverstov, a former general with the WGT  Air Force. Seliverstov is considered the organizer of a  sensational transfer of presents: In 1992, via middlemen, WGT  officers had procured an S-class Mercedes worth over DM150,000  for the leadership of the Defense Ministry and shipped it to  Moscow.    The moral decline within the troops makes their boss gloomy.  "The vices of society," Grachev tells his Wuensdorf governor  Burlakov in a telegram, "are seeping ever deeper into officers'  circles."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Eduardo Vallarino, presidential candidate </F> for Christian Democratic Party, PDC, by unidentified reporter on  8 May; place not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Reporter] For several hours, we have been reporting  on this electoral process, which represents an important  landmark in Panama's political history. Mr. Eduardo Vallarino,  now that several hours have passed since the end of the  elections, we would like to hear what you have to say about the  election results.    [Vallarino] Panama's elections have been extremely pure and  transparent, very civic, very enthusiastic. Panama is the winner  in these elections. It is evident that we did not fare as well  as we would have desired. Panama has attained a great victory,  however.    [Reporter] What message do you have for the Panamanian  people, although the final results are not yet known?    [Vallarino] I think the results are indeed known. They are  determined by a number of factors which I think are  irreversible. Although the official results are not yet known,  it is clear that the Democratic Revolutionary Party [PRD] won  the elections and that Perez Balladares has won the right to  become president. What message do I have for the Panamanian  people? Simple: We will have a new president, elected by a  considerable number of Panamanians and whom we all must support.  We will become the opposition, a responsible one.    [Reporter] We have talked with Christian Democratic Party  candidate Eduardo Vallarino.</p>

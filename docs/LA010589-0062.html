			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR INCREDIBLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING;  </P> <P> LOW-FAT FISH, CALORIE-SPARING SAUCES IN TUNE WITH DIET-CONSCIOUS TIMES  </P> <P> With so much emphasis today on lighter eating, it's surprising to find there is  still so much interest in nostalgic foods that are filling and satisfying. Yet  stick-to-the ribs meals, such as rich and robust stews, filling soups and  pastas in chunky aromatic sauces enjoy the same popularity they once did, but  today they are made with low-fat ingredients.  </P> <P> Recipes still call for whipping cream, butter, cheese or half and half; just  less of them is being used. Team this calorie-sparing technique with naturally  low-fat fish like trout and firm white fillets and the possibilities for  low-calorie, high-protein menus are endless.  </P> <P> Fresh apples make a delightful sauce for rainbow trout, although almost any  fruit can be substituted in Trout With Apple Cream Sauce. Red grapes and  Zinfandel come together to complement the delicate flavor of the fish in  Rainbow Trout in Zinfandel-Grape Sauce.  </P> <P> Crab Meat Focaccia, the pizza-like country bread from Northern Italy that is  topped with fresh herbs and olive oil, is made with an easy-to-prepare pizza  dough and topped with imitation crab legs for an elegant but inexpensive dish.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Robust but Light  </P> <P> Pan-Bake Pesca Pasta is another aromatic and colorful robust but light dish. It  features low-calorie, low-fat cod fillets and fettuccine in a wine-kissed  spaghetti sauce topped with green peppers, onions. olives and a sprinkling of  Parmesan and mozzarella cheeses.  </P> <P> In Broiled Pollock With Shrimp-Butter Sauce, mild lean fillets of whitefish are  topped with a savory shrimp butter sauce then broiled. The fish is basted  during cooking to keep it moist then, while keeping the cooked fillets warm,  the pan juices are slightly thickened and finished with white wine to become a  light, glossy sauce.  </P> <P> The last suggestion, Shrimp and Scallop Saute With Pecan Rice, is a rich flavor  combination. The scallops and shrimp marinate in beef broth and beer, then the  seafood is sauteed with garlic and red pepper and served over rice and toasted  pecans.  </P> <P> TROUT WITH APPLE CREAM SAUCE  </P> <P> 1 1/2 tablespoons butter or margarine  </P> <P> 4 rainbow trout fillets  </P> <P> 1 apple, peeled and sliced  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon chopped shallots  </P> <P> 1/3 cup whipping cream or half and half  </P> <P> 1/4 cup apple cider  </P> <P> 1/4 cup dry white wine  </P> <P> 1/8 teaspoon ground allspice  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> Melt 1 tablespoon butter in skillet over medium-high heat.

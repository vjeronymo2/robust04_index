			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Senate flexes its muscles over foreign policy President Bill Clinton's conduct of foreign policy has been heavily criticised in academic and establishment circles, but increasingly the US Senate seems ready to act where most others merely write in complaint. Yesterday Senator John Kerry, the Democrat from Massachusetts, took to the opinion pages of the New York Times to demand that the US oust the military junta in Haiti by force - preferably in conjunction with others but still by invasion. Over the weekend, Senator George Mitchell, the majority leader, and Senator Bob Dole, his Republican counterpart, called for economic sanctions against North Korea for refusing to subject its nuclear facilities to full inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Mr Mitchell also said he was in favour of imposing trade penalties on China unless visible improvement in its human rights record was evident in the two weeks remaining before Mr Clinton determines whether to extend most favoured nation trading status. His blunt comments need to be set against his known willingness to help the administration find a way out of its dilemma, but Mr Dole, forever combative, threatened to embarrass the president to the maximum extent possible by urging him to renew MFN and admit he had made a mistake last year in linking it to human rights. Last week, in somewhat contradictory votes, the Senate twice urged the lifting of the arms embargo on Bosnia. Mr Dole's motion urged that the US do so unilaterally while Mr Mitchell's called for the maximum effort to persuade US allies to go along. Though neither yet has the force of law, both constituted advances on an earlier non-binding 'sense of the Senate' resolution. Senator Kerry is not the first member of Congress to call for the use of force in Haiti, though he may be the most influential to have done so to date. It is considered axiomatic that the administration would not launch an invasion without some form of prior consent by Congress. However, the Republican party is generally opposed, in spite of the fact that Presidents Reagan and Bush both conducted military ventures in the region, in Grenada and Panama respectively. With Bosnia and North Korea, however, senatorial frustration appears to be growing across party lines. Many of those who supported Mr Mitchell's compromise amendment last week may be persuaded to switch sides on the arms embargo if hostilities persist and no progress is made in negotiations. Lifting the arms embargo is, as Senator Claiborne Pell, chairman of the foreign relations committee, put it, 'the easy cost-free solution'. One of Mr Dole's central arguments for a unilateral lifting was that no US lives would be put at risk. The Clinton administration, intent on pushing healthcare reform through Congress, is sensitive to the dangers of additional political controversy. But this caution has already invited criticism that the president is unwilling to take a stand on too many matters. This sense could well encourage the Senate to take matters further into its own hands, as it last did in prohibiting the Reagan administration from funding the Nicaraguan contras in 1980s.</p>

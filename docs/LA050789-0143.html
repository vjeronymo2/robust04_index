			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BARGAIN CORNER: PASSES FOR DOWN UNDER  </P> <P> Here are several programs to consider for Australia.  </P> <P> The Austrailpass offered by Railways of Australia is available in first or  economy class for consecutive periods of 14, 21, 30, 60 or 90 days.  </P> <P> Based on the current rate of exchange, the 14-day pass costs about $567 U.S.  first-class and $347 for economy, with the 21-day pass going for about $711 and  $446, respectively.  </P> <P> Deluxe Coachline offers a Koala Pass for 7, 10, 14, 21, 30, 60 and 90 days,  about $185 for seven days and $238 for 10 days.  </P> <P> Even better rates -- about 30% off the Koala Pass fares -- are offered on the  Space Pass. However, this pass involves traveling on a standby basis, though  seats can be confirmed up to four hours before departure. The Space Pass is  issued in the same time periods as the Koala Pass, starting at $131 for seven  days and $167 for 10 days.  </P> <P> The Aussie Wanderer Pass provides discount rates for four itineraries around  Australia. The pass can be used anywhere on the routes and for up to 12 months.  A key restriction is that you can't repeat a place unless it's part of the  routing.  </P> <P> There are also several directional passes. For example, the 30-day Reef Pass  covers the area between Cairns and Brisbane, which includes the Great Barrier  Reef. You have to travel in one direction only, without backtracking.  </P> <P> All of the programs are good until Sept. 30.  </P> <P> Pioneer, another Australian motor coach, has Aussiepasses for 7, 10, 15, 21, 30  and 60 days, starting at $176 for the seven-day pass. A Super Aussiepass  combines accommodations with the coach passes.  </P> <P> Contact travel agents or Australian Travel Service at (800) 232-2121, Extension  840.  </P> <P> Greyhound Australia has a bus pass starting at $176 for seven days. On the 15-,  21-, 30- and 60-day passes, you can stay up to seven days at a place without  this time counting against your pass.  </P> <P> Mount Cook Line of New Zealand offers a 9-, 12-, 18-, 14-, 32- and 45-day  Downunder Coach Pass good for travel in both New Zealand and Australia. The  nine-day version is $221.  </P> <P> Contact travel agents or Greyhound International at (800) 828-1985. JACK ADLER  </P></p>

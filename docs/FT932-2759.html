			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Leading Article: A dose of reality NEGOTIATIONS on South Africa's political future have reached a delicate stage, possibly a dangerous one. Tuesday's decision by the Inkatha Freedom Party chief, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and a motley group of other political players from the white right and black homelands to walk out of the multi-party negotiating forum raises the spectre of two competing factions whose rivalry could destabilise South Africa. Chief Buthelezi and the white right have little in common other than antipathy to the expedient alliance between the government and the African National Congress (ANC). But, while they lack the support to govern South Africa, they may well have the capacity to make it ungovernable. A disaffected Natal, township violence and a security force with many right-wingers in its ranks - these elements could combine to make peace unattainable. The only forum at which the country can forge a lasting settlement, including principles for a new constitution and rules for the country's first all-race elections, is at the multi-party talks taking place near Johannesburg. The first instinct of Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader, and possibly of the government may be to threaten to go ahead without Inkatha. But both parties must know that it would be far better to persuade Chief Buthelezi to send his representatives back to the conference table. Equally, if chief Buthelezi takes serious stock of his options, he will know that his movement has nothing to gain from trying to scupper the peace process from the sidelines. What the current impasse exposes is that, after months of wishful thinking, South Africa's constitutional negotiators are at last confronting the fundamental issues in the transition to democracy. Up to now delegates have created an illusion of progress by constantly referring the most difficult problems to technical committees; most recently, they masked the lack of progress on substantive issues by setting next April 27 as the date for elections to a constituent assembly. If Inkatha's action brings the delegates down to earth it will have served a purpose. The issue that prompted its move - the powers of the provinces under a new constitution - is a critical one that politicians must address as a matter of urgency. The most sensitive concern of all is also one that has yet to be properly addressed. Both the ANC and the National Party speak of 'power sharing' in a government to be formed after elections, but they have very different concepts in mind. For the ANC, which expects to emerge as the largest single party, it is a coalition in which they are the dominant partner. For the National Party, as President F. W. de Klerk made clear in a recent interview with the Financial Times, power sharing would be written into the constitution, with the leaders of the main parties taking major policy decisions by 'consensus'. Until the negotiators resolve these two problems in a form which will be binding on a proposed constitution-writing constituent assembly, elections will not be viable. This week's upset may yet mark not the collapse of talks but the point at which they get down to business.</p>

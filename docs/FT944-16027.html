			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / BBC secures lottery showtime Camelot, the National Lottery operator, has reached agreement with the BBC on televising the draw that could create millionaires most weeks between November 19 and September 2001. An official announcement of the deal, the result of months of negotiations between Camelot, the BBC and the Office of the National Lottery, is expected early next month. The hope is that the opening hour-long programme, to be hosted by Noel Edmonds, might top the UK television ratings with a potential audience of between 18m and 20m. The expectation is that the regular half-hour programme will probably be scheduled at about 8pm on BBC 1 and could challenge programmes such as Coronation Street and EastEnders for the top slot in the ratings. All around the world live television is a big part of generating publicity and excitement for national lotteries. The Camelot-BBC approach is for a relatively unusual programme by international standards - there are unlikely to be magicians or dancing girls. Choosing the six winning numbers out of 49, with a seventh ball to chose intermediate Pounds 100,000 winners, is likely to take only a couple of minutes. One of the formats under consideration would involve other games of chance. Other elements could involve good news - human interest stories of winners and how the prizes will affect their lives, although players will have a right to privacy if they choose. As money starts to flow to the five good causes which will benefit from the National Lottery proceeds - the arts, charities, a millennium fund, the national heritage and sports - there will also be stories about how the money is being spent. The programme will be under the overall control of Mr Michael Leggo, head of entertainment at BBC Television. When Camelot launches its scratch-cards in addition to the main computerised draw in the spring there will be a second mid-week programme. The Camelot consortium, which brings together Cadbury Schweppes, Racal Electronics, De La Rue, GTech and ICL, wanted to launch with the BBC from the start. Not only was the corporation seen as the right environment to launch what Camelot hopes will become a national institution in its own right, but the BBC could also offer national, regional and local radio coverage. The Camelot approach has been to try to get the best of both worlds by putting the draw live on BBC and advertising the lottery on ITV. ITV, which ruled itself out of the competition to broadcast the draw and scratch-card competitions - largely, it said, because of regulatory difficulties, will almost certainly run the winning numbers within seconds of the BBC draw. Mr Nicholas Hinton, the chief executive of the Millennium Commission, was last night dismissed just before formally taking office. The issue that led to Mr Hinton's departure - his appointment was due to become permanent on Monday morning - appears to have involved a definition of his role. The commissioners may have been more 'hands-on' than Mr Hinton expected. Mr Michael Montague, one of the millennium commissioners, said last night: 'I felt either we accepted the way things were developing or we did something about it and the right time was before Monday.'</p>

			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLAYERS NOT THE ONES TO BLAME FOR PRICES  </P> <P> Now that athletes have brought to light the greed and cunning of the owners  (longtime collusion experts), how can sports fans still believe that the blame  for big wages and high prices rests with the players?  </P> <P> The continual labor-management standoff and the steady escalation of ticket  prices and salaries will level off only when both sides approach each other  with honesty (and open books). Good luck to the fans while we wait.  </P> <P> But to damn the players for putting the same demands on the owners that all  show-biz entertainers put on their producers and promoters is unfair.  </P> <P> If people are willing to shell out money for Sinatra, Springsteen or Robin  Williams, why do they weep if the prices for a big fight or a big game are  steep?  </P> <P> B.

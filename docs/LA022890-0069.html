			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANDINISTAS WILL STRUGGLE ON, CUBA SAYS;  </P> <P> NICARAGUA: A PARTY NEWSPAPER SAYS PRESIDENT ORTEGA'S DEFEAT IS NOT A STATEMENT  OF POLITICAL BANKRUPTCY FOR HIS LEFTIST CAUSE.  </P> <P> Cuba's Communist Party newspaper Granma said Tuesday that Nicaragua's  Sandinista revolution is entering "a new stage of struggle" after the defeat of  the leftist government in elections Sunday.  </P> <P> "There is no doubt that it is a great setback, but it doesn't mean political  bankruptcy (for the Sandinistas)," Granma said in an editorial.  </P> <P> "The Nicaraguan revolution has passed through a tough test and is entering a  new stage of struggle," it added.  </P> <P> Cuba had been one of the closest allies of the Sandinista government since the  1979 revolution. President Daniel Ortega lost his reelection bid in an upset to  U.S-backed candidate Violeta Barrios de Chamorro.  </P> <P> Granma said the surprise victory of Chamorro and her National Opposition Union  (UNO) does not necessarily mean a vote against the historic role of the  Sandinistas, who led the popular 1979 revolution against dictator Anastasio  Somoza.  </P> <P> The paper did not comment on Cuba's relations with the new Nicaraguan  government.  </P> <P> Voters were obliged to choose in Sunday's elections between the Sandinistas and  "U.S. imperialism," Granma said.  </P> <P> It said the United States had indicated that a victory for Ortega would have  meant the continuation of its economic blockade against Nicaragua and of the  Contra guerrilla war against the Sandinistas.  </P> <P> "The Nicaraguan electorate was faced with the contradiction that a victory for  Sandinismo would not mean the end of the war or the lifting of the blockade or  the end of sanctions," Granma said.  </P> <P> It added that International Monetary Fund-style reforms adopted by the  Sandinista government have also created discontent among poor sectors of the  population.  </P> <P> Another factor, Granma said, is that traditional allies of the Sandinista  government in Eastern Europe have been plunged into political and economic  uncertainty by what the paper called "historical retrogression," a reference to  Western-leaning reforms sweeping the Soviet Bloc.  </P></p>

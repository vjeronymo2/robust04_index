			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> NEW OPERATION FOR DIABETES  </P> <P> An experimental transplant operation designed to free diabetics from insulin  injections has produced the most promising results since the technique was  developed, researchers reported last week.  </P> <P> The procedure enabled five of nine patients to significantly reduce their need  for daily insulin injections, including one 16-year-old Louisville, Ky., girl  who has remained completely independent of injections for more than six months,  the researchers reported.  </P> <P> "I'm completely excited," said Dr. Camillo Ricordi of the University of  Pittsburgh, who published the results with his colleagues in the British  medical journal Lancet. "It's opening up a whole new perspective on cellular  transplants."  </P> <P> The procedure involves removing so-called islet cells from the pancreas of a  donor, then purifying them and injecting them into a patient. The cells, which  are the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, then lodge in the liver and  begin cranking out insulin.  </P> <P> The procedure has shown promise for years in animal studies and some early  attempts on humans. But the new study has produced the most favorable results  to date, experts said.  </P></p>

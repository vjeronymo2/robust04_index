			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / International Company News: Preussag profit tumbles to DM193m Preussag, the diversified German steel, plant construction, engineering, energy and metals trading group, saw net profits tumble to DM193m (Dollars 109m) for the year to the end of September, after a loss of DM164m in its steel division. The result was less than half the DM440m earned in 1991-92, but still showed the value of being such a broad-based industrial holding company, said Mr Michael Frenzel, the newly-installed chief executive. The dividend will be maintained at DM10. He announced a big push to 'internationalise' further the group, which already has 44 per cent of its DM23.29bn annual turnover in foreign sales, although 77 per cent of that export trade is within Europe. Mr Frenzel said the aim was now to promote Preussag sales and investments in new markets, particularly in north America and in Asia. The group signed a co-operation agreement with Sumitomo, the Japanese trading company, in December to market its products and services in the Pacific region. He said that results for the first quarter of the current year showed a 4 per cent increase in orders, to DM6.6bn, with a 12 per cent increase in outstanding orders to DM13.4bn. Turnover in the quarter at DM6.1bn was little changed on the same period of the previous financial year. Positive results for the energy, trade and transportation, shipbuilding and railway wagon building, plant construction and environmental technology divisions, in spite of the difficult economic conditions, compensated for losses from steel, non-ferrous metals and telecommunications. Apart from the loss at Preussag Stahl, the steel subsidiary, the group had already announced in January the need for a capital injection of up to DM150m for MetalEurop, its ailing French subsidiary which contains all its non-ferrous metals interests.</p>

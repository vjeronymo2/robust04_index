			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Radio and Television Broadcasting  Council [KRRiT] has reported that the government, the Belweder  Palace, and political parties will not have a guaranteed right  to present their activities in special television programs on  public television. The council will next week issue a decree  that says news programs will be the place for presentation of  politicians' current activities. Television heads will be able  to grant time slots to the government, the president, or the  Sejm, but they will not be obliged to do so.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent Lukasz Perzyna] In news  programs, television ought to maintain balance in the  presentation of the main political forces. Yesterday, the draft  decree was commented on by the Polish Television Program  Council. Its members wished the formulations contained therein  be made more precise, but, in the view of the KRRiT, general  principles ought to suffice.    [Lech Dymarski for KRRiT] It was proposed that this balance  be substituted by a formulation as to political parties that  have real significance in political life. But someone  immediately asked how real significance can be measured.  Further, can this be limited to the political parties that  exist in parliament? Well, it cannot be. A party that is in  parliament will, perhaps, after some election or other, function  outside of parliament.    [Perzyna] Those who make programs will be responsible for  them; that means the board of television, the editors of  particular programs, the journalists themselves. Everyone ought  to be directed by the principles of professional ethics.    [Dymarski] The journalist has an obligation to know a lot  and  to be responsible. So this decree does not contain any such  formulation as to what a journalist may not do.    [Perzyna] The National Council will next week specify the  principles in force in radio and television for the campaign  before the June self-government elections. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HEIGHT LAW STIFFENED FOR VENTURA BLVD.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday strengthened a temporary 45-foot height  limit for new buildings on Ventura Boulevard by strictly defining how to  measure a building's height.  </P> <P> The measure, which applies to the entire 17-mile length of the boulevard from  Studio City to Woodland Hills, was prompted by angry Studio City residents who  complained that a 95-foot Ventura Boulevard office building blocked their view  of the San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> Under the law, building heights will be measured from the lowest point of the  curb on Ventura Boulevard.  </P> <P> The restrictions are designed to close a loophole in the boulevard's temporary  construction-control ordinance, which was enacted in 1985 to give city planners  time to set standards for the Valley's most commercially popular thoroughfare.  </P> <P> Although the 1985 ordinance restricted heights to 45 feet, it did not clearly  state how the buildings should be measured.  </P></p>

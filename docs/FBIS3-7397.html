Han goes to Beijing on Sunday to join President Kim  Yong-sam,  who is continuing his state tour of Japan and China, the foreign  minister embarks on a separate trip to Washington, D.C., on  March 29 and will shuttle back and forth between the United  Nations until April 2 to negotiate the contents of the Security  Council resolution on North Korea.    While in the U.S. capital, Han is expected to meet Secretary  of State Warren Christopher and possibly Defense Secretary  William Perry.    At the United Nations, he will confer with Security Council  President Jean-Bernard Merimee.    The foreign minister stops off in Tokyo on his way home from  April 2-4 for talks with his Japanese counterpart Tsutomu Hata  and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    The Security Council is ready to adopt a resolution on the  North Korean nuclear issue sometime next week, when it will  likely demand immediate inspections by the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA).    Han has timed his visit to New York to coordinate with  Security Council members on how the United Nations should deal  with the nuclear problem.    In Washington, the foreign minister will need to discuss the  fate of the South Korea-U.S. joint military exercise "Team  Spirit," specifically whether and when to hold it this year.    South Korea and the United States, although they have  recently taken a hard-line stance outwardly, are expected to  discuss possible ways to bring North Korea back to the  negotiating table.</p>

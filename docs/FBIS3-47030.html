			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale made an  unusual request to Isamu Miyazaki, president of the Daiwa  General Research Institute, who was in charge of compiling a  report while serving as acting chairman of the Economic Reform  Research Council (a private advisory body for Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa) when the council drafted the report in  December last year that the report specifically indicate Japan's  plans to cut its trade surplus with the United States and  Japan's efforts to expand domestic demand. This was disclosed on  8 January. A member of the report draft committee said:  "Bureaucrats and the United States were a major `barrier' to us  when we compiled the report." He is implicitly admitting that  the request from the U.S. ambassador was a "pressure" and it  affected the report's contents.    The council, which was created by Prime Minister Hosokawa  with the mandate to study ways to reform Japan's economic  structure, submitted the report to the prime minister on 16  December.    It is still unclear when Ambassador Mondale and Mr. Miyazaki  met. According to an official familiar with the council,  however, the U.S. Embassy asked for a "meeting between  Ambassador Mondale and Mr. Miyazaki to discuss the report" when  the council was about to compile it. According to the same  official, they met at the president's office in the Daiwa  General Research Institute located in Koto Ward, Tokyo. During  the meeting, the U.S. ambassador is said to have asked Mr.  Miyazaki to incorporate in the report numerical targets for  cutting Japan's trade surplus with the United States.    As for the numerical targets, many council members from  industries argued strongly that "the report should incorporate  numerical targets for Japan in order to avoid pressure from  European nations and the United States to further appreciate the  yen. The council, however, decided not to incorporate the  numerical targets in the report in the face of a fierce backlash  from the Finance Ministry that spoke out against setting any  macroeconomics targets." Nonetheless, the report calls for  "Japan's aggressive efforts to cut its current account surplus  fully and significantly in the midterm" and for an increase in  the basic plan for public investment under which a total of 430  trillion yen will be invested by the year 2000. As a result,  the council compiled the report taking into account the U.S.  ambassador's request.    Mr. Mondale succeeded Mr. Armacost as U.S. ambassador to  Tokyo in September last year and he is former vice president and  a big cheese in the United States. During the Japan-U.S. summit  talks held in New York in late September last year, President  Clinton told Prime Minister Hosokawa, "Ambassador Mondale is my  partner who converses by telephone with me most frequently."  The U.S. ambassador is believed to have made the request after  conferring with the President.</p>

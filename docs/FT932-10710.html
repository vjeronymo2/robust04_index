			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Letter: Impact of rising yen on Japan trade Sir, In challenging the wisdom of US leaders 'talking up' the yen and 'talking down' the dollar, your leader (May 1) questions the efficacy of exchange rate changes in contributing to external adjustment in the requisite direction. It argues that 'Japanese exports are notoriously insensitive to price changes', and, referring to recent US trade data, 'so much for the impact of currency manipulation on the US trade performance'. Recent empirical evidence is, however, strongly at variance with your views. Since the yen appreciation of the mid-1980s, Japan has experienced the smallest increase in manufactured export volume (16.4 per cent) in a sample of 21 OECD countries - excepting Finland (1.5 per cent), Sweden (8.8 per cent) and Italy (16.1 per cent) - between 1985-86 and 1991. And this was following a decade during which Japan has easily outshone its rivals in the manufacturing export volume. Meanwhile, it is no surprise that the US has experienced the largest increase (77.9 per cent) since 1985-86. Of course, yen appreciation is not the only factor responsible for Japan's poor export showing. Rising real wages have, in addition, made Japan an expensive location from which to serve global markets - stimulating the growth of 'transplant' production in both developing and developed countries  -which voluntary export restraints and other protectionist devices have also encouraged. It seems indubitable that currency appreciation can contribute to Japanese external adjustment in the requisite direction, in both the short and medium term, by increasing costs in the domestic base and encouraging the export of Japanese manufacturing capital.

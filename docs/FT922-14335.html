			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: Property debts - Ballot Box One of the first questions that seems invariably to greet an incoming Labour-led administration is what to do about the property market. The problem lies with the banking system: overheating under the Tories leads to a hangover in banking under Labour. If the resulting hole in bank balance sheets is big enough, the Bank of England starts to ponder the wisdom of a demarche to Number 11 Downing Street. Not long after Labour came to power in 1974, the then governor Gordon Richardson found himself asking for support from Denis Healey, against a background of considerable political antipathy for fringe bankers and property. Despite enjoying support from the influential Harold Lever, his request was rebuffed. Now the property men are once again popping up on cue. First, Canadian-based developers Olympia &amp; York admitted to difficulties. Then came Gerald Ronson's Heron Corporation, followed by Trevor Osborne's Speyhawk. All are talking about plans for restructuring their debts. The difference this time is that there is not much of a fringe banking sector standing between the clearers and the property men. The foreign banks are also taking a larger share of the losses. Another difference is that National Westminster, which in 1974 was forced to make an unprecedented announcement to the effect that it was not going bust, appears to be less exposed than Barclays is today. No doubt the clearing banks are too big to fail. A shore-up for property anyway looks a poor bet under Labour. And since Olympia &amp; York's Canary Wharf development is widely regarded as a Tory flagship, that is one place where Labour sympathy is most unlikely to be forthcoming.</p>

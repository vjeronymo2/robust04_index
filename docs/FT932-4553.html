			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / New plant puts GM in the fast lane: Christopher Parkes witnesses a small miracle worked in Eisenach IN EISENACH, where once 10,000 east Germans laboured to build 100,000 rattle-trap Wartburg cars a year, Adam Opel is just three months away from its target of producing 125,000 vehicles with less than 20 per cent of the old workforce. While most other German car plant managers are contemplating more job cuts or the prospect of continuing short-time working into the second half of the year, the management at General Motors' newest European plant is preparing to recruit at least 600 people to man a third shift. Mr Jeff Bell, one of 10 advisers guiding the final stages of the plant's start-up phase, relishes the comparison with the bad old days. But the young Canadian is more concerned with relating the Eisenach plant's performance to the bad old ways of its real-life peers and competitors. Patrolling the walkway above the robotised welding line in the bodyshop, where human beings do just 2 per cent of the work, he tots up the advantages of Opel's showpiece works. According to measuring standards set by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, it takes just 18.3 hours to build a car in Eisenach, compared with around 30 hours in the group's works in Bochum, western Germany, and Saragossa in Spain. The so-called MIT number at GM's British subsidiary, Vauxhall, is about 25. 'But the quality is not very good. . . . We make the best Astra in Europe,' he boasts, claiming that cars come off the Eisenach lines with only half a dozen defects each, compared with 20 at Bochum and 14 in Britain. But the works is much more than a modern car factory. It serves as a test site for lean production methods and team working, as a training ground for new management, and as an example to prove that despite the country's much-discussed disadvantages, making cars in Germany is and can remain an economic, competitive proposition. Mr Bell waves a hand across his super-lean 'buffer' stock of 10 underbodies, built up to keep work going further down the line if there is a fault in the body shop. 'There would be 365 in Bochum. A long buffer is inventory. It costs money,' he says. 'If this line breaks down we have 20 minutes to fix it before the next production stage runs out of work. They have six hours at Bochum.' Down on the final assembly line, Mr Chris Honda, another Canadian import from GM's CAMI joint venture with Suzuki in Ontario, points to typical on-hand stocks of parts sufficient for only two hours' work, compared with days'-worth elsewhere in the group. The merits of Eisenach's methods were recognised early by rival Volkswagen, which last year lured away the plant manager, Mr Jurgen Gebhardt, and made him production director at its Audi subsidiary. Mr Gebhardt's crucial role, his ex-colleagues say, was in convincing workers to accept flexible working practices unknown in western Germany. For example, the Eisenach body shop employs 10 skilled plant maintenance people per shift, compared with 300 in Bochum. While the new plant is far smaller, company officials insist that the comparison is valid. The key difference is that when a western German line stops through breakdown, non-maintenance workers sit on their hands while it is put right by the maintenance staff. At Eisenach, idled workers pitch in to help. A new works, unashamedly Japanese-inspired and custom-built to 21st century demands, Eisenach is already proving its worth. Not least noteworthy is that it is able to compete in cost terms with GM's low-pay Saragossa factory in the production of the company's new small car, the Corsa (sold as the Vauxhall Nova in Britain). VW, by comparison, has been forced by high German costs to move all its Polo production to Spain. But as Mr Bell and Mr Honda readily admit, it cannot escape the consequences of its position as the most junior member of the international GM family, and the realities of life in the worst downturn in the German motor industry since the war. Lacking its own presses - excess capacity elsewhere ruled out new installations on site - it relies on Bochum and Spain for body parts. 'I'd like us to build as much as we could and keep quality control under one roof,' says Mr Bell. Mr Honda also cites quality as an argument for the new works' having more local sources. 'But Opel wants only one supplier for each part for Spain and Eisenach,' he says. Meanwhile, despite its quality record, the plant's Astra output is being switched to Bochum where the recession has forced the introduction of short-time working. This will leave Eisenach with the Corsa only, and postpone full-scale testing of its ability to produce up to seven vehicle variants on a single line. Eisenach is a small fish in the group's manufacturing pool. 'You have to remember that GM sells 1.7m cars a year in Europe, and we have capacity to make only 150,000 of them,' notes Mr Bell. But it has a potentially more important role as a breeding ground for what Opel calls its 'missionaries' to spread the new manufacturing technology and philosophy. The man who set up its state-of-the-art paint shop is now working at Vauxhall in Ellesmere Port. Mr Honda's predecessor is now managing a plant of his own in Georgia in the US. But something more than missionary zeal is required. Mr Honda, only eight months in Germany, already recognises the scale of the task confronting him and his colleagues when their turn comes to spread the message. 'It is one thing to succeed with a new plant on a greenfield site, manned by new people who have no prejudices or preconceptions,' he says. It is another to succeed in places where factories, ideas and attitudes have been established for decades.</p>

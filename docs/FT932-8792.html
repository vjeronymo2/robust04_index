			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / International Bonds: Danish vote may prove watershed for Ecu sector DENMARK'S second referendum on the Maastricht treaty is likely to prove a watershed for the Ecu bond market. Late last week, dealers reported a spurt of buying activity ahead of the May 18 referendum, as positive sentiment grew on the chances for a Yes vote. In the run-up to the election, the level of decided Yes voters has consistently run at about 60 per cent. In addition, a wave of enthusiasm was generated by the devaluations of the peseta and the escudo on Thursday. According to dealers, a Yes vote is now largely discounted in the market. But it seems clear that, while a Yes vote would help restore confidence in the sector, the market is not about to recover all the ground lost in the last year. A year ago the Ecu bond market was riding high. Ecu bonds had become a component of many large international bond portfolios, and were traded as an additional European government bond market. On the back of the so-called 'convergence' theory - that European interest rates would converge on the path to European monetary union - Ecu bond yields fell rapidly. Before the first Danish referendum on June 2 1992, actual Ecu bond yields were 60 basis points below the theoretical yield curve (calculated according to the proportionate bond yields of the Ecu's component currencies). The only rationale for the premium level of Ecu bonds was that they were set to form the single European bond market. In the wake of the June referendum, when that assumption was severely tested, the heavy supply of new issues was cut off overnight and liquidity disappeared. Then, pressures on the European exchange rate mechanism further crushed confidence in the sector, and by September actual yields were 50 basis points higher than the theoretical curve. However, the market has staged something of a recovery this year, and with actual yields now about 10 basis points through the theoretical curve, dealers believe it to be more rationally based. There are some reasons to argue that the market could rally sharply in the event of a Yes vote. The market is flat to slightly long ahead of the referendum. Last year, the market's collapse was exacerbated because traders had very long positions ahead of the vote, either for speculative purposes or because they had substantial inventory left over from new issues. This year, retail investors and asset swappers have taken excess paper out of the market. This means that the risk of a structural collapse has been removed, according to Mr Steve Major, an analyst at Credit Lyonnais Securities. He believes that yields could fall to 30 basis points through the theoretical yield curve on a Yes vote, or rise to 20-30 basis points above the theoretical curve on a No vote. However, he cautions that the ratification delay in the UK and constitutional questions over German ratification mean that the uncertainty is not over. A Yes vote should help pave the way for a revival of activity in the primary market. According to IFR Securities Data, only 14 new issues have been launched in the Ecu market since the last Danish vote, though both the French and UK governments have restored their Ecu programmes. A number of key borrowers are expected to tap the market if conditions improve. The European Community and the European Investment Bank have both maintained their presence in the market and are expected to return. In addition, Finland, Sweden and Spain are all said to be looking at the market. Finland launched an Ecu500m issue in February. There are also hopes that Belgium will revive its plans to develop its own Ecu government bond programme, shelved after the market collapsed. However, even if the market rallies, dealers believe that its status as a quasi-government bond market will not return. Many institutional investors still have not returned to the market, and not all of them will be persuaded to change their minds by a Yes vote. 'The Ecu has returned to trading as a basket currency,' said Mr Michael Burke, an economist at Citibank. 'Only the most die-hard enthusiast' can expect a return to its previous status, he added. The Shenzhen stock exchange plans to take a series of measures aimed at lifting overseas interest in its flagging market for B-shares, Reuter reports from Beijing. It will unify its listing and currency clearing, give seats to overseas securities dealers and reduce the time lapse between issuing and marketing of B-shares. The exchange says it will work to ensure more information on B-share transactions.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, April 9 (ATA) -- At the end of his visit to  Albania, the NATO supreme commander, General Joulwan, held a  joint press release with the minister of defence, Safet Zhulali.    Minister Zhulali said that Albania favours close cooperation  with NATO and an active participation in the Partnership For  Peace. Mr. Zhulali expressed Albania's readiness to open its  airport facilities to missions of the Alliance to preserve peace  and stability in the region and beyond. He voiced Albania's  commitment to participate in all the NATO structures. Joint  military training, Mr. Zhulali said, will help the Albanian Army  to keep up with the standards of NATO's member countries. The  Albanian Army, he added, is preparing a company, which, after  qualification, can take part in the peacekeeping forces of the  United Nations.    He said that they are making arrangements for the Albanian  forces to participate in rescue operations and to deliver  humanitarian aid to the fighting areas.    Mr. Zhulali said that Albania has asked for greater material  assistance and training of Albanian personnel in NATO's member  country academies. He received positive replies to both these  requests. Minister Zhulali said that they also discussed the  possibility of the extension of the conflict to Kosova and  further south as well as the threat posed by Serbian repression  of the Albanian population in Kosova.    General Joulwan described the aim of his visit, which he  related to Albania's support for the CSCE resolutions and NATO  initiatives, its very strategic position in the region and  Europe. "I appreciate your national commitment to freedom and  democracy," General Joulwan said. "They are values for all the  NATO countries with which we share these ideals. The general  appreciated the commitment to strengthen democratic  institutions, and the development of structures within the army.  We will be looking forward to your document of presentation in  the context of Partnership For Peace, which will present  Albania's goals and objectives. NATO will do its utmost to  create and build up mutual confidence between NATO and Albania.  "I say you are on the right path," General Joulwan said.    To the question whether the Albanian Army can be furnished  with new weaponry, General Joulwan said that "we are in the  process of reviewing the request in order to examine the  strategic role of Albania, but we shall do our best to help you."    Asked about NATO's attitude in case the conflict spreads in  Kosova and beyond, General Joulwan replied that NATO, the United  Nations, and other international organizations are deeply  concerned over this matter. The UN forces, the Nordic and  American battalions in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  show that the situation in this zone has been under serious  consideration, General Joulwan said.</p>

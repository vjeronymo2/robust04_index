			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 22 Apr (EFE) -- Czech Prime Minister  Vaclav Klaus said today that the Czech Republic, which is  following the path of economic liberalism, was able to  completely change the political and social system because  communism and the so-called socialism with a human face "lead  nowhere."    A complement to the market economy is an "effective" social  policy, said Klaus, who pointed out that regional blocs should  not become fortresses that exclude third countries.    Klaus, who arrived for an official visit on 20 April,  underlined during a news conference "the enormous results shown  by the Chilean economic transformation" and the efforts made  toward democracy.    He also expressed the Czech Republic's interest in trade and  joint investments in Chile. He noted, however, that some work  still remains to be done to eliminate all the obstacles to  increasing bilateral trade.    In this regard, he pointed out the need to expedite  negotiations for signing an agreement on investment protection,  and another for eliminating double taxation.    He said he explained this and other proposals to Chilean  President Eduardo Frei and to the economic area ministers with  whom he met.    He indicated that he had proposed to Chilean officials "the  use of all means" to reach a liberalization of trade relations  with the signing of a free trade agreement.    He also proposed the creation of joint commissions, both  government and business, to study other bilateral relations  possibilities.    Prime Minister Klaus came with a delegation of 70  businessmen, who met with Chilean economic officials in the  public and private sectors.    Klaus and Chilean acting Foreign Minister Jose Miguel  Insulza  signed today a cooperation agreement in the areas of culture,  education, and science.    During his stay in Chile, Klaus met with President Frei, the  ministers of the economic area, businessmen, Chamber of Deputies  President Jorge Schaulsohn, and Supreme Court President Marcos  Aburto.    Prime Minister Klaus also gave a lecture in the Diplomatic  Academy, and was declared guest of honor in Santiago. He will  leave for Brazil today.</p>

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Anglian Water to shed 900 jobs Anglian Water yesterday announced 900 job cuts in the latest indication of the upheaval facing the water sector as it faces a tougher pricing regime from next year. The UK utility, based in the Huntingdon constituency of prime minister Mr John Major, is cutting 17 per cent of the 5,200 jobs in its core water and sewerage business. Anglian is believed to be one of the top five employers in the region. Mr Chris Mellor, Anglian's finance director, said virtually all the job cuts would come from administration, with little scope left for trimming the blue collar side after substantial cuts in the mid-1980s. At least two or more layers of management would be stripped out, he said. Anglian is taking a Pounds 60m provision this year to pay for the redundancies and reorganisation. Mr Mellor said Anglian expected to make cost savings of more than Pounds 20m a year after 1996/97, with some savings beginning this year. About 500-600 of the proposed job cuts would take effect from October, with the balance over the next two years. The announcement comes as water companies examine the draft price increases set by Ofwat, the industry regulator, in May. Mr Ian Byatt, director general of Ofwat, is thought to feel the water companies have not cut costs quickly enough since privatisation in 1989. He is expected to set tough efficiency targets as part of the current price review, which will be made public on July 28. The Pounds 60m charge left pre-tax profits 40 per cent down at Pounds 132.2m for the year to March 31. Stripping out the provision, profits were 4 per cent ahead at Pounds 192.2m. Sales were 18 per cent up at Pounds 687.9m. The core utility reported a 20 per cent fall in operating profits to Pounds 171.8m on sales 6 per cent ahead at Pounds 594.5m. Acquisitions helped the unregulated division increase sales from Pounds 29.1m to Pounds 102.4m. The Pounds 4.3m costs of closing non-core businesses left the unregulated operation with losses of Pounds 3.5m against Pounds 5m last time. The dividend was increased to 15.5p, for a total 8 per cent higher at 22.8p. Earnings per share fell by 31 per cent to 39p. Excluding the charge, earnings were 5 per cent ahead at 59.2p.

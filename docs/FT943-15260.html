			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / France steps up plea for support France will today step up its quest for an honourable exit from Rwanda with an appeal by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur to the United Nations Security Council for other countries to replace French troops in the central African state by the end of this month. The Security Council gave France the go-ahead on June 22 to send 2,500 troops to try to prevent further massacres of refugees caught up in the Rwandan civil war, before the arrival of the UN's planned 'Minuar' peacekeeping force later this summer. But Mr Balladur said from the outset that he wanted the stop-gap French force out of Rwanda by July 31. Despite the presence of some Senegalese troops already in Rwanda and 500 Ghanaian soldiers due next week and of some Canadians and Australians, there is growing nervousness in France that the full Minuar force will not be ready in time for France to stick to its self-imposed deadline. Mr Francois Leotard, the defence minister, warned the French Senate last week that at least some French troops would have to stay on into August. Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, said at the end of last week that he had been advised by UN headquarters that the new UN multinational peacekeeping force would be ready to relieve the French by early August. Before flying to New York, Mr Balladur said over the weekend that he hoped to convince aid agencies to do more to help the 900,000 Rwandan refugees estimated to be in or near the security zone in the south-west of the country, and to persuade other countries to carry out their commitments to supply soldiers to the Minuar force.</p>

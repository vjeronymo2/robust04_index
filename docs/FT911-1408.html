			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Moves to cut Pep delays BRADFORD &amp; Bingley Building Society has had teething problems with its personal equity plans, which invest in BP and ICI shares. The Peps represent a bold attempt to sell shares to the mass market, harnessing shares in two large blue chip companies to a building society with many retail outlets. However, the service has not functioned smoothly. One FT reader had to wait more than a month for his shares to be purchased, having sent a cheque for Pounds 6,000 to Bradford &amp; Bingley on March 15. During that time the share price rose by more than 20p. He was sent no receipt for his cheque and only discovered it had been cashed when he saw his bank statement. The building society now says that cheques for the ICI Pep will be acknowledged. The delay occurred because of several factors: Bradford &amp; Bingley had to allow seven days for the cheque to clear. It also had to allow a statutory 'cooling-off' period of seven days before the purchase could be made. These periods ran concurrently. The reader already held shares in BP, and wanted to transfer them to the Pep. This cannot be done directly - the shares have to be sold and bought back within the Pep before the rest of the purchase can be made. These two delays meant that a deadline for opening the plan was missed. Bradford &amp; Bingley only guarantees that the plan will be opened within two weeks of receipt of the funds by the plan manager. It is only possible to open plans on one day each fortnight. Peps need to be held for several years before the benefits of reinvesting dividends gross and avoiding capital gains tax begin to pay off. There is a time delay, thanks to 'cooling-off', with nearly all Peps, and they are not for those who wish to play the market. Peps are good for profiting from the equity market in the long-term. Bradford &amp; Bingley offers the option within the Pep of investing Pounds 3,000 in a unit trust which tracks the FTSE index - plainly a package for the risk-averse. Investing in equities via the mass market is not easy but Bradford &amp; Bingley's decision to acknowledge cheques will overcome one of the difficulties.</p>

			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Producer prices held down by competition Powerful competitive forces held down prices for UK manufactured products in July in spite of upward pressure on the costs of industry's fuel and raw materials. The prices charged by UK manufacturers were unchanged on balance between June and July, bringing the annual rate of output price inflation down from 2.1 per cent in June to 1.9 per cent last month, its lowest since December 1986, the Central Statistical Office reported yesterday. The so-called core measure of output price inflation, which excludes food, beverages, tobacco and petroleum, was also subdued. It increased by 0.2 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis between June and July, while the year-on-year rate slipped from 2 per cent in June to 1.9 per cent in July, its lowest rise since November 1967. Raw material and fuel prices dipped by 0.3 per cent on an unadjusted basis between June and July, reflecting a seasonal fall in home-produced food manufacturing inputs. Elsewhere, seasonally adjusted figures and revisions to the CSO's June data pointed to a strengthening of input price inflation. The input price index rose by an adjusted 0.5 per cent last month after a 1.3 per cent jump in June that was revised upwards from 0.8 per cent in the CSO's initial report a month ago. Input prices rose an unadjusted 2.9 per cent in the 12 months to July compared with a rise of 2.2 per cent in the year to June and year-on-year declines as recently as April. The Treasury welcomed the continued evidence of subdued inflationary pressures at the factory gate. Some City economists warned, however, that output prices may soon rise. Mr Andrew Cates of UBS said: 'The evidence suggests that the current rate of output price inflation has probably reached its trough.' Mr Cates, forecasting that underlying retail price inflation could breach the government's 4 per cent target ceiling in the middle of next year, said: 'Input prices are increasing faster than output prices, unit wage costs are under pressure and firms are desirous to expand their profit margins.' The year-on-year increase in input prices largely re-flected the higher costs of most categories of imported materials. While annual output price inflation fell for a wide range of goods, higher commodity prices were reflected in higher year-on-year prices for pulp and paper products, chemicals and petroleum products.</p>

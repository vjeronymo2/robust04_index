			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / UK Local Elections: Labour demands talks on London Labour yesterday woke up to sweeping new opportunities to co-ordinate policy across London. For the first time since the abolition of the Greater London Council in 1986, the party has overall control of a majority of the London boroughs - 17 out of 32. This will allow it to chair all the joint co-ordinating committees formed in the wake of the GLC's abolition. These control fire, civil defence, planning advice to government (although not planning itself), grants to voluntary organisations, research (mainly into the environment), and concessionary fares for pensioners, along with some transport functions such as parking and the committee to ban lorries. Mr Toby Harris, leader of Haringey borough council, where Labour gained 14 seats from the Conservatives, and of the Labour-controlled Association of London Authorities, signalled that the party's ambitions go beyond this. It wants to concentrate on urban regeneration and partnerships with the private sector, rather than the confrontational politics for which the old GLC is remembered. He said he was seeking an immediate meeting with Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, to discuss a new initiative for the future of the city - establishing a 'Regeneration Partnership for London'. He added: 'Based upon a partnership between central government, the London boroughs and the private sector, this new initiative will harness public and private-sector resources and will require proper direction.' Labour also intends to use its extra strength to lobby for more European funds and to try to end the division of London authorities into two representative associations. The ALA was intended to provide an easy vehicle for re-establishing a London-wide authority once Labour was returned to government. This remains a central Labour aim, as Mr Harris stated yesterday. All its members are Labour-controlled, and the organisation concentrates on campaigning. It broke away from the London Boroughs Association, whose remaining members are predominantly Conservative, and the two organisations have lobbied in different directions, weakening attempts to create a cohesive 'London voice'. The ALA claimed that several councils had already contacted it yesterday, asking to join, while the LBA was non-committal about its future. An alternative, which would do away with division altogether, would see all 17 Labour councils joining the LBA. Both organisations are due to have meetings at the beginning of June. Labour cannot wield as much power as it did by controlling the GLC. Several joint committees, including the grants committee for voluntary organisations, require a two-thirds majority to agree a new budget. Also, several GLC functions, such as transport, have been removed from local government.</p>

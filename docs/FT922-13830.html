			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Election 1992: Fizz goes out of poll night parties BRITAIN goes to the polls today, but three weeks of campaigning have left voters in anything but a party mood. Recession, a lacklustre campaign, and the prospect of a hung parliament have taken some of the fizz out of the traditional euphoria. Indications are that around 20m voters will slump in front of their TV screens heaving a sigh of relief that the whole thing is finally over. 'There isn't much to celebrate really,' sighed one senior City of London banker. 'The Tories have done a lousy campaign and the country is about to vote in Mr Kinnock as prime minister.' But if 13 years of Conservative rule comes to an end tonight at least some groups will be marking the event in style. Mr Conrad Black, proprietor of the Daily Telegraph, at London's Savoy Hotel, and Lord Wolfson, chairman of Great Universal Stores, at Claridges, are both hosting parties for the great and the good (provided they vote Conservative). At the Savoy, customers can enjoy an Pounds 18-a-head election buffet while the Dorchester has a special Pounds 35 menu which includes a mystery dessert entitled Surprise D'Election.

'It isn't done to be so showy any more,' a spokeswoman confided. 'Actually, a lot of our clients have been hit by the Lloyd's affair.' The three main parties will toast their success or drown their sorrows, although by tonight some of them may be wishing they were at the Golden Lion Hotel in Ashburton, Devon. Here, 250 devotees of the Monster Raving Loony Party will commence three days of revelry, due to last until Monday morning. 'We'll be questioning why everything went so right for us,' a spokesman explained. 'We're not used to things going so well.' For those who favour a more academic approach, the London School of Economics is hosting a party for 250 with its own experts, including Lord Desai and Professor Kenneth Minogue, and their very own swingometer preparing to compete with the TV pundits and their computer graphics. Around the world, expatriate Britons will be gathering in venues as diverse as the British Embassy in Paris and the American Club in Rio de Janeiro. 'There is a British club,' admitted one Rio-based ex-pat, 'but the American one has a happy hour and CNN.'</p>

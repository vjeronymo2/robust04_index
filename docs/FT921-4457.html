			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Arts: My Fair Lady - The Opera House, Manchester This new production of My Fair Lady is well timed, has already been extensively hyped and is likely now to visit London. There has been some brouhaha over whether or when national press would be invited to review these Manchester performances - and therefore over whether Mancunians were being given merely a preview or rehearsal run. Frankly, a lot more rehearsal and revision would have helped. There are at present just three good reasons to catch it: Helen Hobson, the fresh new Eliza; the elegant and original sets by David Fielding; and My Fair Lady itself. The last is the most important. Most of the brilliant dialogue is straight out of Shaw's Pygmalion, and yet the song lyrics prove just as memorable. This is something rare in musicals, but rarer yet by far is the fact that the songs are made buoyant less by Lerner's words than by Loewe's music. (Even Higgins's Sprechgesang is, or should be, intensely musical.) But I could not write this way if this production were my first experience of My Fair Lady. The lyrics are under-inflected, some performers are under-voiced and over-amplified, several parts are miscast, and neither Eliza nor Higgins emerges as a star role. Helen Hobson does everything well, has enough voice for it all and exaggerates nothing. She has timing, feeling and fun. But she is as yet only half the Eliza she could be, and for this and much else, Simon Callow, the director, is to blame. She never, for example, learns to carry or turn her head elegantly or expressively. (Several of the other, more experienced actors do not even seem to know how to use their eyes.) Edward Fox makes a nonsense of Higgins by blurring his consonants, drawling his vowels (he calls them 'vahls'), and dawdling behind the music. He works his six facial expressions for maximum contrast, but none of them conveys intelligence. When he says 'I have my own spark of divine fire' ('fah'), no-one believes him. He takes Eliza to a place which he calls 'Airscot' and which Michael Medwin's atrocious Pickering calls 'Ashcot'. What kind of phonetics do these two club bores know? There are minor signs that Callow has tried to 'reconceive' this beloved show, not very revealingly. Mrs Pearce (Jennie Goosens) has become Irish, and Mrs Higgins (Sheila Burrell) is now a Bohemian artist. Jasper Conran, the designer, has made the Embassy Ball a dingy, vulgar affair - horridly choreographed by Quinny Sacks - in which Eliza's simple white neo-Grecian gown is a breath of fresh air; the idea does not come off. Wittier is his Ascot, with all the ladies dressed like stems and wearing huge flower hats; Eliza, as an all-pink rose, really is the purest and loveliest here. David Fielding's non-realist designs would not surprise an opera audience. In a musical, they are a shock. The basic white set, with columns and walls in classical English architectural style, is printed all over with words from Shaw's ideal phonetic language (for example, 'laeqgwej'). He always makes much of Shaw's dominant symbols: most wittily in the Covent Garden scenes, where the old fruit and vegetable market stands right before the distant and tilted Opera House. 'Laeqgwej' is what will take Eliza from the former to the latter.</p>

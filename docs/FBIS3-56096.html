No Sensation"]    [Text] Despite the tradition which has become rooted in  the style of young Russian parliamentarianism, the first sitting  of the upper chamber of the Federal Assembly began in a calm and  organized manner with no sensations.    As planned, the sitting was opened by Boris Yeltsin. While  paying ritual rhetorical tribute in the form of congratulations  to deputies on their "great personal and political success" and  expressing his intention to cooperate with the legislators and  conduct consultations with parliamentary faction leaders, the  president also identified a number of points of principle in his  speech.    First and foremost he noted that most Federation Council  members are "experienced political figures who have learned the  secrets of power and are capable of distinguishing real politics  from petty politicking." This could well have been a passing  allusion to the composition of the State Duma, which as yet is  frighteningly unpredictable, unlike the Federation Council,  which is dominated by the heads of the executive branch in the  republics, krays, and oblasts -- firm pragmatists who are  prepared for dialogue with the Kremlin and, equally importantly,  are capable of controlling the situation in their regions. The  president thereby made it plain that he sees his parliamentary  support primarily in the Federation Council, which has the right  of veto over highly important decisions from the lower chamber  and is able to bring the Duma legislators to their senses as  necessary.    The appeal to "forget revolutionary terminology and jettison  relapses into morbid suspicion and political maximalism" had an  extremely timely ring and was maybe the first time it had been  heard from the president's lips.    Boris Yeltsin also stated that the president's annual  message  to the Federal Assembly, which is stipulated by the  Constitution, will be presented in the very near future after  the organizational matters relating to each of the chambers'  work have been resolved. The message will propose a program of  political and economic transformations for 1992 and the basic  guidelines of domestic and foreign policy.    There is one sentence which should probably be regarded as  the key fragment in the president's speech: "No matter who our  voters voted for, they were unanimous that the Russian  Federation must continue to be an integral state, a solid  federation. It is out obligation to fulfill this wish."    The president is indubitably aware that the specter of  separatism looming over the Federation has by no means been  exorcized by the adoption of the new Constitution. Having  received a nationwide mandate to pursue a more autonomous, more  independent policy, regional leaders, it goes without saying,  will not pass up the chance of making use of it. And the  Federal Assembly [as published] hall of sessions will become an  arena of struggle to coordinate the interests of the center and  the provinces. Giving a foretaste of this struggle, the  president recalled the precise constitutional delimitation of  the areas of responsibility of the Federation and its  components, noting at the same time that "strong regions are a  condition of Russia's prosperity."    Then, in accordance with constitutional procedure, Yuriy  Chernichenko, the oldest deputy in the upper chamber, took the  chair for the first sitting of the Federal Assembly [as  published], calling on Kaliningrad Oblast Administration Head  Yuriy Matochkin and Sakhalin Governor Yevgeniya Krasnoyarova to  act as his assistants.    The draft standing orders for the first day of the sitting  stipulated the election of the credentials commission, which has  already happened, and also the approval of the agenda, which  presupposes a most important matter: the election of the  Federation Council chairman and his deputies.    In reply to my question about which candidacy for the post  of  head of the upper chamber seems preferable to him, Bashkortostan  President Murtaza Rakhimov noted that he has no personal  antipathy toward, say, Vladimir Shumeyko, but in his view the  Federal Assembly [as published] should be led by a person with  experience of leading a republic, kray, or oblast. Here Murtaza  Rakhimov stressed that the Federation Council chairman must be  "someone with a Russian surname," from which it an be inferred  that, for example, Ramazan Abdulatipov and Eduard Rossel, who  figure among the contenders for this post, should not  particularly count on being successful.    On the other hand, Krasnodar Kray Administration Head  Nikolay  Yegorov assessed Vladimir Shumeyko's chances as pretty high  ("the whole of the North Caucasus is for him"), while at the  same time noting the "anti-Kremlin mood" of a considerable  proportion of the Federal Assembly.    The first sitting of the upper chamber of parliament is  continuing. After the procedural warm-up, it is likely that 11  January will also see the beginning of substantive debate.</p>

Information provided by the Commission reveals the  following:    (a) Following the G-7 meeting in Munich in July 1992 (which  should be considered the starting point of international  assistance to improve nuclear safety because it gave rise to a  multilateral action program and the decision in principle to  create a multilateral fund of 700 million dollars), the EC  accepted responsibility for coordinating implementation of the  program agreed in Munich within the G-24. In early 1993, work  to create the multilateral fund was concluded and its  administration has been entrusted to the European Bank for  Reconstruction and Development [EBRD]. Since the implementation  of the Munich action program, a total of 506 assistance programs  have been listed in the G-24 data bank, involving 16 donors  (including the European Union), five international organizations  and 15 beneficiary countries. These 506 programs involve a  total of ECU461.25 million, of which more than 60 percent is  provided directly by the EC (through its PHARE and TACIS  programs) and by the member states;    (b) Regarding the organization of implementation of the  Munich action program, the EC has contributed to a large measure  in the achievement of several positive results, in particular:    - three working groups (Kozloduy, Training and Civil  Liability) are fully operational, while three other issues  (Slovakia, RMBK and Regulatory Authorities) are being handled in  ad hoc working groups;    - institutional arrangements are fully operational (the  Plenary Group meets twice a year and the Steering Committee four  times a year). A secretariat has been established with the  status of an independent unit within Directorate-General XI of  the European Commission (it comprises European civil servants  and national experts from Germany, Belgium, France, Japan,  United Kingdom and Russia);    - the data bank has reached an advanced state of development  and is now being used by the secretariat and members of the G-24  as a tool for the administration of bilateral and multilateral  cooperation. The system will be perfected soon so as to make  distance access possible. Moreover, the secretariat's missions  in Hungary, Slovakia and Bulgaria have made it possible to  incorporate the data bank into national programs for the  improvement of safety being developed in these countries without  western assistance;    - information on projects underway is provided by means of a  quarterly publication (NUSAC News).    (c) In addition to participation in decisionmaking and  multilateral fund management bodies, the EC has established  close technical cooperation between the G-24 secretariat and the  EBRD secretariat (meetings are held regularly in Brussels). The  Commission notes that this cooperation has already proved  productive regarding the case of the nuclear power station in  Kozloduy (Bulgaria), with approval of an initial project  totalling ECU25 million on which the G-24 Kozloduy working group  has issued a favorable technical opinion. An identical  procedure is underway for the Ignalina station in Lithuania and  will be used subsequently for a number of projects in Russia.    (d) Regarding the outlook for 1994, a stepped-up effort will  be made to improve coordination of aid to beneficiary countries  in the area of legal matters so as to establish international  confidence facilitating the exchange of know-how. Two specific  aspects will be the focus of this initiative:    - the development of an appropriate framework in terms of  civil liability to enable western suppliers to more easily  deliver equipment and material. The G-24 ad hoc group on civil  liability will continue providing follow-up to national  developments in nuclear law and will continue its contacts with  the nuclear industry and the insurance sector;    - the development of legislation on intellectual property.</p>

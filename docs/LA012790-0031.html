			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PBS BROADCAST OF AN ISRAELI VIEW OF INTIFADA  </P> <P> In his Jan. 16 review of the documentary "A Search for Solid Ground: The  Intifada Through Israeli Eyes," Howard Rosenberg announces that his suspicions  have been confirmed: "PBS has a pro-Jewish double standard" concerning the  intifada.  </P> <P> It is not that he finds the film unbalanced; indeed he finds it "more balanced"  than the controversial "Days of Rage."  </P> <P> In fact, Rosenberg praises "A Search," acknowledging the program's quality is  not at issue -- a point that doesn't stop him from drawing gratuitous parallels  between Israel and South Africa or the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> According to Rosenberg, the proof of PBS' "pro-Jewish double standard" is that  "A Search" is accompanied by a 30-minute panel discussion, unlike the 60-minute  wrap-around of "Days of Rage."  </P> <P> JERRY SHAPIRO, Anti-Defamation League, Associate Director, Los Angeles  </P></p>

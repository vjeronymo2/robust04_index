			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / International Company News: IBM promotions may offer clues to Akers succession INTERNATIONAL Business Machines has identified its next generation of top executives with the election of five new senior vice-presidents, from among whose ranks the successor to Mr John Akers, chairman and chief executive, is expected to be chosen. Mr Akers will reach 60, the traditional retirement age for IBM executives, in December 1994. Speculation about his successor has been rife for the past year, but the new appointments appear to narrow the field to a handful of the company's top managers, all of whom are in their late 40s. The five are: Ms Ellen Hancock, 49, general manager of the networking systems division, and the first woman to be elevated to the level of senior vice-president at IBM; Mr James Cannavino, 48, general manager of the personal systems division, which includes personal computers and workstations; Mr Robert LaBant, 47, general manager of US operations; Mr Ned Lautenbach, 48, president of IBM Asia Pacific; and Mr Bernard Puckett, 48, general manager of the applications solutions division. Notably absent from the line-up is Mr Nick Donofrio, general manager of the enterprise systems division, which develops and manufactures mainframe computers, IBM's traditional flagship products. Within IBM, the bets are on Mr Robert LaBant, who was assistant to Mr Akers from 1983 to 1987. In 1990, he became general manager of application business systems, overseeing one of IBM's most successful lines, the AS/400 mid-range computer products. Also named by insiders as a likely successor to Mr Akers is Mr Bernard Puckett, a former head of IBM's corporate strategy and planning, who took up his current position last year. Mr Puckett is said to be playing a key role in IBM's efforts to establish closer links with its customers.</p>

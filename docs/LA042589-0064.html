			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. MOVES TO BOLSTER SUPERCOMPUTER STANCE  </P> <P> The U.S. government is gearing up to prevent Japan from dominating yet another  segment of the high-technology industry, the small but strategic field of  supercomputers.  </P> <P> Supercomputers are used for the most complex computing jobs such as determining  air flow over an airplane wing, designing new weapons systems, cracking  military codes or mapping the human body's genes.  </P> <P> Priced at $20 million apiece, the machines' processing speed is so great it is  measured in billions of computing operations per second.  </P> <P> Government officials are talking of increased funding, congressional hearings,  interagency studies and a possible industry consortium to prevent major U.S.  research and development work from depending on foreign models.  </P> <P> But scientists who do that research are less concerned about Japanese dominance  of the field than by the possibility that the United States may keep them from  buying the best machines available.  </P> <P> </P> <P> User Industries  </P> <P> "The real economic impact of supercomputers is not on the industry that makes  them, it's the industries that use them -- aerospace, automobiles, oil," said  Sydney Karin, director of the San Diego Supercomputing Center. "We must be  careful about any efforts to restrict the optimal supercomputers for these  users."  </P> <P> Federal officials are more circumspect. High-performance computing is obviously  critical to science and engineering, which must not depend on outmoded  technology, said William Wulf, assistant director of computing and information  sciences for the National Science Foundation.  </P> <P> But Wulf added: "We must be careful to balance the need for cost-effective  computing and having a vigorous indigenous supercomputer industry."  </P> <P> The nation's supercomputer makers have attracted attention after two disturbing  announcements for the U.S. industry this month: NEC Corp. of Japan now claims  to have the world's fastest computer, while Control Data Corp. said it would  shut down its supercomputer business, leaving only Cray Research Inc. in the  domestic field.  </P> <P> NEC's news had been expected for some time, but Control Data's pullout -- part  of a $490-million restructuring to revive sluggish earnings -- surprised  government and industry alike.  </P> <P> The House Science, Space and Technology Committee was "shocked" by Control  Data's decision to close ETA Systems Inc., said Executive Director Harold  Hansen.  </P></p>

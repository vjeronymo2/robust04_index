			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Zhu Yucheng Stresses That No Department or </F> Individual Is Allowed to Interfere in China's Judicial  Independence"]    [Text] Zhu Yucheng, deputy director of the XINHUA Hong  Kong Branch emphasized yesterday that "Xi Yang's violation of  the law is a personal act and is unrelated to normal news  coverage by Hong Kong reporters on the mainland or to freedom of  the press at all."    Zhu Yucheng said: "I mentioned three points to the gentlemen  from the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong  yesterday: First, Xi Yang stole state secrets and violated  China's state security laws. It is completely within the scope  of China's sovereignty that judicial authorities try him in  accordance with laws of criminal procedure. Second, the Xi Yang  case involves state secrets, so no public trial was conducted in  accordance with laws of criminal procedure. This is a  characteristic not only of China's law, but also of the laws of  various countries around the world. Therefore, it was legal to  conduct a trial in camera. Third, Xi Yang's violation of laws  was a personal act. The fact that he stole state secrets is  incompatible with his status as a reporter. This is unrelated  to freedom of the press or to normal news coverage by Hong Kong  reporters on the mainland at all."    Zhu Yucheng also said that no unit or individual or  government department is allowed to interfere in China's  judicial independence.    Zhu Yucheng made the above remarks when attending the 1994  Spring soiree held by the Association of Hong Kong Chinese  Entrepreneurs at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center  in Wanchai last night.</p>

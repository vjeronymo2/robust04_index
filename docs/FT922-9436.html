			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / A revolution on the runway: Boeing, the world's largest commercial aircraft manufacturer, is adjusting to tougher competition A cultural revolution is taking place at Boeing. For the first time in its 75-year history, the world's leading manufacturer of commercial jets has appointed a woman - Mrs Rozanne Ridgway, a career diplomat  - to its all-male board of directors. More significantly, it is being forced to implement fundamental change in the way it does business. It has adopted a more open stance towards the outside world and is encouraging airlines, suppliers and subcontractors to participate actively in the design of its latest airliner, the 777 widebody twin engine jet. In the past, Boeing felt it knew what was best for its airline customers. 'But with the 777, Boeing has for the first time given us direct access to the process of designing a new aircraft,' says Mr James O'Sullivan, British Airway's chief project engineer on the 777 programme. Boeing is also openly talking for the first time of forging close ties, including equity partnerships, with other companies. 'We have always been a go-it-alone company with a fearsome amount of pride,' conceded Mr Frank Shrontz, Boeing's chairman. 'It has been difficult for us to share with others but we are changing that.' The reasons, according to Mr Shrontz, are the huge investments necessary to launch new programmes and the market risks which are forcing companies to pool their resources. 'I see more and more openness in that sense. I don't know where our next partners will come from but I am not ruling out partnerships with any other company in the world.' This new attitude reflects both the current conditions of the civil aviation market, which is still struggling to recover from its worst slump since the Second World War, and the changing nature of the competition facing Boeing. The biggest challenge has undoubtedly come from Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft consortium which has steadily built up market share during the past 20 years with advanced new aircraft and government subsidies. Airbus has now captured nearly 30 per cent of the world commercial jet market and has started making serious inroads into some of Boeing's traditional US airline customers. Airbus has not only developed a comprehensive family of aircraft to compete against Boeing, but has also sought to leapfrog its US rival by introducing new technological concepts to commercial jets. These include fly-by-wire controls, which enable the pilot's commands from the cockpit to be transmitted electronically rather than mechanically to the flaps and the rudder, and computer-aided design systems. The European consortium is now also threatening to challenge Boeing's dominance of the jumbo aircraft market by studying the development of a 600 to 800-seater aircraft for the end of the decade. But Boeing is facing a more immediate threat at the top end of the market from McDonnell Douglas. Boeing's American rival unveiled plans last week to build the MD12, a 430 to 510-seat double decker jumbo aircraft to compete against the Boeing 747-400 and the Seattle company's own longer-term plans to develop a 600 to 800-seater aircraft either by stretching the 747 or building an entirely new aircraft. Both McDonnell Douglas and Airbus are seeking partnerships in the Far East, one of the most promising markets for large jets, to help them develop their new jumbos. Airbus has already had preliminary talks with three Japanese manufacturers - Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Fuji Heavy Industries - to interest them in a possible equity partnership on its new jumbo project. McDonnell Douglas has been in negotiations for the past year to sell up to 49 per cent of its Douglas commercial aircraft business to Asian partners with Taiwan Aerospace leading the field. Last week, the Taiwanese company received qualified approval from its government to negotiate the purchase of up to 40 per cent of the Douglas business for Dollars 2bn. The proposed Taiwan Aerospace-Douglas deal has increasingly worried Boeing. It fears this could eventually lead to the emergence of what it calls an 'Asian Airbus'. Mr Shrontz said he hoped the deal would not force Boeing to fight another subsidised competitor. The tentative agreement reached last month between the European Commission and the US government on Airbus subsidies is expected to bring some discipline to the commercial aircraft market. The agreement will limit direct government support for future Airbus programmes to 33 per cent of their total development costs. 'We would have preferred zero subsidies and zero government involvement,' Mr Shrontz emphasised. While Boeing believes it has secured an acceptable compromise with Airbus, it fears Taiwan could distort the market because it is not a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) nor of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and therefore not bound by Gatt and OECD agreements on commercial aircraft trade. While Taiwan has made it clear that it seeks to join these organisations, it has also said it would finance up to 49 per cent of the Douglas deal with low interest loans and tax incentives. All these pressures have coincided with the worst slump in civil aviation in 40 years. And Boeing has not escaped the downturn. Although it has continued to report higher profits and sales (first quarter net profits of Dollars 441m this year represented a 43 per cent increase over the same period in 1991), Boeing is being forced to cut about 8,000 jobs this year and scale down production of its 737 narrowbody airliners from 21 a month to 14 a month next October. Rising profits have resulted from the high level of aircraft deliveries to customers and recovery in the company's military activities, while the job cuts reflect a slump in orders. Boeing does not expect any recovery in new orders until later next year. Some of its main US customers, including United Airlines, American and Delta, have announced deferrals of committed orders and significant cuts in spending. At the latest count, about 725 aircraft are lying idle in the Arizona desert. Mr Shrontz said he was optimistic about the longer-term prospects for the industry. In the short term, however, he acknowledged there was still considerable uncertainty. 'We need a couple more quarters to tell us that we are coming out of the recession and things are getting better,' he said. But Boeing says it cannot afford to wait for the recovery to be sure of retaining its 60 per cent share of the commercial jet market. Instead, the company has decided to act now. The strategy, reflecting the marketing and financial demands of airline customers, is most evident with the Dollars 5bn Boeing 777 programme. 'The real difference is the direct involvement of airline customers right at the start of the design of the aircraft,' said Mr Philip Condit, head of the 777 project and widely tipped to take over Boeing's commercial aircraft division if the new aircraft is a success. Boeing has formed 235 'design/build' teams grouping together airline designers and maintenance engineers, suppliers of components and subcontractors together with Boeing designers and engineers. These teams, devised by Mr Condit, use powerful computers which enable them to share their designs through a common database. International partners can therefore communicate directly from their headquarters. 'One of the things we are trying to do is to meet customer requirements as opposed to introducing technology for technology's sake,' Mr Condit said. This collaborative approach is also aimed at building what Boeing calls a 'consumer-driven service-ready aircraft'. Airlines have welcomed the change because it has helped them introduce specific improvements - such as the fitting of new overhead luggage bins and better-designed cabin lighting systems - more quickly. Boeing wants to reduce to a minimum the changes which normally have to be made to fix design problems during production of the aircraft and after it has been delivered to its first airline customers in 1995. In so doing, it is hoping to avoid repeating the mistakes made three years ago on the development of the 747-400, the newest member of its jumbo family. 'The scars of the 747-400 are still there,' Mr Condit conceded. Boeing was forced to delay delivery for several months of the 747-400 to initial customers because of teething problems and was also forced by airlines to make changes to its original design. 'With the 777, we want a fault-free introduction,' Mr Condit said. Boeing is introducing more electronics in the 777 than it has ever done on a new aircraft. The fly-by-wire system on the 777 will be as comprehensive as on any Airbus aircraft; Boeing is introducing liquid crystal displays in the cockpit; the 777 is the first aircraft Boeing has designed entirely by computers using a three-dimensional digital system called Catia developed by the French Dassault group; the US company is using computer-based training methods to prepare pilots and maintenance engineers; it is using new composite materials on the 777 tail and floor beams; it is also offering as an option a folding wing tip mechanism to enable the aircraft to park more easily at airport terminal gates. 'Boeing has been pushed by Airbus to develop a technically advanced aircraft. They want to overtake Airbus after the European group leapfrogged them,' explained Mr O'Sullivan of British Airways 'We are getting consistently better and cheaper Boeings because of Airbus and the competition,' he added. Mr Shrontz agreed. 'We would probably be a lot flabbier today without competition.' But with the launch of the 777 programme, 'it's bet your company time' all over again, added Mr Dick Albrecht, a Boeing executive vice-president. 'The development costs and lead times are so significant you really risk the health of the company every time you launch a new programme,' he said. And just as Boeing will start delivering the first 328-seater 777 widebody jets to customers in 1995, it will have to consider launching an even more expensive programme to develop its new jumbo aircraft. That aircraft is likely to cost more than the 777 and will inevitably force Boeing to accelerate its open-door strategy. For Boeing, survival as the industry leader will hinge on its ability to absorb such change.</p>

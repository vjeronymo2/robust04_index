			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PHOTO ESSAY;  </P> <P> AN ANCIENT LAND OPENING ITS DOORS  </P> <P> A renaissance of traditional culture is sweeping the landlocked Asian nation of  Mongolia. Long-ago conquerers of most of Asia and part of Europe, the Mongols  have lived in isolation under Communist rule since 1921.  </P> <P> But now the Mongolian People's Republic is swinging its doors open to the  world.  </P> <P> A renewed burst of nationalism is bringing looser ties with the Soviet Union  and new respect for all things Mongolian. The long-persecuted Buddhist faith is  in resurgence. Genghis Khan, who united warring tribes nearly 800 years ago and  set them on their path of conquest, is no longer condemned as a feudal  aggressor, but rather praised as a national hero.  </P> <P> This year, on the rolling grasslands that surround the capital of Ulan Bator,  Mongolians have held several traditional "Naddam" festivals, featuring the  national sports of wrestling, archery and horse racing. One festival marked a  late-summer visit by U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III. Another  honored Genghis Khan in a celebration of the 750th anniversary of the writing  of "The Secret History of the Mongols," which documented the famous conquerer's  life and the history of his people.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Wang Lingling: "Inflation Remains the </F> Country's Economic Scourge"]    [Text] Though inflation continued to run loose in  February, China's central authorities seem confident they can  tie it down.    On Tuesday, Premier Li Peng said the government would do its  best, with the nation's help, to keep the retail price index  below the budgeted 10 percent.    However, it will be a tough task as the pressure powering  inflation is growing, and in January and February, retail prices  rose 20 percent higher than in the same period of last year,  said the State Statistics Bureau (SSB).    So dealing with the problem has become a priority.    It will mean sharply cutting investment in fixed assets and  the strict control of consumer spending, which was agreed at a  forum on monetary policies held recently in Beijing.    The capital's financiers decided the central People's Bank  of  China should throttle the broad money supply to deal safely with  inflation's time bomb.    Economists believed runaway inflation inevitably leads to a  decline in people's living standards and threatens economic and  social stability.    The SSB said people's living standards in some cities  plunged  as much as 40 percent last year.    And farmers, who make up about 80 percent of the population,  are no happier than their urban counterparts.    The statistics showed their real per capita income remained  more or less static last year.    Most economists said two main factors were causing the  current rise in inflation.    One was hefty investments in fixed assets, the other was the  explosive increase in consumer spending.    Investment in fixed assets grew by 47 percent last year,  while production advanced only 10 percent, said Yu Tianyi,  professor from the China Finance Institute.    To curb rocketing investment in fixed assets and real  estate,  the country put the brakes on the money supply in the second  half of last year.    However, the move failed to retrieve most of the capital  which had by then become reinforced concrete. Instead, working  capital was squeezed, slowing the growth in production.    Yu said holding down investment in fixed assets would need  administrative measures backed by stern monetary policies.    The government has resolved to slow the country's economic  growth this year, said Premier Li Peng, in his keynote speech to  the National People's Congress (NPC).    The target is a 9 percent growth rate, four per cent lower  than the figure for the last two years.    To hold down the growth in fixed assets investment while  maintaining modest economic progress, the central bank should  impose strict controls over credit and loans, economists say.    However, that does not mean shutting down the money supply  indiscriminately.    Nationwide investment should focus on propping up essential  industries and agriculture and helping loss-making State  enterprises to improve their technology and production capacity.    These targets will only be achieved if governments, State  enterprises and banks speed up internal reforms and improve  their management.    However, some economists support a more flexible credit  policy to sustain backing for ailing State enterprises.    For their ability to pay back loans may decline if their  investments reduce sharply said Dai Genyou, an official with the  People's Bank of China.    The other cause of inflation is the huge rise in spending.    The tight monetary policies imposed late last year have held  down the prices of production materials, but had little effect  on consumer goods, said Dai.    Economists trace rising prices to the lifting last year of  controls on the cost of most consumer goods. The problem has  been further fueled by people's increased spending power as  their wages go up.    Dai said a third of State enterprises were in the red last  year despite considerably increased production. Much of their  cash was used to finance the rapid growth in employee's wages.    China should cap pay rises in order to restrain the growth  in  the retail price index, said Dai.</p>

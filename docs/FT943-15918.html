			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Yen's rise lifts imports of vehicles to Japan The yen's ability to defy gravity has been a boon to vehicle imports to Japan, which rose by 40.3 per cent to a record 137,966 units in the first half of this year, writes William Dawkins in Tokyo. Sales of imported vehicles climbed by 42.9 per cent last month from a year earlier, as Japanese consumers took advantage of the falling yen price of foreign cars. June represented the eighth monthly rise in a row, according to the Japan Automobile Importers' Association. Foreign car makers have not been the only winners. The overseas plants of Japanese producers have also benefited. Imports of foreign-made Japanese vehicles nearly doubled last month to just under 9,000 (30 per cent of all imports). Within the total, imports of passenger cars rose by 32.9 per cent in June, with Ford up 175 per cent, Chrysler up 104 per cent, and Nissan's UK plant showing a 95 per cent increase in sales to Japan.</p>

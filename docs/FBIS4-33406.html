			<p>BFN     [Text] The minister of justice received the government  order to act against anyone suspected of favoring a foreign  intervention in Haiti.    Reacting Saturday 4 June to the statements attributed to the  president-in-exile by the NEW YORK TIMES, the provisional  government of attorney Emile Jonassaint denounced Father  Jean-Bertrand Aristide's statements.    The Ministry of Information stated that it has formally  recorded the statements of the president-in-exile who, I quote:  After demanding and obtaining a total embargo against Haiti, is  calling for an armed action against the country, unquote. The  ministry asks the Justice Department to take the necessary  measures to start action against anyone who intends to promote  an invasion of Haiti, unquote.    The government also advised that the national territory  would  be defended by the Army. In three press releases issued on  Saturday 4 June, the provisional government denounced the  threats of invasion which weigh on the country.    The Ministry of the Interior protested against the violation  of Haitian territorial waters by some foreign ships and advised  that an order was given to the Armed Forces to take all measures  to defend the national territory.    The government, which asked the population to remain calm  and  vigilant in the face of the provocations, also indicated that  any attacks are likely to provoke a counterattack. The Haitian  Government, however, reiterated its feelings of friendship and  of cooperation toward other friendly countries.</p>

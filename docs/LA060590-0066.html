			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIMITS PROPOSED ON COMPANIES CLOSING FACILITIES  </P> <P> The pending closure of an Oscar Mayer plant in Vernon that will leave 537  workers jobless sparked a call Monday for federal and state laws that would  limit the freedom of healthy firms such as Oscar Mayer to shut facilities and  move elsewhere.  </P> <P> At a congressional hearing in Vernon, Rep. Matthew Martinez (D-Montebello)  suggested that Congress require corporations that wish to shut plants to file  "economic impact statements" justifying their business decision and providing  compensation for the financial and social problems caused by a closure.  </P> <P> And state Sen. Bill Greene (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the Senate Industrial  Relations Committee, said he favored a state law conditioning tax breaks for  business on a corporation's pledge to keep its business operating in a fixed  location for a certain number of years.  </P> <P> Wisconsin-based Oscar Mayer Foods Corp., which operates 21 manufacturing plants  throughout the country and reported $2.3 billion in revenues last year,  announced last March that it was closing the 39-year-old Vernon plant in  September because it is too small and too old.  </P> <P> Martinez, whose district is home to a number of the plant's workers, called  Monday's hearing as chairman of a House subcommittee on employment  opportunities. He said he did so after failing to persuade Oscar Mayer's parent  corporation, Philip Morris Companies, to reconsider the plant closing in  exchange for possible government assistance in modernizing the plant.  </P> <P> "It seems to me that a corporation should have a responsibility to communities  in which it operates . . . before turning out that final light on the plant.  Forty years of devotion and productivity dedicated to the company should earn  the community a similar measure of caring," Martinez said.  </P> <P> Leaders of United Food and Commercial Workers Local 770, which represents about  three-quarters of the workers at the plant, have charged that Oscar Mayer's  true reason for shutting the Vernon plant is not its physical condition but the  cost of its employees.  </P> <P> In shutting down the plant, Oscar Mayer is joining a national trend in which  cost-conscious companies attempt to rid themselves of union shops and older  workers. The Vernon plant meets both tests. Because it is unionized, workers  make about $10 an hour. By contrast, non-union packing house workers often make  only $6 an hour. And because 57% of the Vernon workers have 20 years or more  seniority, their health, benefit and pension costs are relatively high.  </P> <P> The age of the work force and the fact that 75% of the employees are Latino  will mean painful social dislocation for many workers once Oscar Mayer closes,  the union says.  </P> <P> At Monday's hearing, Ricardo Icaza, president of UFCW Local 770, vowed that his  28,000-member local is prepared to launch a consumer boycott of products  marketed by Philip Morris Companies and its Kraft General Foods and Miller  Brewing subsidiaries.  </P> <P> "Ironically, Philip Morris spends millions of dollars each year on advertising  and philanthropic activities directed at (the Latino) community. . . . We  believe an appeal from the Vernon workers to Hispanics across the nation,  citing specially targeted Philip Morris products, would prove very effective,"  Icaza said.  </P></p>

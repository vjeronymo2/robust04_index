			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / International Company News: Indonesia looks for strategic Garuda investor Indonesia plans to sell a stake in the national flag carrier, Garuda Indonesia Airways, to a foreign investor through a direct placement before offering its shares on the stock market, according to local press reports, AP-DJ reports from Jakarta. 'The strategic investor must be a foreign airline which has a good reputation internationally,' Mr Mar'ie Muhammad, Indonesia's finance minister, was quoted in the Jakarta Post as saying. He said the government would tender the sale of the stake among prospective investors who would be able to improve the performance of the 45-year-old airline. However, he declined to say what percentage of Garuda would be offered. He said that Garuda was still a long way from being able to list its shares on the stock market, and finding a 'strategic investor will help the performance of Garuda before it can meet the requirements for going public'. Garuda's latest financial report was given qualified opinions from the government audit agency. After-tax profit in 1993 dropped about 21 per cent to Rp73.44bn (Dollars 2.3bn) from Rp92.98bn in 1992. The finance minister said the privatisation of the airline would also make it more independent financially from the government.</p>

He  plans to have meetings with President Bill Clinton, Vice  President Albert Gore, the secretaries of defence, the treasury  and commerce, congressional leaders, the management of the World  Bank and the International Monetary Fund and members of the  business community.    A treaty between Ukraine and the United States on the  encouragement and mutual protection of investments and a  convention between the governments of the two countries on the  prevention of double taxation and of tax evasions on income and  capital taxes are to be signed during the visit.    The two governments are also to sign an agreement on  cooperation in science and technology and the Defence Ministries  will sign an agreement on additional assistance in eliminating  strategic nuclear weapons and preventing the proliferation of  weapons of mass destruction.    A wide range of matters of mutual interest are expected to  be  discussed, a State Department spokesman who requested anonymity  told ITAR-TASS. He did not rule out the possibility that  regional security issues as well as Ukrainian-Russian relations  would be discussed during the visit.    "The principal aim of the visit is to broaden U.S.-Ukrainian  economic and trade contacts," Dmitriy Markov, counsellor at the  Ukrainian Embassy in the U.S., told ITAR-TASS. "We are also  interested in discussing defence conversion matters with the  U.S. side," he added.    President Kravchuk and members of the American business  community will discuss possibilities for capital investments in  the Ukrainian economy, Sheila O'Creal, spokeswoman for the  overseas private investment corporation, told ITAR-TASS.    A press release circulated by the corporation in view of the  Ukrainian president's visit points out that Ukraine is now in a  critically important stage of transition to a market economy and  may become an important market for Western investors.</p>

			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DAVID DUKE'S STRONG SHOWING IN LOUISIANA VOTE  </P> <P> In response to "Much Too Close for Comfort" (editorial, Oct. 11):  </P> <P> The best thing that can be said about Louisiana's primary is not that Duke  lost, but that hopefully it sends a message to our self-serving politicians  that the electorate is becoming fed up with candidates whose positions depend  solely upon which special-interest group they are speaking to at the time. Like  it or not, at least we know exactly where Duke stands.  </P> <P> And the demagogue who arises in California won't claim that the government sold  the state to the immigrants; he will claim, justifiably, that the politicians  gave it to them.  </P> <P> TRENT DAVOL SANDERS  </P> <P> Angeles National Forest  </P></p>

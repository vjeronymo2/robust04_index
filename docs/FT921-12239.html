			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses move up as Volvo's strategy comes under fire MARKETMAKERS saw buying from domestic sources as bourses, by and large, improved yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT broadened its switch to cyclical stocks as opinion spread that a steel strike need not necessarily be bad for the industry, or for the German economy. Goldman Sachs yesterday decided to move German equities from underweight to market weight, advancing four reasons: valuation, given the rally in German bonds and the underperformance of its equity market last year; the probability that the Bundesbank will lower interest rates this year; its expectation of GNP growth, and inflation, of 2.5 per cent and about 3 per cent respectively in 1993; and 'distinct signs' of improvement in the east. Chemicals, steels and engineers did well as the FAZ index rose 6.67 to 684.20 at midsession, and the DAX closed 18.81 higher at 1,683.58, close to the top of its 1992 trading range. Volume was thought to have risen from Friday's DM5bn. In carmakers, Volkswagen jumped DM11 to DM333.50 after an MM Warburg recommendation. VW is up 16 per cent from this year's low. PARIS opened the February account in optimistic mood but turnover was disappointing at FFr1.85bn after Friday's FFr2.2bn. The CAC 40 index rose 19.35 to 1,869.27. Euro Disney was the day's most active stock as it rose FFr4.80 to FFr146.50 on a favourable interview with a senior company official by a US news agency. Eurotunnel was one of the day's biggest gainers as it picked up FFr2.85 or 6.6 per cent to FFr46 on the back of the 'easy money' argument and buy recommendations from Paribas and French financial newspapers. The UK broker Charterhouse has recommended a switch out of P &amp; O and into Eurotunnel. Profit-taking wiped FFr16 off the oil refiner Total to FFr1,047 in spite of a pleasing 41 per cent rise in 1991 net attributable profit. MILAN traded quietly ahead of Fiat's preliminary 1991 results which are due this afternoon. The Comit index fell 1.42 to 547.68 in turnover estimated at slightly below Friday's L102bn. Analysts said the market had already discounted disappointing figures from Fiat and was instead waiting for the company's view on 1992, which some expected to be on the cautious side. The stock eased L25 to L5,170. In the insurance sector, Generali added L10 to L31,210 while Ras rose L55 to L21,600. In a report on the non-life insurers issued late last week, Nomura advised selective profit-taking because in its view, the sector is due for a period of underperformance. Among smaller stocks trading in ABB Tecnomasio, the mechanical engineering group, was delayed because of an order imbalance following news that its parent company was buying in the outstanding 9.23 per cent at L3,100 a share. The share later jumped L528 or 21 per cent to L3,043. OSLO recovered a little, the all-share index gaining 9.38 at 453.00. Norsk Hydro rose NKr5.5 to NKr151. Higher prices for North Sea oil pushed Saga Petroleum free shares up NKr6.5 to NKr97.5. HELSINKI rose 1.66 per cent on strong demand for industrials, the Hex index adding 14.3 at 873.9 in turnover of FM30.1m. AMSTERDAM remained quiet, the CBS Tendency adding just 0.7 to 121.4. Turnover was thin. There was increased demand for cyclicals, such as the chemical groups, DSM and Akzo: DSM gained Fl 1.60 to Fl 105.30 and Akzo Fl 1.20 to Fl 138.60. The announcement of appointments to Nedlloyd's supervisory board, expected today, was being awaited, analysts said. MADRID's general index rose 2.25 to 253.41 with interest in both Endesa and Repsol stocks. Endesa put on Pta115 to Pta3,215 and Repsol rose Pta50 to Pta2,975. Telefonica fell Pta10 to Pta1,180 on news that its dividend would remain unchanged. ISTANBUL rose 1.8 per cent on active buying following the favourable results from the Social Democrat Populist Party's weekend congress. The 75-share index gained 90.68 to 5,112.74.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - JAN 27  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Open     10 am     11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm      3 pm     lose 1138.33  1138.66   1141.98  1141.84  1141.44  1142.41  1143.05  1142.52  ----------------------------------------------------------------------               Day's High  1143.34    Day's Low  1137.97  ----------------------------------------------------------------------              Jan 24     Jan 23    Jan 22     Jan 21    Jan 20              1131.86   1131.98    1134.07   1136.99   1135.91  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

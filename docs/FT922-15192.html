			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Caterpillar preparing to break strike CATERPILLAR, the world's largest maker of earth-moving equipment, announced yesterday that it would impose its last contract offer next Monday, five months into a strike at the company by the United Auto Workers union in the US. The company said it would ask all strikers to return to work on April 6, and would fill the positions of those who do not return by recalling laid-off employees or hiring new replacements. The use of replacements has been regarded as potentially explosive. The UAW responded last night to the prospect by placing on strike another 1,800 workers at four additional plants. These joined 10,800 union members already idled, making a total of 12,600 or nearly 80 per cent of the Caterpillar workforce. Union anger is likely to be further stoked by the company's statement that it has found, during the strike, it can operate with fewer employees. Caterpillar officials estimated they would reduce the workforce by some 10-15 per cent. The company decided to impose its last contract offer after another attempt at negotiations failed last week. Next, the UAW complained to the National Labour Relations Board of what it called unfair labour practices at Caterpillar. If the charges were accepted by the NLRB, the company would be prevented from hiring permanent replacements for striking union members, though temporary ones would be allowed. The company's first-quarter results are expected to show a sizeable loss due to 'economic conditions and the strike,' said Mr Gerald Flaherty, Caterpillar Group president. Caterpillar reached a settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday over its failure to disclose adequately information about its Brazilian operations in 1989 and 1990. It agreed to comply with disclosure rules henceforth and was not fined.</p>

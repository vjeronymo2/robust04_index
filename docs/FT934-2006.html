			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Go-ahead for Nuclear Electric Nuclear Electric yesterday gained permission to sell electricity directly to large commercial customers. Until now the state-owned utility has been restricted to selling into the pool, the wholesale electricity market, David Lascelles writes. Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, said the move would increase competition. He was satisfied that the concerns of other generation companies about Nuclear Electric, which benefits from a nuclear levy, had been taken into account, though he would monitor the new arrangements closely. The utility has indicated that it will seek long-term, fixed-price contracts with industrial customers. The move follows complaints about the practices of the generators National Power and PowerGen. It also anticipates the planned enlargement of the non-franchise market in April.</p>

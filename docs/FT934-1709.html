			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Power station clean-up begins National Power, the electricity generator, took formal receipt yesterday of the first two of six units which will significantly reduce the amount of sulphur dioxide it emits from its Drax power station in North Yorkshire, Michael Smith writes. Babcock Energy, part of Babcock International, handed over the two flue-gas desulphurisation (FGD) units a day early after five years' work on the project. Work on the remaining four units at National Power's largest power station is expected to be completed by the spring of 1996. The project, which is costing National Power Pounds 680m, is one of the world's largest environmental clean-up projects. PowerGen is installing another set of FGD units at its coal power station in Ratcliffe, Nottingham-shire. The high cost of installation makes it unlikely that FGD units will be built at other coal-fired power stations in the UK. The generators are more likely to reduce the amount of coal burnt at the stations as the amount of gas-fired generation increases. The FGD process at Drax uses large quantities of limestone which contains alkaline calcium carbonate. This 'captures' the sulpur dioxide in the flue gas and ends up as gypsum, which can be used in construction.</p>

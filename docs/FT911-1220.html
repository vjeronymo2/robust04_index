			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Korean army conscripts to ease labour shortage A GROWING labour shortage is prompting South Korea to look at ways in which its armed forces can be conscripted for industrial service. Two separate announcements yesterday included plans to use soldiers and men doing military service for manufacturing and construction work. Under the first proposal, drawn up by the Economic Planning Board and the Construction Ministry, the government will allow more than 10,000 conscripts to switch their military service for a five-year stint in industry. Separately, Mr Roh Jai Bong, the prime minister, proposed that the army corps of engineers be utilised to speed the construction of a new highway between Seoul and the western port of Inchon. A shortage of labour, particularly skilled labour, is causing increasing concern in Korean industry. A recent report by the Labour Ministry estimated that industry had a shortage of more than 190,000 workers last year and that most of the shortage was in the manufacturing sector. Korea's unemployment rate has been falling steadily and is now just 2.9 per cent. Under the plan to use military conscripts, selected soldiers will exchange 18 months of military service for their five years of work in industry. They will be trained and paid by the company they work for but will not be allowed to join trade unions. 'We are seeing a slower increase in population now and the number of people able to work is increasing at a slower rate too,' said a spokesman for the EPB. The reserve conscripts are young people and this plan is one way of making sure of a steady supply of skilled workers.' He added that, if successful, the number of conscripts would be steadily increased.</p>

			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Take control of your pension - Debbie Harrison examines a top-up plan that provides access to low-cost equity funds Richard Gordon, a qualified accountant, asked Weekend Money to check the availability of a special type of top-up plan for a company pension scheme. 'What I am looking for,' he explained, 'is a plan that provides 100 per cent exposure to the UK equity market with a return that matches the FT-A All-Share index. I'd like to combine this with minimum front-end costs and annual management fees.' One option worth considering is a little-known arrangement that allows employees in occupational pension schemes to take control of their top-up pension plans and gain access to low-cost, 100 per cent equity funds. It appears that only one company - Personal Pensions Management (PPM) - offers 'self-invested' free-standing additional voluntary contributions (FSAVCs). Through the self-invested version, you can put money directly into equities, authorised unit trusts (including index-tracking funds) and investment trusts at more competitive rates than you get under standard life office FSAVCs. Self-invested FSAVCs are similar in many ways to self-invested personal pensions (Sipps), which were introduced in the 1989 Budget to allow knowledgeable investors either to run their own pension portfolio or appoint a stockbroker to do it for them. The administration and legal documentation is handled separately by a life office. The beauty of this arrangement is that once you separate the two main functions - investment and administration - you can, if you are dissatisfied with the performance, change the stockbroker or investment manager without having to change the provider. Under a standard personal pension, where these two functions are combined, you have to change the entire package and may lose out through early-termination penalties. Sipps can be used only by employees who are not in company pension schemes, and the self-employed. Until recently, employees who wanted to top up their company scheme benefits had to choose between their employer's in-house AVC scheme, which often is invested conservatively, or take out an individual FSAVC sold mainly by life offices. Low-risk, in-house AVCs are ideal for employees close to retirement, but younger pension scheme members are advised to go for funds with a high equity content. FSAVCs offer a wide investment choice but can be expensive to run. In October 1992, the Inland Revenue confirmed that the self-invested option applied also to FSAVCs. Initially, the charges on these plans were considered to be high, but reductions have made them more competitive these days. PPM, part of the Swiss insurance giant Winterthur, is one of the leading providers of Sipps and is thought to be the only company offering the self-invested option for FSAVCs. The annual charges on the self-invested FSAVC include a plan fee of Pounds 150 and an administration fee of 0.5 per cent, capped at Pounds 400 for larger funds. On top of this, you would pay the stockbroker fees (where applicable) and the charges on any unit or investment trusts. The investment choice under a self-invested AVC includes UK and overseas equities, unit trusts and investment trusts, insurance company managed funds and unit-linked funds. Some unit-linked funds offer performance guarantees backed by derivatives but these are expensive. Gordon is keen to try a UK equity tracker fund which invests in a range of companies on the FTA All-Share index. Trackers often are used by institutional pension funds because they offer broad diversification and a performance that should match closely the index that is followed. Andrew Warwick-Thompson, head of partnership pensions at actuarial consultant Bacon &amp; Woodrow, says: 'Normally, index trackers offer very low charges compared with actively-managed funds, but these cost savings are not usually passed on to the individual investor through authorised unit trusts.' Authorised unit trust index-tracker funds are offered by several institutions including Gartmore, James Capel, Morgan Grenfell, Legal &amp; General, Royal Life and Norwich Union. Of these, only Gartmore's UK Index fund offers low-cost entry for smaller investments. Its minimum is Pounds 2,500 and there is no initial charge, while the annual management charge is 0.5 per cent. Other trackers typically impose a 5 per cent initial charge and an annual charge of 0.75 per cent. Gartmore's fund invests in 450 companies across all sectors, making it one of the cheapest and best-diversified UK equity funds for individual investors in pensions.</p>

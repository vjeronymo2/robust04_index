			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Trade expert for Polish finance post POLAND'S prime minister, Mr Jan Olszewski, yesterday turned to Mr Andrzej Olechowski, one of the country's best known banking and trade experts, to fill the economic policy vacuum caused by the resignation of Mr Karol Lutkowski, the finance minister. The 44-year-old economist will have to be approved by the parliamentary budget committee and by the lower chamber of parliament, which is expected to vote on the nomination later this week. Mr Olechowski, who, as minister of foreign trade, played a key role in negotiating last year's EC association agreement and was deputy chairman of the Polish central bank before that, faces difficult budgetary and other decisions once he wins approval. Mr Lutkowski resigned after six weeks saying he had no confidence the government would avoid inflationary policies. Earlier this week the government announced a 12 per cent devaluation of the zloty against a basket of five western currencies to improve Polish competitiveness and offset the impact of domestic inflation. The latter is running at an annualised rate of around 70 per cent. This devaluation comes on top of the regular 1.8 per cent monthly 'crawling peg' devaluation which has taken place since October. Mr Olechowski, who spent nine years at Unctad in Geneva and the World Bank in Washington, says he is determined to cut the government's Zl 115,000bn (Pounds 5.57bn) budget deficit by the Zl 60,000bn needed if the government is to fulfil its target of restraining the budget deficit to 5 per cent of gross domestic product. His other priority will be to gain more support from international financial institutions. This year, he says, Poland needs to offset the Dollars 1.5bn outflow from the resumption of debt service payments. This follows last year's 50 per cent debt reduction agreement with the Paris Club of official creditors. 'We can't have a net capital outflow this year given the difficult stage our reforms have reached,' he says, referring to mounting concern over the depth of Poland's recession after two years of sharply declining industrial production and GDP. Mr Olechowski remains a supporter of rapid privatisation, especially of financial institutions like state-owned banks and insurance companies. He is also determined to attract more foreign investment: 'Something has to be done about dispelling the xenophobic mood which is beginning to appear.'</p>

			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A.  </P> <P> First, Schwab's, now . . . 7-Eleven?  </P> <P> Yes, aspiring actors, the next time you drop in for a microwaved burrito, you  can leave your resume and photo in a drop-off box at the convenience store. And  Culver City-based Gateway Information Services promises to distribute it to  casting directors (if it doesn't have too many burrito stains).  </P> <P> The catch is you first have to call Gateway's 900 line (at 95 cents a minute)  and jot down the "listing code" of the job that interests you. Then you must  write the code on the outside of the envelope that you drop off at any of five  7-Elevens on the Westside. (Apparently, Gateway figures there are no  prospective thespians in Downey or Encino or Pomona.)  </P> <P> Times have changed since Lana Turner was supposedly discovered while drinking a  malt.  </P> <P> Come to think of it, Gateway lists only acting and technical jobs.  </P> <P> Doesn't the company know that everyone in L.A.'s a screenwriter these days?  </P> <P> Which reminds us: Some Cal Poly Pomona students broke a world record by  building a 201-foot bean-and-cheese burrito, which they cut up and sold to  raise money for charity. It wasn't microwaved.  </P> <P> An alleged counterfeiter was arrested in Hollywood but police are accusing him  of passing a bogus dress, rather than bogus money. He allegedly claimed it was  one worn by Rita Hayworth in a 1946 film.  </P> <P> Police arrested John B. Ponca, 36, the owner of a memorabilia shop, after  investigators took the dress to Santa Barbara and showed it to Jean Louis,  designer of the original costume for the movie, "Gilda." They concluded the  dress might date back only 30 years or so.  </P> <P> Lloyd Curry, a collector, purchased the garment from Ponca for $3,500. Curry  said he first suspected the costume was bogus after he removed it from its  frame. The dress had been mounted like a Da Vinci.  </P> <P> It's important to choose the proper car-pool. That seems to be the message of a  witty Richard Gerrish painting, which is part of the "Carpool" exhibit at the  Pacific Mutual Building on West 6th Street.  </P> <P> The show opens Monday in conjunction with the start of Rideshare Week. Gerrish  depicts a maze of traffic, including cars tumbling into a pool of water. Not  what Commuter Computer had in mind.  </P> <P> </P> <P> miscelLAny:  </P> <P> Griffith J. Griffith, whose donation of land to L.A. became Griffith Park,  later served a year in prison for attempting to murder his wife, whom he  accused of plotting with the Pope to murder him.  </P></p>

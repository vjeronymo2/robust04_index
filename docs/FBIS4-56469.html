			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Colombian economic developments monitored through 3  May.    The Colombian fishing sector has established the Chamber of  Fishing Industry [Camara de la Industria Pesquera], presided  over by marine biologist Armando Hernandez Rodriguez. The  chamber's board of directors includes representatives of the  firms that catch, process, and sell 80 percent of the tuna,  shrimp, and lobster produced in the country. Those firms are:  Atunes de Colombia, C.I.; Oceanos, C.I.; Frigopesca, C.I.;  Vikingos de Colombia; Compania Pesquera Colombiana; Frigogan;  and Promotora de Pesca Colombiana. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL  TIEMPO in Spanish 29 Apr 94 p 5b)    The National Administrative Department of Statistics, Dane,  reported on 2 May a 2.37-percent inflation rate had been  recorded in April, increasing the inflation rate to 11.92  percent for the first four months of the year. The accumulated  inflation rate for the past 12 months was 23.94 percent. The  hike in the cost of living in April is due to the food, health,  and housing sectors, the Dane report added. (Paris AFP in  Spanish 0235 GMT 2 May 94)    Business leaders have reported the devaluation of the  Venezuelan bolivar could prompt an increase in contraband to  Colombia, because it has caused Venezuelan products to be more  economical for Colombians. National production cannot be  protected against increasing economic competition from Venezuela  due to the commercial agreement signed between both countries;  furthermore, the fall of the Venezuelan currency has also made  Colombian products more expensive in Venezuela and could cause a  decrease in Colombian exports to Venezuela.

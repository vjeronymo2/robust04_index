			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by M. Abizanda: "Army Will Reinforce Its Rapid </F> Action Force with Armored Vehicles"]    [Text] Madrid -- The Army will reinforce the Rapid Action  Force [FAR] by including an armored vehicle unit. Although it  was not initially planned that the FAR would have this kind of  unit, confining itself to light infantry forces, the experience  of participation in the UN mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina has  shown the feasibility of including these new resources.    The final makeup of FAR will be determined following the  approval of the Force's mission, depending on the redeployment  plans that currently being drafted by the staffs of the three  services and that are at their final stage of completion. With  the document approved by the defense minister on 25 January --  the new Strategic Concept will in turn be incorporated in the  final Joint Strategic Plan, which, according to the Defense  Ministry's forecasts, could be approved before the summer.    The Army wishes to reinforce the FAR through the Master Plan  with equipment -- especially reconnaissance armored vehicles --  in order to provide it with semiheavy equipment capable of  carrying out reconnaissance missions and equipped with a gun of  at least 25-mm calibers.    The experience of the various battalions in  Bosnia-Herzegovina has shown the need for these resources, to  such an extent that it is stated in military circles that  Operation Alfa Bravo has marked the rediscovery of armored.  vehicles    For this reason, the FAR will have a unit comprised of two  battalions charged with reconnaissance and protection tasks.  The sources consulted stated that it will almost certainly be  based in Valladolid, although Valencia was initially chosen for  its location. Two regiments belonging to the Jarama Brigade,  destined to become at the most a territorial defense unit --  that is, with personnel not exceeding 30 percent of its  potential, in accordance with the Master Plan -- are currently  based in Valladolid.    In the latest drafts of this plan it is ruled out that the  FAMET (Army Airmobile Forces) will be completely incorporated  into the FAR -- the main unit to be deployed in the event of a  crisis or for participation in international missions. The  aforementioned sources stated that only a proportion of their  six battalions will be assigned.    In addition, it is confirmed that the FAR's three main units  will be the Paratroopers Brigade, the Legionnaires Brigade, and  the Light Airborne Brigade, although some changes in their  deployment have been envisaged. In the case of the  Legionnnaires Brigade, the idea of moving the 4th Corps from  Ronda to the Viator base in Almeria seems to have been dropped.  The military chiefs believe it would be a waste to abandon its  current facilities there.    In this event, only the 3d Corps in Fuerteventura will move  to Almeria, to be joined by an artillery group as well as a  logistical unit. Units outside the peninsula in Ceuta and  Melilla will remain in their current locations.    The idea is that, within the FAR itself, the Paratroopers  Brigade and the Legionnaires Brigade will be the initial  reaction group, while the Light Airborne Brigade, with bases in  Galicia and Asturias, would be the second echelon to be deployed.    In addition, the FAR staff, under the command of General  Victor Suances, will remain in charge of Operation Alfa Bravo,  although the Cordoba Group's units belong not to that unit but  to the Southern Operational Command and to the brigades within  the Reaction Force.</p>

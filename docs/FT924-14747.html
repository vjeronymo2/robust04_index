			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / BCCI debt proposal resisted by creditors CREDITORS of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International yesterday fought to postpone approval of the once-and-for-all compensation plan worked out by the bank's liquidators and the Abu Dhabi majority shareholders. But Luxembourg's state prosecutor recommended that the Grand Duchy's district court should clear the plan. The tribunal's final decision will be announced on October 22. At the court's request, BCCI creditors were balloted this summer on the Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 950m) package of payments, which has already been cleared by courts in Britain and the Cayman Islands. Approval by Luxembourg, where BCCI had its brass-plate headquarters, would end the legal procedure, although disgruntled creditors could still take the case to the Grand Duchy's appeal court. The compensation scheme was backed by about 90 per cent of the creditors who voted. Mr Georges Baden, the Luxembourg liquidator, said the result undermined his opponents' claims to speak for the majority of creditors. But in a five-hour court hearing, critics of the compensation package argued that there had been irregularities in the ballot and that new information should be taken into account - notably the damning report of Mr Bob Kerry, the US senator, on the BCCI collapse and the as-yet unpublished UK report by Lord Justice Bingham. Mr Masihur Rahman, formerly chief financial officer of BCCI, flew from New York to voice his doubts about the settlement. 'The UK liquidators and the Bank of England are hand in glove with the Abu Dhabi authorities in trying to contrive this agreement,' he told the court. Mr Keith Vaz, the Labour MP who chairs the parliamentary group on BCCI, warned that approval of the agreement would rule out any further compensation claims, if the Bingham report accused the Bank of England of negligence in supervising BCCI. Lawyers for the Abu Dhabi authorities rejected Mr Vaz's suggestions. They said the report, which should appear in the same week as the court's final decision, would not affect future claims. They and the liquidators argue that rejection of the settlement could end creditors' chances of compensation, or at least delay payments for years.</p>

			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD SALES SEND MATTEL'S PROFIT UP 26%  </P> <P> Citing help from Barbie and a strong performance in foreign markets, Mattel  Inc. reported Thursday that record sales drove its third-quarter earnings up  26% to $47.8 million.  </P> <P> The Hawthorne-based company said sales for the three months ending Sept. 29  totaled $490 million, compared to $410 million for the same period in 1989. The  third period is crucial to toy and game manufacturers because it marks the  first half of retailers' Christmas buying season.  </P> <P> The surge for Mattel, the No. 2 U.S. toy maker in terms of sales, came during a  period of economic uncertainty for the industry. Wall Street analysts said  industrywide sales this year have been relatively flat. With a 38% increase in  foreign sales during the third quarter and a traditionally strong presence  abroad, Mattel would be buoyed during a further slowdown in the U.S. economy,  said Gary Jacobson, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody in New York.  </P> <P> "Domestically, the toy industry is facing very sluggish demand," Jacobson said.  "On the international front, business is booming, and Mattel is being helped by  the weaker (value) of the U.S. dollar in world markets."  </P> <P> The weaker dollar makes Mattel products less expensive and more competitive  abroad, but many buyers in the United States and Europe are also lured by some  of the toy maker's newer products, said John W. Amerman, Mattel's chairman and  chief executive.  </P> <P> Among the sales leaders are Magic Nursery dolls. The large toy is packaged in a  hospital gown that dissolves in water, leaving underlying clothing and a card  bearing information on the doll's sex. The Disney Preschool line of toys,  introduced in 1988, also is enjoying strong sales, Amerman said.  </P> <P> However, Barbie -- introduced 31 years ago -- is still the biggest financial  boon to Mattel. A 30% increase in foreign sales of Barbie dolls helped boost  the foreign portion of sales to 55%, Amerman said. Typically, about 50% of  Mattel's business stems from foreign sales.  </P> <P> "This shows that we're gaining market share around the world," Amerman said.  "Our competitors are having more difficulty. . . .Our products are well-suited  for international consumers."  </P> <P> Barbie sales, which account for about 45% of all of Mattel's annual business,  are surging because other toy makers are concentrating more of their resources  on toys and games for boys, said Carol Palmer, an analyst at Duff &amp; Phelps  in Chicago.  </P> <P> "There has been less competition in girls' lines," she said.  </P> <P> Palmer said Mattel has outperformed industry expectations. She said it is now  gaining on Hasbro, the No. 1 U.S. toy maker. Hasbro reported an earnings  increase of 6% in the third quarter, but its sales have not been rising as  rapidly as Mattel's.  </P></p>

			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Howe seeks policy information for case to Iraq probe LORD HOWE, the former chancellor and foreign secretary, has asked Whitehall officials to supply documentary evidence of cases in which the government has withheld information about UK foreign policy from parliament. Lord Howe's request is related to his appearance, expected next January, before the Scott arms-to-Iraq inquiry. Lord Howe's office said yesterday that he was not prepared to make any comment until he gave evidence to the inquiry. 'His position will become clear then,' a spokesman for Lord Howe said. It has emerged that in recent weeks that Foreign Office departments have been asked to broaden their research for current and former ministers appearing before the Scott inquiry to include diplomacy during the 1980s in countries other than Iraq. According to senior Whitehall sources, departments have been asked to find instances of government policy not being spelt out to parliament on the grounds that officials and ministers at the time judged this to be in the overriding public and national interest. A possible example relates to secret diplomacy with Argentina in the years after the Falklands war. Within Whitehall there is a widely held view that officials and ministers have been put on the defensive by Lord Justice Scott and his counsel Miss Presiley Baxendale QC and need to put their case across more forcefully in the coming weeks. Lord Howe served as foreign secretary between 1983 and 1989. He announced guidelines restricting arms exports to Iraq and Iran to parliament in October 1985. Documents made available to the Scott inquiry show the guidelines had been secretly agreed to by ministers in December 1984. Lord Howe's former junior minister at the Foreign Office, Mr William Waldegrave, told the Scott inquiry last month that they were secretly relaxed in 1988, but argued that this was a minimal change. Information given to parliament in 1988 had been misleading. But he argued that the withholding of information served the public interest because it protected British hostages held in the Middle East. The inquiry today takes evidence from Mr Ian McDonald, the head of the MoD Defence Export Services Secretariat.</p>

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Russia to build up ties to Crimea In what may, paradoxically, presage an easing of tensions between Moscow and Kiev, Russia is likely to begin providing much more active support for Crimea's efforts to loosen Ukraine's grip over it after the Russian-dominated peninsula voted at the weekend for much closer ties with Russia. Moscow's new Crimean policy would involve building closer economic ties  - for instance making it easier for Russian banks to open in Crimea to help it develop tourism - and pushing for a settlement to the tug-of-war over the Black Sea Fleet, headquartered in the closed Crimean port of Sevastopol. 'Russia has its sphere of special interests whether people like it or not,' said Mr Konstantin Zatulin, head of the Russian parliament's committee for relations with the CIS and Russians living abroad. 'There are some places Russia simply cannot walk away from.' He said he had the impression that the city and the fleet would never agree to share the 100-ship fleet with Ukraine despite a breakdown in negotiations over its transfer to Russia. Mr Victor Semyonov, head of Sevastopol's city council, says it sees its future only with Russia because it needed subsidies and stability to develop economically after decades of isolation as a closed city. Its ailing infrastructure means for instance that it will receive just two hours of water a day starting from tomorrow. The likelihood of a deal, rather than confrontation, with Ukraine after an 80 per cent 'yes' vote in an 'opinion poll' proposing a special treaty between Crimea and Ukraine, dual citizenship, and special powers for Crimea's president, has even been lent some credence by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk. Mr Kravchuk, who earlier issued a decree outlawing the opinion poll as a referendum in disguise, has since told a Crimean newspaper that he favoured giving Crimea 'maximum economic independence' while preserving Ukraine's territorial integrity. He also said Mr Yevgeny Saburov, a Moscow economist whom the new Crimean president wants to appoint his prime minister, would be able to receive Ukrainian citizenship in order to qualify for the job. Crimea was given to Ukraine in 1954 when both were part of a single Soviet state but it has sparked fears of a conflict ever since the two became independent two years ago.</p>

			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> TELLING DOLPHIN FROM PORPOISE  </P> <P> Just what is the difference between a porpoise and a dolphin, anyway?  </P> <P> Not much. At least not much to the casual whale watcher.  </P> <P> According to the American Cetacean Society, "It would be convenient to  differentiate dolphins and porpoises, if only there was some rule we could use.  . . . Unfortunately, there isn't."  </P> <P> "Some animals are always known as dolphins, and some are always called  porpoises," the society explains simply in a guide written by Richard Ellis,  author of "The Book of Whales" and "Dolphins and Porpoises."  </P> <P> Generally, however, small cetaceans with a "beak" are called dolphins; those  with a rounded head profile are referred to as porpoises.  </P> <P> Indeed, most small cetaceans conveniently fit this profile. The spinners,  spotters and bottlenose are all dolphins, while the harbor and speedy Dall's  porpoises have more rounded heads.  </P> <P> But there are notable exceptions, often quite confusing. The pilot whale, for  example, is not really a whale, but a member of the dolphin family. But its  head is distinctively rounded, like that of a porpoise.  </P> <P> The killer whale, too, is not a whale but a dolphin. Yet it also has a head  more rounded than beaked.  </P> <P> At the same time, some true whales have beaks, such as the giant bottlenose  whale or the Cuvier's beaked whale.  </P> <P> A more specific -- though, for most casual observers, less useful -- way to  distinguish porpoises from dolphins is to look at their teeth.  </P> <P> Scientists say that true porpoises have spade-shaped teeth, while those of most  other small cetaceans are tapered and sharply pointed.

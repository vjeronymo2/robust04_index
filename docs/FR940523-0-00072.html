			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (g) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section, or any other provisions of this part, any requirement for the payment or obligation of funds by the Department established by this part shall be subject to the availability of appropriated funds, and no provision herein shall be interpreted to require obligation or payment of funds in violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1341).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;765.22  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Appeals procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Any appeal by a licensee of any Department determination subject to the requirements of this part, shall invoke the appeals process specified in paragraph (b) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) A licensee shall file an appeal of any Department determination subject to the requirements of this part with the Office of Hearings and Appeals, U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585. Any appeal must be filed within 45 days from the date the licensee received notice, actual or constructive (i.e., publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), of the Department's determination. Appeals will be governed by, and must comply in full with, the procedures set forth in 10 CFR part 205, subpart H. The decision of the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall be the final decision of the Department. A licensee must file an appeal in order to exhaust its administrative remedies, and the receipt of an appellate decision is a prerequisite to seeking judicial review of any determination made under this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;765.23  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Annual report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department shall prepare annually a report summarizing pertinent information concerning claims submitted in the previous calendar year, the status of the Department's review of the claims, determinations made regarding the claims, amounts paid for claims approved, and other relevant information concerning this reimbursement program. The report will be available to all interested parties upon written request to the Department's Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Action Project Office, 2155 Louisiana NE., suite 10000, Albuquerque, NM 87110 and will also be available in the Department's Freedom of Information Reading room, 1000 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart D_Additional Reimbursement Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;765.30  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Reimbursement of costs incurred in accordance with a plan for subsequent remedial action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) This section establishes procedures governing reimbursements of costs of remedial action incurred in accordance with a plan for subsequent remedial action approved by the Department as provided in this section. Costs otherwise eligible for reimbursement in accordance with the terms of this part and incurred in accordance with the plan shall be reimbursed in accordance with the provisions of subpart D and subpart C. In the event there is an inconsistency between the requirements of subpart D and subpart C, the provisions of subpart D shall govern reimbursement of such costs of remedial action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) A licensee who anticipates incurring costs of remedial action after December 31, 2002 may submit a plan for subsequent remedial action. This plan may be submitted at any time after January 1, 2000, but no later than December 31, 2001. Reimbursement of costs of remedial action incurred after December 31, 2002 shall be subject to the approval of this plan by the Department. This plan shall describe:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) All applicable requirements established by NRC pursuant to UMTRCA, or where appropriate, by the requirements of an Agreement State, included in a reclamation plan approved by NRC or an Agreement State which have not yet been satisfied in full by the licensee, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The total cost of remedial action required at the site, together with all necessary supporting documentation, segregated into actual costs incurred to date, costs incurred or expected to be incurred prior to December 31, 2002 but not yet approved for reimbursement, and anticipated future costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The Department shall review the plan for subsequent remedial action to verify conformance with the NRC- or Agreement State-approved reclamation plan or other written authorization, and to determine the reasonableness of anticipated future costs, and shall approve, approve with suggested modifications, or reject the plan. During its review, the Department may request additional information from the licensee to clarify or provide support for any provision or estimate contained in the plan. The Department may also consult with NRC or an Agreement State concerning any provision or estimate contained in the plan. Upon approval, approval with modifications, or rejection of a plan, the Department shall inform and explain to the licensee its decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) If the Department rejects a plan for subsequent remedial action submitted by a licensee, the licensee may appeal the Department's rejection or prepare and submit a revised plan. The licensee may continue to submit revised plans for subsequent remedial action until the Department approves a plan, or September 30, 2002, whichever occurs first. A failure by a licensee to receive approval from the Department of a plan prior to December 31, 2002 will preclude that licensee from receiving any reimbursement for costs of remedial action incurred after that date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

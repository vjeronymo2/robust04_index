			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 17 KYODO -- A top business leader on  Tuesday [17 May] urged Construction Minister Koji Morimoto to  delay the planned rise in toll fares on the nation's highways.    Takeshi Nagano, president of the Federation of Employers'  Associations (Nikkeiren), criticized the government over the  planned toll hike in a press conference last week.    The rise in highway tolls would have a strong impact on  overall prices, he said.    Nagano said he will try to testify at a public hearing to be  held later this month over the proposed increase in highway  charges.    The hearing, cosponsored by the Construction Ministry and  the  Transport Ministry, will be held next Tuesday over the plan by  Japan Highway Public Corp. for an average 10.4 percent rise in  the tolls.    In the meeting with Morimoto, Nagano said he doesn't oppose  the construction of highways, the funding of which the highway  corporation cites as a reason for hiking the tolls.    It is not fair that only public charges are raised while  other prices are falling, Nagano told the construction minister.    Morimoto said, "I take the (Nikkeiren) president's remarks  seriously."</p>

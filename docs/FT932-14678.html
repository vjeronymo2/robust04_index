			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Leading Article: Clinton, Japan and Russia WHETHER Mr Clinton will succeed in rejuvenating the US economy may be doubted. What is noticeable, however, is how far he has changed the US domestic debate. The same is true on the global economic stage. The week's events in Tokyo - the Dollars 43bn package of assistance for Russia from the group of seven industrial countries and the Y13,200bn (Pounds 76bn) emergency spending programme announced by the Japanese government on Tuesday  -bear witness to his impact. It is not that either is an altogether new departure. Assistance for Russia and stimulus packages in Japan were on last year's agenda as well. As often happens, however, developments in policy preceded a change in administration. Where the Bush administration was tentative, Mr Clinton's is aggressive. At the top of its international agenda are the twin aims of helping Russia and dealing with Japan. But its goals for the two countries conflict. Mr Clinton wants to introduce market forces into Russia's controlled economy and controls into Japan's market economy. Naturally, that is not how he would put the point. The US view is that the Japanese trade surplus is the result of obscure obstacles to the proper working of the market. This week Japan announced an overall trade surplus for fiscal 1992-93 of Dollars 111.34bn (Pounds 73bn), up 26 per cent on the previous year. The bilateral surplus with the US was Dollars 46.1bn, up 20 per cent. Such figures reinforce US determination, as Mr Clinton must have told Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, in Washington yesterday. Pre-emptive Japan's response was a shrewdly-timed pre-emptive fiscal strike. The Japanese government produced its plump rabbit from the fiscal hat just as Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury Secretary, and Mr Warren Christopher, US Secretary of State, arrived in Tokyo for the meeting of the group of seven industrial countries on help to Russia and immediately before Mr Miyazawa went to Washington. The Ministry of Finance even argued that the spending and tax concessions would produce a 2.6 per cent increase in nominal gross national product. Governments would be sorely embarrassed if laws governing truth in advertising applied to their pronouncements as well. As so often - including, indeed, the Dollars 43bn supposedly on offer for Russia - the rabbit was thinner than it looked. Many analysts believe the Japanese package will generate at most half the growth envisaged by the government. Unfortunately for Japanese international public relations, amongst the doubters appears to be the redoubtable governor of the Bank of Japan, Mr Yasushi Mieno. Even the government claims that its measures would boost the country's imports by only some Dollars 8bn, a mere dent in the surplus. Partly for this reason, but still more because lobby-infested Washington views trade in industry-specific terms, the Japanese package is unlikely to achieve its chief strategic goal, which was to ward off US pressure for 'results-oriented' agreements on trade. Mr Christopher, for example, was not so busy urging more support for Russia that he did not find time to persuade Japan to solve individual trade issues. Bottomless pit Yet if the Japanese government is to secure target shares of particular imports in the Japanese markets, it must first force its citizens to make the necessary purchases. As foreign appetites grow upon what they feed, such arrangements will spread, not just within Japan but to other successful exporting countries. A market-oriented international trading system would then be replaced by a sort of mini-Comecon. Yet Mr Clinton's emissaries also put great pressure on Japan to assist Mr Yeltsin in his attempts to rebuild the ruins left by the collapse of the real Comecon. As usual, Tokyo did not dare to say 'no'. Japan did not raise the vexed issue of Russian occupation of the Kurile islands. Instead, it agreed to increase its planned bilateral assistance from Dollars 1.2bn to Dollars 1.8bn. This it did despite its well known conviction that Russia is the closest thing on earth to a bottomless pit. If this perfectly plausible conviction is to be proved wrong, Russia must have a coherent and effective government implementing a coherent and effective reform strategy. At present doubters have good cause for their doubts. Mr Yeltsin is going into a referendum on April 25 that poses great risks for him. No likely result will give him the decisive victory he needs if he is to rule where now he reigns. It is only the extraordinary importance of the effort that justifies its being made at all. But the same applies to Japan's wish to avoid results-oriented trade. In Tokyo the Europeans - particularly the Germans - insisted upon the importance of helping Mr Yeltsin, but stressed that they themselves had done enough. Germany's position is certainly defensible. But Europeans do have a fresh role to play in the US-Japan bilateral trade conflicts. They should support Japan if it decides at last simply to say 'no'.</p>

			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NUNN SHOWS NOTHING TO GET EXCITED ABOUT  </P> <P> Michael Nunn is getting a bit too arrogant for his own good.  </P> <P> His reaction to the fans' boos -- "They don't take any punches" -- indicates  complete disregard for their feelings. One can reply, "He gets paid for it."  </P> <P> Until he defeats someone of the caliber of Sugar Ray Leonard, Tommy Hearns or  Marvelous Marvin Hagler, let him realize that so far he isn't the second coming  of Muhammad Ali.  </P> <P> HY GLASS, Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

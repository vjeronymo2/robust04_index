			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets: France benefits from German rate cut The Bundesbank's unexpected decision on Thursday to cut interest rates encouraged strong performances by some of the European bourses last week. The FT-Actuaries World Index rose by 2.1 per cent in local currency terms, with Europe 3.5 per cent ahead. The strength of the dollar provided the second element to the story, trimming some advances in US currency terms and leaving others showing declines on the week. The Bundesbank's decision to cut its discount and Lombard rates came after a week in which all the indications were that no such move was planned. Analysts speculate that the decision was taken during the 24 hours before the announcement was made, with the problems experienced by the weak Danish krone providing the final incentive for the German move. Mr Sushil Wadhwani, director of UK and European equity strategy at Goldman Sachs, says the expected date for a cut in German rates had been March 18. He saw the Bundesbank's move as the first instalment of a reduction and believes that the markets might well have to wait until the middle of next month for the next piece of the action. Mr Andrew Bell, director of European strategy at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, also cautions against expectations that the German move heralds more cuts in the immediate future. France was the principal beneficiary of the German initiative. Its equity market advanced by 7 per cent in local currency terms on the week as pressure for a devaluation of the franc eased and hopes rose that the way might now be open for lower French rates. In dollar terms, the rise was trimmed to 4.1 per cent. German shares, with financials particularly strong, climbed 4.8 per cent and Italy, also benefiting from the Bank of Italy's decision to lower its discount rate by  1/2 percentage point - before Germany acted - rose by more than the European average. There were lower than average gains among the more defensive markets: in Switzerland, with its interest rates already low, and in the Netherlands, which still managed to rise above the corporate traumas suffered at Daf and Fokker during the week. Ireland was the latest country to demonstrate devaluation arithmetic. It gained 6.6 per cent in local currency terms in the wake of its devaluation of the punt; but in dollar terms, it emerged with a 3.9 per cent decline. The US was 2.3 per cent higher as Wall Street, firm for much of the week, marched into record territory on Thursday and Friday. Japan, itself the beneficiary of a 75 basis points reduction in its discount rate, was the laggard among the big battalions as analysts agreed that government inspired buying by public funds, designed to stabilise the Tokyo market, was no basis for an extended equity revival.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                               % change      % change               % change in local currency**    sterling** in US dollars**             1 Week  4 Weeks  1 Year  Start of  Start of      Start of                                        1993      1993         1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria      +3.58    +6.36  -17.96   +3.06     +4.87        +0.23 Belgium      +2.78    +6.49   +2.15   +8.20    +10.39        +5.50 Denmark      +0.27    +7.63  -20.91  +11.29    +15.75       +10.63 Finland      +3.62    -2.39   +1.52   +6.53     +2.55        -1.98 France       +6.95    +3.63   +2.53   +3.61     +7.04        +2.30 Germany      +4.78    +7.62   -5.92   +6.92     +9.50        +4.66 Ireland      +6.57    +3.79   -9.20  +10.88     +4.97        +0.32 Italy        +4.55   +12.90   -2.07  +15.78    +16.88       +11.70 Netherlands  +2.83    +3.66   +4.88   +4.78     +7.12        +2.38 Norway       +1.14    -2.15  -14.59   +2.60     +6.09        +1.39 Spain        +4.67   +10.23   -4.86  +13.26    +16.24       +11.09 Sweden       +4.13    -3.72   +7.50   -0.86     -1.26        -5.64 Switzerland  +2.26    +3.64  +18.02   +2.94     +3.41        -1.18 UK           +2.16    +2.62  +13.81   +1.52     +1.52        -2.97 EUROPE       +3.49    +4.20   +5.58   +4.14     +5.37        +0.71  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia    +0.92    +2.00   -5.92   -1.10     +1.39        -3.10 Hong Kong    -0.09    +2.82  +17.84   +3.30     +8.20        +3.41 Japan        +0.62    +1.70  -18.06   +0.18     +5.24        +0.59 Malaysia     +3.94    +5.21  +18.56   +3.46     +7.71        +2.95 New Zealand  +3.62    +3.07   +0.18   +0.81     +5.17        +0.51 Singapore    +1.02    +2.67   -0.62   +3.60     +7.70        +2.94 Canada       +2.10    +1.73   -8.91   +0.16     +5.67        +0.99 USA          +2.28    +4.59   +8.52   +2.99     +7.77        +2.99 Mexico       -0.36    -8.53   +4.68   -5.25     -0.19        -4.61 South Africa +1.12    +2.32   -7.65   +6.48    +16.56       +11.40 WORLD INDEX  +2.08    +3.55   -0.83   +2.44     +6.43        +1.72  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on February 5, 1993.

			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / GRE cuts loss in first half to Pounds 39m GUARDIAN Royal Exchange, the composite insurer, yesterday reported that its loss before tax had been reduced to Pounds 39m from Pounds 88m for the six months ended June 30. Losses on mortgage indemnity, which are triggered by house repossessions, doubled to Pounds 16m, while the recent IRA bomb in the City of London accounted for another Pounds 10m of losses. The interim dividend was cut to 2.5p from 4.4p. Mr Sid Hopkins, chief executive, said the full year dividend would be at least in line with last year's total of 7p. Underwriting losses in the UK, which accounts for half of the group's general insurance underwriting book, were reduced by Pounds 55m to Pounds 125m, while the US and South Africa were back in the black with profits of Pounds 1m. Investment income fell to Pounds 133m from Pounds 142m because of property write-downs and foreign exchange translations. About 40 per cent of equity investments are protected through an insurance policy. Mr Hopkins said: 'We are very pleased with the trend. But we do not want to be lulled into a false security. Anything can happen, including another hurricane. 'We will continue to increase premiums to reflect increases in our product costs.' Household theft claims in the UK rose 9 per cent to 25,000 and subsidence claims in the second quarter rose to 2,124 from 1,902. Underwriting losses fell from Pounds 38m to Pounds 9m because of the mild weather and a fall in subsidence costs. However, premiums are expected to rise by between 5 per cent and 10 per cent. Underwriting losses from motor insurance fell from Pounds 47m to Pounds 19m. The number of cars insured by the company declined by 75,000 to 600,000. During the past three years, the the number of cars insured by GRE has fallen by more than 300,000 because of competition and a decision to increase the premiums of high-risk categories, such as younger drivers. Mr Hopkins said he was considering direct writing in the UK on the lines of that offered by the company's Irish subsidiary, the new PMPA. Car thefts in Germany pushed the underwriting loss there up Pounds 12m to Pounds 28m. The loss per share fell to 5.6p from 11.1p. The solvency ratio at the end of June was 42 per cent compared with 43 per cent. Lex, Page 16</p>

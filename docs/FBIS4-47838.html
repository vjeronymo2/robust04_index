			<p>BFN     [Text] South African arms suppliers are making a bid to  sell attack helicopters to Britain. They have been invited to  submit a tender to supply Britain's Royal Air Force with  Rooivalk [red falcon] choppers, a signal that the arms embargo  may soon be lifted. Marinus Wijnbeek reports:    After about 20 years the second South African Air Force  flight to Britain, in as many weeks, is preparing to leave from  Waterkloof Air Force base, and in its hold is Denel's Rooivalk  attack helicopter. Fitting the large aircraft into Hercules is  an engineering feat all by itself. Rooivalk will be  demonstrated at the coming air show at (Middlewallop) in  Britain. Since December last year the weapons systems have  undergone intensive tests. The aircraft has a chin- mounted  canon and it is also fitted with the Kentron ZT-3 antitank  missile. It is these tank killing properties and its very  modern technology that resulted in the invitation to submit the  bid in Britain. The aircraft can operate under all weather  conditions in virtually any region of the world. Six other  contenders from the USA and Europe have also entered  helicopters. If successful 91 Rooivalk aircraft will be  exported to the UK.</p>

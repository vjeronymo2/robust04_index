			<p>BFN     [Text] The Azerbaijani Army again intensified its  aggressive operations along the northeastern border of Armenia  on the morning of 3 May. The Armenian Defense Ministry press  service reported that the enemy subjected the border settlements  and defensive positions in Noyemberyanskiy, Idzhevanskiy,  Tavushskiy, and Berd rayons to heavy artillery shelling as of  1800. All types of weapons were used.    In an attempt to fulfill a recently planned military  operation by the Azerbaijani Army command, a large armed group  in Kazakhskiy Rayon launched an attack at 2100 with the support  of tanks against Berdavan in Noyemberyanskiy Rayon. The enemy  achieved some success against our border guards and approached  the village. However, after 40 minutes, the Armenian Army  fighters regrouped their forces and threw the enemy back and  recovered their initial positions. The positional battles  continued until 2400. Both sides suffered losses.    The Azerbaijani formations fiercely shelled Vazashen and  Diran in Idzhevanskiy Rayon, Aygepar and Paravakar in Tavushskiy  Rayon, and Vahan in Krasnoselskiy Rayon last night. Casualty  figures are being determined. Our border guards took  countermeasures and silenced the enemy at dawn.    According to the press service, a relative calm prevailed on  Armenia's northeastern border during the day today.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Commenting on the sabotage of a train in the south,  Army Commander in Chief General Wimon Wongwanit said that rifts  among the ethnic people in the south are being exploited as a  pretext to stage acts of terrorism. He said officials are doing  their best in terms of suppression:    [Begin recording] [Wimon] I would like to say this --  suppression alone cannot solve the problem of terrorism,  regardless of the country. We must try to cut their external  support, and we will only be able to cut external support by  negotiating with those countries on a government-to-government  basis. Meanwhile, local people and soldiers must cooperate in  safeguarding public security and protecting natural resources  along the border.    [Unidentified correspondent] Was it an attempt to create  confusion?    [Wimon] There is no confirmation of that. I have only  received a report on the incident. It is still too early to  determine what group was responsible for this attempt. We have  to wait for more information and more evidence. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Granada active Granada underlined its predatory intentions in the television sector with another move into the market to pick up stock in London Weekend Television. The catering to leisure group bought a further 4.5m preferred shares in LWT at 500p each, taking its stake up to 19.99 per cent. The shares crept up a penny to 483p. Granada slipped 4 to 417p. Leisure and media analysts were sceptical over press reports that the two groups were discussing a merger, particularly prior to the government's expected pronouncements on the very subject, due by the end of the year. Drugs issues Glaxo and Wellcome shrugged off recent weakness to register sharp advances. Dealers said the corrections were underpinned by some keen US buying, as well as a short position undertaken by one of the leading London marketmakers. Glaxo advanced 14 1/2 to 561 1/2 p. Wellcome gained 13 at 658p. Confirmation that international conglomerate Lonrho had appointed James Capel as its joint broker with Strauss Turnbull was seen as another move helping to elevate the stock to 'blue chip' status in the market. The shares hardened 2 to 126p. Bargain hunters were seen for English China Clays, boosting the stock 6 to 411p. Barclays and National Westminster were the pick of a rather sluggish banking sector, with both stocks responding to some aggressive buying in the traded options market and lingering hopes of another cut in domestic interest rates. Both share prices moved to within 10p of their all-time highs. NatWest advanced 6 to 487p on turnover of 3m, while a similar figure was traded in the options market. Barclays rose 4 to 481p on 1.6m dealt. Abbey National was up 2 at 417p and TSB 3 at 193p. The sale and subsequent purchase of a block of 2.2m Sedgwick shares failed to unsettle the stock price, which closed only marginally easier at 200p. A further rally in crude oil prices helped the oil sector stabilise after the hefty losses of recent sessions. The oil team at NatWest Securities said a move by the UN to allow the Iraqis to sell around Dollars 1.6bn worth of oil, for humanitarian reasons and for reparations to Kuwait, would entail the sale of 600,000 barrels of oil a day. 'This is not enough to swamp the market by itself, but probably enough to prevent prices rising in their normal seasonal pattern in the third quarter,' said NatWest. The broker told its clients to pick up oil issues with good recovery prospects, notably British Petroleum, but warned of the exploration and production sub-sector's vulnerability to weak crude prices. BP touched 296p but eased back to close only a fraction ahead at 294p amid talk of a number of profits downgrades in the pipeline, notably from BZW. Shell Transport rallied 5 to 616p. Burmah Castrol rose 6 to 708p, reflecting its wide exposure to the German economy and hopes of further interest rate cuts in that country. Among the oil minnows, New London shares closed 2 3/4 off at 5 3/4 p after the proposed sale of its International Drilling Fluids business to Schlumberger and the latter's proposed acquisition of a 10 per cent stake in New London fell through. Celsis, the medical equipment manufacturer, made an impressive debut in the market, with its flotation via a placing and offer nearly four times oversubscribed. The shares, issued at 100p, peaked at 117p before profit-taking saw them close just a penny ahead at 101p; turnover was a hefty 9.9m shares. Turnover in British Steel rose to 9.5m and the shares shed a penny to 88 1/2 p as NatWest Securities reiterated its sell recommendation following a meeting with the company. Fears that the current UK defence cutbacks may eventually lead to the UK government scaling down its order for the new Challenger tank hurt Vickers, off 2 at 149p. Westland Group, on the other hand, was cheered by reports that an order for transport helicopters would not be subject to the proposed defence cuts. The shares appreciated 7 to 221p. GKN, which has a near 30 per cent stake in Westland, moved 7 ahead to 460p on the same sentiment and news of an improvement in UK car sales. Lex also benefited from the car news and rose 7 to 386p. Suggestions that Saudi Arabia was about to place a substantial order for Airbus aircraft, for which British Aerospace builds the wings and holds a 20 per cent stake in the company, boosted BAe. The shares closed 6 up at 392p. BT performed strongly, finishing 8 higher at 426p with 5.6m shares traded, after news that the company had received 5.2m registrations for the BT 3 share offer. Dealers said the shares were helped by strong support in the traded options market, where the equivalent of a further 6.3m shares changed hands. Positive talk from Kleinwort Benson was said to have helped Boots shares climb 6 to 433p. MFI improved 1 1/2 to 131 1/2 p in spite of being downgraded by Goldman Sachs.</p>

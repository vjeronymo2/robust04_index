The crime came at a time when  Muslims were preparing to celebrate International Jerusalem Day.    The Zionist entity officials -- who have failed to achieve  their satanic objectives despite all their ruses,  capitulationist solutions, and acts of violence -- are again  trying their luck through fascist means, as they did in Dayr  Yasin and Kafr Qasim. By committing massacres and spreading  terror, they want to deter the oppressed Palestinian Muslims  from continuing their just and legitimate resistance.    The world is once again face to face with a barbaric and  ugly  crime that has no justification whatsoever. The Zionist entity  and the White House leaders are in charge of these practices  from behind the curtain.    The Hebron massacre has put an end to the dreams of the  bargain seekers and those who indulged the criminal leaders in  Tel Aviv and called on the Palestinian people to make peace and  bargain with them. Does not bargaining with such an entity lead  only to the destruction of the Palestinian Muslim people? Are  not those ignoring these crimes and calling on the Tel Aviv  leaders to be friends partners in the crime? What crime has the  innocent Muslim inhabitants of Hebron committed to be massacred?    World public opinion and Muslims everywhere are angry with  this ugly Zionist crime and are urged to show their correct and  conscious reaction in order to prevent the Zionists from  persisting with actions that aim to annihilate Muslims and Islam.    If Muslims are lax and pay scant attention to this crime,  the  Zionists and their allies in Washington will certainly take the  next steps. The main objective of the arrogant forces and the  Zionists is the destruction of the Islamic resistance. The most  prominent examples of this are seen today in the occupied  territories and Bosnia. We are confident that Muslims will not  allow such a satanic plot to pass.</p>

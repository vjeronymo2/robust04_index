			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Kim Chae-muk: "Who Will Be Victims of </F> Sanctions Against North Korea?"]    [Text] Economic sanctions are one of the means of external  policy implemented by the international community as a "weapon."  The purpose of sanctions is to attain a certain "strategic goal"  by controlling commodities trade between states and blocking the  flow of capital.    Discussion of sanctions against North Korea that the UN  Security Council undertook on a full scale this week is to  pursue the same strategy. Its strategic goal is to work out  measures to ascertain North Korea's nuclear transparency.    The question is whether economic sanctions have practical  effects or not, in other words, whether one can achieve the  strategic goal of the sanctions, namely "making the leaders of  the Pyongyang regime give in."    In the event that measures to implement sanctions against  North Korea are finalized in the UN Security Council, sanctions  by the international community, including the discontinuation of  trade of weapons and other commodities and blockade of the flow  of various capital, will be implemented.    Nevertheless, it is not clear whether North Korea will give  in to such sanctions and allow the "nuclear inspection" demanded  by the international community.    We remember a historical fact that the state power  traditionally uses outside pressure as a means for consolidating  unity of the people at home. This holds more true for  dictatorial states. In view of this, the Pyongyang regime may  shift the pains it will suffer from pressure of the  international community onto the powerless North Korean people  and may implement policies for its own survival.    Needless today, the effects of sanctions against North Korea  will not end only in the "North Korean people." In other words,  there is a great possibility that such pains will be extended to  South Korea. The negative impact of sanctions will be felt by  the common people in South Korea more seriously than by the  rulers. Even at the initial stage of discussions of sanctions at  the United Nations, the price of "ROK stocks" already showed an  indication of uneasiness in the international financial markets.    When the sanctions are actually implemented, our business  firms have to bear economic pains. Needless to say, such pains  will extend to the common people in the ROK. No one can be  optimistic about the extent of the damages. The  processing-on-commission-trade between the North and the South,  though it is still negligible, will be suspended, and external  credit rating of business firms will be lowered. As a result,  export-import activities will be drastically reduced.    Even if one makes the North Korean regime surrender through  sanctions, the actual damages the people in the North and the  South may suffer will not be compensated.</p>

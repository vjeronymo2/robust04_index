			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> HART OF GOLD: Who's the world's youngest popster? Our money's on Taro Hart, son  of Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart, who is the co-star of Hart's new album,  "Music to Be Born By," the perfect gift for your crystal-worshiping New Age  chums. Due out from Rykodisc in March, the record features Taro's heartbeat in  the womb accompanied by Hart's performance on drums, bass and wooden flute.  According to Hart, the music is designed to provide child-bearing women with a  "soundscape of comforting patterns to assist in the birthing process." . . .  Are you ready for a video magazine devoted to (gasp) heavy metal? It's called  "Hard 'N Heavy," with a premiere hourlong issue devoted to uncensored videos  from Ozzy Osbourne and Anthrax, an Alice Cooper career retrospective, scenes  from Motley Crue mainstay Vince Neil's feature film debut (in "Police Academy  VI") and other headbanger highlights. The video, which is due out every two  months, will retail for $20. . . . Sandra Bernhard's notorious one-woman  Off-Broadway show, "Without You I'm Nothing," will be immortalized on vinyl in  May, thanks to Enigma Records. The two-album sound track includes the  acid-tongued comedienne's renditions of Prince's "Little Red Corvette" and  Billy Paul's "Me and Mrs. Jones." Of Enigma, Bernhard said: "It's the home of  Poison and Stryper, so I couldn't be happier." . . . Speaking of Enigma -- it's  launching an Enigma Retro label that will feature classic out-of-print releases  (though only on CD or cassette). The label debuts with very early Alice Cooper  ("Pretties for You"), the GTO's ("Permanent Damage") with releases from Ted  Nugent, Lord Buckley and Lenny Bruce to follow.  </P></p>

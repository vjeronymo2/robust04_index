			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lutfi Shatarah: "Socialist Party Demands Army </F> Withdrawal From Seven Governorates"]    [Excerpt] London -- Authoritative Yemeni Socialist Party  [YSP] sources have attacked former Foreign Minister Dr.  'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani for announcing the number of incidents  and and assassinations to which the YSP has been exposed over  the past three years. They accused him of appointing himself  policeman, prosecutor, and judge at the same time.    Al-Iryani said that the YSP and its cadres have been exposed  to nine attempts only, and that the suspects are in jail. But  the sources stress that the incidents exceed 152.    Elsewhere, YSP Information Center sources in Aden have said  that YSP representatives on the military committee continue to  insist on the party's position urging that the Armed Forces  withdraw from the seven governorates (Lahij, Abyan, Shabwah,  Ma'rib, Ta'izz, Ibb, and al-Bayda') and that all military units  be moved out of these governorates, saying that there is no  justification for a military presence in these areas, known in  the past as the fringes between the two parts of Yemen, except  in the areas which represent protection for the Republic of  Yemen.    In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, the sources denied that  the YSP had demanded the withdrawal of what used to be known as  the southern and northern forces to their positions before  unity, contrary to what has been reported by some circles in the  General People's Congress.    The YSP demanded that all armed forces, wherever they are,  be  treated equally in terms of food, clothes, and other  necessities. [passage omitted]</p>

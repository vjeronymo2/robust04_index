			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average eases on late profit-taking SHARE prices finished easier on the day after late afternoon profit-taking eroded earlier gains and buying by dealers lost its momentum, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average was finally 115.12 down at the day's low of 18,440.18. It registered a high for the session of 18,916.70 in the morning, as last Friday's Federal Funds rate cut in the US raised hopes of an imminent lowering of the official discount rate by the Bank of Japan. Volume fell to 380m shares from 754m as dealers, who have been active buyers recently, refrained from buying. Declines led advances by 509 to 489, with 146 issues unchanged, the Topix index of all first section stocks shed 9.82 to 1,410.56 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 2.12 to 1,135.30. Short-covering by foreign investors and short-term buying by individuals were noted as hopes of an early credit easing lifted prices in the morning. Investment trusts came in with the profit-taking in the afternoon. Major institutional investors were inactive. Since a high proportion of institutional portfolios is already invested in equities, institutions are not aggressive buyers of shares; and, due to 'guidance' from the Ministry of Finance, they are unable to sell to take profits either. 'Banks and life insurers which have sold stocks are receiving calls from the Finance Ministry,' said Mr Masami Okuma at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. Individual investors continued with speculative short-term trading. Nippon Mining, the most active issue of the day, rose Y10 to Y510 on the Aids theme. Trust banks were firm on active short-covering. Yasuda Trust advanced Y96 to Y1,010 and Toyo Trust Y79 to Y1,030. Leading commercial banks lost ground on profit-taking. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y30 to Y2,960 and Sakura Y100 to Y1,210. Minebea, the leading ball bearing maker, put on Y3 to Y495. The issue saw active buying on reports over the weekend that it would sell NMB Semiconductor, its semiconductor manufacturing affiliate, to Nippon Steel. However, some earlier gains were lost as denials by Minebea of an agreement with Nippon Steel prompted profit-taking. In the morning session, the Japan Securities Dealers' Association said it would suspend trading of NMB Semiconductor shares on the over-the-counter market in order to allow investors to confirm newspaper reports. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 13.12 to 20,134.62 in volume of 20.4m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, gained Y100 at Y10,800 on bargain hunting. Roundup SENTIMENT varied in the Pacific Rim region yesterday, reflecting a fairly gloomy tone in the higher volume markets. HONG KONG blamed Sino-US trade disputes, profit-taking and switching back into Japanese equities as the Hang Seng index ended 43.1 down at 5,664.41 after hitting an intraday low of 5,647.07 just before the close. Turnover shrank from HKDollars 1.82bn to HKDollars 1.32bn. Selective profit-taking took in HSBC Holdings, which topped the actives list as it retreated HKDollars 1 to end the day at HKDollars 54.50. AUSTRALIA reflected nervousness about interest rates and the weak local dollar as the All Ordinaries index slipped 15.4 to 1,514.9. Turnover more than halved from ADollars 291m to ADollars 139.9m. Brokers said banks were depressed by the perception that interest rates have bottomed. The sector was led down by NAB, 14 cents off at ADollars 7.20, followed by ANZ and Commonwealth, each 8 cents cheaper at ADollars 3.08 and ADollars 6.66 respectively. Westpac dipped 7 cents to a 7 1/2 -year low of ADollars 2.83. TAIWAN reversed early gains on meeting heavy selling of electronics stocks. The weighted index, which rose more than 40 points at the opening, finished 36.22 lower on balance at 3,852.27. The market was closed on Friday and Saturday due to a typhoon. The electronics sector was weak after poor interim results, and amid talk that some might fail to meet payment deadlines to suppliers. Microtek fell TDollars 2.10 to TDollars 29.10. SEOUL climbed steeply in moderate trade as President Roh set a date for his visit to China, and on news of a Siberian gas joint venture for the construction of a pipeline linking the reserves with Korea. The composite index moved ahead 22.90, or 4.3 per cent, to 557.59 in turnover of Won298.9bn, against Saturday's Won231.9bn. MANILA saw modest gains in leading telephone issue PLDT and state-controlled Philippine National Bank (PNB), and the composite index rose 21.70 to 1,413.70. News that the government planned to sell 11 per cent of its PNB shares to a state pension fund, ensuring that government deposits remain intact in the profitable bank, helped PNB to move forward 12.50 pesos to 277.50 pesos. BANGKOK reflected a spurt in property companies and Thai Airways as the SET index advanced 6.98 to 770.26 in turnover of baht 6.62bn. BOMBAY had just one hour of trading instead of the usual two, but this still left the BSE index 60.42 stronger at 3,226.52 as speculators and small investors bet on a continued uptrend.</p>

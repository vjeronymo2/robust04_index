			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BUSH LINKS ECONOMICS, GLOBAL WARMING ACTION  </P> <P> In a speech that was controversial before it was even delivered, President Bush  told an international conference on global warming Monday that the United  States is committed to "aggressive and thoughtful action" on world  environmental issues, but he repeatedly stressed his belief that policies have  to be "consistent with economic growth and free market principles."  </P> <P> Delegates from about 50 countries, here for the Intergovernmental Panel on  Climate Change to continue work on a massive report assessing the threat and  consequences of global warming and recommending responses, gave the President's  opening speech a strikingly modest response. Representatives of environmental  groups followed with a chorus of criticism that Bush had thrown away an  opportunity for the United States to take effective leadership.  </P> <P> "It just shows that the Administration is still more concerned about polluters'  profits than protecting the Earth from global warming," said Daniel Becker of  the Sierra Club. "There is no reason that we can't act."  </P> <P> Environmentalists have for months urged that the United States set firm goals  for reducing gases, particularly carbon dioxide, contributing to an  acceleration of the Earth's greenhouse effect. Faced with sharp differences  within its ranks, the Administration continues to maintain that scientific  evidence needs to be clearer before major long-term commitments are made.  </P> <P> Some European governments, meanwhile, have already set firm targets for  freezing carbon dioxide emission levels.  </P> <P> After its predecessor had set the year 2000 as a target for stabilizing  emissions, the new Dutch government is considering a proposal to move the  deadline to the middle of this decade.  </P> <P> After the President's speech Monday, Dutch environmentalist Jan Henselman  expressed concern that other countries will be reluctant to follow the lead of  the Netherlands unless the United States, by far the world's largest  contributor of carbon dioxide, moves to control its emissions.  </P> <P> Renewing an offer he tabled at the Malta summit with Soviet President Mikhail  S. Gorbachev last December, Bush again proposed that Washington host the first  negotiations toward an international global warming convention, once the report  of the United Nations-sanctioned Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is  completed.  </P> <P> The President also told the delegates the White House will invite scientists to  a spring conference on environmental and economic issues, and that he intends  to participate personally.  </P> <P> The meeting, he said, will convene "top officials from a representative group  of nations to bring together three essential disciplines, science, economics  and ecology. And they will share their knowledge, assumptions, and state of the  art research models to outline our understanding and help focus our efforts."  </P> <P> Although, he announced no date, Administration sources said plans are to hold  the meeting in April, just before the 20th anniversary commemoration of Earth  Day.  </P> <P> Bush's opening speech to the third plenary meeting of the Intergovernmental  Panel on Climate Change had become a subject of sharp controversy in recent  days after it was reported that White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu, a  skeptic of global warming evidence, had insisted on toning down the planned  address after it had been endorsed by Secretary of State James A. Baker III,  Energy Secretary James D. Watkins, Environmental Protection Agency  Administrator William K. Reilly, and White House Science Adviser D. Allen  Bromley.  </P> <P> Sununu denied he had toned down the speech, and in a television interview  Sunday, criticized "faceless bureaucrats on the environmental side" who tended  toward a policy "that cuts off our use of coal, oil and natural gas."  </P> <P> After the address was delivered Monday, Administration sources said Sununu had  removed nothing of concrete substance from the speech, but had sharply  moderated its tone by changes such as eliminating a reminder that the United  States last year committed itself to a stabilization of carbon dioxide  emissions "as soon as possible."  </P> <P> The meeting here this week is designed to move the working groups a step  further along the way to draft reports due to be submitted for approval in  Stockholm next August.  </P></p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Johnson Matthey falls 11% - Shares lose 28p as costs of Italian silver disposal hit results The cost of disposing of its Italian silver business helped to push 1993-94 profits down by 11 per cent at Johnson Matthey, the precious metals technology group. The shares fell 28p to close at 558p. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 65.4m on total turnover of Pounds 1.96bn for the year to end March, compared with a previous Pounds 73.8m on turnover of Pounds 1.85bn. However, continuing activities showed operating profits rose by 15 per cent to Pounds 81.6m (Pounds 70.8m) on turnover of Pounds 1.84bn (Pounds 1.76bn). Mr David Davies, chairman and chief executive, said all four divisions had shown higher profits. At the same time the group had embarked on several joint ventures which would enable it to expand globally. The group was moving from the cost cutting cycle of the past few years into a cycle of growth, he said, citing the group's ceramics venture with Cookson, planned autocatalyst plants in Malaysia and Mexico, and an electronics venture with Mitsubishi in Japan. The improvement at operating level was fuelled by the materials technology division, which lifted profits from Pounds 20.8m to Pounds 28m. Mr Davies said that biomedical products had continued to be a good profits earner, and the electronic materials side had lifted profits in North America by 60 per cent in sterling terms. Profits at the automotive catalysts division rose from Pounds 27.1m to Pounds 28.2m, with strong demand from North America offsetting a 15 per cent decline in the European car market. Precious metals profits edged ahead from Pounds 20.5m to Pounds 20.8m. A rise in the price of platinum from Pounds 215 a troy ounce to Pounds 255 in the period was offset by a further fall in the rhodium price, from Pounds 1,253 a troy ounce to Pounds 625. The colour and print division improved profits from Pounds 11.3m to Pounds 13m. Exceptional charges totalled Pounds 11.7m, compared with an exceptional gain of Pounds 3.7m previously. The book loss of Pounds 9m on the Italian sale, announced yesterday, was offset by the disposal earlier in the year of the UK and Irish jewellery businesses at a profit of Pounds 2.3m. A provision of Pounds 5m has been charged for restructuring costs on Cookson Matthey Ceramics, the joint venture with Cookson announced last March. and due to start on July 1. Earnings per share were 23.7p, down from 27.1p. Earnings before exceptionals were 27.6p. A final dividend of 8p is proposed, giving a total for the year of 11.4p (10.3p). COMMENT The fall in the share price was surprising. Apart from the sale of the Italian business, the results were in line with City expectations. Further growth is expected. The group is investing a lot of money in the future. Capital expenditure, at Pounds 65.4m, was more than twice the depreciation charge, and research and development spending at Pounds 28.5m was also at a record. It is taking its electronics expertise to Japan and its autocatalyst expertise to east Asia and Mexico. By linking with Cookson, it is turning the small colour and print division into a business big enough to compete on global terms in the ceramics industry. Next year profits should be about Pounds 90m, which gives a multiple of more than 17. This might look expensive in the short term, but longer term the prospects are good.</p>

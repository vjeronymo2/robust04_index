			<p>BFN     [Text] Georgian-Abkhazian talks, mediated by Russia, the  United Nations, and the CSCE, continued this morning at the  Russian Foreign Ministry in Moscow. No precise agreements were  reached at yesterday's meeting. On Tuesday the sides mainly  debated the introduction of peacekeeping forces to the conflict  zone. They talked about the option of deploying peacekeeping  forces along the confrontation line between the armed formations  of the warring sides, situated on the Inguri River. In  particular, they discussed how far the troops should be  withdrawn from the river in order to create a buffer zone, where  peacekeeping forces could then be deployed.</p>

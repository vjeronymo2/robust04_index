			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Recent good earnings news holds sway Wall Street US stocks yesterday extended their rally into a second session, as equity investors brushed aside a mild down-turn in bond prices on fresh evidence of the economy's strength, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 33.67 higher at 3,798.17, just shy of the session's peak. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 added 2.75 at 461.01. Volume on the Big Board was a moderate 258m shares. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite rose 1.93 to 439.62. The Nasdaq composite ended 2.69 higher at 724.85 after a power outage knocked out the market's computer systems and halted trading for half an hour during the afternoon. Looking back on a corporate results season which brought news of strong earnings, equity investors were in a buoyant mood as the trading week commenced. After Friday's 33-point Dow advance, shares opened higher and built on their early gains even though the day's economic data may have rekindled fears over interest rates. Such misgivings, quelled on Friday by favourable data on second-quarter economic growth, resurfaced with the release of the monthly survey conducted by the National Association of Purchasing Management. Its overall index for July inched forward, defying expectations of a decline. The report also contradicted Friday's data by showing that business inventories had fallen. The news pushed bond prices down, though the losses were modest. But equities chose instead to accentuate the positive on the heels of the impressive performance by the corporate sector in the quarter. Cyclical issues again led the advance. General Motors climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 52 7/8 , Caterpillar Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 109 7/8 and United Technologies by Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 61 3/4 . Steel shares gathered strength on speculation that Chrysler was willing to pay a 10 per cent price increase to its leading suppliers. Inland Steel advanced Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 40 1/4 , National Steel Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 21 5/8 and USX-US Steel Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 39 1/8 . The day's big loser was Carter Wallace, which plunged 31 per cent after the company recommended that doctors stop prescribing its Felbatol treatment for seizures. The stock fell Dollars 4 7/8 to Dollars 10 3/4 amid concern over the drug's side-effects. CBS's share price appreciated on renewed speculation over its future. The stock put on Dollars 2 3/4 at Dollars 314 3/4 after Mr Ted Turner, owner of the Cable News Network, told reporters that he was interested in acquiring the media group. Most technology stocks improved. IBM moved up Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 63 and Lotus Development Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 32 7/8 . But Motorola shed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 51 7/8 on news of a 38 per cent drop in prices on its digital access equipment. On the Nasdaq, Newbridge Networks plummeted Dollars 13 3/4 to Dollars 28 1/8 after issuing a profits warning. Brazil Sao Paulo declined 1.17 per cent in local currency terms in light trade, led by a strong sell-off in the telecoms sector after news that Telebras was planning a RDollars 320m preferred share subscription. The Bovespa index of the 56 most-active shares finished 493 off at 41,520 in weak volume of RDollars 220.1m (Dollars 236.1m). Telebras preferred closed 1.8 per cent down at RDollars 43.10, while its common stock dropped 3.2 per cent to RDollars 32.80. A lack of new foreign funds due to continued concern over the real/US dollar exchange rate also weighed on share prices.</p>

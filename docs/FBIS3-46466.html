This is not what we wish to see, and the  responsibility does not lie with the Chinese side."    It has been learned that the total volume of Sino-British  trade reached $3.59 billion last year, an increase of 86 percent  over the previous year. Judging from the general situation, Wu  Yi continued, Sino-British economic and trade relations are not  bad, and there is great potential for development.

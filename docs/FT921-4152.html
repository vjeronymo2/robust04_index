			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / International Company News: Degussa plans to float stake in unit PRE-TAX profits at Degussa, the German metals, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals group, rose by 5 per cent to DM43m (Dollars 26m) in the first quarter of this year. However Mr Gert Becker, the chief executive, said results would only show a marked improvement for the full year if the world chemical market recovered. The company plans a number of fund-raising moves this year. It will launch a rights issue and plans to float off a minority stake in its pharmaceutical subsidiary, Asta Medica, when stock market conditions are suitable. Asta's turnover, including the newly acquired business in east Germany, is around DM1.3bn. Mr Becker said Degussa's profits last year stemmed from chemicals and pharmaceuticals. It had cut losses at its Leybold high technology unit and was seeking a partner for this business. Eventually, Leybold could also be partly floated off to the public, he said. Degussa's restructuring measures had made the company 'significantly more robust' than in the previous year, he added. Group restructuring costs exceeded DM100m in the financial year to September 1991, with the labour force reduced by more than 2,000. The company intends to shed a further 1,000 jobs by autumn next year, as it reduces its central administrative and research staff. 'We are in a period of radical change,' Mr Becker said. For last year, Degussa cut its dividend from DM11 to DM7 after a drop in net income last year of 33 per cent to DM99m. Degussa is concentrating more on its non-German activities to be closer to world markets. Foreign investments were higher than those at home for the first time last year. Investments abroad, chiefly in the US, India, Taiwan and Brazil, made up 55 per cent of the DM783m total, which was up by 15 per cent on the previous year. Mr Robert Ehrt, finance director, said this year's capital spending would total up to DM650m. Around 70 per cent of turnover, which dropped by 7 per cent to DM3bn in the first quarter, is achieved abroad.</p>

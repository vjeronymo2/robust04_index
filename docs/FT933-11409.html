			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / International Company News: Austrian savings bank has strong first-half result DIE ERSTE Oesterreichische Spar-Casse Bank said its operating profit in the first half jumped 47 per cent to Sch724m (Dollars 59.6m), due to much better income from lending and trading as well as reduced costs, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich. The bank, which converted itself into a joint stock company last month, reported total assets of Sch184.7m, 2.4 per cent higher than at the end of last year. Mr Konrad Fuchs, chief executive, said negotiations aimed at restructuring Austria's savings bank sector, in which Erste is playing a leading role, were entering an intensive phase. But he declined to speculate on the outcome.</p>

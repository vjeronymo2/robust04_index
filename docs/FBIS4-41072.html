It is common  knowledge that the disputing sides have generally heeded the  cease-fire agreement for more than a month.    Regrettably, Armenia has violated the cease-fire several  times during the past few days. That has had serious  consequences. For example, several towns in Sadarak Rayon in  the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic [NAR] were shelled with  heavy artillery on 19 June. Considering that, the Azerbaijan  Ministry of Foreign Affairs reaffirms that compliance with the  cease-fire agreement along the entire front line, which  constitutes [words indistinct] in the negotiations process, is  essential.    The evidence--which confirms that the representatives of  Armenia and the Armenian community in Karabakh have tried to  avoid the outcome of the consultations held in Moscow between  the [words indistinct] and the delegations which represented  Azerbaijan and the Azerbaijani community in Daghlyk-Karabakh  [Nagorno-Karabakh] with Russian mediation--is astonishing.  Azerbaijan resolutely supports the effort to find a political  solution to the dispute, which has continued for many years and  created many misfortunes for the Armenian and Azerbaijani  peoples. Matters related to the finding of a political solution  to the dispute, consolidation of the cease-fire, withdrawal of  military forces from Azerbaijan's occupied territories, and  establishment of the future political status of Daghlyk-Karabakh  in Azerbaijan should [words indistinct].    Furthermore, Azerbaijan applauds the [word indistinct]  mediation effort for the resumption of the peace process by the  CSCE, Russia, and the CIS in order to completely end the  dispute. The Azerbaijan Ministry of Foreign Affairs views the  present situation as a turning point and urges all responsible  bodies to act with goodwill to contribute to the establishment  of peace.</p>

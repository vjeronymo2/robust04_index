			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by RPF Chairman Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe on 14 </F> April; place not given]    [Excerpts] Ladies and gentlemen, in an earlier statement  issued on 10th April 1994, we informed you that since the death  of the president many innocent people have been killed by  Presidential Guards, some elements of the Army and MRND-CDR  [Republican National Movement for Democracy and  Development-Coalition for the Defense of the Republic] youth  wingers, who have been trained and armed with military  equipment. [passage omitted] The RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front]  took an irreversible step to fight this group of people, and the  RPF calls upon government and the entire Rwandese population who  are not in the clique to join hands so as to accomplish this  task.    Ladies and gentlemen: Since the RPF decided on 8th April  1994 to take up arms and stop these acts of murder and terror,  the Rwandese people welcomed the act and have been cooperative  in places where our soldiers passed on their way to Kigali.  Peace-loving government soldiers who were against shedding  blood of innocent people have also disassociated themselves from  the killers. These killers are the ones who have denied the  democratic process our country has been prepared to take based  on the Arusha peace agreement. I am pleased to inform you that  at this particular moment, the Rwandese Patriotic Army soldiers  are already in Kigali fighting with the clique of government  soldiers who are continuing to kill innocent people. Countrymen  and peace-loving soldiers: Let us come together and pursue  those murderers and we shall defeat them within a short time.    Let me take this opportunity to request the youth who are  involved in these acts, be they in government forces or MRND-CDR  youth wingers, (Inyeuhamwe) and (Imhuzamugambi), [as heard] to  stop killing innocent people. Let me also remind you that the  people who deplored you to do such acts are already running out  of the country and the so-called government Sindikubgwabo and  Kambanda [as heard] is in a state of confusion with no direction  of where to go. We request the military commanders, leaders in  prefectures and communes, religious leaders to disassociate  themselves with this clique of murderers. [passage omitted]    Ladies and gentlemen: I request you not to listen to bad  elements who scare that the RPF is your enemy. I cannot repeat  the lies broadcast by radio (RTLM) and Radio Rwanda, together  with MRND and CDR cohorts. The days for such lies meant for a  resumption of hostilities are numbered. Our objective is to  defend the Rwandese people by stopping such wanton killings in  our country. We request for your cooperation so that we can  achieve our objective within the shortest time possible. I once  again thank all those who are assisting the RPF in this war we  are fighting so as to completely eliminate dictatorship from our  country. I request all of us to be together in sorrow in these  bad days we are (?existing). Victory is certain. Thank you.  Signed by the RPF chairman, Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe.</p>

			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSONAL HEALTH;  </P> <P> NEW FOCUS ON KEY TEST FOR CANCER;  </P> <P> RADIOLOGY: MAMMOGRAMS CAN PROVIDE VITAL EARLY WARNINGS OF BREAST CANCER, BUT  SOME INVESTIGATION OF FACILITIES IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT THE TESTS ARE  PROPERLY CONDUCTED AND RESULTS ARE RELIABLE.  </P> <P> Recent concern about the accuracy of Pap tests not only has underscored the  need for greater care with that type of cancer detection. It also has given new  relevance to a quiet effort to improve the accuracy of one of the few other  mass-screening tools for cancer: mammography.  </P> <P> Unlike the Pap test, the mammogram offers women choices and a competitive  market in which to make them.  </P> <P> But until recently there has been no easy way for a woman to know that the  facility she chooses will detect problems early enough to prevent her from  being among the 43,000 women who die every year from breast cancer.  </P> <P> In fact, radiologists concede, faulty procedures and inadequate quality control  in some cases have resulted in poor-quality mammograms that miss small cancers.  </P> <P> No one can say how many women may have been given a false sense of assurance  when in fact they had cancer, but "we're certain" it has happened, said Dr.  Lawrence W. Bassett, director of the Iris Cantor Center for Breast Imaging at  UCLA.  </P> <P> How can a woman know if her mammography facility is a good one? "The answer,"  he said "is that until recently we really had no mechanism. Women were told . .  . that if they asked certain questions they could find out. But that puts an  awful lot of burden on women. You shouldn't have to do an investigation on your  own every time you use a service," he said.  </P> <P> Bassett is helping to lead a national push by radiologists, the government and  the American Cancer Society to remedy the problem by setting standards for  quality mammography.  </P> <P> Unlike previous concerns over excessive radiation doses -- concerns focusing on  old or poorly adjusted equipment -- the latest effort aims at improving the  more subtle procedural aspects of X-raying a woman's breasts.  </P> <P> Getting a quality image while keeping the radiation dose down requires:  well-adjusted equipment dedicated solely to mammography; extended processing of  the film separate from other X-rays; well-supervised technicians; and proper  positioning of a woman's breast against the X-ray film, Bassett said.  </P> <P> "If the image that comes out is good, it's not only because the equipment's  good, but because the technologist positioned the patient properly, the  compression (of the breast) was adequate, and the radiologist knew how to read  it," he said.  </P> <P> The keystone of the new push is a voluntary certification program by the  American College of Radiology. Since its inception two years ago, the program  has certified about 2,000 facilities as meeting its standards for taking and  interpreting mammograms; 52 of these are in California, with another 59 in the  state in the process of certification, said Marie Zinninger, who directs the  program.  </P> <P> "This is meant to be an educational effort, to raise a level of awareness about  what needs to be done to have quality mammography," Zinninger emphasized.  </P> <P> As a result, facilities that don't pass usually adjust procedures or equipment  and reapply successfully, she said.  </P> <P> The government also is getting into the act. In California, the radiologic  health branch of the Department of Health Services has drafted rules to require  mammography facilities to regularly test their work to assure quality control,  said Edgar Bailey, branch chief. It also will adopt rules of good practice for  mammography.  </P> <P> Nationally, the Medicare catastrophic care bill passed by Congress last year  would have extended mammography benefits for the first time under a federal  program. It also set up strict standards for the procedure similar to those  advanced by the American College of Radiology.  </P> <P> Since Medicare regulations often become the norm throughout the health care  industry, mammography advocates were elated at what they saw as a first step  toward making the test a routine part of health care covered by private medical  insurance.  </P> <P> But mammography coverage may be excluded in the current effort to repeal  catastrophic health care. The House voted Oct. 4 to repeal the entire  catastrophic care bill. Mammography coverage was one of a few provisions that  the Senate voted Oct. 6 to retain, while repealing most of the bill, said Ray  Gill, a spokesman for the Health Care Financing Administration. The difference  is being resolved in a conference committee.  </P> <P> For a woman seeking a mammogram, the national focus on quality will, in the  future, make it easier to have confidence that her test will be properly  conducted.  </P> <P> But for now, there is still an element of investigation necessary.  </P> <P> The American College of Radiology's program, so far, has certified only about a  third of 6,400 mammography facilities known to be in existence in 1988.  (Zinninger estimates the number may have risen now to as high as 8,000.)  </P> <P> American Cancer Society offices have lists of accredited facilities in their  areas. State-by-state lists of accredited facilities also are available from  the federal Cancer Information Service, (800) 4-CANCER (800-422-6237).  </P> <P> If there are no accredited facilities nearby, women still must do some  investigating to ensure the quality of their mammogram. But by making some  relatively simple inquiries, they can greatly increase their chances of  undergoing a test that results in good-quality images with minimal radiation  exposure, Bassett said.  </P> <P> Radiologists note that the lowest dosage isn't always the best. That's because  a dose that is too low means an inadequate X-ray, radiologists say.  </P> <P> According to the federal Center for Devices and Radiological Health, the  average radiation dose from a single mammogram has decreased from unacceptable  levels as high as 6 1/2 rems in 1974 to averages of 1/4 to 1/2 of a rem in  1985. (A rem is a measure of the biological effect of radiation; a chest X-ray  is about 0.030 of a rem -- more commonly expressed as 30 millirems, or  thousandths of a rem. By comparison, cosmic rays and other environmental  sources of radiation deliver 100 to 200 millirems to each American annually.)  </P> <P> In a 1988 national survey by the Food and Drug Administration's Center for  Devices and Radiological Health, however, new imaging techniques that can spot  smaller cancers had increased the average mammogram dosage very slightly. That  is because these techniques require higher energy to produce an image.  </P> <P> The same study found that the quality of American mammography facilities --  measured by having them X-ray "phantoms" embedded in opaque material -- had  improved as much as 22% between 1985 and 1988.  </P> <P> Still, the American Cancer Society advises that a mammography test involving  two views of the breast should deliver no more than 1 rem of radiation, notes  Dr. Judy Dean, a Santa Monica radiologist.  </P> <P> Dean said doses that are 20% of that can easily be achieved. Women needn't  worry about radiation dose if the facility they or their doctor selects meets  the American College of Radiology standards, she suggested. (Her own  mammography center is undergoing certification.)  </P> <P> More important is getting women to come in for mammograms at all, she said.  Data from the 1987 National Health Interview Survey showed that only 37% of  women 40 and older have ever had a mammogram.  </P> <P> A coalition of 11 groups, including the National Cancer Institute and the  American Cancer Society, united earlier this year to endorse mammograms every  one to two years for all women ages 40 to 50, and annually for all women older  than 50.  </P> <P> There appears to be agreement on that as a minimum standard, but some doctors  -- including Bassett and the 65,000-member American College of Physicians --  contend that mammograms should be done annually on all woman older than 40.  </P> <P> This, they say, is necessary because cancers are harder to detect, yet more  likely to be of the fast-growing type in a premenopausal woman's dense breast  tissue. As women age, this glandular tissue is replaced by fatty tissue that is  easier to image.  </P> <P> Dean said she thinks she knows why women don't get mammograms: "In some ways,  it's the same thing that keeps them from going to the dentist -- unpleasant,  easy to put off. But if you go to the dentist what's the worst thing you can  get? Maybe a root canal. If you go to get a mammogram what's the worst thing  you can hear? 'You have breast cancer. You might die.' It's a big anxiety.  </P> <P> "I get patients in here so nervous, sometimes they arrive and they've been  drinking. They're half-drunk because they couldn't face up to it otherwise,"  Dean said.  </P> <P> What does she tell women who are fearful? "Getting a mammogram 99% of the time  means getting good news. And if you're coming regularly, in my opinion you're  never going to get the worst news. You're going to at most find out that you  have something early that needs attention but is probably curable."  </P> <P> HOW TO CHOOSE A MAMMOGRAPHY FACILITY  </P> <P> The American College of Radiology's program has certified only about a third of  6,400 mammography facilities known to be in existence in 1988. To get the list,  call the Federal Cancer Information Service at (800) 4-CANCER.  </P> <P> If there are no accredited facilities nearby, the American College of Radiology  advises women to choose one that can answer "yes" to all the following  questions, because such a facility is likely to produce good images with  minimal radiation exposure.  </P> <P> * Is the radiologist certified by the American Board of Radiology?  </P> <P> * Are technologists certified by either the American Registry of Radiological  Technologists or the state licensing board?  </P> <P> * Is the X-ray equipment dedicated solely to mammography or specifically  designed for it?  </P> <P> * Is the equipment calibrated regularly by a certified radiological physicist?  (Once a year is considered minimum.)  </P> <P> * Have the radiologist and the technologist taken special courses or had  additional training in mammography?  </P> <P> * Does the radiologist do mammography as part of his or her regular practice?  </P> <P> Source: American College of Radiology  </P></p>

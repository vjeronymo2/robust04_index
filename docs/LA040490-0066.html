			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD  </P> <P> If Wayne Gretzky can't play, I like Calgary over the Kings in four games. . . .  </P> <P> The Stanley Cup playoffs should be as wide open all the way as the NCAA  basketball tournament was until the final. Boston had the best record in the  league, but in no way is to be confused with the old Bobby Orr machines.  Calgary is the defending champion, but is not playing nearly as well as a year  ago. Les Canadiens no longer scare anyone. The ex-Broad Street Bullies from  Philadelphia didn't even make the playoffs. About half the 16-team field has a  legitimate shot. . . .  </P> <P> Dynasties have been the rule, not the exception, in the NHL lately. Edmonton  won four of five Stanley Cups from 1984-88. The New York Islanders won four in  a row from 1980-83 and Montreal four in a row from 1976-79. . . .  </P> <P> The Kings never have won two consecutive playoff series. . . .  </P> <P> However, no Los Angeles sports fans are more enthusiastic than those at the  Forum during the hockey playoffs. Standing ovations when the team comes onto  the ice are mandatory. And some guests at the hotel across the street thought  there was an earthquake the night of April 10, 1982, when the Kings rallied and  beat Edmonton in overtime and the cheers and foot-stomping of 16,005 fans shook  the Forum. . . .  </P> <P> Sportsmanship and the NHL aren't exactly synonymous, but the handshakes that  follow the end of every Stanley Cup series should be copied by other sports. .  . .  </P> <P> NBC made a mistake by televising the NHL All-Star game instead of a  championship series game or two. . . .  </P> <P> Don't hold your breath for this one to happen, but the Clippers would love to  trade Benoit Benjamin and their two first-round draft choices to Houston for  Akeem Olajuwon. . . .  </P> <P> Nevada Las Vegas could become the first school to repeat as NCAA basketball  champion since UCLA in 1973, but only if Larry Johnson returns for his senior  season. . . .  </P> <P> How decisive was UNLV's victory over Duke? The margin of 30 points was seven  more than those of the previous eight championship games combined. . . .  </P> <P> A tribute to the Runnin' Rebels' physical conditioning is that they ran more  than anybody else in Denver, but were less bothered by the altitude. . . .  </P> <P> Thumbs up to Mike Krzyzewski, a good loser Monday night, and Jerry Tarkanian, a  good winner. . . . Coach Lon Kruger's five-year contract at Florida reportedly  is worth $625,000 a year, including money from TV and radio shows and summer  camps. And for every year that the Gators are put on NCAA probation because of  violations committed by the old regime, a year will be added to Kruger's  contract. . . .  </P> <P> Alabama Birmingham's Gene Bartow turned down a deal that would have been worth  $600,000 a year at Texas A&amp;M. . . .  </P> <P> Look-alikes: Seve Ballesteros and Bucky Dent. . . .  </P> <P> In non-lockout years, this is the most appealing week of the sports calendar:  NCAA basketball championship game, opening of the baseball season and the  Masters. . . .  </P> <P> Mike Marshall has found regular work as Keith Hernandez's replacement at first  base for the New York Mets, who have demoted Dave Magadan to the bench. . . .  </P> <P> It's early, but Chris Berman seems better suited to the studio than baseball  play-by-play for ESPN. . . .  </P> <P> The Dodgers always act as though they're doing a player a favor when they trade  him. . . .  </P> <P> Does anybody really think Danny Ferry is going to spend another year in Italy  before joining the Cleveland Cavaliers? . . .  </P> <P> This might finally be the season that Pat Riley gets what he deserves, the NBA  coach-of-the-year award. . . . Outfielder Michael Moore of Beverly Hills, who  plays wide receiver in the fall and is the nephew of Ahmad Rashad, is the only  member of the UCLA baseball team who has a batting cage in his back yard. . . .  </P> <P> Bruin forward Trevor Wilson, whose stock rose in the NCAA tournament, will  participate in the NBA prospects' camp next week in Orlando, Fla. . . .  </P> <P> The John Wooden of volleyball coaches, UCLA's Al Scates, will be honored at  ceremonies before the championship match of the Diet Pepsi-UCLA Collegiate  Volleyball Classic Saturday night at Pauley Pavilion. . . .  </P> <P> George Steinbrenner is financing and taking an active interest in the Florida  Clippers track club in Tampa, which will send world-class sprinter-hurdler Tony  Dees to the Jack In The Box meet May 20 at Drake Stadium. . . .  </P> <P> Jesse Orosco wore No. 47 and his record with the New York Mets was 47-47. . . .  </P> <P> Enough, already, of the Jim Valvano saga.  </P></p>

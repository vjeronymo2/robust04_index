			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / International Company News: Philippines mine lower Benguet, the Philippines' leading mining company, reported net profits for the nine months to end-September of 13.8m pesos (Dollars 0.58m), a steep drop of 95.7 per cent from the previous year. Total operating revenues amounted to 2.24bn pesos, down 6.3 per cent. The results were affected by poor ore grade which 'significantly improved' by the start of the fourth quarter of the year. The company expects full recovery by the first half of 1995. Gold production, Benguet's principal activity, suffered a decline following an earthquake that damaged part of the Antamok mine, with the clean-up later delayed by heavy rains. Losses from its Antamok open-pit mine in the January to September period reached 42.1m pesos, down, however, from the previous year's 70.3m pesos. Copper production, on the other hand, slowed in the third quarter due to breakdowns in the Dizon mine's concentrator plant.</p>

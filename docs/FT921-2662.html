			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Law jobs 'too costly for many graduates' NEARLY half of the law graduates who failed to take up their places on this year's finals course for solicitors dropped out because they could not afford a career in the law, according to the College of Law. An inquiry by the college, the largest training organisation for solicitors in Europe, found that 244 of the 508 law students who cancelled places or failed to register at the beginning of the 1991-92 academic year had financial reasons for withdrawing. More than 40 per cent of respondents to a more detailed questionnaire sent to the 244 had upper second honours degrees, and 11 per cent had already arranged training contracts with law firms. Nineteen per cent of the respondents had managed to obtain a council grant, although only 6 per cent managed to get both fees and a contribution to maintenance; 9 per cent were offered a bank loan; and 6 per cent obtained some sponsorship from employers or potential employers. Only 2 per cent obtained grants from charities or other foundations. Worst affected were students from ethnic minorities and married women returning to work after having children. Mr Richard Holbrook, chairman of the college's management board, said the college was 'very concerned about the extent of initial student drop-out'. The college would continue to campaign for mandatory grants to cover fees on the finals course and look for help from business in establishing a bursary scheme, he said. Mrs Yve Schelaas, a married women with four children who obtained an upper second degree from the University of Kent, approached 20 firms in the hope of securing sponsorship for her finals course. 'It's such a waste of taxpayers' money to educate law graduates so far and then not enable them to finish their qualifications,' she said.</p>

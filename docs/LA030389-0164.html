			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANTS / MAX JACOBSON;  </P> <P> 2 COUNTY ESTABLISHMENTS METE OUT SOME PRETTY GOOD VEGETARIAN FARE  </P> <P> Vegetarian friends visited me last week, and with them came the problem of  finding a restaurant where they would be comfortable. It's not that vegetarian  dishes are hard to find; any Chinese, Indian or Middle Eastern restaurant, for  example, has a good variety of meatless specialties. But for many lacto-ovo,  vegan, macrobiotic and other label-specific vegetarians, variety is not the  issue.  </P> <P> Rutabegorz in Fullerton looks as if it belongs on an ivy-covered New England  campus -- a dark, wooded shed-like dining room on a quiet, tree-lined street  just a block or two, in fact, from the campus of Fullerton College. It's a  casual place; you seat yourself, and all the waiters wear T-shirts and  comfortable shoes. Our waiter had a pony tail, and a calming, professional  demeanor.  </P> <P> The menu is a 15-page paper booklet that includes several non-veg items, mostly  of the salad/sandwich variety. My friends, David and Caren, begged me not to  try them -- and a misbegotten seafood salad, topped with a tasteless mixture of  crab and shrimp, told me I should have listened. Meanwhile, David and Caren  busied themselves with crisp tossed greens with tomato, sunflower seeds,  alfalfa sprouts and sliced cucumber. The dressings on their salads -- tahini  poppy seed and a sesame honey ginger -- were delicious.  </P> <P> Next came main courses, and more points for their side. I bit into a sandwich  called "the walnut that kissed the chicken" (chicken, walnuts, sprouts and  lettuce on squaw bread) and wondered why I could barely taste the large hunks  of chicken. When I asked the waiter if the chicken had been frozen, he replied,  "Yes, but it should be thawed by now."  </P> <P> David just smirked as he enjoyed a simple, well-prepared vegetarian chili:  pinto beans with two cheeses, sliced onion and fresh olive in a strong, hot  sauce. Caren sympathetically offered me some of her giant stuffed mushrooms  with vegetable-bread crumb filling; I accepted gratefully.  </P> <P> And that's about what to expect: The restaurant's meatless dishes are a far  better indicator of the kitchen. Stuffed squash and vegetarian lasagna make  filling, tasty meals. The tostada, enchilada and Mexican casserole, despite a  surfeit of gooey cheese, have a nice mix of flavors. My advice is not to bother  with the restaurant's frozen turkey breast, tired cubed chicken or tasteless,  shredded seafood. They will only serve to make your veggie friends say "I told  ya so."  </P> <P> Desserts at Rutabegorz taste like goodies from a church bake sale. Cheesecake  is light, lemony and fresh. Carrot cake, a tall square piece cut out of a giant  loaf pan, has lots of nuts and a moist, springy texture. Apple pie is served in  a gigantic slice, with a dry crumb topping and finely chopped fruit,  Pennsylvania Dutch country-style. There is an interesting assortment of creamy  cappuccino drinks (heavily doctored with ice cream and/or chocolate and/or  cinnamon) and ciders, too, even if they are not entirely in harmony with the  purists. Caren smiled beatifically when I kept my order simple and had a nice  cup of herbal tea instead.  </P> <P> The Greenery Natural Kitchen looks more like what my friends are used to: a  modest, unadorned restaurant with abundant potted plants, a few plain tables  and some scuffed-up wooden chairs. This time, I promised them that our dinner  would be entirely meatless.  </P> <P> The first things to arrive via the sluggish service were the fresh-pressed  juices. Carrot juice was sweet and fresh, but aloe vera juice was less  appealing -- it may be great for sunburns but as a drink, well, it tastes  vaguely like a cranberry-flavored health tonic.  </P> <P> The salads were next, and, as at Rutabegorz, they were fresh and crisp. But  this time, the tomato was remarkably flavorful and the dressing, a delightful  creamy herb, was virtually oil-free. A side order of cottage tofu with abundant  dill made an interesting if eccentric side dish.  </P> <P> David tried the unburger (a throwback to his days as a meat-eater) and seemed  to like it. It's large patty made from ground nuts, brown rice and seasonings,  topped with a grilled slice of onion and a thin slice of melted cheese. I found  it interesting and a bit on the heavy side, with a texture at once crunchy and  creamy. It does not taste remotely like the real thing.  </P> <P> Caren, meanwhile, busied herself with the lentil burrito, a savory mixture of  stewed, spiced lentil with guacamole, salsa and melted cheese on a whole-wheat  tortilla. I tasted it and it was delicious. I would happily forswear most meat  dishes in its place.  </P> <P> Although the Greenery is more subtle in its use of cheese than most vegetarian  restaurants, I noticed that, as at Rutabegorz, cheese was present on almost  every entree. Perhaps this is because the kitchens are trying to satisfy the  richer diets of non-vegetarians like me. But I, for one, could do without it.  </P> <P> Now, in fact, whenever I drop by these restaurants, I look for cheeseless  dishes. The Greenery has a few: eggplant quiche, light and custardy with a  thin, buttery crust on the bottom; Popeye salad -- fresh spinach, mushroom,  carrot, tomato, green onion and egg with a tangy lemon and honey dressing, and  steamed vegetables with brown rice. That last one is best; pinto beans are  cooked together with the rice, like a Cuban congri, and the vegetables are  fragrant with clear tastes.  </P> <P> The kitchen here is considerably more accomplished than the one at Rutabegorz.  Most of the dishes are delicate, and someone behind the stove has a real way  with combining flavors. As at Rutabegorz, there are tuna, chicken, and turkey  salads, but I didn't taste them. Sorry, Caren. Next time I want a protein-rich  meal, I'm going out for a steak.  </P> <P> Both restaurants are inexpensive, with few dishes over $5. Rutabegorz has beer  and wine; the Greenery does not.  </P> <P> RUTABEGORZ  </P> <P> 211 N.

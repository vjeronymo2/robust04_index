			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (6): Inflation won't savage modest starters - Investing For Income / And the golden rule, as with any investment, is to spread the risk INCOME IS the main reason why many people have investments. Either they have retired, and their pension is inadequate for their needs; or they are relying on their investments to meet some pressing commitment such as school fees. It is natural that many should put their money into building societies when they want income. The societies offer products that are easy to understand; they are accessible; they offer a guarantee of capital return; and they are universally perceived as safe. But if you expect to need income from your investments over a long period, building societies are a dangerous home for your savings. They provide no protection from that great enemy of investors - inflation. A retired widow, now with the state pension and a small pension from her late husband's employers, may feel reasonably well off with savings of Pounds 50,000: she could earn a gross income of as much as Pounds 7,000. But in 15 years, inflation compounded at 5 per cent annually would halve the real value of her building-society deposit. If interest rates also fell, then the same sum might provide an income of only Pounds 5,000 - worth just Pounds 2,500 in today's prices. To avoid the rigours of inflation, you have normally to sacrifice income now, in order to achieve capital growth, and thus, the prospect of a higher income in future. The sure way to protect yourself against inflation is to buy index-linked gilts or national savings certificates. But in the former case, the immediate income is only 2 per cent gross, and the latter pay no income at all. So if you do need to live off the income from your investments, only a small proportion of your portfolio can be placed in either of these vehicles. Equities have proved, over the long term, to be one of the best hedges against inflation; but, as James Higgins, of London-based fee-charging advisers Chamberlain de Broe, says: 'Not everyone can afford to wait until the yield on the average unit trust grows sufficiently so that it provides a reasonable income.' Mr Higgins has designed a scheme that will yield a high immediate income, but which also permits the investor to share in the fortunes of investment vehicles that are better longer-term achievers. 'Up to one third of the available sum is used to purchase a five-year temporary annuity, taking advantage of the high rates we presently enjoy,' he says. 'The balancing two-thirds will make up a five-year growth portfolio, utilising whatever allowances the investor has available, but including Tessas, personal equity plans (Peps), National Savings, zero-coupon investment trusts - and perhaps even an element of assured-tenancy Business Expansion Scheme, if the client's circumstances are appropriate.' The temporary annuity pays a very high rate, although of course it is only returning to the investor his own capital. But that means, as a consequence, that the investor will pay little income tax. By the time the annuity expires, Mr Higgins argues, the growth portfolio will have replaced the loss of the annuity capital and achieved some extra gain on top. However, there are many ways to achieve income from investments. The most common are described below. The golden rule, as with any other form of investment, is to spread your risk. Do not rely entirely on anything, whether it is a fixed-income or an equities-based instrument. High-yielding unit trusts offer capital growth, too UNIT TRUSTS may not seem the most obvious source of investment income, because yields, currently around 6 per cent gross, compare badly with the returns from building societies. The key, of course, is the fact that income on an equity-based investment can grow. Figures from Fund Research show that dividends in the equity income sector grew by 111 per cent between 1985 and 1990, compared with an 89 per cent rise in the income offered by the FT-A All-Share Index over the same period. Dividends are normally paid twice a year, and a judicious selection of funds with different payment dates can ensure that some kind of dividend cheque arrives every month. There are around 130 unit trusts in the UK equity income sector. At the same time, the capital value of the investment will grow over the long term - something that will not happen with a building society deposit. The average UK equity income unit trust grew by 440.8 per cent in the 10 years to March 1, according to Finstat, although that figure does include reinvested income. In capital terms, the increase has been somewhere around 250 to 300 per cent. The risk, of course, is that in much shorter periods, the value of the trust could go down. So high-yielding unit trusts should never make up all the income-seeking investor's portfolio. Guaranteed income bonds carry a tax snag GUARANTEED income bonds tend to be issued by insurance companies, and offer a fixed return over a set period of years, normally somewhere between one and five. Rates vary, depending on the life of the bond and the amount being invested, but at the time of writing were between 9.5 and 10 per cent. The return that GIBs pay is net of basic-rate tax, which cannot be reclaimed, so they are not suitable for non-taxpayers. The best time to buy them is when interest rates are at their peak, so that investors can lock in to the high rates on offer. Many companies offering bonds are quite small - but investors are protected in case of failure by the Policyholders Protection Act, which guarantees to pay out 90 per cent of the first Pounds 100,000 invested. No CGT on gilts - and the issuer won't go bust GILTS, which are bonds issued by the UK government, are an obvious choice for any income investor's portfolio. They provide a healthy yield - between 10 and 11 per cent at the time of writing  - and any profit is free of capital gains tax. In addition, the issuer will never go bust. There are two yields normally quoted for gilts. The running yield, calculated by dividing the trading price by the interest rate or coupon, is the best indicator of the short-term return you will receive. The gross redemption yield takes account of the fact that gilts will eventually be repaid (redeemed) so investors will make a capital gain or loss, depending on whether the bond is trading above or below the offer price. This is important if you intend to hold the bond until redemption. Gilts have different repayment dates, and there are some issues that will never be repaid at all. Buying a long-dated issue brings certainty of return over a long period; but it also means the investor is highly prey to that great enemy of gilts - inflation. Long-dated gilt prices can also vary substantially, so there is a risk that the value of your holding can go down in the short term. The cheapest way of buying gilts is through the National Savings Stock Register, via the local post office. You can also buy a gilt or bond unit trust, which will attempt to provide you with a good income by managing a portfolio of securities. You can take the interest from your Tessa account ALTHOUGH tax-exempt special savings accounts (Tessas) are desined to be held for five years, it is possible to use them to provide income. Investors can withdraw interest from the account without penalty, although they can only receive the net (after-tax) rate. However, the tax advantages do not disappear. At the end of the five-year period, the investor will receive the 'tax' element of his interest in the form of a bonus. If you plan to hold a large sum of money in the building society anyway, there is no harm in holding as large as possible a proportion of it (Pounds 3,000 in the first year, Pounds 9,000 over five years in a Tessa). Your income will be the same, and you will qualify for a tax bonus on top. Annuities offer most to long-livers and over-70s AN ANNUITY is an odd sort of investment, in that it is really a gamble on how long you will live. You invest a lump-sum, and an insurance company guarantees to pay you an income for the rest of your life. But when you die, the insurance company, in most cases, keeps your investment. Thus the longer you live, the better you do. Insurance companies know this, so they vary the rates they are prepared to guarantee, depending on the life of the buyer. The older you are, the greater the income the annuity will pay. For these reasons, the Consumers' Association argues that it is probably only worth considering buying an annuity if you are over 70. (There are also joint-life annuities which carry on paying out until both husband and wife are dead). The most common type of annuity gives a fixed income, which obviously leaves the investor at risk from inflation. But it is possible to buy an increasing, or even an index-linked annuity, where the income steadily rises, though it starts from a lower base. Unit-linked annuities give a return based on the value of a particular fund, and thus can vary in value. There are also temporary annuities, which have a limited lifespan and pay a high income - but you lose all your capital when the annuity expires. A lot of people are forced into buying annuities as part of their pension plan. If you fall into this category, then it may well be sensible to diversify the rest of your portfolio by buying more flexible income-producing instruments. However, see above for the use of temporary annuities, as part of an overall portfolio. Cash funds for high yields and low charges CASH unit trusts invest in money-market instruments - deposits, Treasury bills, commercial paper and the like - with the aim of offering unitholders a high yield. A number of such trusts have been established over the past couple of years. Investors had been discouraged by the poor performance of equities, and this created an incentive for fund-management companies to offer a product that was certain not to go down in price. The managers also realised that, by persuading investors to switch into the cash fund during a bear market, they would keep funds within the group, rather than lose them altogether. The trusts usually have a nil, or very low, upfront charge and a high yield. At the time of writing, Fidelity's cash unit trust was offering a yield of 13.7 per cent, assuming income reinvested. Equities in a Pep mean tax-free dividends EQUITIES are a time-honoured means of achieving a growing income. They represent a risk - the capital value of the shares can fall and dividends can be cut, as many investors have been reminded in recent months. In the long term, however, a diversified portfolio of shares is one of the best ways to ensure your income keeps pace with inflation. And if you are going to own shares for a long period, there is a strong argument for holding them in a personal equity plan. For a 40 per cent taxpayer, the fact that dividend income in a Pep is tax-free is highly attractive. In the short term, the fees charged by the plan manager may outweigh the tax benefits. But over the long term, say five years or more, the income tax advantages are substantial - there is much to be said for holding high-yielding shares within your Pep. Of course, the capital gains tax exemption is an added bonus.</p>

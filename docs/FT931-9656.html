			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Management: Investors export US zeal US institutional investors, out of whose bottle the genie of corporate governance first crept, are exporting their activism abroad. According to a study* published yesterday by the Boston-based Institutional Responsibility Research Centre, US shareholders have nearly doubled the number of ballots they are casting at overseas corporate meetings. In 1992, US institutions exercised their vote on 40 per cent of their non-US stock, up from 24 per cent the year before. UK institutions fare badly by contrast. The National Association of Pension Funds in 1991 found that fewer than 20 per cent of British institutions voted on share resolutions for stocks in their home market, though the NAPF says such apathy may be changing. American investors are increasingly taking as hostile a stance abroad as in the US, where they have toppled senior management at IBM, American Express and General Motors. Board positions were opposed in 7.8 per cent of cases in 1992, up from 3.5 per cent in 1991, the survey found. 'With more than Dollars 250bn (Pounds 166bn) worth of international stock at stake, US shareholders are saying they can't afford to ignore the hazards of different corporate governance practices abroad,' said Stephen Davis, director of IRRC's Global Shareholder Service. However, the study finds that non-American corporations are fighting back against institutional activism. Many German corporations appear to be deleting shareholder proposals from proxy materials and ballots sent to US investors, while most US investor votes cast at annual meetings of UK, Australian and Canadian annual meetings are never counted. *Full results in: Global Voting: Shareholder Decisions 1991-92, available from Investor Responsibility Research Centre, 1755 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington DC 20036.

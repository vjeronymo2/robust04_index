			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FEC TO TAKE NO ACTION IN BAKER CASE  </P> <P> The Federal Election Commission will take no action against former Orange  County congressional candidate C. David Baker for accepting an illegal campaign  contribution from his aunt because Baker acted immediately to return the  donation, an FEC spokesman said Wednesday.  </P> <P> "Due to the circumstances, the general counsel recommended and the commission  accepted the recommendation that they take no further action and just close the  file," spokesman Scott Moxley said.  </P> <P> The commission reached the unanimous decision during a meeting on Aug. 28,  Moxley said.  </P> <P> Baker was defeated in the 1988 Republican primary by C. Christopher Cox, who  went on to win in the 40th Congressional District. The seat previously had been  occupied by Robert E. Badham (R-Newport Beach), who did not seek reelection.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Placed on Probation  </P> <P> In an unrelated incident, Baker subsequently pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor  charge in connection with his forgery of a signature on a $48,000 check during  the closing days of the campaign. He was placed on probation and ordered to  perform 600 hours of community service.  </P> <P> Baker had told the FEC that he regarded the $11,000 payment from his aunt for  radio air time as a loan that was not subject to the $1,000 federal limit on  campaign contributions.  </P> <P> But, Moxley said, "Anything of value is a contribution subject to the same  limit" as cash.  </P> <P> The FEC spokesman said the agency's general counsel advised against taking  further action because Baker acted to return the money as soon as he was told  that its acceptance would violate federal election law.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FREEWHEELING TOUR TAKES VISITORS PAST D. C.'S SCANDAL SPOTS  </P> <P> The bus tour begins on a patriotic note with a taped rendition of "Yankee  Doodle Dandy," "Over There" and other high-spirited songs.  </P> <P> A George Bush look-alike strolled to the front of the bus as it rolled down  Connecticut Avenue. The "President" (in the person of actor Ed Henley) asked  passengers to put their hands over their hearts and repeat after him:  </P> <P> "I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States and to the Republicans  for which it stands. . . ."  </P> <P> Henley held up a copy of the Washington Post with its bold headlines on the  latest development in the Mayor Marion Barry matter and whooped:  </P> <P> "Welcome to the Scandal Tour!"  </P> <P> The streets of Washington are always jammed with buses. Some carry  schoolchildren on field trips, some are filled with tour groups from around the  nation and others are full of foreign visitors, who hear about our history in  dozens of languages.  </P> <P> Since Aug. 27, 1988, another sort of bus has been rolling past the famous  buildings and monuments. For $30 a person, this bus offers an irreverent and  light-heartedly different tour of Washington -- the seamy, scurrilous, even  silly side of the capital of the free world.  </P> <P> It's a theater-on-wheels, and it takes the stage -- or, rather, the bus -- six  times a week here.  </P> <P> "That's where Mayor Barry was busted in room 727," said tour guide Henley as  the bus passed the Vista Hotel. "So much scandal happens in this city, we have  to constantly update our itinerary."  </P> <P> In its 11-mile romp through the heart of D.C., the bus troupe may satirize any  of 120 different scandals that are brewing or have brewed in the shadows of the  monuments.  </P> <P> As the bus passes the Soviet Embassy, Henley, as President Bush, announced:  "OK. Ready. Everybody shout together as loud as you can: We won the Cold War!  We won the Cold War!"  </P> <P> At the White House, there is a brief report on Warren Harding's escapades with  a mistress in a cloak closet. Around the corner, across from the Old Executive  Office Building, Fawn Hall (actress Shari Elliker) pointed out the window and  said: "Over there is Shred Center."  </P> <P> At another corner, the voice of Oliver North was heard testifying at the  Iran-Contra hearings over the strains of the "Marine Hymn."  </P> <P> The bus passed the Watergate complex where the bungled 1972 burglary of  Democratic campaign headquarters led to Richard Nixon's resignation two years  later. As President Nixon, actor John Simmons paced the aisle of the bus,  giving his famous victory signs and muttering:  </P> <P> "I was appalled at the senseless illegal activities. I am the President. I will  always be the President."  </P> <P> Throughout the tour, a half-dozen actors and actresses change costume in the  restroom at the rear of the bus. Each takes on the character of someone caught  up in a political scandal.  </P> <P> As the bus passed the 1852 red sandstone Norman Castle, the first Smithsonian  building, Henley talked about one of the District of Columbia's greatest  benefactors -- James Smithson, "the bastard son of the first Duke of  Northumberland."  </P> <P> "So incensed was the English scientist over his illegitimate birth that when he  died in 1829, he left his substantial fortune to America instead of Great  Britain to establish the famous institution named in his honor," related  Henley.  </P> <P> As the bus rounded the Tidal Basin, Henley asked, "Remember when Rep. Wilbur  Mills was stopped by police for drunk driving and his girlfriend stripper Fanne  Foxe, the 'Argentine Bombshell' flew out of the car's passenger door and  plunged into the Tidal Basin?"  </P> <P> At the halfway point, the tour bus stops and discharges its passengers to the  sidewalk outside a three-story brownstone townhouse in tony Georgetown.  </P> <P> This is where, some say, presidential candidate Gary Hart's hopes were dashed  when Donna Rice was discovered exiting the back door.  </P> <P> Back on the bus, actor Simmons as Ronald Reagan pointed out HUD headquarters,  vehemently denying the initials stand for "hundreds of unethical developers."  </P> <P> As the charming Jacqueline Bird Roosevelt, "head of the School of First  Ladies," actress Marianne Curan dished some dirt surrounding the man whose name  is on the Washington Monument:  </P> <P> "He did wear wooden teeth, you know. Martha frequently had splinters in her  lips. They raised two children by Martha's previous marriage. The father of our  country was sterile, unable to produce children of his own."  </P> <P> Actor Henley held up a copy of Life magazine with Barbara Bush's picture on the  cover and "revealed" that the First Lady gave Dan Quayle one of Millie's  puppies. "He named the puppy Checkers," Henley said jokingly.  </P> <P> Rick London, 35, came up with the idea for the Scandal Tour. "My relatives were  always coming to town asking me to take them to Gary Hart's apartment and to  Watergate.  </P> <P> "I was working with John Simmons, who has been performing with the Gross  National Product (acting company) and doing satires on Washington politics in  Georgetown for the past 10 years. I suggested we put together the bus tour,"  said London, who has hired GNP actors and actresses to portray the characters  on the Scandal Tour.  </P> <P> During its first full year in business, about 3,000 people took the Scandal  Tour, producing gross sales of $80,000. Since last August, 6,000 more have come  along for the ride.  </P> <P> Sales so far this year have totalled $168,000, the tour's operators said. The  original $20 fare has been raised to $30 to reflect rising costs, said London.  </P> <P> While most of the weekday Scandal Tours are chartered by groups, weekend tours  continue to be filled by capital tourists traveling on their own.  </P> <P> "The nation's capital is the original theme park. All the buildings are in  place," said London. "We sent President and Mrs. Bush gift certificates. But  they haven't used them yet."  </P></p>

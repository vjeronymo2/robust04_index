			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Cookson/JM Merger talks between Cookson and Johnson Matthey may have broken down because the two sides could not agree on valuation. But the failure would seem to confirm that there was little industrial logic in a combination. Had there been, it would have been easier for one or other to give a little ground on valuation. Instead, talks became bogged down as each side fought for slightly greater shares of the merged company than implied by their respective market capitalisations. The main driving forces behind the merger talks were the ambitions of Mr Richard Oster, Cookson's chief executive, and Mr David Davies, JM's chairman, to run larger companies. Just because this deal has failed, those ambitions are unlikely to have faded.</p>

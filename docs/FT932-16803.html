			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Daimler, Hoechst take a tumble in the post-bourse CORPORATE stories moved a number of bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT ended the official week virtually unchanged with the DAX index 9.83 lower on the day at 1,661.75 in turnover up from DM4.6bn to DM4.8bn. But after hours, things happened. First, Hoechst confirmed a police report that a gas cloud consisting of a form of sulphuric acid was released in an accident shortly before 1300 GMT; and that it was heading south from the Hoechst plant on the outskirts of Frankfurt. There was an all-clear later but Hoechst, accident-prone lately and now the least attractive of the big three chemicals in terms of dividend yield, was DM3.80 down at DM247.80 after hours, as BASF eased 50 pfg to DM237.60 and Bayer rose DM1.20 to DM276.70. Next, Daimler moved the merger with Mercedes AG which was the subject of speculation a week ago. Mercedes, DM3 lower at DM490.50 at the close, owns 25.2 per cent of Daimler, which closed DM7 lower yesterday at DM610.50, on a share-for-share basis. The deal should ease Daimler's problems with rights issue pricing, save it tax on dividends next year and, said Mr Hans Peter Wodniok of James Capel in Frankfurt, help in the provision of shares required for the Daimler listing in New York. However, as Mercedes ended Ibis late trading at DM575, DM84.50 up from its bourse close, Daimler wavered between DM490 and DM500. PARIS fell on position-squaring, the CAC-40 index ending 15.07 lower at 1,990.82, 1.7 per cent down on the week in turnover of FFr2.95bn. CarnaudMetalBox, the packaging group, fell FFr9, or 4.2 per cent to FFr208 after suspension, and the announcement that a 25.3 per cent stake owned by MB Caradon had been successfully placed with CGIP, Parfinance, and SG Warburg. Peugeot Citroen lost FFr10, ending at FFr564 in 95,000 shares on the 9 per cent drop in French car registrations in March. Registrations of Peugeot cars declined by 10.9 per cent. The glass and building materials group, Saint Gobain, continued to lose ground. After its 6.6 per cent drop on Thursday, the stock fell another FFr8, or 1.6 per cent lower at FFr490 on the chairman's pessimistic view of prospects. AMSTERDAM ended mixed with the CBS Tendency index unchanged on the day, and little changed on the week at 106.8. Nutricia, the baby foods maker, rose Fl 2.20 to Fl 131,50 amid rumours that it was a takeover target, although the company said it knew of no attempted bid. The rumours began after Unigate, which has a 27.8 per cent stake, told the Financial Times that changes in the relationship between the two companies were possible. Aegon was marked Fl 1.50 lower to Fl 85.90 in response to Thursday's results. Fokker eased 10 cents to Fl 13.30 ahead of its announcement after the bourse closed of a 74 per cent drop in 1992 profits. ZURICH's SMI index edged 1.9 higher to 2,190.3, matching the all-time high recorded on Wednesday, for a 1.4 per cent rise on the week. CS Holding continued its advance, adding SFr30 to SFr2,380, supported by buy recommendations from several London brokers. Bearers in Von Roll fell SFr80 or 10.9 per cent to SFr650, after the steelmaker warning on Thursday that it expected a loss for the current year. MILAN was broadly weaker with the the lira's fall to record lows against the D-mark only adding to political uncertainty. The Comit index eased 4.29 to 475.44, for a weekly fall of 2.3 per cent. Fiat pulled other shares down, fixing L175 or 3 per cent lower at L5,651 before picking up to L5,690 after hours. Companies controlled by Mr Salvatore Ligresti moved against the trend after newspaper reports that a restructuring plan was being considered. Premafin rose L290 or 6.2 per cent to settle at L4,920 before L4,975 on the kerb. MADRID's general index closed 2.01 lower at 237.65, 0.4 per cent down on the week. The two main features were a 3.3 per cent fall to Pta1,300 in Acesa, the most liquid of the four Spanish motorway operators, and a 1.4 per cent decline to Pta3,770 in Tabacalera. Acesa dropped on rights issue rumours although, according to Mr Christopher Cooper at James Capel, the prospect is already built into the rating. Tabacalera reacted to the threat of an international price war in cigarettes following the news on pricing from Philip Morris in the US. ISTANBUL continued its advance, adding 236.15 or 3.9 per cent to an all-time-high of 6,307.01, for a weekly rise of 11.5 per cent.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- April 2                                             THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes            Open        10.30       11.00       12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1139.32     1140.42     1140.55     1140.46 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1216.54     1221.56     1219.54     1220.07  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00       14.00       15.00       Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1141.52     1142.27     1142.41     1140.36 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1221.03     1221.13     1218.42     1215.52  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Apr 1     Mar 31    Mar 30    Mar 29    Mar 26  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1144.81   1149.13   1152.62   1148.76   1147.31 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1219.86   1220.16   1219.87   1213.37   1213.80  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 -  1144.00 ; 200 -  1222.11 Low/day: 100 -  1139.07  200 -  1215.27 .  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

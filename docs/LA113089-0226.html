			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GENERAL MILLS, NESTLE PLAN CEREAL JOINT VENTURE  </P> <P> General Mills and Nestle S.A. said today they will start up a joint venture to  market breakfast cereals.  </P> <P> Under the letter of intent, the two food companies will star "Cereal Partners  Worldwide" in Europe, then take the cereals around the world, except the United  States and Canada. The companies will share equally in the ownership of and  investment in the new joint venture, which will have its headquarters in  Europe.  </P> <P> In a joint statement, Bruce Atwater, chairman and chief executive officer of  General Mills, and Helmut Maucher, managing director of Nestle, said  ready-to-eat cereal is one of the most attractive and fastest-growing major  food categories in the world. Consumer demand is growing in response to  increased interest in foods that emphasize health, nutrition, convenience and  value, they said.  </P> <P> "Through a strategic alliance that combines the cereal expertise and technology  of General Mills with the local marketing expertise and sales distribution  systems of Nestle, we believe we can accomplish collectively that which would  be much more difficult to accomplish individually: to become a major  competitive force in the development of worldwide breakfast cereal markets  within the next decade," they said.  </P> <P> "This is intended to be a well-defined and longstanding successful  relationship."  </P></p>

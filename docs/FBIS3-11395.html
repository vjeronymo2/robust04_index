			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Havana, 14 Mar (PL) -- Today TRABAJADORES, the Cuban  labor unions' mouthpiece, called for associations among Cuban  enterprises and not only with foreign capital.    In its Monday editorial, the newspaper indicates that "there  is often a trend to seek solutions to the idle (industrial)  facilities based only on deals with foreign capital, which are  important but do not constitute the only way out."    The publication points out that "it is necessary to use all  association possibilities among Cuban enterprises -- a sort of  `South to South cooperation' -- on a local scale."    It later says: "There are businessmen who prefer to bring  anything from abroad, using such arguments as quality,  timeliness, and efficiency."    It goes on by saying: "This, which could be justified in  some  cases, in others implies, and we know it, an inadmissible  resurgence of taking the easy way out, narrow vision, and an  inability to see the country's problems in a comprehensive  manner."    TRABAJADORES believes that "there is actually a coherent  policy designed to reorganize and reestablish the national  economy but that all the economic sectors will not come out of  the serious crisis Cuba currently faces at the same time or in  the same way."    TRABAJADORES reiterates: "It is necessary to motivate the  strategic sectors that generate foreign currency, manufacture  substitutes for things that are imported, ensure the supply of  food, and those sectors that have the greatest chance to recover  and thrive."    However, the publication points out that "the principle of  the struggle we are waging should not be based on the idea of  `every man for himself' or `let us save a lucky few in some  sectors.'"    TRABAJADORES underscores that "our philosophy, which is just  and realistic, is that of saving all and viewing the country and  the people as one entity."</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It should be stated at this juncture that the proposed rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes a procedure whereby the Commission may grant a waiver from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> full compliance with the rule's requirements, if a group of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carriers applies for and justifies such relief. A waiver could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply to any part of the rule, including the requirement that data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be reported by individual country sub-trades. For example, an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement might be permitted to report by a multi-country region  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rather than by individual countries, if it could show that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> major moving commodities moving into or out of a particular group  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of countries did not vary much country by country, and so regional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data would provide a reasonably accurate and complete description  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the trades with those countries. The waiver procedure could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also be used to allow conferences made up of relatively small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carriers serving a relatively small trade to submit post-implementation monitoring reports at wider intervals (for example,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> once a year). The waiver provisions specifically state that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission will take into account the presence or absence of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shipper complaints in considering an application for a waiver.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. ``Class A'' Agreements Under the Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> information form <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for a ``Class A'' agreement begins by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring a listing of all effective agreements covering all or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part of the geographic scope of the proposed agreement, whose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parties include one or more of the parties to the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement. This provision is designed to ensure that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission has accurate information regarding the recent trend  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toward networks of agreements connected by common parties. Next,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the form requires an identification of all ``Class A/B'' activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the agreement seeks to authorize.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After obtaining the market share data discussed above, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information form then inquires into the recent agreement-wide cargo  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carryings and revenue results of each of the carriers that would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> now join together into the agreement. Otherwise, the information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> form focuses primarily on the state of affairs in each of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement's sub-trades before the agreement was filed. This is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> done by reference to the major commodities moving to and from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> United States in each sub-trade.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Using the actual commodities moving under an agreement as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chief frame of regulatory reference is an important feature of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule, and represents a significant departure from current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practice. At present, the information obtained by the Commission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on carrier rate and service practices via the monitoring reports  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted for certain major agreements does not describe the cargo  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being transported, and is stated in the aggregate (for example,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total number of service contracts executed) or as broad averages  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (for example, average revenue per TEU of all cargoes). In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contrast, the proposed information form, while continuing to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require the submission of aggregate data in certain areas, mainly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires carriers to identify the commodities that have made up the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bulk of their cargo in each sub-trade and then to submit data on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the price and service practices they have applied to each of those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commodities. With this information in hand, the Commission will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have a reasonably comprehensive summary of pre-agreement rate and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service practices in each sub-trade covered by the new agreement,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as well as in the agreement's entire geographic scope. If the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement is permitted to go into effect, that summary will serve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a baseline for analyzing the corresponding information later  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtained through the post-implementation reports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In sum, the proposed rule both changes the orientation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement review to that of the cargo being affected, and also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calls for more refined and differentiated data from the carriers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These reforms should provide the Commission with improved and more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> useful indicators of the potential or actual impact of an agreement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the needs of shippers for good service at reasonable rates, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in particular whether the agreement might cause or has caused  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unfair or unreasonable conditions for specific commodities, classes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of shippers, or geographic areas. It should be noted that, while  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed rule is constructed around the major moving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commodities in each sub-trade, nothing prevents the Commission from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taking appropriate action if it receives information that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement is harming the fair and reasonable transportation of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relatively minor commodity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

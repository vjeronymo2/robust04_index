			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 12 Apr (MENA)--Israeli Deputy Chief of Staff  General Amnon Shahaq has described the session of talks with the  Palestinian side that ended in Cairo today as "good."    In a news conference today, Shahaq said several topics were  discussed in this session, including security matters upon which  an agreement is now very close. He noted that some issues  within the framework of the Security Committee have not yet been  resolved, saying: We will resume the negotiations in Cairo next  week to continue discussing these issues.    Shahaq, head of the Israeli delegation to the negotiations  with the Palestinians, said agreement was reached with the  Palestinian side to postpone some issues until after signing the  executive agreement on Gaza and Jericho on the condition that  negotiations on these points will be resumed after the signing.    On issues that are still under discussion between the two  sides, he said issues concerning the Palestinian legal  jurisdiction in civil affairs, as well as other matters, have  not yet been discussed. He affirmed that agreement on security  corridors and water will be reached before signing the accord  and that the antiquities question has actually been resolved.    As for taxes, he said: We are waiting for an agreement to be  reached by the economic committee, currently in session in  Paris. Agreement is expected to be reached on fiscal  jurisdiction before signing the accord.    He explained that there will not be more than five or six  issues that will be deferred until an accord is signed; most of  them are civil affairs and some may be related to civil affairs  that are linked to security aspects.    He said that agreement was also reached on the size of the  Palestinian police force, the total number of which will be  9,000; 2,000 from inside Gaza and Jericho and 7,000 from abroad.    He added that 6,000 of the Palestinian policemen who will  come from abroad will enter Gaza and Jericho directly after the  signing of the "executive agreement" and the other 1,000 will  enter three months after the agreement is signed.    As for the security measures inside Gaza and Jericho, he  said, we are very close to reaching an agreement on them. He  expressed hope that the negotiations will be completed within a  few weeks; otherwise, they will encounter difficulties, as has  been happening since the start of the talks.    Commenting on the Palestinian detainees, Shahaq said the  Israeli side explained to the Palestinians everything about the  detainees who will be released, to what factions they belong,  and when the release will take place. He added: We will not  allow the release of detainees from the Hamas movement, because  they are against peace and their leaders and representatives in  Amman had announced their responsibility for the recent 'Afula  incident in northern Israel. He went on: Also, those who have  carried out operations after 13 September, the date when the  Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles was signed, and  those responsible for operations in which Israelis were killed  will not be released. He noted that this issue will not be  discussed further.    Concluding his news conference, Shahaq said: The  negotiations were hindered in the past not because of us but  because of many other reasons and we have to complete the  negotiations as quickly as possible.</p>

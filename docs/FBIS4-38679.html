			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, May 31, BNS -- Nordic countries, the  United States and Canada are to give the Baltics and Belarus 1.5  million dollars to support their efforts in resolving the issue  of refugees and prevention of illegal immigration, said Juri  Ruus, deputy chancellor of the Estonian Interior Ministry.    Ruus was quoting the head of the Nordic mission of the  International Migration Organization, Oystein Optal, who had  announced the assistance package at a meeting on refugee issues  at the Estonian Interior Ministry today.    The 1.5 million dollar program includes assistance to  Russian-speakers in the Baltics who want to re-emigrate to  Russia, but also for those who want to move to Latin America or  other regions, Ruus explained. The first 0.5-million tranche of  the aid line is to be made available for the Baltics and Belarus  from July 1, Ruus said.    The U.N. Refugee Commission's new representative to the  Nordic region and the Baltics, Hans Thoolen, is expected to  arrive in Estonia for an acquaintance mission on June 20.    Ruus said his department's data shows there are currently  about 180 illegal immigrants in Estonia.</p>

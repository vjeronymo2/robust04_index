			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Marketmakers face penalties The London Stock Exchange has decided to penalise marketmakers that fail to fix opening prices on time for shares trading on its SEAQ system. The system acts as an electronic bulletin board for share prices. The fines, which will operate in a manner similar to those in effect for the trading of international securities, could end in a fine of up to Pounds 25,000 and/or deregistration as a marketmaker in the relevant security. Marketmakers are securities firms which agree to make firm offers to buy or sell large lots of securities. Because they commit their own capital to promote share liquidity, they have certain privileges, including the right to borrow stock and to sell stock short. These privileges are considered essential for securities firms wishing to trade on their own account and for those wishing to create derivative instruments for clients. The stock exchange said that marketmakers issue firm quotes to customers on time '99 per cent of the time'. From December 1 quotes not posted within five minutes of the mandatory quote period will bring a Pounds 10 fine per security per day. If the same firm is fined twice in any three-month period, the second offence will carry a Pounds 25 fine. If in any six-month period the same marketmaker offends for a third time, summary disciplinary procedures will be invoked.</p>

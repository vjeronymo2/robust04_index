			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Costliest jadeite jewellery The Mdivani jadeite necklace remained the costliest piece of jadeite jewellery ever sold at auction when it realised HKDollars 33m (Pounds 2.6m) at Christie's Swire in Hong Kong yesterday. The 27 brilliant green beads are of exceptional size and purity, and are believed to have been cut from the finest gem ever found. Fashioned into a necklace by Cartier for Ms Barbara Hutton, the Woolworth heiress and valued by Cartier at Dollars 500,000 in the 1930s, the necklace was sold from the estate of the Princess Nina Mdivani at Christie's Geneva in 1988. Yesterday it was sold by a South-East Asian collector to Mr Sammy Chow of the Hong Kong jewellers Trio Pearls.</p>

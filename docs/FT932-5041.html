			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Motoring: Mercedes jazzes up its act LIKE AN ageing entertainer in search of a new audience, Mercedes-Benz is changing its act. For at least 50 years, its cars have been a byword for quality. I would settle for one as my personal car in preference to any other - if only I could afford to. The company's solid conservatism is rooted in the best engineering practice. Mercedes shrug off very high mileages while continuing to perform like new cars. There is a strong 'feel good' factor when you drive behind the three-pointed star. At least, there is for me. Bernard Shaw hit the nail on the head when he said that youth was a wonderful thing and far too good to be wasted on young people, but let that pass. Car makers have to live in the real world. While Mercedes-Benz is happy to have a large and loyal band of mature customers it knows it must attract younger buyers, not just their parents and employers. The car it hopes will do the trick is the new C-Class, successor to the small - the term is relative - Mercedes-Benz 190 of which more than 2m have been sold in the last ten years. C-Class is a little longer than the 190, considerably roomier within and sleeker without. For at least two years it will be offered only as a 4-door saloon, though an educated guess suggests estate cars and 2-door coupes will follow by 1996. There are seven four-valves-per-cylinder engines. Three of the petrol engines (1.8, 2.0 and 2.2-litre) and two diesels (2.0 and 2.1 litre) have four cylinders. There is a 2.5-litre, five-cylinder diesel and the flagship C-Class models have a 2.8-litre in-line six-cylinder petrol engine. Mercedes-Benz contemplated following the herd and giving its new compact car front wheel drive. But it decided the space-saving advantages were not great enough to justify this break with tradition. When, as seems probable, it launches a VW Golf-sized car later in the decade, this will be front-wheel driven. There is nothing radical about the design of the C-Class; it is an extension of the philosophy that has served Mercedes-Benz so well. True, the front suspension is new and the 16-valve and 20-valve diesels are the first of their kind. The important changes are marketing, not engineering, led. The styling is smoother, more rounded and, except from the front, less typically Mercedes-Benz. In a bid to broaden the customer base, four distinct versions of every C-Class car are being offered; standard, Esprit, Elegance and Sport. Standard models have plain, understated interiors. I found the two-tone trim of some Esprit and Sport models rather brash but Mercedes-Benz believes young buyers will approve. The smartest Elegance versions will appeal to owners of the larger 200-320 Mercedes-Benz (now to be called E-Class) wishing to trade down to a smaller car. Even the standard models come with a driver airbag, ABS brakes and power steering. Last week, in the sweltering Swabian Alps, I sampled four of the new cars - a C 180 petrol and C 220 diesel with five-speed manual gears, a C 250 diesel and C 280 with the optional four-speed automatic. The billiard-table roads were no test of the suspension's ability to make the rough feel smooth. But their sharp gradients and serpentine curves showed handling and roadholding to be even better than the 190's  - particularly so in the case of the nose-heavy five-cylinder diesel and six-cylinder petrol versions. The C 180 ran sweetly at 190 kmh (118 mph) on the autobahn, pulled hard in fifth gear from under 50 kmh (31 mph) and seemed to enjoy hard driving on switchback roads as much as I did. Lacking turbochargers, the four-valve diesels felt urbane rather than urgent though they cruised at high speed on the autobahn as quietly and effortlessly as the petrol-engined cars. (I have to say that for sheer performance combined with refinement, the six-cylinder BMW 325td and 525td are ahead of the executive-class diesel pack). The C 280 automatic felt as secure as a majestic Mercedes-Benz S-Class when I drove it through a downpour on the autobahn. A ride in the back confirmed the C-Class really is more rear-passenger friendly than the 190. When left-hand drive C-Class cars go on sale in two weeks, they will cost about the same as the 190s they replace. Right-hand drive prices will not be known until the British launch this autumn. Mercedes-Benz UK will be juggling with a strong D-mark in one hand and next year's list price-based company car tax bands in the other. It knows that if the C-Class is to seduce younger drivers away from their BMWs and Audis, the prices cannot be too far out of line.</p>

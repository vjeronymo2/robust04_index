			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUAKE TOLL RISES; U.S. MARINE KILLED IN CRASH;  </P> <P> PHILIPPINES: THE NUMBER OF DEAD RELATED TO MONDAY'S TEMBLOR CLIMBS TO 659.  SURVIVORS PLEAD FOR FOOD AND OTHER RELIEF AID.  </P> <P> The death toll from Monday's earthquake soared to 659, including a U.S. Marine  pilot surveying quake damage who was killed Friday when his small observation  plane crashed into a wooded mountain outside the devastated city of Baguio.  </P> <P> Another Marine was hurt in the crash, bringing the latest official figures for  quake-related injuries to more than 1,300.  </P> <P> The Marines' OV-10 observation plane crashed about 3 miles southwest of Baguio  while surveying what appears to be a broad swath of destruction caused by the  quake and more than 384 recorded aftershocks.  </P> <P> Reports reaching Manila indicated huge landslides had damaged scores of  isolated villages in Luzon's northern mountains and had stranded or crushed  hundreds of cars, trucks and buses on rural roads. At one place, villagers have  chalked the message "We need food!" in a courtyard.  </P> <P> "We've got an undetermined number of stranded and dead people out there," said  Mike Gomez, spokesman for the Department of Health.  </P> <P> Although rescue teams continued to burrow through the rubble of the Hyatt  Terraces hotel in Baguio, a U.S. team of 21 earthquake experts left the city,  where there were at least 224 confirmed dead, and headed for Agoo in the  neighboring province of La Union. Agoo's city hall, public market and a church  reportedly collapsed.  </P> <P> "At this point, it's their belief there aren't any survivors left in Baguio,"  U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager said.  </P> <P> Six Air Force C-130 cargo planes ferried food and relief supplies to Baguio and  brought out about 400 U.S. citizens and other foreigners. Roads to the city  remain blocked.  </P> <P> "We've had some reports of measles and typhoid breaking out in some smaller  villages," Schrager said. But Gomez, the Health Department spokesman, said no  epidemics had been confirmed, despite daily torrential downpours and poor water  supplies.  </P> <P> "What we do have a problem with is tents, blankets and surgical implements,"  Gomez said. "Everyone is still outside."  </P> <P> U.S. officials withheld the name of the dead Marine pilot until his family  could be notified. The injured Marine was taken to a hospital at Camp John Hay  in Baguio. They had taken off from the U.S. naval base at Subic Bay.  </P> <P> At least one other American was killed in the quake. Richard Finley of  Washington, D.C., who was here under contract for the U.S. Agency for  International Development, was killed when Baguio's Nevada Hotel collapsed. At  least one Filipino employee of the AID also is missing.  </P> <P> A Philippine woman married to an American was also killed, but U.S. Embassy  officials said it was not clear whether she was a U.S. citizen. Her name was  not made public.  </P> <P> The U.S. relief operation, led by more than 250 doctors, engineers and others  from Subic Bay and Clark Air Base, began within hours after the quake and has  overshadowed criticism that the government's effort has been slow and often  disorganized.  </P> <P> President Corazon Aquino must approve all foreign disaster aid coming into the  country, and diplomats complained Friday that customs officials have held up  emergency communications equipment and other relief supplies pending her  approval.  </P> <P> Newspapers and radio commentators questioned whether the American rescue effort  would affect talks next month on the future of six U.S. military bases, an  emotional issue that colors virtually every public debate here.  </P> <P> One Manila radio station led its noon newscast with a report that Foreign  Secretary Raul Manglapus and U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt had insisted there  were "no strings attached" to the earthquake aid.  </P> <P> "It's obviously going to have an effect" on the bases talks, a U.S. official  said in frustration. "The problem is that every time they get in trouble, they  call us."  </P> <P> He said there were "a lot of parallels" to last December's attempted coup, when  U.S. jets helped save Aquino's government by pinning down rebel forces. Two  months later, Aquino snubbed visiting Defense Secretary Dick Cheney after  critics insisted she was beholden to Washington.  </P></p>

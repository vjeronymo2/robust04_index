Can We Breathe Easier?"]    [Text] On 15 March a Session of the Oblast Soviet  Voted for One of the Year's Main Issues    Budget questions are questions of our life. Much  depends on the figures for which the deputies vote: whether we  can receive treatment and be taught at the level of the  individual of the end of the 20th century, ride urban mass  transit, and move, as needed, into new residential  neighborhoods. At the oblast soviet session on 22 February the  deputies rejected the draft budget. And now a new attempt. This  time the decision was adopted. Our correspondent's questions are  answered by M.G. Pabat, chief of the oblast state administration  financial department.    [Gurova] Mikhail Grigoryevich, the second version of the  budget is better?    [Pabat] Substantially. The amount--10.3 trillion  karbovantsy--that the deputies rejected on the last occasion  would hardly have been sufficient to cater to half our  requirements. In order to fully cover the requirements of  housing and public utilities and for there to be sufficient  funds for the purchase of prescription drugs, for transport  subsidies, and for other needs, the deputies proposed an  increase in the amount by a factor of 1.7. Which also will not  be enough for everything, of course, but we will not have to  accustom ourselves to shortages.    [Gurova] From where, for all that, has the increase in funds  come?    [Pabat] From a reduction in tax payments to the state  coffers. Having transferred them to the local budget, the  deputies thereby ran counter to current legislation. But they  had no choice. When there is not enough to maintain the  hospitals and schools, to maintain electric transportation in at  least some kind of shape, not to mention replacing it, or to  prevent the poor from dying of starvation and to provide them  with a roof over their heads, under these circumstances one does  not point to the strict pressure of the law. After all, on the  other side there is the abyss into which poverty is pushing us.    [Gurova] Will these percentages which were withheld from the  state budget help us to breathe easier?    [Pabat] Alas! The budget is composed of taxes, and where are  they to come from if the plants and factories come to a halt? In  January the oblast produced 34 percent less than in the same  month last year. In February the minus increased to 41 percent.  In March it is expected that this figure will be even higher. We  will breathe more easily only when an upturn in production  begins.    [Gurova] What was the subject most discussed when the budget  was being adopted?    [Pabat] The talk was mostly about social protection, about  the pay of employees of the publicly funded sphere. Whatever  matter was raised--whether there was a reserve fund, the  construction of housing, or the Afghan veterans--the talk  continually came back to the calamitous position of the  hospitals, schools, and higher educational institutions and,  consequently, the doctors, teachers, and lecturers--those on  whom the health, intellect, and spiritual condition of the  people depend. Despite the fact that the payments to them come  not from the local but the state budget, the session still had  to decide questions on an increase in pay from general  appropriations until the corresponding decrees are adopted at  the state level.</p>

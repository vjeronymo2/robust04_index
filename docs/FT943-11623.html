			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Pensions guide delayed by SIB Full guidance on how to review the personal pensions sold to people transferring from, or opting out of, occupational schemes will not be available until October, the Securities and Investments Board, the chief City regulator, said yesterday. SIB had intended to publish by the end of this month the guidelines for life companies and financial advisers on how to review their cases and compensate customers who had suffered from poor advice to take a transfer or opt out. SIB's plan was announced last December after public concern about possible mis-selling of personal pensions was fuelled by a pilot study showing a widespread disregard of regulatory requirements. Announcing the delay, SIB said that the work was well-advanced but that it wanted to assess over the summer how workable the approach which had been developed would be. It decided against publishing any interim guidance in case this caused confusion. While the regulator has made progress with devising compensation arrangements, several sensitive issues that concern the relative responsibilities of life companies and of independent financial advisers have not yet been resolved. Nor has it yet been decided whether to publish the results of the two research projects that were commissioned by SIB on the extent and range of pensions business. SIB insisted yesterday that the delay did not undermine the urgency with which remedying past mistakes was being tackled. It published guidelines in May on how life companies and advisers should go about identifying cases which should be reviewed as a priority, for example where the pension-holder had already retired.</p>

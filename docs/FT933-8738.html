			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / International Company News: St Louis makes Dollars 64m deal with TWA TRANS WORLD Airlines, the bankrupt US carrier, yesterday announced a Dollars 64.7m sale-and-leaseback deal with the city of St Louis, in Missouri. News of the deal came 24 hours after TWA won bankruptcy court approval for its plan of reorganisation, and was accompanied by confirmation that the airline plans to move its headquarters to St Louis. TWA filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code in early 1992, when the airline was still owned by Mr Carl Icahn, the US financier. Approval for its reorganisation plan means that it should emerge from bankruptcy within a few weeks. Under the reorganisation scheme, equity ownership of the airline will be split between employees, in return for wage concessions, and creditors, in exchange for forgiving debt. The carrier had been headquartered in Mount Kisco, New York - alongside Mr Icahn's other business interests - although its main operating 'hub' was in St Louis. Under the arrangement with the city, TWA will sell gates, jetways, baggage systems and associated property to the local airport authority and then lease these assets back. Cash from the sale will arrive in two stages: Dollars 24.7m by October 31 and Dollars 40m by December 31. The city has also waived a Dollars 5.3m claim against TWA for back-lease payments. TWA dominates air services in St Louis, and when fears about the airline's continued viability were at their height, concerns were expressed about the impact which the airline's collapse might have on the city's business community.</p>

			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / A very Bosnian plight: New nations still have to prove themselves in trial by battle An anniversary passed last week with little notice and less celebration. On December 16, 1991, the member states of the European Community (the European Union did not yet exist) agreed on criteria by which requests for recognition from new states would be judged. Everyone knew that these would be used to accord recognition to Croatia and Slovenia, because that was what the Germans wanted. But they were supposed to be applied to other former constituent republics of the Yugoslav federation as well, and to those of the Soviet Union which was also breaking up just then. Recognition of new states in former Yugoslavia was hotly debated, because the Serbs opposed it. Recognition of the ex-Soviet republics, by contrast, was uncontroversial, as by then Russia was pushing for it. Little attention was paid to the fact that Russia was itself a federation. There was no debate on the desirability of applying the same principles to constituent republics of that federation, should any request recognition. Probably few of the ministers who set the criteria had heard of Chechnya, let alone knew it had declared its independence six weeks earlier. If they did know, their position was what it has remained: Chechnya was not their business. It was an internal Russian matter, though one they hoped would be solved without violence. The borders of the new states should remain as they had been within the old federations of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, unless changed by mutual agreement. If someone had asked why what applied to one federation should not apply to another, the ministers would perhaps have said that Russia was not a 'real' federation. Yet the Soviet Union had not been very 'real', either. In fact it had been a highly centralised state, ruled from Moscow by a single communist party. That party had decided quite arbitrarily to give some regions the status of Soviet republics, nominally equal to Russia, while making others mere 'autonomous republics' or 'autonomous provinces' within Russia, or within one of the other Soviet republics. (Thus the autonomous republic of Abkhazia and province of South Ossetia found themselves in Georgia, which abolished their autonomy when it achieved its own sovereignty.) Equally arbitrary were the boundaries of these various units. The peoples of the north Caucasus, in particular, were divided, reshuffled, deported and repatriated at the whim of Stalin and his successors. All this is very clearly and carefully explained in an extraordinarily well-timed report published last week by the Minority Rights Group*; and described in a livelier, more impressionistic way by Suzanne Goldenberg in her book Pride of Small Nations (Zed Books, Pounds 14.95pb, Pounds 39.95hb). Some were given territorial units, some not; sometimes two peoples with unrelated languages were lumped together. Seldom did the 'titular nationality' form a majority of the inhabitants in the territory named after it. Several peoples were deported en masse to central Asia during the second world war, then allowed to return years later, giving rise to vicious territorial disputes. 'It is of paramount importance,' say the MRG authors piously, 'for the European and international community not to neglect the needs of the region and its peoples.' Some hope] Western leaders find it simpler to close their eyes and hope Yeltsin gets on with it. Many of them were not sure even in 1991 that recognising new states was such a good idea, and others have regretted it. Recognition may have helped bring about a ceasefire in Croatia, but it led more or less directly to war in Bosnia. It has certainly not prevented bloodshed all along the southern periphery of Russia, from Moldova to Tajikistan. Among the criteria for recognition set by the European ministers, one that previous generations of diplomats would have seen as the most important was strangely left out: what the Slovenian jurist Danilo Turk calls 'the criterion of the effectiveness of the power of the group claiming self-determination in a certain territory'. Historically, states have established themselves by proving, if necessary in war, that they were able to survive; or they have been established after someone else defeated the state to which their territory formerly belonged. The ministers in Brussels, in December 1991, rightly sensed that such a method of deciding whether a new state has the right to exist is barbaric and primitive. They wanted to establish a more civilised and democratic test of legitimacy. Did the majority of the people in the territory concerned support the new state? And were dissenting minorities guaranteed full civil and political rights within it? If so, it was entitled to recognition. What they failed to consider was how to give effect to such legitimacy if the group claiming self-determination does not effectively control its territory, as proved the case in Bosnia. Following the criteria they had established, the EC member states, accompanied and urged on by the US, recognised Bosnia's independence in April 1992; it was admitted to the UN the following month. But they were unable or unwilling to help the new state to achieve effective control of its own territory. Bosnia was left to face the same ordeal by battle that other new states have had to pass, without being allowed weapons to fight with. Now the Chechens are in a similar plight. At least they, unlike the Bosnians, cannot blame 'the international community' for encouraging them in any false hopes. * The North Caucasus: Minorities at a Crossroads.

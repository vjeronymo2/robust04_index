			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / International Company News: Pakistan telecoms sale under way The partial flotation of Pakistan Telecommunication Corporation, the country's monopoly telephone service, gets under way today, with the government offering Rs1bn (Dollars 33m) of PTC shares. The sale represents less than 1 per cent of of the corporation's worth, but the government plans to privatise a further 26 per cent next year, possibly to a 'strategic investor', who would take over management of the concern. Objections from the armed forces, who feared the sale would compromise Pakistan's security, delayed the sale for some two years. The government has since said that some of the money raised through the sale will be used to set up a new telephone service for the armed forces. Meanwhile, PTC unions said yesterday that they had called off a planned strike in an agreement with the government over job security after privatisation. The strike was to have begun today, but a union spokesman said agreement had been reached on job security, pensions, gratuities and bonuses.</p>

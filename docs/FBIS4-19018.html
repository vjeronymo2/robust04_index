			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Forza Italia Warns Andreatta on </F> Slovenia, Croatia"]    [Text] (ANSA) Fiuggi, April 11 -- Forza Italia members of  parliament meeting here Monday [11 April] approved unanimously a  motion warning Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta against  making any formal decision at the April 20 European Union [EU]  meeting to discuss membership applications by Slovenia and  Croatia. Forza Italia MPs warned the Rome government "not to  compromise the issue of EU membership to Slovenia and Croatia  with any irreversible acts" at the Brussels meeting, referring  to possible acceptance by this government of future membership  for the two former Yugoslav republics on Italy's northeastern  borders.    The motion gives a clearer indication of what the foreign  policies of a future government under the Freedom Pole (Forza  Italia, Northern League and National Alliance) may be with  respect to the two neighboring republics.    Those borders and former Italian territory now belonging to  Slovenia and Croatia, as well as the issue of rights for the  Italian minorities there, are being cited by the neofascist  National Alliance as reasons for vetoing EU membership.    Forza Italia MPs, as their allies, evidently fear that  Andreatta on April 20 may commit future Italian governments to  grant Slovenia and Croatia EU membership.    "This government that will be in charge for just a few more  days, representing political balances that have been turned  upside down by the popular elections, in recent weeks has taken  decisions that may jeopardize irrevocably delicate issues that  are often crucial for future developments," the Forza Italia  motion claimed.    National Alliance wants to renegotiate three postwar  treaties  signed with former Yugoslavia and wants to negotiate special  rights for Italians living in the two republics.</p>

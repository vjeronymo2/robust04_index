This problem was discussed by the upper chamber of the  Russian Parliament in connection with the Russian president's  address to the nation in response to the U.N. secretary  general's appeal asking Russia to send an additional military  contingent to former Yugoslavia.    The session of the upper chamber of the Russian Parliament  was attended by representatives of the Russian Defence and  Foreign Ministries, federal departments, a counter-intelligence  department and a department for emergency situations. In  accordance with the Russian Constitution, "a decision on the  possibility of the use of the Russian Armed Forces outside  Russia's territory" is within the competence of the Russian  Federation Council.    A resolution passed by the Federation Council instructs the  Russian Government to resolve problems connected with the  formation of a corresponding military contingent on a voluntary  basis and on terms envisaged by the resolution of the Russian  Parliament of March 6, 1992.    The Russian Government was also instructed to urgently  resolve the problem of giving a pay rise to the personnel of the  Russian contingent.    Under the resolution, the Russian Defence Ministry, shall,  jointly with the Russian Foreign Ministry, create a system of  measures providing social guarantees to the Russian personnel  taking part in peace-keeping operations in former Yugoslavia and  coordinate these measures with the U.N. secretariat.    The Russian Foreign Ministry was instructed to institute  additional posts for Russian officers in the headquarters of the  U.N. peace-keeping forces. The Federation Council drew  attention to the fact that it is necessary to step up the work  of corresponding departments for the ultimate solution of the  Bosnian crisis by political means.</p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / International Company News: American Express job cuts could reach 6,000 American Express last night confirmed that it would undertake a wide-ranging overhaul of the back-office operations which support its card businesses in the US, in the process eliminating some 4,000 jobs. The company also said it expected to cut a further 2,000 jobs by 'streamlining' other support staff throughout its worldwide operations and at its headquarters. Most of the cuts, out of a total workforce of 71,000, will come over the next two years as American Express closes four operating centres in the US. The closures would be staged to avoid disruption, the financial services group said. Further streamlining will lead to more cuts 'over the next several years'. The changes mark the second round of substantial cost-cutting undertaken by the company recently. Two years ago, American Express announced plans to axe 4,800 jobs as part of a move to reduce annual expenses by Dollars 1bn a year. The company said that target had been reached last year. The switch to fewer operating centres reflects a change in approach as the financial services group broadens its range of products. At present, its charge card, corporate card and credit card products are handled in different centres. Plans to launch another 10-15 products in the next two years make this fragmentation impractical, the company said. The continued focus on improved efficiency also reflects growing competition in the cards business. Although the market is growing strongly, card companies have suffered from rising interest rates, which have increased their financing costs, and the launch of a range of new credit cards. The reorganisation - billed by American Express as a re-engineering of processes ranging from cardmember acquisition to product development - follows a study carried out by consultants from Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton into the company's costs. Each aspect of its operations was compared with those of rival card companies in a 'benchmarking' exercise intended to highlight the most efficient company in each area of activity. American Express said its aim was to match the most efficient company in each area, although it had set no overall target for savings. The latest restructuring would be covered by a Dollars 342m charge taken in 1992, American Express said.</p>

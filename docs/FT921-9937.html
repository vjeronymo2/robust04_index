			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / UN chief orders sweeping shake-up THE UN secretariat announced a big shake-up last night, dropping fourteen senior officials and scrapping a dozen departments and offices. The sweeping changes were ordered by Secretary-General Boutros Boutros Ghali, in response to demands by major cash contributors for a rationalisation of the bloated bureaucracy. However, Mr Boutros Ghali, by-passed a streamlining plan drafted by 30 UN ambassadors led by Australia's Mr Peter Wilenski. This would have created a small group of deputy secretaries general and eliminated an entire tier of the hierarchy. Mr Francois Giuliani, who is to continue as the UN spokesman, observed that it was the secretary-general's prerogative to organise the secretariat as he saw fit. The Office for Political and General Assembly Affairs headed by Mr Ronald Spiers, a former senior US State Department official, is among those to be eliminated. Also to be scrapped is the Centre for Transnational Corporations, which just this week issued a report critical of the handling of the BCCI affair. The department was headed Mr Peter Hansen of Denmark. Former Canadian broadcasting executive Mrs Therese Sevigny, one of the few senior women, is to be replaced as under secretary-general for information by Mr Eugeniusz Wyzner, a lawyer-diplomat who served the Polish communist government before joining the UN staff 10 years ago as head of conference services, another axed department. Britain's Mr Marrack Goulding will head a new office of Peacekeeping Operations, maintaining the responsibilities he held as a UN political affairs executive. His office will also gain Mr Kofi Annan of Ghana, who conducted the abortive talks with Iraq aimed at obtaining the resumption of oil shipments. Two key appointments - administration and management and emergency relief co-ordinator - are to be announced, one of which may go to an American. A newcomer is Mr Vladimir Petrovsky, former Soviet deputy foreign minister who will be in charge of one of two political affairs departments. Mr James Jonah of Sierra Leone, will head the other.</p>

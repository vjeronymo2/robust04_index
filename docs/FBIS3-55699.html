			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valentin Vasilets] </F>   [Text] Ottawa, 11 Jan -- "Khudozhnik Pakhomov," a Russian  container vessel, unexpectedly called on Monday at the port of  St. John's, Newfoundland, causing a wave of controversial  reports on alleged dramatic events on board. The CBC television  company reported in the morning, quoting police sources, that  Canadian policemen and customs officials boarded the ship after  learning that there had been a gun battle on board. At least  one person was reported killed. Canadian Press agency reported,  quoting its own sources, that two people had been killed and  three wounded. It was alleged that the conflict began after  stowaways had been found on board.    However, representative of the Russian Federation marine  fleet in Montreal, Nikolay Zharnakov, contacted on the phone by  ITAR-TASS, categorically refuted these reports. He said that  there had been no gun battle and no firearms on board, and of  course there were no casualties or fatalities. Mr. Zharnakov  added that "Khudozhnik Pakhomov" had been heading for Montreal,  having taken part one week ago in the search for the crew of  "Marika-7", a Greek vessel that had sunk in stormy seas 1,500 km  off of Newfoundland. The container vessel, owned by the Baltic  shipping line, had also been affected by the storm and its  anchor had been damaged. The vessel had to head for the nearest  port for repairs. As she was approaching St. John's, a  stowaway, who had been hiding in the hold, emerged on deck. The  captain called the police and customs in order to have the  surprise "passenger" sorted out.    A representative of St. John's customs service also  confirmed  in the evening that no dramas had happened on board. Police  detained six stowaways who had penetrated the ship in a port in  Europe. The customs official said three of the stowaways were  Romanians, two Armenians, and one Russian. They all requested  asylum.</p>

A press  conference of Colonel-General of Aviation Petr Deynekin,  commander-in-chief of the Air Forces and head of the Russian  delegation, dealt with what our aircraft builders will  demonstrate at this exhibition.    Also participating in the press conference were  Valentina Tereshkova, the world's first woman astronaut; Yuriy  Starodub, deputy chairman of the State Committee for the Defense  Industry; Pavel Trishin, deputy general designer of  "Rosvooruzheniye"; Vice-Admiral Leonid Golovko, arms chief for  the navy; and Sergey Belousov, general director of the Russian  exposition.    The military-technical cooperation of Russia with the  countries of the Latin American continent goes back more than 20  years, but never before have we participated in air shows here.  FIDAE-94 is the debut for Russian aircraft builders and it is a  good chance for them to announce their presence loudly in the  markets of Latin America. Time will tell to what degree they are  successful in taking advantage of this. Right now we are  actively preparing for the air show.    The fighter-interceptors Su-27UBK and Su-30MK and the  transport aircraft Il-76 arrived in Chile under their own power,  having covered more than 16,000 km through the air. The air  giant An-124 "Ruslan" landed in Santiago two days earlier. It  had on board light frontal fighters MIG-29 and MIG-29UB for the  air show. The main delegation will fly to Latin America on 17  March on the long-range airliners of the Ilyushin firm Il-62 and  Il-96-300.    They expect 400 firms and companies from 34 countries of the  world to take part in the FIDAE-94 aerospace exhibition. The  largest aircraft building firms of Russia, the United States,  France, England, Germany, Italy, Canada, and many other states  have set up their displays on specially equipped pavilions and  exhibition areas covering about 60,000 square meters. The  directors of all leading aviation companies of Latin America  have been invited to the air show. Among the honored guests of  the air show are Col-Gen of Aviation Petr Deynekin, commander in  chief of the Russian Air Forces; Valentina Tereshkova, first  woman astronaut; Vladimir Kuzmin, general director of MAPO  [Moscow Aviation Production Association]; and Mikhail Simonov,  general designer of the ANPK [Aviation Scientific Production  Complex] "OKB Sukhoy" [Sukhoy Experimental Design Bureau].    The organizers of FIDAE-94 have no doubt about the success  of  the air show. Its success is predetermined by the participation  of Russia in the air show, as Axel Cabrera, Chilean consul in  Russia, said. According to the forecasts of specialists, the  aerospace exhibition in Chile will be visited by more than  600,000 people, including 3,000 marketing agents and merchants  specializing in the aviation business.    "Rosvooruzheniye," a recently established state company for  the export and import of arms and military equipment, took on  most of the work in the organization of the Russian section at  the FIDAE-94 air show. In Chile, Russia intends to demonstrate  the latest developments and also the series production of more  than 50 design bureaus, research institutes, and industrial  enterprises. Altogether, more than 100 different models of  aviation equipment and arms systems will be presented. The  participants in the exhibition will be able to familiarize  themselves with an entire family of Russian delivery sytems,  antiaircraft missile systems, surface ships and submarines,  surface skimmers and with various air and naval arms, radar  complexes, and firearms. But the hit of the air show will still  be combat aircraft. The commander in chief of the Russian Air  Forces does not rule out the possibility that some foreign  pilots will even be given the chance to fly our fighters.    MAPO, one of the oldest aviation production associations in  Russia, is presenting series models of the light frontal  fighters MIG-29 and MIG-29UB in Chile. Beginning with the air  show in Farnboro in 1988, our MIG's have been demonstrated at  practically all large international aerospace exhibitions, where  they gained the reputation of being the best light fighters.  They recently affirmed this reputation in Italy, where they  carried out instructional air battles between the MIG-29 and the  American F-15, F-16, and F-18. Our fighters gained a convincing  "victory" in them.    At the air show in Chile, MAPO is proposing to its potential  partners not only combat aircraft themselves but also guaranteed  servicing under world standards.    And it is hardly likely that anyone at the current air show  will be able to compete with the fighter-interceptors Su-27UBK  and Su-30MK of the scientific-production aviation complex "OKB  Sukhoy." The mere fact that they flew to Chile with just a few  intermediate landings was a sensation in the aviation world.    Chile is not only an air power but a naval power as well.  Hence, it is understandable why naval themes will also be widely  represented in the Russian section of the FIDAE-94 show. In  particular, there are submarines, the "Murena" and "Zubr"  landing craft on air cushions, which are capable of transporting  different tracked and wheeled vehicles along with their crews  (as much as 130 tonnes), the patrol boats "Saygak" and "Muflon,"  a system of tactical strike missile weapons....    The experience of the previous exhibitions and air shows has  shown that firearms are particularly popular there. Visitors at  FIDAE-94 will have the chance to get to know the new Kalashnikov  assault rifles AK-101 and AK-102 (caliber 5.56 mm), the  underwater pistol SPP-1M (caliber 4.5 mm), a noiseless assault  rifle, a sniper's rifle, and other weapons.    Air shows are costly. Participation in FIDAE-94 will cost us  at least $600,000, even under the most modest estimates. But it  is necessary to spend money for this, because there simply is no  better way to make ourselves known and to present our goods in  person. By the way, we have already passed the critical point in  the reduction of Russian military exports. The figures for 1993  are higher than for 1992. At the present time, Russia's share in  the total volume of world arms exports is 5 percent.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Lev Ambinder report under the "Economic Reform in </F> Tatarstan" rubric: "'Unity and Progress' Prepares Agreement  with the PRES"]    [Text] A working group for drawing up a draft agreement on  joint activity with Sergey Shakhray's Party for Russian Unity  and Accord [PRES] was set up in Kazan yesterday by the political  council of Tatarstan's "Unity and Progress" party. Aleksey  Kolesnik, cochairman of the party and deputy of the republic's  parliament, has told your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent that  the idea of concluding the agreement was discussed with Sergey  Shakhray back on 26 April at the inauguration of the PRES  Tatarstan branch.    Mr. Kolesnik said in a conversation with your  KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent that the agreement looks certain  to be based on bilateral, public ("non-state!" -- the "Unity and  Progress" chairman stressed) control over the implementation of  the treaty between Tatarstan and Russia. In this regard,  Aleksey Kolesnik pointed out, KOMMERSANT-DAILY's allegations on  27 April that his party plans to use the cooperation with PRES  "to strengthen its position in its standoff with the  authorities" are completely groundless. In a statement on the  KOMMERSANT-DAILY publication, the "Unity and Progress" executive  committee said: "The party has not accused President Mintimer  Shaymiyev of `dragging his feet on reform and being too careful  in carrying it out,' because according to our program we are  interested not so much in speed, but rather in the effectiveness  of reform. We do not think that confrontation is the best means  to achieve political objectives. The experience of Tatarstan's  talks with Russia has shown that only through dialogue can  positive results be achieved."    At the same time, it is evident that a split is emerging  among the party leaders themselves over approaches to economic  reform. KOMMERSANT-DAILY has already reported that another  cochairman of the "Unity and Progress" party, its ideologist and  presidential adviser (now former), Rafael Khakimov, published a  series of articles in the local press accusing the republic's  leaders of creating an atmosphere of stagnation in Tatarstan.  The executive committee of the party's political council  distanced itself from the "rebellious statements" by Rafael  Khakimov, calling these publications "his private opinion."    However, although "Unity and Progress" leaders keep  insisting  that their party is not in opposition to the authorities, the  government appears to hold a different view. Filza Khamidullin,  chairman of the Tatarstan State Economy Committee, refused to  cooperate with party specialists when drawing up a government  anti- crisis program.    For its part, the "Unity and Progress" executive committee,  familiar only with isolated fragments of the draft anti-crisis  program being prepared by the State Economy Committee,  nonetheless sees it as "not sufficiently market-oriented."  Given that the president has sympathetically reacted to the  party's economic policy concept and that "Unity and Progress" is  made up primarily of the republic's city and rayon nomenklatura,  the State Economy Committee's position appears fairly shaky.  Mr. Kolesnik explains the current situation as follows: "The  expressly market-oriented nature of our program and Mr.  Khamidullin's dogged silence in response to our calls for  cooperation confirms that someone does not want change but  wishes to preserve the Tatarstan economy in its current form."    Meanwhile, the issue is apparently not only that of  different  views on the situation in the republic's economy and further  economic reform. In the view of observers, a conflict between  political elites -- the old party nomenklatura currently in  power and "second-ranking" bureaucrats who have been denied  access to power -- is deepening in Tatarstan.</p>

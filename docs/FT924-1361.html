			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Observer: Family affairs Minorco may be a publicly quoted company but it has been wrestling with a common family problem for some time - whether to choose Harry Oppenheimer's former son-in-law or his godson to run the business. Harry O is 84 and long since retired from Anglo American Corporation, which controls Minorco. But his family company still effectively controls Anglo, South Africa's biggest business, and no important decision is taken without sounding out his opinion. So it would not be surprising if the old man had a hand in ensuring that former son-in-law Hank Slack, 41, is made chief executive of a streamlined Minorco. Slack has been chairman of its management committee since 1989. Roger Phillimore, a 42-year-old godson, has decided to call it a day and go off 'to dabble in the arts', something he has long wanted to do. Tony Lea, who along with Slack and Phillimore, had been dispatched from Anglo in 1988 to shake up Minorco, has been offered a job back at Anglo's headquarters in Johannesburg. The three young Turks arrived at Minorco with a bang - making a Pounds 2.9bn bid for Consolidated Gold Fields. But after this failed, they lost their adventurous spirit. Minorco's shares remain at a discount of about 40 per cent to net asset value - the same ratio as when they started out. Having, in effect, three managing directors couldn't have helped.</p>

They called on Zhengzhou to speed up the financial  industry's  modernization, to upgrade efficiency and attract more  professionals.    The municipal government and relevant departments have  seriously considered the experts' suggestions.    Located in the central plain, Zhengzhou is a hub within easy  reach of the cities of Shanghai, Beijing, Xian and Wuhan. The  country's two main railways cross the city and it also has many  highways and airlines to connect with other regions.    Zhengzhou is a city with brisk commercial activities, with  22  large wholesale markets in operation. In addition to the  national influential markets in the fields of grain, medicine,  coal and building materials, the production factor markets  involving technology and real estate have also taken shape.    Zhengzhou commodities exchanges, whose trading system is  linked with the terminals of REUTER'S NEWS AGENCY and the  ASSOCIATED PRESS, have been ranked as China's most standardized  futures markets by specialists from home and abroad.    So far, the financial industry has developed steadily in the  city, with a comprehensive network of over 1,700 banking  institutions and 15 securities institutions.</p>

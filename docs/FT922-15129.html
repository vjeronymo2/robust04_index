After all, in the market's gravity-defying heyday, when any excuse was good enough for buying shares, none was better than a corporate name-change. Moreover, sakura means 'cherry blossom' and the switch of identity had been timed to coincide with the blooming of the blossoms as well as a new financial year. Alas, the omen that came true was the rain which has washed out this spring's blossom-viewing, boding ill for the Japanese who see the delicate pink petals as symbols of the fragility of life itself. Down drooped the renamed bank's share-price by nigh on 10 per cent to a new year's low and - despite brokers' protestations that they'd have liked to place congratulatory buy orders - a probable portent of worse to come.</p>

			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / India complains as US threatens retaliation INDIA yesterday described as 'unwarranted' the Clinton administration's action last week designating it a priority country for punitive action under the US Special 301 legislation for retaliatory trade practices. Mr Pranab Mukherjee, the commerce minister, told parliament yesterday that India 'noted with regret' the US decision, which could deprive India of import privileges extended to developing countries under the generalised system of preferences programme. Such a move could undermine India's economic reform programme. The Special 301 provision of US trade law is designed to protect American industries from product 'piracy' or theft of patents, copyrights, software, and trade secrets, worth billions of dollars each year. To force US trading partners to improve enforcement of intellectual property rights, the Clinton administration last week announced tougher procedures which would make India and Thailand liable to immediate sanctions. In a move which won praise from the International Intellectual Property Alliance - a group of US trade associations - Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, refused to give several offending countries an additional year to repair the alleged deficiencies in their intellectual property rules and placed them on short-term review cycles to press for specific, short-term results. Korea, Argentina, Egypt, Poland and Turkey were made the subject of these 'out-of-cycle' reviews. Hungary and Taiwan agreed to 'immediate action plans,' and the US will 'intensify' consultations with Australia, the EC and Saudi Arabia. Mr Mukherjee said that trade-related intellectual property rights were being discussed at the Uruguay round trade negotiations. India would continue to impress on the US that its unilateral action was 'unwarranted'.</p>

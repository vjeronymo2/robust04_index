			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Change on work permits criticised US business groups fear tighter restrictions will be placed on non-European citizens visiting the UK for business purposes under a change to Britain's immigration regulations. The London branch of the American Chamber of Commerce intends to protest to UK trade and industry ministers about the move, which it believes could force short-term business visitors from non-European Union countries to apply for a work permit. The Home Office described the amendments to the Immigration Act, due to take effect on October 1, as a 'clarification' of existing rules. The chamber is concerned by a clause which states that a business visitor to the UK will be granted entry without a work permit only if he or she 'does not intend to produce goods or provide services within the United Kingdom'. It fears that visitors who plan to speak at international conferences, provide consultancy services or engage in marketing activities will have to obtain work permits before being allowed into the country, even if they plan to stay for only two or three days. Mr Eric Deakins, consultant to the American Chamber of Commerce, said: 'These rules go against the spirit of the Gatt agreement on international free trade.' Previous immigration regulations, last revised in 1990, state that passengers admitted to the UK with 'visitor' status 'are free to transact business during their visit'. Mr Deakins said: 'This is a substantial tightening up of the rules. Whatever it means, in practice may be another matter.' The Home Office said the 'clarified' rules would be enforced in 'exactly the same way as they were before'. Earlier this year, the Home Office issued guidance notes which clarify some points. But the status of conference speakers and outside consultants is still unclear. The notes state that non-EU citizens may enter the UK without work permits as speakers 'in a conference where this is not run as a commercial concern and the conference is a one-off'. Mr Deakins said this note did not make clear what was meant by 'commercial concern' and did not set out the status of speakers who were not being paid but were speaking at commercial conferences. The Home Office said a conference speaker who was not being paid would not generally need to secure a work permit before arriving in the UK. But each case would be judged individually and conference speakers could be evaluated on the length of their stay in Britain, whether they were receiving any payment in kind, and the nature of the conference at which they were appearing.</p>

			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Observer: Divi divining Now that BP has cut its dividend one wonders which other pillars of the corporate establishment could be a bit shaky. Like most good clubs, the FT 30-share index has a rather quirky membership; even so the health of its members is well worth monitoring for signs of dividend fatigue. Asda and Royal Insurance have only been admitted to the FT 30 club in the last decade, and they have already cut their dividend. BP itself is a relatively junior member - it was only invited to join in 1977 when Sir Jimmy Goldsmith whisked his Cavenham foods business offshore. Among other new members which may have difficulty keeping up their dividends, P &amp; O, Forte and BICC are worth keeping an eye on. No need to sound the alarm bells, but their shares are far more lowly rated than they were at the bottom of the last recession in 1981. However, Courtaulds, ICI, Allied-Lyons and Guinness were all rated even more lowly in the last recession, but they pulled up their socks and have gone on to win their club colours for good behaviour.</p>

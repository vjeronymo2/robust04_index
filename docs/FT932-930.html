			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Divisions remain over tropical timber pact UNITED NATIONS-sponsored talks on a new tropical timber pact are due to end today with little progress on key issues, despite initial optimism. A third round of negotiations on a successor to the 1983 International Tropical Timber Agreement, which expires next March, is likely in two or three months' time. Consuming and producing countries are still split over the scope of a new agreement. Consumers are resisting producer calls to include temperate and boreal timber in the pact. Producers complain that tropical timber is discriminated against in international trade because it has to satisfy stricter environmental criteria. Tropical timber has been losing market share to temperate timber in recent years, in part because of environmental concerns. At the beginning of the week-long talks, consumers put forward a three-pronged compromise plan that would keep temperate timber out of the agreement but commit consumer nations to aim at sustainable forest management for traded temperate wood. The plan also included language in the new agreement to bar trade discrimination against tropical timber as such and more finance for projects of benefit to producer nations. Producers then said they wanted consumer nations to take on environmental commitments 'as clear and unambiguous' as those in the proposed tropical timber agreement. If consumers have their way, the new accord will require all traded tropical timber to come from sustainably managed forests by the year 2000, a target already set by the International Tropical Timber Organisation. Although consumers have refined their proposals over the week, conference sources said yesterday that they remained unacceptable to producers.</p>

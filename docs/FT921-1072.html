			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Business Law: Meeting old public liability claims The insurance industry is currently under threat from claims of catastrophic proportions which stem from its carte blanche underwriting of unrestricted pollution liability insurance in the UK between 1930 and 1990. Up to now attention has been solely directed to US claims. In the recently published Rowland Report, Lloyd's: a Route Forward, not a single reference was made to the claims that Lloyd's may face from UK policyholders in respect of UK environmental clean-up expenses. There is no hard estimate yet for the amount of money that will be required to clean up Britain's industrial heritage, but all experts agree the costs will run into billions. Lloyd's has acknowledged that the cost of cleaning up the US may reach Dollars 1,000bn. If Britain's problem is only one-tenth the size of the American problem the claims will be in the order of Pounds 50bn. (A recent estimate published in the Financial Times put the cost at between Pounds 10bn and Pounds 30bn.) One insurer recently described the pre-1990 enforcement of laws controlling pollution in the UK as a farce. Since the Environmental Protection Act came into force in November 1990, a much more rigorous regime of pollution control and remediation has been in place. Section 61 of that act, for example, permits local authorities to recover the costs of cleaning up contaminated sites from the site owner. Of more significance are the catch-all provisions of section 161 of the Water Resources Act 1991 that empower the National Rivers Authority to clean up actual or threatened pollution of controlled waters and reclaim the costs of clean-up from anyone who 'caused or knowingly permitted' pollution. As no element of knowledge is required to establish liability on the part on anyone who causes pollution, it would seem that strict liability will be imposed on any company which, quite properly and in accordance with all applicable regulations in force, 'caused' its industrial waste to be disposed in a landfill site owned and operated by a local authority and which now threatens to pollute controlled waters. It will be interesting to see whether a person who transported someone else's waste to such a landfill site will also be liable under this legislation. The National Rivers Authority is the agency empowered under the Water Resources Act to institute clean-up operations. Although they do not yet appear to have used these powers, it cannot be long before they do so. Also waiting in the wings is the anticipated European Commission Directive on Civil Liability for Environmental Pollution. Even in the absence of new laws, there is the spectre of lawsuits grounded in nuisance and negligence which are directed at industry by those whose property and health have been adversely affected by environmental pollution. Recently in the US there has been a number of multi-million dollar settlements of third-party injury claims emanating from consumption of contaminated water over long periods of time. The same pollution problem exists in Britain and it can only be a question of time before evidence of mass poisoning emerges. Thus Lloyd's and UK insurance companies now face an avalanche of claims on public liability policies which have lain dormant for up to 60 years. Why is this so? Insurance policies written in the 1930 to 1990 period covered pollution losses unless specifically excluded. It is a facet of these policies that there is no time limitation on claims and, as fantastic as it sounds, it was well appreciated when the policies were written that claims could arise years after the policies had apparently 'expired'. US insurers acted in the early 1970s to restrict coverage for pollution claims before ceasing in 1985 to write any form of coverage whatsoever. UK insurers inexplicably waited until 1990 to restrict their own pollution coverage. Recently, Mr Brian Street of American International Underwriters (UK), a leading London market insurer, remarked that the UK industry's practice in writing unrestricted public liability policies on an 'occurrence basis' had been 'naive'. He described the typical public liability policy as including all forms of pollution liability, gradual as well as sudden and accidental, unless specifically excluded, and because the policies had been written on an occurrence basis with no limit to the number of events in any one period of insurance, they afforded unlimited coverage. Most UK insurers of commercial liability risks have on their books significant volumes of policies which until 1990 were silent on the topic of pollution. Only those risks where there was a perceived pollution problem, such as chemical plants, would have been restricted. Even where restricted terms were used the effectiveness of these clauses will be open to challenge in the courts. The recognition of the risks of environmental pollution is not new. Until the 1960s it was general practice to include, if there was a perceived risk, an exclusion of liability from water pollution and the escape of fumes, chemical effluent or other noxious gas, liquid or substance placed in the policies of certain industrial insureds. As far back as 1969 Mr Peter Madge, a prominent British writer in the field of liability insurance, pointed out that an occurrence policy would cover a claim for bodily injury and property damage to third parties due to the deliberate emission of toxic chemicals from a chimney stack. It was the writing of these old public liability policies on an occurrence basis that was chiefly to blame for underwriters' current misery. This is because, under the terms of a standard worded public liability policy, the event that triggers coverage is when the injury or damage takes place or occurs, not the accident giving rise to it. Thus where a negligently designed building is erected and subsequently collapses during a later policy period, it is the later policy that will respond to the resulting claims. Similarly, where faulty electrical wiring is installed before insurers come on risk and a building subsequently burns down when insurers are on risk, the claim is covered. It is, therefore, an important question of fact when the injury or damage occurs, for this will determine the policy or policies under which cover will be available. Gradual pollution presents particular problems in this regard. Often there will be little certainty as to when the property damage commenced and for how long it may have continued until discovered. In the recent asbestos-related litigation it was found, as a matter of fact, that discrete bodily injury took place soon after first exposure and continued until the manifestation of disease up to 40 years later. In those circumstances most courts held that all policies in effect during the continuing injury process were jointly and severally liable for the ensuing claims. It is this prospect of multiple years of coverage being triggered for environmental claims that has got the insurance industry so concerned. Since the introduction of the occurrence policy wording, it has been recognised by those who gave any serious consideration to the issue that gradual pollution claims would be covered. In Britain in 1958 the Insurance Institute of London, in recommending that an occurrence basis of coverage should be adopted for UK policies, noted: 'For the insurance to apply it is only necessary to establish that the injury or damage giving rise to the claim has occurred during the currency of the policy. There may still be difficulties if the injury or damage does not manifest for some time . . .' It is particularly poignant that in 1959 and 1960 certain Lloyd's underwriters did try to introduce a standard policy clause that would exclude coverage for gradual pollution. Unfortunately for today's Names, the people whose capital backs underwriting at the Lloyd's insurance market, the warnings of these underwriters were ignored by their fellow Lloyd's and company underwriters who continued blithely to underwrite the risk of gradual pollution loss.

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Pope Shanudah, head of the Egyptian national  church, has issued a call through AL-'ARABI to the grand imam,  the shaykh of al-Azhar, to discuss with him practical ways to  liberate Jerusalem. The grand imam welcomed cooperation with  the brother Copts and the pope, and his eminence the mufti was  enthusiastic about the idea and expressed his readiness to  participate.    What is the starting point? AL-'ARABI has interviewed  political figures and representatives from different national  groups in order to form a common view on a starting point for  this or any practical proposals to consider. [passage omitted]    Counselor Ma'mun al-Hudaybi, official spokesman of the  Muslim  Brotherhood, expressed support for Pope Shanudah's call and  al-Azhar's favorable response to this call. He said that the  agreement of the shaykh of al-Azhar and the pope on this issue  is a good thing and reason for satisfaction. He called upon  them to pursue this issue and continue to pressure the Egyptian  Government and the Arab governments not to ignore the Jerusalem  issue. One practical measure would be continuous public  pressure on the government in order not to overlook this issue.  While the status of Jerusalem is a matter for governments to  deal with, this does not mean that the people should not get  involved. Our role can be divided into two parts: The first is  to collect donations to maintain the Islamic holy places in that  city. The donations should go to a publicly trustworthy body.  As for regaining Jerusalem itself, the major part of this task  is the responsibility of the Arab and Islamic governments. We,  as peoples, must exert maximum pressure through processions,  seminars, conferences, and any other means to restore this city,  which is dear to us all.    Al-Hudaybi stressed that the Muslim Brotherhood welcomes  this  call and is prepared to attend any al-Azhar-sponsored conference  in which the national church and political forces will join in  discussing practical ways to regain Jerusalem. He added that  the real significance of the pope's call and al-Azhar's  favorable response lies in the fact that it confirms beyond any  doubt the absence of so-called sectarian strife in Egypt, and  that the violence taking place now is not directed against the  Copts alone; its victims are both Muslims and Copts.

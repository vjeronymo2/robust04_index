Edward S. Neymark [spelling of name as received], chief of  the aircraft industry department at the Russian Federation State  Committee for Defense Industries, said such cooperation would  benefit both countries.    The Russian aerospace industry is faced with an urgent need  to convert to commercial use due to military spending cuts.    Neymark was speaking at a press conference in a Tokyo hotel  after meeting officials in charge of aircraft manufacturing at  the Ministry of International Trade and Industry.    Neymark said he told MITI officials that Russia is ready to  cooperate with Japan in any aerospace field ranging from  electronic parts to joint development of a 600-seat passenger  airliner.    The Russian official is visiting Japan following a  memorandum  signed last May between the Japanese and Russian aerospace  industries to promote bilateral relations and personnel  exchanges.</p>

			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Plan for staying afloat: What John Major should tell the House Next week Mr John Major will have to defend himself before the House of Commons against the charge of leading his government and his country into the ERM disaster. This is, after all, the man who said, less than two weeks ago, that 'changes in economic and monetary arrangements . . . must work with the grain of the market and not against it. This is of course what the ERM does.' After what markets have done, what will the prime minister say? Ideally, something like this: 'I must apologise to honourable members of this House. I was wrong. The government was wrong. But so, I would remind this House, was the Opposition. 'Not having suffered the disadvantages of a university education in economics, I have little excuse. People with first class degrees and insufficient confidence in their country found attractive the simplifications and the defeatism that lay behind our ERM policy. I cannot plead this justification. 'Why defeatism? How else can one describe the view that the best possible monetary target for the UK was German broad money and the best central bank the Bundesbank? 'Why simplifications? Over the past twenty years, governments first received plaudits for trying to get the exchange rate down, whatever its effects on the money supply; then for deciding to control the money supply, whatever its effects on the exchange rate; and finally, for keeping the exchange rate up, whatever its effects on the money supply. This drunken walk from one over-simplified nostrum to the next has perfectly matched the behaviour of the economy. 'The ERM policy has, in the end, damaged our credibility and our relations with Germany. The system is, in fact, half-baked: too rigid to accommodate the pressures of the markets and too flexible to resist them. The logical policies are either a single currency or a floating exchange rate. The Germans will not soon grant the former, at least to the UK, so the UK must, for the moment, choose the latter. 'A floating pound provides an opportunity, but also a danger. I remain convinced that this country should aim for steady, non-inflationary growth. Monetary policy will not deliver the growth. It is our old supply-side policies - competition, privatisation and low taxation - plus our new supply-side policies - more spending on economically productive infrastructure and a radical overhaul of education and training for the over-sixteens - that will deliver growth in the longer term. But monetary policy can provide support. 'How, the House may wonder, is the government going to pull off this miracle? It is not. The Bank of England is. Daily operation of monetary policy is to be the Bank's responsibility. A bill to grant it operating independence and reconstitute the Bank's court of directors will be before the House shortly. 'You must all wonder how the Bank of England is going to manage its task. That, I am glad to say, will not be the government's problem. But I imagine that like the Bundesbank it will look at broad money - rather a reliable indicator ever since we stopped targeting it - the exchange rate and long term interest rates. 'The Bank will still be accountable. First, the government will be able to override its decisions. But it will have to do so publicly. Secondly, the Governor will have to explain the Bank's policies to the House. I wish her every success. 'Many of my honourable friends hope for yet another dash for growth, with interest rates down to 5 per cent tomorrow. That is neither what we intend nor what the country needs. What it needs is an export-led recovery and continued control over inflation, so building on the one success of the last two years. The latter is what the Bank will be expected to deliver. Nevertheless, my honourable friends will be pleased to know that the government will cut base rate by another two percentage points. We intend to take advantage of our last period of monetary responsibility to make this fully justified cut just before the party conference. 'Once monetary policy is out of our hands, our aim will be to stop the fiscal haemorrhage. We intend to eliminate the deficit over the next several years, not because of the mechanical Maastricht convergence criteria, but because of the need to limit the government's call on private savings. 'As the economy recovers, current spending will come back under control. But we will also be taking a longer term and more radical look at the structure of spending. In the meantime, the growth in public sector wages will be limited to 2 per cent a year over the next three years. 'I have only one more announcement to make. My honourable friend, the chancellor of the exchequer, is to resign his post. This is not because he was responsible for the ERM calamity - the House knows he was not - but because he has become a liability to Anglo-German relations. Our blundering has hugely damaged those relations. We will do whatever needs to be done to improve them. Our firm promise not to rejoin the EMS should help. I can assure the House that this time we mean what we say.'</p>

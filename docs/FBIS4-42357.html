			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Zhirinovskiy Does Not Want To Be </F> Called a `Madcap'"]    [Text] Russian Duma Deputy Vladimir Zhirinovskiy has now  put his foot down and is demanding that HUFVUDSTADSBLADET and  the Swedish Theater be tried before Helsinki District Court.    HUFVUDSTADSBLADET and the Swedish Theater are also being  sued  for compensation totaling around 14 million markkas.    The reason for the writ against HUFVUDSTADSBLADET is that in  her column entitled "Bad Taste" and published on 14 April Jutta  Zilliacus called Zhirinovskiy a "madcap" [galenpanna].  Zhirinovskiy considers the word to be synonymous with the word  "mad" [galen]. He considers this to be defamation.    "This interpretation is completely incorrect. The word  `madcap' is synonymous with the words `daredevil, adventurous,  hothead' and is often used in the context of political  activists," said Mikael Reuter, the head of the Bureau for  Swedish Terminology and Usage.    For its part the Swedish Theater has offended Zhirinovskiy  by  using in the play "Mein Kampf" a speech of Zhirinovskiy's as a  continuation of a speech by Hitler -- something which, according  to Zhirinovskiy gives the impression that it is "the same person  or an incarnation of Adolf Hitler who is speaking."</p>

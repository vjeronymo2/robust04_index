			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 'POLITE BANDIT' GETS 28-YEAR PRISON TERM  </P> <P> A man prosecutors dubbed the "Polite Bandit" because of his courteous manners  while robbing small businesses was sentenced Friday to 28 years and 8 months in  prison.  </P> <P> Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Alan B. Haber imposed the sentence on Gary Allen  Smith, 45, of Long Beach in connection with a string of 30 robberies, 18 of  which occurred in the San Fernando Valley last spring.  </P> <P> Prosecutors had asked that Smith be sentenced to 30 years, nine years less than  the maximum, because Smith pleaded guilty before the case went to trial. Smith  was arrested in April at a drug treatment center in Tarzana when his mother  turned him in after her car was linked to several of the robberies, authorities  said.  </P></p>

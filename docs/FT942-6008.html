			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Top Swiss banker backs derivative regulation The chief executive of Swiss Bank Corporation has backed the main recommendations of the US General Accounting Office for regulation of the controversial financial derivatives sector. SBC, one of the top international banks in the mushrooming derivatives field, has thus distanced itself from US banking and securities industry representatives, who condemned the GAO's report. The report came at a time of growing alarm that the increasing complexity, leverage and volume of futures, options and swaps contracts could in extreme circumstances lead to a collapse of the world financial system. According to one estimate, the volume of contracts outstanding exceeded Dollars 18,000bn (Pounds 12,000bn) at the end of last year. Several industrial companies have reported huge losses in the past year arising from the unexpected behaviour of derivative contracts. Echoing the GAO, Mr Georges Blum, SBC chief executive, said in a speech at the International Management Symposium in St Gallen that supervisors and regulators in different countries 'needed to be more in line with each other on what their aims and instruments should be'. Mr Blum also supported the GAO call for identical regulation of all types of firms active in derivatives. He criticised regulators and supervisors everywhere for dragging their feet on agreeing accounting and disclosure rules on derivatives, and for not legislating to reduce the risk in so-called netting of contracts. 'If lawmakers are concerned about derivatives, these are the obvious areas they should look at first.' Mr Blum also denounced those financial companies who claimed that only low levels of capital were needed to cover their derivatives activities, saying they were 'wishing to have your cake and eat it too'. 'If the stress tests advocated by traders as a way to simulate the extent of the risks occurring in unusual circumstances have any utility, capital must cover the losses derived by the simulations,' he said. 'We agree with the regulators when they say that the system should be able to weather a severe storm, even if there is only a remote possibility that it will occur.'</p>

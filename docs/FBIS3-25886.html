			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, January 31 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Vice Foreign  Minister Kunihiko Saito said today that Japan intends to adhere  to its non-nuclear position.    He denied an allegation by a British newspaper that Japan  may  change its declared stance and develop a nuclear capability  because of the rumored nuclear program of the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).    Speaking at a press conference in Tokyo, the vice minister  noted that Japan would maintain its 3-point non-nuclear  principle of neither possessing nor producing nuclear weapons,  and not allowing them on Japanese soil. He said that to do  otherwise would only contribute to the instability of the  international environment around Japan.    The British "SUNDAY TIMES" reported that Japan had acquired  all the parts needed to make a nuclear weapon, and may have  built a bomb which requires only plutonium to be completed.</p>

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Japanese coalition whips in MPs for reform Japan's coalition government yesterday urged dissident members to close ranks, to improve its finely balanced chances of winning a parliamentary vote today on plans to overhaul the political and electoral system. The vote, in the upper chamber, is the climax of a five-year national debate on how to purge corruption from politics and create a more widely representative parliament. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has staked his survival on the outcome, which depends on an unpredictable handful of votes. His seven-party coalition has a five-seat majority in the upper house, but 10 to 12 defections are expected from both sides of the chamber. Japan's previous two prime ministers fell because of failure to achieve reform. Both the coalition and the opposition Liberal Democratic party have found it increasingly hard to enforce party discipline as the final vote has drawn closer. The splits are deep, because the proposed new electoral system threatens to deprive many members of parliament of a seat after the next general election. A parliamentary showdown, a departure from the normal way of making important decisions by consensus behind the scenes, became inevitable after the failure of compromise talks on Wednesday night, between the coalition and the LDP. That was the trigger for the coalition to return to the offensive yesterday morning, by forcing a vote on the four reform bills in the upper house's political reform committee, the final step before going to the full house for approval. It won the committee vote narrowly, by 18 votes to 16, helped by the defection of LDP member Mr Tomoichi Hoshino, to the government's side. Mr Hoshino's decision to join the growing queue of LDP defections - there were five two weeks ago - took his party officials by surprise and fuelled their fears that other MPs might be preparing to follow his example. Leaders of the Social Democratic party, the coalition's shakiest member, were yesterday meeting potential defectors, who fear the party will fare badly under the planned electoral system, a mixture of single-seat constituencies and proportional representation. 'We must not be blamed for killing the political reforms,' they were told by Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the party's chairman.</p>

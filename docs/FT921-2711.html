			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Money Markets: Trading slows again TRADING was very quiet on the UK money market yesterday, although the mood was improved by a newspaper opinion poll giving the Conservative party a three-point lead. Rates were little changed, with dealers waiting to see if the improvement in Conservative support is reflected in three more polls due out today. A better performance by sterling also reassured the market, which largely ignored disappointing PSBR and industrial production figures which showed the economy was still in the depths of recession. 'No economic figures are likely to be good news at the moment,' said one trader. 'We are much more interested in the opinion polls.' Interbank rates stood at 10 3/4 -10 5/8 per cent from one week through to five months, and 10 13/16 -10 per cent from six months to one year, although the one-year had opened  1/8 per cent higher. June sterling futures opened up at 89.27, and dropped slightly in the morning to 89.25 before firming to 89.29. Funding proved more difficult than expected after the Bank of England initially forecast a moderate shortage of around Pounds 550m. The main factors drawing funds from the system were Pounds 726m treasury bills and maturing assistance, and Pounds 317m bills for repurchase by the market, partly offset by exchequer transactions totalling Pounds 355m. The Bank, however, did not operate in the morning, purchasing only Pounds 300m of band 1 and 2 bank bills, and Pounds 1m band 1 treasury bills, at 10 3/8 per cent in the afternoon. It provided late assistance of Pounds 125m, bringing the day's total to only Pounds 426m. Overnight rates eased to around 10 5/8 -10 1/2 after the moderate shortage forecast, but in the afternoon reached 13 per cent, reflecting the difficult funding situation. German call money was still stuck at the relatively high level of 9.55/9.65 per cent ahead of the Bundesbank's weekly securities repo today. Dealers said rates would remain high and possibly edge higher until pressure from this month's heavy tax deadline was over. The Federal Reserve added temporary reserves to the US banking system through overnight system repurchase agreements. Federal funds were trading at around 4 1/8 per cent at the Fed's operations time, above the presumed target of 4 per cent.</p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / International Bonds: Goldman takes commanding lead in bond league table GOLDMAN Sachs appeared to have safeguarded its position at the top of the Eurobond league table yesterday with the launch of Dollars 500m offerings for BAT Industries and Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and a Pounds 194.6m securitisation for Standard Chartered Bank. According to IFR Securities Data, Goldman Sachs had lead-managed Dollars 26.6bn worth of Eurobonds by the end of trading yesterday, giving it a commanding lead of Dollars 3.4bn over Deutsche Bank, which occupied the number one slot at the end of last year. Sales of BAT's and LB Rheinland-Pfalz's bonds were slow due to uncertainty about the direction of the US bond market. In addition, the rally in US Treasuries led to a considerable widening in the yield spreads on the Eurobonds. The yield spread on BAT's bonds widened to around 79 basis points from 75 basis points at launch while the spread on LB Rheinland-Pfalz's bonds widened by seven basis points to 29 basis points. Mr Paul Schminke, director for LB Rheinland-Pfalz's foreign and treasury activities, said the offering reflected the increasing internationalisation of the bank's assets. 'At present, we have to refinance these through the money market,' he said. 'The international markets give us better conditions than the money market, leading to a considerable improvement of the liability side of the balance sheet.' Elsewhere, British Columbia the highest rated Canadian province, extended the maturity profile of the Canadian dollar sector with the launch of Dollars 350m of 30-year Eurobonds. This is the first 30-year Eurobond offering in Canadian dollars, although there have been 30-year Canadian dollar global bond offerings by Ontario Hydro and Hydro Quebec. British Columbia's Eurobonds were priced to yield 48 basis points over underlying Canadian government bonds, somewhat below the current yield spread of 55 basis points on its 30-year domestic bond. Lead manager ScotiaMcLoed said the pricing reflected the issuer's view that European investors would be willing to pay a premium for a long-dated and liquid issue and that the healthy oversubscription and a rise in the bonds to 97.70 when they were freed to trade, from a fixed re-offer price of 97.11, justified the pricing. Late in the day, Pemex, the Mexican state-owned oil company, tapped the Canadian dollar sector for the first time with a CDollars 100m offer of six-year Eurobonds. The yield spread of 195 basis points over Canadian government bonds was thought ambitious in view of the recent widening of spreads on emerging market bonds in the secondary market. In the Eurosterling market, the securitisation of vehicle hire purchase receivables for Standard Chartered was largely pre-placed.</p>

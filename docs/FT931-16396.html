			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Housing market shows stability THE residential housing market showed signs of stabilising last month, Nationwide Building Society said yesterday. Its house price index fell only 0.2 per cent in December. That followed falls of 1.4 per cent in September, 2.7 per cent in October and 2.0 per cent in November - which were interpreted as reactions to the end of the government's stamp duty 'holiday' in August and to the devaluation of sterling in September. Nationwide said average house prices fell 8.4 per cent last year, from Pounds 56,624 to Pounds 51,862. Mr Tim Melville-Ross, Nationwide's chief executive, said: 'Transaction levels have been low, as we would expect during the winter, but interest in the housing market appears to be picking up.' He said there had been a definite improvement in December compared with the number of transactions usually recorded, but he was not prepared to say that a recovery in the market had started unless it persisted for at least another two months. He added: 'We expect to see an increase in transaction levels during the year, resulting in a stabilisation of prices in the first half of 1993.' The Council of Mortgage Lenders was similarly cautious. It said: 'This seems to imply that the market is relatively stable. But it is an indication that the market is bumping along the bottom. Hopefully it could mean that there will be an increase in transactions, but it is hard to draw any definite conclusions from one month's figures.' Halifax Building Society, which is not forecasting a rise in house prices, concurred with that guarded reaction.</p>

			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLA BREVE  </P> <P> HALEVY: "La Juive." Julia Varady, June Anderson, Jose Carreras, Ferruccio  Furlanetto; Ambrosian Opera Chorus; Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by Antonio  de Almeida.  </P> <P> Philips 420 190-2 (three compact discs). Sooner or later, Halevy's 1835 grand  opera had to come to commercial disc, even, as here, in a somewhat cut version  (which still runs over three hours). Passages of eloquent grandeur jostle with  empty rhetoric for the attention as Scribe's libretto glazes the important  subject of 15th-Century religious intolerance with a frosting of purest  melodrama. Although Berlioz admired Halevy's orchestration, one comes away  convinced that virtually every note is there for effect. Still, Halevy provided  ripe opportunities for vocal display; they have been seized by Carreras'  Eleazar, delivered with fervor and tenorial finesse; by Varady's poignant  Rachel and by Anderson's glittering Princess Eudoxie. Almeida conducts with  conviction and authority, virtues accomplished not easily in this work.  Philips' sound is everything it should be. Allan Ulrich  </P></p>

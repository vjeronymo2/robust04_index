			<p>Language: <F P=105> Azeri </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Dear listeners, we now present a report on the  latest incidents in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] and on  the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan.    The significant decrease in the number of combat operations  at the NKR's front lines during the past few days should not be  taken to mean that tension has subsided. Regrettably,  instability continues to exist. The reason for this state of  affairs is the systematic firing on the Armenian defense  positions by Azerbaijan's military forces and the concentration  of Azerbaijani reinforcements and military vehicles in areas  close to the front. This is not the first time that  Azerbaijan's military command has used the relatively peaceful  situation to organize wide-scale attacks. Although the enemy has  agreed to hold talks to resolve the dispute, it has not  abandoned its military operations.    It is a fact that the talks held between the chairmen of the  parliaments of the two sides was a hope-inspiring development.  However, it is difficult to predict the outcome of their talks.  The latest reports we have received from the NKR Defense  Headquarters have confirmed our viewpoint.    NKR advance positions in Agdamskiy, Martuninskiy, and  Fizulinskiy Rayons were fired on with various types of arms from  Azerbaijan's military bases in Fizulinskiy and Agdzhabedinskiy  Rayons the night before last. The Armenian defensive positions  in Yusifdzhanly, Novruzlu, and Egerly in Agdamskiy Rayon were  fired on with various types of arms from the military bases in  Agdzhabedinskiy and Agdamskiy Rayons. No one was wounded in the  incidents.    The Azerbaijan Military Command Headquarters has used its  air  force units once again. Two enemy aircraft tried to bomb  Stepanakert at about 1020 yesterday. The NKR air defense forces  took retaliatory measures. The first reports we received said  that one of the aircraft was hit and downed near Dashbulakh in  Askeranskiy Rayon. We recall that one of Azerbaijan's aircraft  was destroyed in NKR's airspace nearly a month ago. Obviously,  the losses suffered by Azerbaijan's air force units have  increased.    The situation on the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan  continues to be tense. However, serious clashes and exchanges  of fire have not occurred. The situation can be described as  relatively peaceful.</p>

U.S. State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said the  expulsion of a Russian resident from the United States on Friday  [25 February] was entirely justified.    He was referring to the the espionage case of former CIA  counter- intelligence officer Aldrich Ames, who the U.S. alleges  had been a long-term underground member of the Russian  intelligence service.    "By contrast," McCurry said, "the expulsion of the U.S.  diplomat from Moscow is purely an act of unjustified  retaliation."    He reiterated that Washington reserves the right to take  further action if there are others implicated in connection with  the case of Ames, who was allegedly paid more than 1.5 million  dollars for collecting vital CIA operational and personnel  information for Moscow.    "We will continue to assess, as that investigation and  prosecution develops, what further measures might be necessary,"  McCurry added.</p>

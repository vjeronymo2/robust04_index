			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> YAF OPPONENT  </P> <P> Why does The Times devote so much space to groups like Young Americans for  Freedom, whose "tactics, beliefs teeter on the edge of respectability" (Aug.  12)? Their "desire to make a difference" results in xenophobia and the  systematic suppression of difference. Comparing YAFers to '60s civil rights  activists and lauding their "passionate idealism" is certainly an attempt to  boost their credibility.  </P> <P> And what about Anthony Perry ("YAFers Put Song in Their Heart," Aug. 14), ever  ready to print anti-gay sentiment in his column? AIDS is not a laughing matter.  </P> <P> Why does The Times neglect groups representing opposing viewpoints, such as  YAF's self-proclaimed adversary, lesbian leftists? Or are we perceived as over  the edge of respectability? If working to end poverty, homelessness,  environmental destruction, nuclear proliferation, obscene levels of defense  spending and discrimination on the basis of race, class, gender, age, religion  or sexual orientation is viewed as unacceptable, then count me in.  </P> <P> DIANE SWICK  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

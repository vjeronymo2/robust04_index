			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets: Tax-cutting budget helps KL to scale new heights - The bull run in Kuala Lumpur Budgets usually make stock markets nervous. Not so in Kuala Lumpur, which has been scaling new heights since Mr Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's finance minister, delivered his budget to parliament last Friday. Down the road at the stock exchange, there were no signs of budgetary nervousness. As Mr Anwar spoke, the market was reaching a new record high, with the KLSE composite index climbing to 641.31. In the following days the bulls kept running. By the middle of this week the market had broken through the 650 mark for the first time, closing at 658.68 yesterday, a rise of more than 17 per cent since the beginning of the year. Trading also reached new highs, with turnover on one day this week rising to MDollars 819.7m (USDollars 328m). Market capitalisation has risen to MDollars 218bn from the level at the end of last year of MDollars 161bn and Kuala Lumpur is consolidating a position as one of the biggest and more lively markets in the region. There were plenty of leaks in advance of the budget. The market knew that the overall picture was good. Mr Anwar said that GDP growth would be 8.5 per cent this year, slowing slightly to 8 per cent next year. A current account deficit of MDollars 12bn last year will be cut back to a deficit of MDollars 7.9bn by the end of 1992. While the budget made reductions in some areas of government expenditure in an effort to control inflation and make further inroads into the current account deficit, business was heartened by corporate and income tax cuts. 'The budget was the tonic the market needed,' says one broker. 'It tackled some of the problem areas in the economy but did not try to dampen things down too much. It was still a 'go for growth' budget.' Gaming and leisure stocks such as Genting, owner of south-east Asia's biggest casino complex in the hills outside Kuala Lumpur, surged as fears about tax increases proved unfounded. Construction and engineering were buoyed by the government's commitment to a wide range of infrastructure projects. Other factors have driven the market upward. Like frightened pigeons, some money took flight from Hong Kong in the aftermath of renewed arguments between the colony and Beijing. Some of that cash has settled in Kuala Lumpur. Malaysia Telekom and Tenaga Nasional, the Malaysian electricity utility, account for nearly 30 per cent of the total market capitalisation. Telekom reported pre-tax profits of MDollars 606m for the first half of the year, up 18 per cent from the same period in 1991. Tenaga, whose share offering earlier this year was the biggest such exercise in Malaysian corporate history, this week reported a doubling of pre-tax profits to MDollars 1.41bn for the year ending August 31, 1992. Brokers say both foreign institutional investors and locals are doing some heavy dealing, not only in blue chip shares such as Telekom and Tenaga but also featuring a lot of activity in the more speculative secondary stocks. Not so long ago Kuala Lumpur would ride the wash of the Singapore market. That position is now reversed. The Singapore index, inactive for several weeks, has shown some signs of life recently. Kuala Lumpur is almost twice the size of Singapore in terms of market capitalisation. On one day this week more than 50 per cent of the total volume of trade in Singapore was in Malaysian stocks. Some analysts say Kuala Lumpur's rise is part of a traditional year-end burst of activity, as punters look forward to salary bonuses and rush to pick up stocks before renewed buying in the new year by the big institutional investors. A lot of attention will be focused on the results of a MDollars 1.74bn rights issue earlier this week by Malaysia Airlines. The airline, still more than 50 per cent government-controlled, has had various financial problems in recent years. Brokers say buoyancy in the market should help what is Malaysia's biggest rights issue so far. There are those who say the market, like the economy, shows signs of overheating and that some stocks are overbought. But there are many others who forecast that Kuala Lumpur will go through the 700 level by the end of the year. In the euphoria of a market surge, the voices of caution are few and far between.</p>

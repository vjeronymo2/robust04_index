			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] U.S. information and communications companies have  advanced a request that "the Japanese Government financially  support private firms in the project to establish  next-generation communications networks (new communications  networks that will use fiber optics) in Japan." They have made  the request because, if the government participates in the  project, it will become easier for them to obtain "guarantees"  for orders for necessary equipment to be used in the project.  The Posts and Telecommunications Ministry [PTM] and Nippon  Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) have differing views  about the project. The PTM has asserted that "the government  should financially support private firms in the project," while  NTT has said, "the project should be carried out solely by  private firms." It is possible the requests from U.S. firms,  which "reinforce" PTM's assertion, will turn into a demand that  the government guarantee a certain level of foreign capital  inflow into the project, thus leading to trade friction.    The U.S. firms' intentions were disclosed by John Stern  [name  as published] during a recent interview with NIHON KEIZAI  SHIMBUN. Mr. Stern (representative and director of the Japan  office for U.S. electronics companies) represents U.S.  information and communications companies in Japan. During the  interview, Mr. Stern said: "If private companies (such as NTT)  take total charge of the project, most orders for necessary  equipment will probably be given to Japanese businesses." He  added: "If the Japanese Government participates in the project,  U.S. firms will be able to ask Tokyo to secure the procurement  of U.S. products (through such things as Japan-U.S. trade  talks)."    The project, which is characterized by the PTM and NTT as  "an  important task directed toward the 21st century," is aimed at  setting up fiber optics communications networks, which are  capable of sending and receiving voice information and distinct  moving images, in households and offices all over Japan. The  project will become the social capital that supports multimedia  businesses. It is expected that about 30 to 50 trillion yen  will be invested in the project by the year 2010.    The Telecommunications Council (an advisory body to the  posts  and telecommunications minister), which is studying measures to  establish the new networks, plans to propose that "private firms  should be basically in charge of the project and the government  should financially support them in setting up networks in  depopulated areas, where communications business will not be  worth much." The council is to include the proposal in its  report to be submitted to the posts and telecommunications  minister in May.    The PTM's "idea of the government supporting private firms"  is also backed by some new common carriers which want to prevent  NTT from enhancing its superiority in communications business.  On the other hand, NTT, which opposes government participation  in the project, and the Finance Ministry, which hopes to cut  financial expenditures, are supporting the idea of "establishing  the networks through private firms." Thus, it is likely that  arguments over the project will continue even after the  Telecommunications Council submits its report.    During unofficial talks with NTT in January, the U.S. Trade  Representative demanded foreign participation in the project.  In reply, NTT reportedly simply said: "As in the past, we will  procure equipment through necessary procedures which are fair to  both domestic and foreign companies." It is believed that U.S.  companies are backing the idea of "the government supporting  private firms" with the hope of obtaining a surer "guarantee for  foreign participation in the project."</p>

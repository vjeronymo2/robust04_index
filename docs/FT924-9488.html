			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / World Trade News: French urge EC to fight 'bad' deal FRANCE'S farm minister, Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, yesterday urged the EC to 'counter-retaliate' against US sanctions in the oilseeds dispute, and congratulated himself and his predecessors on standing firm against the 'very bad' Gatt deal offered by the US. Mr Soisson told the French parliament 'the firmness France has shown since 1985 has finally avoided an agreement which would have been very bad for our agriculture and our economy'. The US demands were 'as unacceptable to France as to the European Commissioner, Mr Ray MacSharry', he said. In fact, the French government has privately disputed Mr MacSharry's claim that, except for the impasse over oilseeds, the EC could virtually meet the US-backed proposals of the Gatt secretariat for agricultural trade reform. Brussels has contended that recent EC farm policy reforms would reduce European cereal exports by almost as much as Washington has been seeking. 'We don't see the changes in the common agricultural policy (CAP) producing a big reduction (in EC cereal exports) from the base period of 1986-90 used by the US,' one French official said. Officials claim there were inaccuracies in the recent study by Insee, the French economic research institute, estimating CAP reform would cut EC cereal exports from over 30m tonnes in 1991-92 to less than 15m by 1996. Insee researchers omitted both durum wheat and the grain-growing potential of the former East Germany in their calculations, officials complain. In going into the final round of talks with the US, Mr MacSharry had been wrong to conclude the cereal issue was virtually settled, French officials say. Equally, they contend CAP reform would probably produce little reduction in beef and milk product exports, and nothing at all so far in shipments of sugar, poultry and pork, products not yet touched by the CAP changes. In opposing US demands, France claims to have the backing of several countries on various issues: Ireland on beef, Denmark on milk products, and Germany on cereal substitutes. For essentially political reasons, Spain's Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has said France could count on Spanish support in the Gatt talks.</p>

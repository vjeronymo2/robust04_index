			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Man in the news: Fearless skater on thin ice - Sir Leon Brittan Wedged inside the steamy, overcrowded lift, Sir Leon Brittan clutched his briefing papers and cast his eyes around for a friendly face. The word 'victory' never passed his lips; but even at 3am in the morning he was still savouring his confrontation with Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister and designated hard man in the Gatt talks. After more than 12 hours of discussions in Brussels, Sir Leon could plausibly claim that he had resisted French efforts to force a renegotiation of the EC-US Blair House accord limiting farm export subsidies, thus keeping alive hopes of reaching a Uruguay Round agreement by the end of the year. Sir Leon's clash with Mr Juppe during last Monday's EC 'jumbo' foreign, farm and trade ministers council will go down as a classic confrontation between two men with matching egos, intellect and ambition. But the price of facing down the French government could be a further weakening of Paris's confidence in the Commission as an impartial negotiator with the US, increasing the threat of a French veto of a future Gatt deal. 'He was good,' says one senior German official, 'but maybe he was too good.' Criticism that Sir Leon may be too clever for his own good has dogged his political career. Memories of his involvement, seven years ago, in a clumsy campaign to discredit Mr Michael Heseltine, then UK defence secretary, have faded; but few will forget the verdict of a fellow Conservative MP at the time: 'Too many brains, not enough common sense.' Sir Leon has learnt a trick or two since he arrived in Brussels in 1989 to take up the post of senior UK commissioner responsible for EC competition policy. His willingness to work hard and learn languages (he speaks German and French fluently) won him many admirers. Never shy of publicity, he revelled in his reputation as a fearless and eminently quotable 'trust-buster'. His new job as the EC's chief trade negotiator, which he took up last January, is more challenging. Few could have mastered the Gatt dossier so quickly; but doubts linger about his political judgment or, more accurately, his political touch. Sir Leon's relationship with Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, has improved after a rocky start. 'In the beginning, Mickey wanted to look dangerous, to show he was not afraid of breaking some furniture,' says a US lawyer who knows both men. 'Now they have come to respect each other and they share a common goal of getting a Gatt deal.' On Monday, this willingness to compromise will be put to the test. Sir Leon arrives in Washington saddled with a list of French-led demands for 'clarifying' or 'reinterpreting' Blair House. Technically, these demands do not amount to a formal renegotiation; but Sir Leon knows he risks provoking a further crisis within the EC if he comes back empty-handed. During the all-night 'jumbo' council in Brussels, Sir Leon urged ministers not to make public demands which could harden attitudes in Washington. In fact, he disclosed that he had already presented certain requests for modifying Blair House in an earlier private meeting with Mr Kantor. Concerns that ministers would tie his hands as a negotiator prompted his devastating intervention against a Franco-German compromise text, a move that provoked Mr Juppe to remind Sir Leon that, as commissioner, he was merely a servant of the assembled ministers. Sir Leon is now skating on thin ice. The question remains why he failed to respond to the hardening French attitude on Gatt in late August/early September, relying instead on Germany to act as mediator. Some believe that his inertia (which matched the passive UK government response) was born of a stubborn refusal to accept any part of the French government's case. Sir Leon's belief in the power of rational argument is unshakeable. He has little sympathy for the emotionally tinged arguments in favour of preserving French farming. 'Leon is an intellectual democrat. He will always listen to another point of view,' explains a former colleague. 'But if he thinks he is right, then he expects you to give in.' The tendency toward self-righteousness has led to skirmishes with Commission colleagues and the occasional bloody retreat. Earlier this year, Sir Leon pressed his colleagues to accept a trade liberalisation package with the former communist countries of eastern Europe, only to find himself isolated. Belatedly, he forged an alliance with his rival - Mr Hans van den Broek, the former Dutch foreign minister and now commissioner for external political af-fairs - and the two carried the day. A close Commission colleague describes Sir Leon as a brilliant negotiator who suffers from being a loner. Too often, he misses the chance to win friends by letting others take the credit for political successes. 'He lacks Fingerspitzengefuhl (political touch).' Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, is similarly ambivalent. He shares Sir Leon's enthusiasm for hard work, and admires his intellect. But Mr Delors has also been heard to grumble that Sir Leon is not very good at returning political favours, or as he puts it in French: 'Il ne rend jamais l'ascenseur.' In the same spirit, Sir Leon would argue that he is very good at pressing the right European buttons. As he showed in yesterday's speech on European monetary union, he has broken with UK government policy. He does not share Mr John Major's scepticism toward Emu, nor is he openly hostile to the idea of further political integration. On Europe, he remains as close as ever to his former political mentor, Lord Howe. There is a wider game plan. However remote a prospect, Sir Leon believes in his chances of succeeding Mr Delors as president of the Commission. He is preparing a book on Europe, and he is vigorously cultivating German support. A Gatt agreement would be a crowning achievement, not just for his own reputation but also for his candidacy for the top job in Brussels.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most significantly, the Exchange is proposing a multi-tiered structure for original listing and maintenance of securities on the Exchange. Securities may be listed pursuant to either the Tier I or Tier II listing requirements, and are distinguished with respect to blue-sky exemptions, transaction reporting, listing fees, and corresponding maintenance requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A listing under the Tier I designation generally signifies that the company has achieved maturity and high status in its industry in terms of assets, earnings, and shareholder interest and acceptance. The Tier I listing requirements for common stock include numerical as well as corporate governance policies that conform with the standards set forth in the Memorandum of Understanding between the North American Securities Administrators Association, Inc. (``NASAA'') and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (``CBOE''). <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  Any other securities that are listed pursuant to the requirements set forth in Rule 3.2, paragraphs (d) through (i), including any equity option or index product listed in accordance with Rule 3.6 or Rule 7, respectively, shall qualify for inclusion under the Tier I designation. These requirements are in uniformity with the CBOE, and also meet the same standards established by the NYSE and Amex. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Memorandum of Understanding was approved by NASAA and the CBOE on May 30, 1991. The Memorandum is reprinted in the NASAA Reports at page 601. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See CBOE, Rule 31.5; NYSE Listed Company Manual Section 7; Amex Company Guide Sections 103 to 107. In formulating these requirements, the CBOE standards were used as a benchmark because the CBOE was the most recent national securities exchange to be recognized in every state of the United States as an approved marketplace for registration exemption purposes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange's proposed Tier II designation is limited to the listing of common stock, preferred stock, bonds, debentures, and common stock purchase warrants. These listing requirements are less stringent than the requirements under Tier I, but they nevertheless include both quantitative and non-quantitative (such as corporate governance standards) requirements that are materially higher than the Exchange's existing listing standards. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  The Exchange believes that the listing of a company's securities under this designation is important because it will continue to provide small companies with access to the capital markets and will supply much-needed liquidity to public investors within a regulated marketplace. The Exchange notes that it previously submitted to the Commission a rule filing to list and trade common stock that qualifies under the Small Corporate Offering Registration/Regulation A (``SCOR'') designation. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  The proposed rule is also intended to facilitate the capital formation process for small companies. The SCOR listing requirements would, in effect, constitute a third tier of listing requirements; however, for purposes of the exchange exemption under most state blue sky laws, SCOR securities will not be deemed ``listed'' on the Exchange. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In formulating these listings requirements, the Exchange conducted a comparative analysis of the other regional stock exchanges' standards. The PSE's proposed listing requirements are at least equal to or higher than those of the other regional stock exchanges. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> These were previously designated as Small Corporate Offering Registration securities.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Exchange Act Release No. 32514 (June 25, 1993), 58 FR 35496 (July 1, 1993) (File No. SR&hyph;PSE&hyph;92&hyph;42). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In cases where a company's security does not qualify for inclusion under the Tier I designation, yet the security is listed or has been approved for listing on either the NYSE, Amex (except for so-called ``ECM'' securities) <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  or NASDAQ/NMS, the Exchange may list such security under the Tier II designation in reliance upon the listing requirements of the applicable exchange (or association). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Amex's Emerging Company Marketplace (``ECM'') accommodates the listing of growth companies which are to small to meet the Exchange's regular listing criteria. See Amex Company Guide Section 1102 (listing criteria for ECM securities). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Maintenance Requirements and Delisting Procedures. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The proposal will establish under Rule 3.5 more stringent numerical maintenance requirements, and also includes other factors or events that would invoke the suspension or delisting of a company's securities. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  As with its initial listing requirements, the Exchange's maintenance requirements will be strictly enforced. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  Whenever the issuer fails to meet any provision of the proposed maintenance requirements, the matter will be immediately evaluated by the Equity Listing Committee. The Committee will determine whether to suspend dealings in the security and/or request the issuer to take immediate action to remedy any identified deficiency. Should the issuer fail to correct any deficiency by the prescribed date, the Committee shall take action to delist the security. In cases where the issuer's security fails to meet the applicable maintenance requirements under Tier I of Rule 3.5, the security will be removed as soon as practicable from trading under this designation. The security of the company will be admitted to trading under Tier II should it meet the applicable maintenance requirements. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> These are substantially similar to the COBE's requirements (except for securities listed under the Tier II and SCOR criteria). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities listed under the Tier I designation will not be granted waivers from the Exchange's maintenance requirements. Any security that no longer meets the Tier I maintenance requirements, but meets the applicable Tier II maintenance requirements, will be reclassified as a Tier II security. The Exchange, however, may grant a waiver for the continued listing of any security in cases where the security remains listed on either the NYSE, Amex (except for so-called ``ECM'' securities), or NASDAQ/NMS; provided, however, that the Exchange determines that there is reasonable basis for a waiver. In such cases, the security will be included under the Tier II designation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Special transition rules will apply to securities listed or approved for listing prior to the effective date of this proposed rule change. At such time, to qualify for inclusion under the Tier I designation, a security must meet the applicable initial listing requirements as set forth in Rule 3.2 (including any equity option or index product listed pursuant to Rule 3.6 or Rule 7, respectively); however, a security listed on either the NYSE, Amex (except for so-called ``ECM'' securities), or NASDAQ/NMS may be designated as a Tier I security so long as it meets the applicable Tier I maintenance requirements in Rule 3.5. Any security not qualifying as a Tier I security will be designated a Tier II security. Such Security must meet the Tier II maintenance requirements within two years of the effective date of this rule change. Until that time, the Exchange's former delisting standards under PSE Rule 3.5 will be applied. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

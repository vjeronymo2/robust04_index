			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Colombian victor will face fall-out from oil boom Only about 18,000 votes separated the two leading candidates in the first round of Colombia's presidential election on Sunday, which did little more than confirm what was known before: the country's next president will be either Mr Ernesto Samper of the Liberal party or Mr Andres Pastrana of the Conservatives. Mr Samper emerged fractionally in the lead with 45.2 per cent of the vote against his rival's 44.9 per cent. The two representatives of the parties that have run Colombia since the last century now face a run-off on June 19. The third force in Colombian politics, the former guerrilla group M-19, emerges from the elections weakened: its candidate Mr Ramon Navarro, polled under 4 per cent of the vote, less than a third of what he obtained in the 1990 election. The vote was hardly a triumph for Colombian democracy. About 65 per cent of the 17.1m eligible voters abstained - high even by the standards of Colombian presidential elections. It could be worse on June 19 when the election competes with the World Cup for the attention of voters. Whoever takes over in August will follow a Liberal president who looks set to end his term as one of the most popular of recent times. President Cesar Gaviria - forbidden by law to stand for a successive term and headed for a five-year spell as head of the Organisation of American States in Washington  -has an approval rating of over 50 per cent. His policy of economic modernisation - called apertura to signify the opening of the economy to the outside world - has helped to encourage growth: 5.2 per cent last year, perhaps slightly less this year. But the criticism that it has hurt the poor, many in rural areas, appears to have contributed Mr Samper's greater emphasis on social issues in his campaign. Mr Samper would also move more slowly on the North American Free Trade Agreement than Mr Pastrana, believing Colombia should negotiate jointly with other South American partners rather than on its own. The central economic question for the four years of the next president will be how to manage the expected oil boom. As the Cusiana and Cupiagua fields come on stream, crude oil output will rise to more than 1m barrels a day by the end of the decade. The Washington-based Institute of International Finance, a think-tank owned by financial institutions, estimates oil will add an annual 0.5 per cent to growth starting next year. Already capital inflows into the country have elevated the exchange rate and this, say critics, has damaged the country's ability to export products other than raw materials, oil and cocaine. Mr Juan Manuel Santos, trade minister, says the government will need to continue strict fiscal discipline and spend mainly to enhance both the country's inadequate infrastructure and to improve education. To stop economic overheating, it should also establish a fund outside the country, which could, for example, buy foreign companies to ensure retail outlets for Colombian products in industrialised countries. However, critics of apertura, such as Mr Eduardo Sarmiento, dean of economics at the University of the Andes in Bogota, reckon a much more activist government policy is needed to direct the dividends from oil to investment in other areas. Mr Sarmiento, who says he has the ear of Mr Samper, argues that too much of current growth arises from consumption of imports, which is expanding the trade deficit, and from growth in construction of office blocks and luxury housing, which masks the fall in employment caused by apertura by providing low quality jobs. The problems of overabundance are not the only ones facing the next government. Violence continues at an alarming rate - some 29,000 people are murdered each year in a country of 33.4m people. The persistence of drugs traffickers, guerrillas and widespread banditry is not much help in the government's search for foreign investment. The government also faces a battle with overseas human rights groups, such as Amnesty International, which say the government has not faced up to the role of its own armed forces and police in political killings. Neither will the drugs issue go away. The decision by the country's constitutional court that, in effect, legalises the use of small amounts of drugs for personal consumption has raised the question of why, if consumption is legal, should trade in drugs be illegal. Both candidates have reiterated they will fight either through a referendum or congressional action to reverse the court decision.</p>

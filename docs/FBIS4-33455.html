			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Cuban economic developments monitored from Havana  radio sources in Spanish between 30 May and 2 June:    Radio Reloj at 1949 GMT on 30 May reports that nearly 850  caballerias of sugarcane have been planted in Las Tunas Province  as part of the spring planting plan, despite the recent intense  rainfall.    Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 31 May reports that two  researchers at Comandante Ernesto Che Guevara nickel factory  have developed a new method to reduce the filtering and drying  procedure while increasing the quality of the nickel sulfur  produced.    Radio Reloj at 0204 GMT on 31 May reports that nearly 10,900  caballerias have been weeded in Las Tunas Province as part of  the 1994 sugarcane harvest efforts.    Radio Rebelde at 0900 GMT on 1 June reports that 1,023  low-cost houses have been built in Granma Province in 1994.    Radio Rebelde also reports that the (Chillinma) shipyard in  Havana City has recently finished construction of three lobster  boats to the Batabano Fishing Complex.    Radio Rebelde at 1155 GMT on 1 June reports that the (Input)  factory, in Santa Clara City, has built its 100,000th bicycle.    Radio Rebelde also reports that in Las Tunas, the cost per  patient for the 22 residents in a Jobabo municipal home for the  elderly is 2.53 pesos daily, covering food and care only.    Radio Rebelde at 0900 GMT on 2 June reports that in  Cienfuegos Municipality the municipal committee of the Communist  Party of Cuba has called for a day of sugarcane planting and  weeding at the Pepito Tey Complex. Jesus Rodriguez Diaz,  provincial PCC first secretary, reported that only 75  caballerias had been weeded during May.    Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 2 June reports that  approximately 2,000 caballerias of tobacco will be planted,  tended, and harvested with the aid of foreign capital. Spanish,  Dutch, and Swedish companies will invest over $25 million to  finance the necessary resources for the tobacco crop. The  largest number of the tobacco caballerias -- 1,600 -- are  located in Pinar del Rio Province, 65 in Havana Province; 119 in  Villa Clara; and 195 in Sancti Spiritus.    Radio Rebelde also reports that the planting of "power  forests" -- quick-growth trees to produce coal -- is not  progressing well, or in those places where the planting goals  are met, the forests are planted far from the sites where the  energy is required. Rebelde adds that the entire planting  program is going to undergo a thorough review.    Radio Reloj at 1930 GMT on 2 June reports the Liberacion de  Fomento Cane Cutters Brigade in Sancti Spiritus is the first  brigade to reach the goal of 4 million arrobas in the current  harvest; adding that the brigade used 161 days to complete the  volume with a daily productivity of approximately 25,000  arrobas. The report also says the brigade completed its work at  the Ramon Ponciano Mill and has been transferred to Yaguajay,  where it will work at the Obdulio Morales Mill.    Radio Rebelde at 2300 GMT on 2 June reports the first oil  pipeline built in Moa, located on Cuba's northern coast, began  to operate today with the arrival of a Cypriot supertanker which  brought 50,000 tons of crude oil. The report says the system is  built with pipes which have a 24-inch diameter and it measures  approximately 4 km -- 1 km of this is submerged. The  information says the pipeline will replace the old system, which  used smaller boats to transfer the oil given the area water's  shallow depth. Local nickel plants need more than 500,000 tons  of crude oil per year and the use of small boats renderd  operations extremely expensive. The state spent approximately  $4 million on the new pipeline, but this will be recovered in  about two years given the lower transportation expenses. The  old system cost the country $500,000 per month.</p>

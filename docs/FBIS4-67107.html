			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Dr. Hasan </F> Rowhani, Ayatollah Khamene'i's deputy on the Supreme National  Security Council, by an unidentified RESALAT correspondent in  Tehran; date not given]    [Excerpts] [RESALAT] As the secretary of the Supreme  National Security Council, what image of domestic and external  security would you project for the Islamic Republic of Iran?  What would constitute the most serious threats at home and  abroad?    [Rowhani] The image of national security is wonderful,  although not ideal. We are talking of the security of a country  in which there were changes in every area 15 years ago, when a  rare kind of revolution reached fruition. This revolution has  numerous enemies. Similarly, we have put behind us a prolonged  and major war that lasted eight years, the marks and effects of  which have not been obliterated. We are constantly encountering  the mischief-making of the counterrevolutionary groups.    Compared with our Northern, Eastern, and Western neighbors,  our security is remarkable. The condition of our Southern  neighbors is different and a vast array of foreign military  forces is present. We should view their situation differently.  In those areas, security is provided by others and for their  own interests.    We still have some centers of insecurity in the west and  east  of the country. In the West, Iraq is the root cause of  insecurity. In Kordestan, the vestiges of lackey grouplets  remain active. A country that has borne the brunt of war for  eight years, a war that has included security issues, cannot  efface them fast. [passage omitted]    In the eastern regions we have pockets of insecurity  stemming  from the problem of narcotics. The issue of combating drug  smugglers is tackled mostly for human considerations.  Generally, the smugglers do not want to distribute drugs in  Iran. They mostly want their goods to transit through Iran.  The center for manufacturing narcotics is in a region outside  Iran, between Pakistan and Afghanistan. They want to use Iran  as a route to convey the drugs to Europe and the United States.  The primary users of drugs are the Americans and then the  Europeans.    The main drug dealers and smugglers are also in the United  States and Europe. At times, even Western officials are  involved in this smuggling, which was exposed during recent  humiliating discoveries in Europe and the United States.    If the corruption in Europe and the United States and the  straying of their youth were not important for us, we could  ignore our campaign against the smugglers and, naturally, the  eastern regions of the country would become completely safe.    It is because of our sense of responsibility toward the fate  of mankind that we continue this struggle against these death  peddlers. Unfortunately, the Westerners are not only ungrateful  to our self-sacrificing forces, they castigate us for our  treatment and execution of the smugglers and label it human  rights violations.    But we consider ourselves beholden to the fate of humans, as  the happiness, health, and good fortune of our fellow beings is  one of our mottoes. Thus we can say that we have two centers of  insecurity, one of which relates to Iraq and the other to  narcotics. [passage omitted]</p>

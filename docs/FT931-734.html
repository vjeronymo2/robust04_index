			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Latin American Finance (1): Top of investors' agenda worldwide - One in every three new investment dollars now allocated worldwide in equity is reported to be going into emerging markets. Latin America is winning an important share IT could be one of the most important financial developments of the 1990s, setting investment trends into the 21st century - or perhaps just another financial fad. Megatrend or a flash in the pan, Latin America has in the last three years pushed itself to the top of the agendas of investors - individual, financial and corporate - worldwide. The reasons are both internal and external to the region. Internally, economic policies offering prospects for stability and a return to growth are being pursued by governments no longer hostile to private capital. The cloud of the 1980s foreign debt crisis has lifted in some countries, thanks to low US interest rates and negotiated debt relief. Externally, low returns in established markets have forced investors to look further afield to improve performance. Michael Howell, of Baring Securities global strategy unit in London, reckons: 'One in every three new investment dollars now allocated worldwide in equity is going into emerging markets.' Of this, Latin America is getting an important share. Mr Howell often describes to investors an ideal investment portfolio for the turn of the century. The portfolio is only 54 per cent invested in the staid markets of the industrialised world: the rest is in the emerging markets of developing countries. One-fifth is concentrated in Latin America. Yet this is no portfolio of the future, but a typical British investment spread in 1913. Mr Howell argues that, after years in which emerging markets were ignored, history is turning a full circle. Richard Watt was recently appointed head of Latin American investments for Gartmore Investment Management, which manages around Pounds 12.8bn (Dollars 19bn) of funds. Gartmore has recommended to clients that they put up to 1 1/2 -2 per cent of their portfolios in newer emerging markets. Around 70 per cent of that will go to Latin America. Gartmore has already placed Pounds 40m of investment in the region since the start of the year. Pension funds in Britain account for more than Pounds 300bn of investments. Philippa Armitage of Fleming Investment Management believes UK institutions will approach Latin America as they did Asia's emerging markets some years ago, initially committing perhaps 1-2 per cent before building up to higher levels. UK institutions are lagging Dutch and, in particular, US investors. In the US alone, institutions hold some Dollars 6,000bn. There, some consultants are recommending significantly larger exposure to Latin America. They see economies with good growth prospects, attractive share valuations and the scope to increase return by diversifying portfolios and thereby reducing risk. EVEN if a fraction of this money makes its way into Latin America on a sustainable basis, it can make a huge difference. Yet investors are still cautious after the 1980s debt crisis, unsure about the durability of the improved economic performance. There are questions about the ability of markets to absorb a large influx of funds. Investors rarely complain about inadequate settlement procedures - except in Venezuela - but the markets in most shares are thin and prone to overshoot. This volatility of Latin stock markets was forcefully underlined last year. Stocks hit new highs in the first half of the year and then collapsed, leaving investors with meagre returns and a large number of proposed international equity offerings high and dry. The market for Latin American bonds also had its share of troubles: the latter part of the year saw a glut of over-priced bond issues which sold poorly. Some underwriters only cleared their books of these issues with this year's fortuitous drop in US interest rates: they may as a result be more cautious in the future. These problems, providing investors with their first real setbacks since private capital began flowing back into Latin America at the start of the 1990s, contributed to a slowing of portfolio investment into the region last year. That interest among portfolio investors in the region continues to grow after such difficulties suggests the return of foreign capital to the region may be more than a transitory phenomenon. Despite this, an important proportion of the inflows - too high for comfort  -has been of volatile short-term capital. This has been attracted by high real interest rates in the region which are a consequence of tight monetary policies aimed at curbing inflation. Dependence on short-term capital to cover current account deficits - such funding is estimated to make up between a third and a half of Mexico's capital inflows - carries risks. It can flee as quickly as it arrived, with harsh consequences on interest rates, growth and economic policy. Over-dependence on volatile foreign capital has underlined the need for reform to boost domestic savings, following the example of Chile where private pension funds have stimulated growth of local capital markets. Throughout the region, foreign banks are showing a growing interest in local capital markets. There has also been a significant influx of long-term capital, foreign direct investment (FDI) with the potential to expand the region's productive capacity. As portfolio flows slowed last year, foreign direct investment is estimated to have continued growing. No longer viewing such investment with the suspicion of the past, the region's governments are doing what they can to attract it. Some FDI has been spurred by privatisation, an unrepeatable phenomenon, but much has also been driven by growth prospects and expected progress towards regional economic integration, which translates into bigger domestic markets. CAPITAL inflows have opened in some countries the prospect of a future path to sustainable growth. They do not guarantee it, however. Latin America is in the early stages of an economic transformation that involves the destruction of much old industrial capacity. Industries once protected by high tariffs and import quotas are no longer viable. This restructuring - together with the slimming down of government - implies unemployment for important, and often powerful, sectors of society. Yet the economic benefits of new investment, if indeed it continues, could take years to become evident. Since elected governments now hold sway in most of the region - and in the next two years almost every country faces a presidential election - there is a risk of a reaction in economic policy. Even if economic success is enjoyed by some countries, others may miss out. The economic prospects for the largest economy - Brazil - are highly uncertain. Governments face social problems - big income inequalities and poverty that worsened throughout the 1980s. In two big economies, Argentina and Mexico, inflation has been tackled in part with policies that have encouraged an appreciation of the real exchange rate. These countries and others have experienced widening current account deficits, raising questions about whether they can be financed on a sustainable basis. Absent Brazil's big trade surplus, the region's widening current account deficit underlines that whatever investment so far has taken place, it has yet to create an important base for exports. The reform of the region's economies has given Latin America a heightened dependence on foreign capital, external economic conditions and the world trading system. The auguries are strong for continued flows of new finance to Latin America. Yet most of the region's governments have placed their bets on a system of free markets and free trade, a system now being questioned in the US, the region's most important trading partner, and elsewhere in the industrialised world.</p>

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / International Company News: Hafnia tumbles to DKr1.39bn deficit FALLING security values last year sent Hafnia Holding, which heads the big Danish insurance and financial services sector, into a loss of DKr1.39bn (Dollars 217m) compared with profits of DKr1.52bn in 1989. Mr Per Villum Hansen, chief executive, said that by the middle of this month most of last year's unrealised losses on securities had been recouped as the markets recovered. 'We are fairly optimistic because Hafnia's underlying business continues to make good progress,' he said. As from 1989, gains and losses on securities must be taken in the profit and loss account, not the balance sheet, which has contributed to see-sawing profit and loss figures in the Danish insurance groups. Hafnia's current battle to gain control of its domestic rival Baltica also contributed to the profits turnround. The group acquired 33.7 per cent in Baltica Holding and 12 per cent in Baltica Insurance during the year-long battle. The cost of financing this DKr4.53bn investment was the principal factor in an increase of DKr350m in financial costs. The losses on securities reduced equity capital to DKr5.3bn from DKr6.3bn at the end of 1989. Earnings per share slumped from DKr162 to a negative DKr154 and book value per share from DKr663 to DKr476. Premium income in the insurance business increased from DKr5.70bn to DKr6.98bn, reflecting primarily the acquisition of the UK's Prolific Group and Denmark's Forenede Assurandorer in the autumn of 1989. In a statement to the stock exchange the group said the results in the current year will depend to a large extent on developments in the bond and share markets and it was therefore too soon to make a forecast, but group profits on ordinary business activities are expected to exceed the 1990 figure. An unchanged DKr10 per share dividend was proposed.</p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / People: European Leisure makes two key appointments European Leisure, the deeply troubled disco and snooker hall owner that is grappling with a mountain of debt as well as being the subject of an uncompleted Serious Fraud Office investigation, has hired a new non-executive chairman and group finance director. But yesterday's announcement failed to lift the shares which languish at 2 3/4 p. Clive Bastin, 55, national managing partner of accountants Spicer &amp; Oppenheim until shortly before it merged with Touche Ross, will be non-executive chairman. He replaces Geoffrey Nichols, who had been standing in since last July when Michael Ward resigned from his position as chairman andchief executive. Since leaving Spicer, Bastin has been developing a portfolio of interests; he is deputy chairman of Frogmore Estates and of Clarke Hooper, and he came recommended by a merchant bank, according to Ian Rock, group managing director. Replacing Christopher Critchlow, who stepped down as finance director in April because he did not want to relocate with the company to Leicestershire, is Patrick Hooper. Hooper, 44, has been at booksellers Pentos since 1977, latterly as group finance director. Asked why he should wish to leave the booksellers for European Leisure, Ian Rock commented: 'He understands retailing, and obviously he was attracted by the opportunity to move forward from what is perceived as a low base.' Hooper was unavailable for comment yesterday. European Leisure, which owns the Hippodrome and Camden Palace discos, is in the midst of a programme of disposals in France and Mallorca, but this has been proceeding more slowly than expected because of the recession and lack of bank lending, Rock explains. When the company reported results for the six months ending December 31 1991, bank borrowings stood at Pounds 76m, a gearing ratio of 217 per cent. Rock says the SFO investigation, connected with the 1990 acquisition of Midsummer Leisure, does not concern the current management: 'We rarely hear from them. It is almost as if it (the investigation) doesn't exist.' ***** Richard Burgess, finance director of SPEYHAWK, has been appointed finance director of Chartwell Land, the property subsidiary of KINGFISHER; Robert Fish, finance director of Speyhawk's principal trading subsidiaries, has been appointed group finance director in his place. ***** Jean-Pierre Garnier, president North America pharmaceuticals, has been appointed to the main board of SMITHKLINE BEECHAM. ***** Garry Campbell has been appointed md of the UK import and distribution division of TKM, part of INCHCAPE. ***** Yves Dominioni has been appointed president directeur generale of Atal, a subsidiary of BULLOUGH. ***** Paul Matthews has been appointed group finance director and company secretary of CAKEBREAD ROBEY. ***** Richard McClean (above), deputy chief executive of the Financial Times, is stepping down next July after 38 years with the group. McClean's FT career started in the advertisement department and he became the first advertisement director to join the FT board. He was appointed FT managing director under Alan Hare and has been deputy chief executive to Frank Barlow and David Palmer, the current chief executive. He developed the 'No FT .. no comment' campaign and played a leading role in expanding the paper's printing and circulation outside the UK. He says he intends to continue in business and will retain his enthusiasm for the 'whole area of media and communications'. Outside the newspaper, his interests include Roman remains and charitable activities at Trident Trust which provides work experience for young people. ***** Nigel Horne (below right) has been appointed non-executive chairman of Alcatel Network Systems UK, a subsidiary of Alcatel, the French telecommunications manufacturing giant. Horne, a well-known figure in the UK telecommunications industry, was director of technology at STC, the electronics group, until its takeover by Canada's Northern Telecom in 1990. Before that, he worked for GEC, the electronics group. Alcatel Network Systems UK was established last year mainly to market Alcatel's telecommunications infrastructure products in the UK. Horne, 52, is its first chairman.</p>

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Information technology suffers Europe's information technology industry suffered its worst year in 1993, and has only limited prospects for growth next year, according to a report from the European Information Technology Observatory, the commission's co-ordinating group for IT. Growth in the European IT market was 2 per cent in 1993, down from annual growth of 15 per cent five years ago. EITO said faster deregulation and a harmonisation of standards were essential to allow European groups to compete on equal terms with US companies. The US market grew by 7 per cent last year and now accounts for 37 per cent of the world market. Japan accounts for 16 per cent, compared with the EU's 29 per cent. However, with new markets opening up in eastern Europe and in technological fields straddling telecommunications and IT, EITO predicted that the Ecu262bn (Pounds 198bn) European IT market could grow by around 3.6 per cent in 1994.</p>

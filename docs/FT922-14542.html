			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Gains for far right parties in German state polls A SURGE of votes for the extreme right stunned Germany's established parties in two state elections yesterday, with Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) losing its long-held absolute majority in Baden-Wurttemberg. Provisional results indicated the Social Democrats (SPD) lost ground in Schleswig-Holstein but clung to a bare majority of seats. The rightwing Republicans, who campaigned for tougher laws to keep out foreign asylum-seekers, got 10.9 per cent of votes in the prosperous, industrial state of Baden-Wurttemberg, entering parliament in Stuttgart for the first time. The far-right German People's Union (DVU) won 6.3 per cent of votes in the more rural state of Schleswig-Holstein, clearing the 5 per cent hurdle to enter the state parliament in Kiel. The main issues - the influx of asylum-seekers, housing, and fear of unemployment - had been expected to boost the right-wing vote. But the outcome was more dramatic than expected. The Republicans attracted support from young working-class people and the self-employed, according to a survey carried out yesterday. Some 16 per cent of blue-collar voters and 13 per cent of all those under 30 chose them. In Schleswig-Holstein, Mr Gerhard Frey, founder-leader of the DVU, said his party's result was a 'spectacular success', and attributed it to 'the inability of the old parties to solve the problem of phoney asylum - seekers'. He said his party's cause was helped by Bonn's willingness to give up the D-Mark in the interests of European union. 'We are not against foreigners, we are for Germans,' he said. The result is a resounding snub to both Mr Kohl and to Mr Bjorn Engholm, the Schleswig-Holstein premier and SPD national leader who will challenge Mr Kohl in 1994. It also increases pressure on the SPD to go along with curbs on the flow of asylum-seekers. Some 35,000, a record for a single month, arrived in March, mostly from Yugoslavia and Romania. Mr Engholm said: 'These are protest votes and all the major parties must reflect and ask themselves, 'What we have we done wrong?'' Mr Erwin Teufel, the CDU premier of Baden-Wurttemberg, said he would consider various coalition possibilities but ruled out co-operation with the Republicans. Provisional returns in Baden-Wurttemberg gave the CDU 39 per cent of the vote (compared with 49 per cent in 1988); SPD 29 (32); Greens 9.5 (7.9); FDP 5.9 (5.9); Republicans 10.9 (1.0). In Schleswig-Holstein, the SPD saw its 54.8 per cent share of the vote cut to 46 per cent. The CDU got 33.8 per cent, almost identical to their previous 33.5 per cent. Election officials said initially the Greens just cleared the 5 per cent hurdle, but then said they had just failed.

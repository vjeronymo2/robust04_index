			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Arts: Carmen Jones - Old Vic To go as an opera-lover to Carmen Jones might seem to be tempting fate even more flagrantly than Carmen does herself. There is a belief, hopefully misplaced, that those who appreciate opera in its traditional form will be outraged by any adaptation, even one as successful as Oscar Hammerstein II's version of this favourite Bizet masterpiece. The problem, though, generally lies with the adaptations. In recent years we have seen well-meaning attempts to cross the cultural barrier with The Marriage of Figaro and Don Giovanni (the former made it to the West End, briefly) but they remained apologies for the real thing, less well sung than an opera, not so much fun as a musical. Carmen Jones is not like them. It throws its inhibitions aside in the wings and takes the stage as if it owns it. This London production opened last week and on Monday night introduced its second cast, the one with a 'show-biz' element, rather than all opera singers. This brought us a brash and glamorous Carmen in Sharon Benson, a bit too keen to be the star of the show perhaps but full of life, and a touchingly plain and honest Joe in the operatic tenor Michael Austin. He has all the notes, while she struggles from time to time in the upper voice, but both know how to put the music across. And for that they must thank Bizet and Mr Hammerstein in just about equal measure. In this version, music and story are transported to the Deep South in the dark days of World War II. Bizet's cigarette factory in Seville becomes a parachute factory, where black manual labour works to sustain the war effort over lazy, jazz-inspired choruses, while the lure of gypsy life in the mountains is replaced by the bright lights of Chicago. How well it all works, too, after updatings at the opera-house, like Pountney's unconvincing street-cred Carmen at ENO. The world of Hammerstein's black America affords an entertaining milieu. There is a touching Cindy Lou from Karen Parks and the towering Gregg Baker, a fine baritone, is a natural for the heavyweight champion Husky Miller; but it is the wealth of fine performances in the smaller roles, mostly well directed by Simon Callow, that gives this musical its depth of character. With Henry Lewis, a longtime expert in Carmen and Carmen Jones in charge in the pit, there was never any worry that the music would fail to flare into life. It is not his fault that the last scene is so weak. Hammerstein, mindful no doubt of the stamina of his singers, cut the last duet to the point where the music that remains can in no way carry the action, and the two lead players fatally let the drama slip through their fingers. Otherwise this is a fun show.</p>

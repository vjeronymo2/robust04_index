			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER;  </P> <P> FIREWORKS RECEIVE 4TH OF JULY REPRIEVE  </P> <P> Fireworks will be legal in Westminster during next year's Fourth of July,  regardless of the outcome of a June referendum.  </P> <P> The City Council voted 4 to 1 this week to place the referendum on the June,  1990, ballot to let voters decide whether fireworks should be banned in the  city.  </P> <P> They also voted that the ban, if approved, would not go into effect until next  August, so that organizations selling fireworks could do so one last time.  </P> <P> The council had the option of calling for a special election in March, which  would have cost about $38,000, or placing the issue on the ballot during a  primary or general election at a cost of about $13,000.  </P> <P> The referendum is the result of efforts made by a citizens group that collected  the 3,734 signatures needed to qualify the referendum for the ballot. The group  began collecting the signatures after the council approved a fireworks-banning  ordinance on Sept. 12.  </P> <P> The council rescinded the ordinance on Nov. 28 to place the issue before the  voters.

			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Stores active as Dow recovers early decline Wall Street US EQUITIES recovered from a weak start to leave leading indices little changed on the day, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at its overnight level of 3,208.63, after having fallen to 3,191.86 in the morning. Volume on the New York SE was unexceptional, with 180.3m shares changing hands. In spite of the Dow's subsequent recovery, declining issues still led rises at the close by 1,017 to 611, but the broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index was finally just 0.14 off at 403.89. Silicon Graphics plummeted Dollars 4 3/4 to Dollars 21 7/8 in unusually heavy volume after the company agreed to acquire Mips Computer Systems in a stock-swap merger. Mips jumped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 13 1/2 in active over-the-counter trading. Retail issues were actively traded. Lands End, the big US catalogue retailer, climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 34 3/4 on the back of fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 1.10 a share, up from 78 cents a year earlier. In contrast, Dayton Hudson saw operating profit fall in all three of its divisions for the year. Same store sales rose by only 2 per cent year-on-year for the group overall. Dayton Hudson tumbled Dollars 5 3/4 to Dollars 61 1/8 on the results. Wal-Mart firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 52 7/8 after boosting its quarterly dividend from 4.25 cents a share to 5.25 cents. Traditionally, the discount retailer has been a low-yielding stock, since the company has preferred to plough money back into the business. Gap Stores moved ahead Dollars 2 to Dollars 44 3/4 on unexpectedly strong February sales. Schlumberger added Dollars 2 1/8 at Dollars 57 after Goldman Sachs repeated a 'buy' rating on the stock. Black &amp; Decker, the US power tool and home appliance maker, dipped Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 23 1/2 on news that it had filed for a public offering of shares in its information systems and services business. The company also filed to offer 18m shares of its own stock. The shares are expected to bring in net proceeds of about Dollars 350m, including the repayment of some inter-company debts. In the secondary market, the Nasdaq composite was quoted 1.22 lower at 615.92. Canada SAGGING gold shares led the Toronto market to another weak finish in active trading. The composite index shed 23.7 to 3,479.8 and declines outpaced advances by 375 to 177 after volume of 30.1m shares. The gold sub-group fell 2.04 per cent as spot gold lost USDollars 3.10 to USDollars 347.65 an ounce in New York. American Barrick, the sector's most heavily weighted issue, retreated CDollars  7/8 to CDollars 31. Trizec reported lower first-quarter earnings and plans to make an equity offering this year to reduce debt. The 'B' shares dipped CDollars  1/4 to CDollars 8 5/8 .</p>

			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Survey of Milton Keynes (5): A competitive destination - Company Relocations AN important difference between Milton Keynes and other towns and cities looking for new investment and relocating companies in the past decade was that there was not much industry in Milton Keynes in the first place. Swindon and Peterborough - towns similar to Milton Keynes in that they grew rapidly in the 1980s - were both railway towns with a pool of skilled labour that new companies could utilise and build on. Similarly, south Wales and the north-east of England had declining industries such as steel, coal and shipbuilding, all of which shed labour in recent years. But Milton Keynes' lack of an indigenous labour force did not act as a deterrent to new investors. At first the development corporation and later the private sector made sure that enough houses (about 45,000 ) across a wide price range were built to accommodate the workers and managers that relocating companies would need. The absence of an industrial past, so to speak, had three effects. Milton Keynes has a smaller-than-average manufacturing sector for somewhere so close to the Midlands. It has comparatively few large companies. And it has a relatively young workforce. There are few very large manufacturing concerns, although there are a considerable number of medium-size light manufacturing companies involved in component manufacturing. The manufacturing sector employs 21 per cent of the workforce, below the national average. A recent employment survey undertaken by the Milton Keynes Development Corporation showed that the two largest categories of companies were those which employed less than 20 people and less than 100. Only 160 companies have more than 100 employees. Sixty companies employ more than 200 people and only 15 employ more than 500. Service and distribution companies dominate among the largest concerns and the smallest. The biggest employer is now the bank, Abbey National, which has 3,500 workers on the payroll, but it has only grown to this size in the past four years. In 1987 it employed 800. At that time the largest employer was the Open University which employed 2,300, similar to the number it employs today. Other large companies are the Argos group, the catalogue showroom retailer, and motor car distributors such as Volkswagen. Companies in the service sector and manufacturing have flocked to Milton Keynes because of its strategic location, because there is plenty of space for working, living and parking and because its costs remain low compared with London, the south-east and Birmingham. Of the 3,300 registered companies or parts of companies, 2,500 have established themselves in Milton Keynes in the past 20 years. In the early 1980s, when Abbey National found itself bursting at the seams in its headquarters in London's Baker Street, it wanted somewhere cheaper but close enough to London so that an important number of staff would move either by commuting or by physically relocating. It also wanted a location where there were no larger employers, particularly in the service sector. Milton Keynes fitted the bill. Mr David Woollcott, group personnel manager, says: 'We wanted somewhere which was close enough to London for executives to come and go to the London headquarters. We still operate management, treasury and corporate functions from there. But we also wanted a place where other key staff would work.' More than half the 800 employees of the early 1980s came from the London office. As the company has expanded, staff either commute in or have been taken on locally. Mr Woollcott says: 'There are trains every 20 minutes to London's Euston which is just up the road from Baker Street. The fastest trains take just 35 minutes.' Mr Woollcott also says the company likes the space and lack of congestion in Milton Keynes. Parking is easy, although Abbey employees have to pay a small fee because their office buildings are near the station and their car parks were apt to be invaded by commuters. Parking used to be free. BRS, formerly British Road Services, is in the process of moving 200 employees into newly acquired offices in Milton Keynes. The company says the space and good communications were important considerations in selection of the city. Ms Sue Simpson, marketing manager of the transport group, says: 'We looked at Bedford, where our parent company NFC (formerly the National Freight Corporation) is based. But Bedford is basically a market town with parking problems and congestion. 'We also looked at various business parks. The trouble with these are that they are usually on the outskirts of town, and you either have to build your own amenities, canteens, gyms and leisure facilities or see the staff travelling into the nearest town for lunch. Here in Milton Keynes, you can have the best of both worlds. You are right in the middle of town, so there are pubs, restaurants and shops close by. But it is also easy to get in and out and park.' The space and lack of congestion was also attractive to Mr Kyoshi Watano, managing director of Alps Electric (UK), one of the 43 Japanese concerns in Milton Keynes. The Milton Keynes Development Corporation was never able to offer grants and other incentives of the kind offered by areas such as south Wales and the north-east. But it was able to offer land and factories which would enable expansion. Alps started up five years ago with 80 employees. It makes electrical components for VCRs and televisions. Mr Watano says: 'We wanted to be in England for our European operation because of the English language, and to be near other Japanese companies - particularly our customers. I looked at south Wales, and also Telford, but I chose Milton Keynes because this was the best for distribution for all our customers. One of our customers is Philips which is in Holland. They might not have liked it if we had gone to Wales because Sony is there.' Asked whether the company did not mind going without the incentives available in Wales or Scotland, Mr Watano says: 'Grants do not make a company; it is the quality of the people. Here, there are good, well-trained people.' Even without subsidies, Milton Keynes remains a competitive relocation destination. Wages are between 10 and 20 per cent below those in London. With the recession throwing people who commuted to London or Birmingham on to the local market, fears of skills shortages have receded. Office rents at Pounds 15 a sq ft are a third of those in central London. There is plenty of land left for offices, factories and houses. Milton Keynes is an hour's drive from Heathrow airport and just over half an hour on the train from London. Once the economy improves, Milton Keynes should again see an inflow of investment on a substantial scale.</p>

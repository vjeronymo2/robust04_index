			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pristina, 14 Jan (TANJUG) -- Ibrahim Rugova,  president of the Democratic Alliance of Kosovo (DSK), today  welcomed the NATO decision on partnership with eastern European  countries made at the summit in Brussels. At a news conference,  he did not comment on the NATO threat to bomb the Bosnian Serb  positions, but only said that "the threat is realistic." The  DSK leader described as positive British Prime Minister John  Major's statement on "the policy of prevention in Kosovo."  Rugova said that the incidents on the Yugoslav-Albanian border  are "a provocation against Albania, but also against the ethnic  Albanians in Kosovo." Rugova did not elaborate further on any  of these issues, nor on his habitual claim about "the repression  against the Albanians in Kosovo."</p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Demand outstripping health funds - A survey by a group of world pharmaceutical companies DESPITE the efforts of many countries to reform their healthcare systems, the gap between demand for health services and the funds available to pay for them will continue to grow, according to a new survey published today. The survey, which covers the health services in 12 countries, has been financed by 40 of the world's largest drug companies. They have formed a new organisation, Pharmaceutical Partners for Better Healthcare, to lobby for health reforms to meet the growing demand. Next week, President Bill Clinton is due to announce his reform package for the US health system, including compulsory membership of healthcare schemes for all citizens. The survey, which has been seen by the task force producing Mr Clinton's reforms, endorses many of the elements expected to be in the package. The survey says all countries are facing rising health costs. Figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development show that spending on health as a proportion of national income has more than doubled for many countries in 30 years. The UK now spends three times as much in real terms on healthcare per person as 30 years ago, the US and Germany four times and France five times. The two main causes of this growth are technological innovation, which has led to new and more expensive types of treatment, and demographic change, with growing numbers of elderly people who use more health services. The growth is faster than many countries think they can afford, according to the survey. Most of the 12 countries surveyed have launched reform programmes, but these are often deeply unpopular. In many cases, countries are resorting to short-term measures to curb the growth in costs. But piecemeal measures are often counter-productive, the survey says, since saving money in one sector often forces up costs elsewhere. Introducing charges for consulting family doctors, for example, will increase demand for hospital treatment if that remains free. The survey argues that only structural reforms, which should aim to create systems that provide incentives for doctors and patients to economise, will work in the long run. On present projections, demand for health services will outstrip funding by between 2 per cent of GDP in the US and 9 per cent in the UK and the Netherlands, calculates the National Economic Research Associates, the economic consultants who carried out the survey. The NERA survey identifies principles that should guide healthcare reform. These include compulsory competitive insurance systems which guarantee a basic package of health services. None of the 12 countries provides a perfect model, according to NERA, though the ideal prototype partly resembles reforms now being implemented in the Netherlands. In the US, with its private insurance system, universal access to basic health services is the key to reform, the survey says. For European countries with tax-funded health systems, such as Britain or Sweden, more competition is required to provide incentives for greater efficiency. Mr Richard Rapp of NERA says: 'There are many lessons to be learned from the experiences of other countries. But don't look to any of the countries for the answer.' Patient choice is an essential element in increasing efficiency. If an insurer fails to keep costs down, their members should be able to change to other, cheaper insurers. But patients should also be expected to contribute towards the cost of their healthcare to foster cost-conscious behaviour. The role of governments is to set standards and define the range of services to which everyone is entitled. While governments should not have a dominant role in financing or monitoring the system, they are the only bodies that can launch the legislative and administrative changes needed for structural reform, the survey concludes.

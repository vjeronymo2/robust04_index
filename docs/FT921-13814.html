			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Lager group thirsts for real ale LOVERS of traditional ale are facing the possibility that a famous British brewer could be taken over by a fashionable Dutch lager company. Grolsch, the Dutch brewer of the premium lager, is in talks with Courage about the acquisition of Ruddles, the Leicestershire-based brewer of real ale founded in 1858. The deal could be worth about Pounds 40m, according to industry estimates. Ruddles, based in Langham, Leicestershire, was acquired by Courage, the UK arm of Fosters Brewing, the Australian group, in a pubs-for-breweries swap with Grand Metropolitan last year. It has estimated national sales of 300,000 barrels a year. Courage said yesterday: 'Grolsch have put forward an interesting proposal which may offer us mutual benefits.' Grolsch, which dates back even further than Ruddles to 1615, said it planned to preserve the Ruddles brand name and to protect the interests of employees. The acquisition is part of Grolsch's aim of establishing a strong presence across north-west Europe from Britain to Germany and Poland. It entered the UK market in 1979. Its lager brand, supported by advertising campaigns featuring its distinctive bottle and the slogan 'you can't top a Grolsch', rapidly gained a niche in the packaged beer sector. During the past 14 months, Grolsch has signed agreements to supply the lager on draught. Total sales in 1991 grew by about 20 per cent to 165,000 barrels and account for 40 per cent of exports. The purchase of Ruddles would boost sales by nearly 15 per cent to more than Fl 800m (Pounds 250m). Trading in Grolsch shares was suspended on the Amsterdam stock exchange prior to the announcement yesterday. The shares closed on Thursday, up Fl 2.50 to Fl 185, near their 12-month high.</p>

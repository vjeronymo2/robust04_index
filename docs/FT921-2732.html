			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / International Company News: Kugelfischer makes DM80m loss KUGELFISCHER, the German bearings company, made a loss of about DM80m (Dollars 48m) in 1991 after a profits slump the previous year, and is continuing to cut its labour force in an attempt to lower costs and return to the black. It said renewed profits could not be expected this year while only 80 per cent capacity was being utilised. The company, which also makes sewing machine systems, hydraulic brake parts, and other industrial products, said its turnover fell by 3 per cent to DM3.9bn (Dollars 2.4bn). Excluding acquisitions in east Germany and the US, however, there was a drop of 9 per cent. After cutting its labour force by 5,600 people last year (including a 3,450 reduction at DKFL, the east German bearings subsidiary), it plans to shed a further 2,700 in 1992. Of these, around 1,400 jobs will be lost at the parent company, which comprises the west German bearings plants. The worldwide labour force was around 35,000 at the year-end. Kugelfischer said losses totalled about 2 per cent of turnover; this is roughly DM80m, though it gave no figure. In 1990, net profits fell by 42 per cent to DM59m. Not only did it suffer from the impact of recession abroad and reduced demand from the engineering sector for bearings, but the company's sewing machine operation was also hit by problems in the textile industry. Last year's fall in group orders left Kugelfischer with a backlog of 5.7 months' work, two months less than the year before. However, it expected turnover to stabilise in 1992 now customers seemed to have stopped reducing stocks. Short-time working, affecting about a quarter of the domestic workforce, would continue.</p>

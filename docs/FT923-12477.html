			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy falls on interest rate worries SECOND THOUGHTS on the implications of the rise in German discount rate, concentrated by falls in other European bourses and by an increase in mortage lending rates by Britain's sixth largest building society, sent share prices plunging in London yesterday. The FT-SE Index fell by 51.5 points to 2,431.9 in the largest daily setback since March 11, the day when the UK election date was confirmed. Equities opened calmly, still buttressed by the Bundesbank's decision to keep Lombard Rate unchanged. But the first check to domestic confidence came when the Bank of England acted in the London money market to restore the slight reduction in rates which had surprised the market earlier this month. A second, and keener, blow came when the chief economist of one of the largest UK home lenders was reported to have warned that mortgage rates might rise, even if base rates stayed at the current level of 10 per cent. Within moments, Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society raised its rate from 10.75 per cent to 10.99 per cent. With forward sterling rates also signalling upward pressure on UK interest rates, shares began to fall sharply. Mortgage rates have a more than symbolic effect in the equity market since the collapse of the domestic housing market is regarded as a significant restraint on confidence among domestic investors and on prospects for economic recovery. For the rest of the session, it was a picture of increasing gloom which took the Footsie to a loss of 52.5 at the day's low, just before the close. Weakness in stock index futures and a bearish view on UK economy from Mr Bill Martin, economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, completed the market's day of woe; Mr Martin said that the UK government's ERM commitment is on 'collison course with the real economy.' Trading volume as measured by the Seaq network, was not heavy. The day's Seaq total of 487.2m shares compared with 525.5m on Thursday when retail business moved just above the Pounds 1bn mark for only the second time in the past fortnight. A fall of 36 Dow points in early trading on Wall Street completed London's dismay, bringing further losses in US and dollar-orientated stocks. Interest-related sectors, such as builders and properties suffered heavily. Retail, or customer, business in equities has drifted lower again this week as interest rate worries have resurfaced in the stock market.</p>

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / De Klerk predicts talkson constitution soon SOUTH AFRICA'S President F W de Klerk predicted yesterday that stalled multi-party talks on a new constitution would resume shortly, as the troika of EC ministers held their first day of meetings in Johannesburg aimed at breaking the current deadlock. The team led by Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, lunched with Mr de Klerk and later met Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress. Meanwhile, the ANC national executive continued to debate the resumption of talks for the third day, in a meeting likely to last until late last night. It is expected to announce later today whether it will resume full-scale constitutional talks, or continue limited bilateral contacts. These have brought together Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary general, and Mr Roelf Meyer, constitutional development minister, to discuss issues such as release of remaining political prisoners and a general amnesty for apartheid crimes. Mr Hurd stressed that South Africans would have to resolve the nation's political problems. 'It's not for Europeans to come and bang people's heads together in South Africa.'</p>

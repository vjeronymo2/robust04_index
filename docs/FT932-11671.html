			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Brussels plan to speed E Europe ties with EC: Tariff barriers to be eased sooner than expected THE European Commission has endorsed a substantial package of measures to accelerate the political and economic integration of six former communist countries in eastern Europe into the EC. The package includes faster-than-expected dismantling of tariff barriers in footwear, steel, textiles, cars and other industrial goods, and a new plan for the Commission to tap funds from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to finance road building, telecommunications and other infrastructure in the east. The Commission's support for trade liberalisation has already caused misgivings in Brussels and could arouse strong opposition among some of the EC's member states worried about increased imports in a deep recession. The package covers Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania. All have 'association agreements' with the EC which offer preferential treatment but still fall well short of the benefits of EC membership. The chief elements of the package reflect a new alliance between Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner for external economic relations, and Mr Hans van den Broek, EC commissioner for external political relations. A senior Brussels official said the two men had ended their early rivalry and now championed the cause of freer trade. The package includes: Removing all tariffs for industrial goods such as cars and chemicals by the end of 1994. This cuts an earlier five-year transition period to three years. Reducing the period for phasing out tariffs in 'sensitive sectors' such as textiles and steel from five to four years. This means a cut of 20 per cent each year, with a 40 per cent reduction in the fourth year. Increasing quotas and ceilings from 20 per cent to 25 per cent for sensitive goods - so-called because of the east Europeans' competitive advantage. Advancing plans to increase exports of meat, fruit, dairy goods and vegetables from eastern European countries by 10 per cent annually for five years. The plan has been brought forward by six months to begin this July. Moving from a quota-based system which sets rigid targets for imports into less restrictive 'ceilings'. This means east European exporters will not automatically face higher tariffs if they exceed their import targets, a senior EC official said. The Commission paper fails to set a firm date for starting EC membership negotiations, but it offers all six countries that have association agreements with the EC a 'clear commitment to eventual membership'. The third proposal is to allow the Commission's chief east European aid unit  -Phare - to gain access to funds from the European Investment Bank and the EBRD. Officials hope for final agreement on the programme at the EC summit in Copenhagen next month.</p>

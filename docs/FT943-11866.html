			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / CBI urges tax changes to aid investment The Confederation of British Industry yesterday called for tax changes to improve the investment performance of industry. Responding to the Treasury's review of savings and investment, the CBI rejected the idea that the tax credit on dividends should be further reduced. Until last week the review was being conducted by Mr Stephen Dorrell as financial secretary to the Treasury. Mr Dorrell, who was appointed national heritage secretary in the cabinet reshuffle, had expressed concern that the high level of dividend payouts was restricting corporate investment. But the CBI argued that, in the long term, the best way of increasing investment would be to reduce the rate of corporation tax, thereby increasing the retained earnings of businesses. In the short term, however, the CBI called for a reform of capital gains tax. The current top rate of 40 per cent should only apply if an investment was held for under a year; gains on shares held for more than a year should only be taxed at 20 per cent, with a further potential reduction to 10 per cent for long-term holdings. By changing the capital gains tax system, investors would be more inclined to take returns in the form of capital gains and there would accordingly be less pressure on companies to pay high dividends. The CBI also called for a more generous system of capital allowances, particularly to help small businesses. The recommendations were discussed at the CBI's monthly council meeting yesterday, which also expressed concern about the government's proposals for minimum solvency standards for pension schemes. The CBI called for the standards to be made more flexible, particularly for companies to be given longer to take corrective action. The organisation also responded to the white paper on European social policy issued in Brussels yesterday. Sir Bryan Nicholson, president, said: 'In two crucial respects, this white paper reflects CBI thinking. First, it emphasises that employment creation must be the top priority in Europe. And second, the white paper explicitly rejects the idea of a lengthy new legislative agenda in Europe.'</p>

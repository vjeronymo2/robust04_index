			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kjell Dragnes: "Wild Growth in the Wake of the </F> Accident"]    [Text] Chernobyl/Kiev--"The zone"--it is only spoken of  that way by those in the know--that restricted area 30  kilometers in diameter around the power plant, has become a huge  testing and research area. Six and one-half years after the  explosion and the fire at the nuclear power plant--which began  on 26 April 1986--the effects are being observed on people,  animals, and plants. For researchers it has become a mecca. Here  they hope to find answers to what man-made radioactivity does to  the environment and those of us who live with the environment.    It is important to learn this, not just for the Ukrainians,  but also for other countries with nuclear power and for  countries without nuclear power. Because contamination knows no  borders. The zone is uninhabited; 163,000 people were evacuated  from the region. But beyond the zone people live. People live in  Valdres in Norway, where there are places that are just as  contaminated with radioactive materials as the soil and the  woods in the vicinity of Chernobyl.  <H5>  Berlin Blue </H5>   The effects of this contamination could have been very  great,  in economic and health terms, if it had not been for Berlin blue.    "It might sound like boasting, but the fact is that the  Norwegian initiative with Berlin blue is almost the only  successful research project in Chernobyl, in Ukraine, in  Belarus, and, not least of all, here in Norway," said Per  Strand, a researcher at the Norwegian Radiation Protection  Agency. Since 1990, and together with Brit Salbu and Knut Hove,  professors at the University of Trondheim's College of Arts and  Sciences [NLH], he has been working with Ukraine, Belarus, and  Russia on the fallout from Chernobyl.    The pigment, which was first produced in Berlin in 1704,  hence the name, contains a complex iron ion (FeIIFeII-(Cn)6)  which has proven effective as a binder for radioactive cesium,  Cs137. The first research on Berlin blue was carried out at the  Radium Hospital in the sixties; later a method was developed  using Berlin blue as an additive to blocks of salt lick and as a  pre-additive. This was done at the Norwegian Agricultural  College, which in 1991 tested tablets in Ukraine, Belarus, and  Russia--with fairly remarkable results.    Berlin blue works in such a way that radioactive materials  are not absorbed into the body or turn up in meat and milk. An  absorption reduction of some 90 percent means that large  contaminated areas can still be used by people and animals.    How important this is in economic and health terms can be  illustrated by the following figures:    In Ukraine, more than 7 million hectares of ground have been  contaminated by Cesium 137, so the radioactivity is over 1 curie  per square kilometer (calculated another way: 37,000 becquerels  per square meter). Today 2.6 million people live in this area.  Between 1986 and 1991, Ukraine spent over 15 billion karbovanets  to neutralize and reduce the effects of the fallout. Even if  inflation is high and Ukraine's currency is still dropping in  value, this is nevertheless a very major burden.    In addition, there are huge areas in Belarus, especially  around Gomel. And areas in Norway. Norway is in fact the country  outside the former Soviet Union that was the most affected, and  will continue to be the most affected, by the fallout from  Chernobyl. In Valdres, there are many areas where the  contamination varies between 1 and 10 curies per square  kilometer.    Norway is also especially vulnerable because we use  wilderness areas for grazing to such an extent. A survey done by  the NHL and the Radiation Protection Agency in Ukraine showed  that on land that is farmed, plowed, and fertilized, the  absorption of radioactive materials in plants is less. The type  of soil is also important; the contamination of organic soil  (soil rich in humus) is the worst; radioactive particles are  more permanent in clayey soil.  <H5>  Get By Cheaply </H5>   By simply giving Berlin blue to domestic animals, absorption  in meat and milk can thus be neutralized. The economic  consequences are great. In Belarus alone, they would have to  spend between 5 and 10 percent of the [gross] national product  to neutralize the contamination; now they can get by with much  less.    We are also doing that. If we had followed the international  standards for the absorption of radioactive materials and not  used any countermeasures, Norwegian agriculture would have lost  between 1 and 2 billion kroner annually. Using Berlin blue, the  radiation values are brought way down. Cost: around 100 million  kroner.    The Norwegian research applies not just to reductions of  absorption in animals. It also includes a project in which the  aim is to study the mobility of radioactive materials in  relation to the distance from a nuclear power plant where there  have been emissions. The goal of this research is to learn more  about what Norway could be exposed to if, for example, an  accident were to occur at the Russian nuclear power plant on the  Kola [Peninsula].  <H5>  Eight Thousand Dead From Radiation </H5>   "We have seen many tears," said Vladimir Kholosha, the  deputy  minister at the Chernobyl ministry. "Tears because people had to  leave their homes, tears because people died from minor  illnesses. People's immune systems were so weakened by radiation  that even `innocuous' diseases have become life-threatening."    Today there is hardly anyone who has an overview of what  effect the radiation from Chernobyl has had on public health.  Kholosha confirmed that about 8,000 people have died, and that  it was due to large doses of radioactivity. In early September,  the Ukranian national assembly, Verhovna Rada, approved a  comprehensive program for the next two years and the period  between now and the year 2000 to reduce the effects. But money  is needed--scads of money--and Ukraine does not have it.    At the same time a major effort is under way, under the  aegis, among others, of the UN and the EC, to survey public  health conditions. A good six and one-half years after the  accident, we are starting to see some of the consequences. In  Ukraine and Belarus, infantile thyroid gland cancer has  increased dramatically, a survey conducted by the World Health  Organization, WHO, showed. Since 1989, 225 new cases have been  reported in Belarus, 157 in Ukraine. Normally there would only  have been two to three cases.    Ukrainian experts also think they are seeing more deaths  from  other diseases, among others of the heart, blood vessels, and  the circulatory system, but inasmuch as there are so many  factors that influence the development of such diseases, at the  moment it is too early to suggest any connection.  Regardless--the national assembly, Verhovna Rada, certainly  stands by what it said when it states that the Chernobyl  accident "will be seen as the worst tragedy in 20th century  Ukrainian history, and will affect the lives of several  generations of people."  <H5>  Strange Evergreen Forest </H5>   The needles on the fir trees do not look like ordinary  needles--even if they come from the common fir, pinus  silvestris. They are in different sizes. Some are long, others  are short, some are growing in loops. From every growth point,  where normally five branches would grow, here between six and 20  grow. All the same, upon closer inspection, this green forest is  not that normal.    "We can see changes in the pattern of growth," said Andrei  Arkhipov, one of the researchers at the center in Pripyat. "But  it is impossible to see whether there are genetic changes; for  that, we have to have several generations of trees. The green  forest of firs was sown with seeds from those trees that  received the greatest radiation damage in 1986, and turned red."    Arkhipov is the son of Prof. Nikolai Archipov, one of  Russia's greatest experts on the effects of radioactive  contamination. For many years the elder Arkhipov conducted  studies of the effects of the once unknown nuclear accident in  Kyshtym in the Urals. Now the laboratory has been moved to  Chernobyl.    The forest is just one of the research areas. In large  greenhouses tests have been made on plants such as rape, lupine,  oats, root crops, and vegetables to study the absorption of  radioactive materials in the plants--and how this can be  neutralized.    "The most effective countermeasure we have found to date is  fertilization with potassium, which prevents the absorption of  cesium. Applying lime is useful to reduce the absorption of  strontium," Arkhipov said. The center has extensively mapped the  contaminated area, which shows a spotty pattern. In some places  the fallout can be great, just as it can be practically free of  radioactive materials. The main goal of this research is to see  how agricultural areas can be reused after a nuclear accident.</p>

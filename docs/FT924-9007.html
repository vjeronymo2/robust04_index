			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: The CGT body blow WHAT is the position regarding Capital Gains Tax on the sale of chattels with a predictable life exceeding 50 years, such as antiques? If the sale price (before deduction of auctioneer's commission etc) does not exceed Pounds 6,000, there is no CGT to pay. If the indexed cost exceeds the proceeds, the allowable loss is calculated as though the sale price (before commission etc) had been Pounds 6,000. There are rules for sets of articles, eg the Pounds 6,000 limit would apply to a pair of candlesticks - not to each candlestick separately. Where the sale price (before commission etc) exceeds Pounds 6,000 the chargeable gain is restricted to 166 2/3 per cent of the excess of that price over Pounds 6,000, if that suits the taxpayer. This can give a high marginal rate of CGT where chattels are sold at auction. Suppose a 40 per cent taxpayer has an antique with an indexed base cost of Pounds 5,000 and it is sold at auction, subject to commission at the rate of 11 3/4 per cent (inclusive of VAT). If the bidding stops at Pounds 6,000, the owner will receive Pounds 5,295 and will be exempt from CGT; but, if the bidding continues to say Pounds 6,300, so that he receives Pounds 5,559.75 from the auctioneer, there will be a CGT bill of Pounds 200 to meet (40 per cent of 166 2/3 per cent of Pounds 300) on the extra Pounds 264.75 - an effective marginal rate of over 75 1/2 per cent. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

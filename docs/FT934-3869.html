			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Bristol Scotts row deepens The row at Bristol Scotts deepened yesterday as Mr Ian Stevens, who has called for the resignation of two directors and the chairman, yesterday demanded clarification of several issues. These included an acquisition which he stated had not been declared in the accounts, and the transfer of 364,213 non-voting shares into voting shares. He reiterated his call for an extraordinary meeting at which he aims to appoint himself and fellow shareholder Sir Ian Rankin to the board. Meanwhile, the dispute over control of shares, originally owned by director Mr Nicholas Kerman and subsequently sold to publisher Mr Nicholas Berry will continue at a high court hearing on Friday.</p>

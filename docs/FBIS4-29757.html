			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- Farm Minister Mutsuki Kato  said TuesdayJapan's rice importation to make up for last year's  poor domestic harvest will not reach the initially targeted  level due to steady growth of the early crop.    Speaking at a press conference after a regular cabinet  meeting, Kato said rice import contracts have been signed for a  total of 2,545,000 tons so far and no more contracts will be  concluded.    "We have secured the amount needed for (domestic) supply.  And we have no import plans for this year," Kato said.    The Food Agency, which regulates rice production and  distribution, was to import a total of some 2.66 million tons of  rice to make up for the shortage caused by last year's poor  harvest.    As for rice imports contracted so far, China was the biggest  exporter with 1.07 million tons, followed by Thailand with  753,000 tons, the United States with 537,000 tons and Australia  with 183,000 tons.    Of these, 2.21 million tons were for table use, while the  remainder were for processed foods.    In a related development, the food agency said Tuesday that  short-and medium-grain rice mainly imported from the U.S. And  China totaled 1.7 million tons of the 2.41 million tons of  nonglutinous rice contracted for import.    Of the 1.7 million tons, 700,000 tons had been sold to  wholesalers by June 16, the agency said.    Long-grain rice imported from Thailand, which turned out to  be unpopular with Japanese people, who usually eat short- and  medium- grain rice, totaled 710,000 tons, of which 420,000 tons  have been sold.    With the agency now providing mainly short-and medium-grain  rice to wholesalers, agency officials said they expect a  stockpile of some 100,000 to 200,000 tons of long-grain rice by  the end of October.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Giacomo Ferrari: "What Will 1994 Be Like? A </F> So-So Year"]    [Text] A Makno poll reveals a pessimistic prospect:  People are consuming less and saving less, and the fear of  inflation persists.    Almost 60 percent of the Italians have no confidence in  the political and economic future. They are willing to make  sacrifices, providing everybody pays their taxes and the welfare  state works.    One Italian in five, however, does not agree. He does not  want to make any more sacrifices, even if they are aimed at an  "effective improvement" in the Italian economic situation. The  others would perhaps be willing to accept them, but only under  precise conditions (see the accompanying tables). For  example--and this represents the great majority--provided the  welfare state is preserved, if not actually strengthened. Or  else (and this is another numerous category), only on the  assumption that everybody pays their taxes.    A generally pessimistic outlook emerges from the poll Makno  conducted last month [i.e., November] with a significant sample  of citizens throughout Italy. And it can be summed up in a kind  of brief indication: In answer to the question concerning the  near future of the "economic, political, and social situation"  of Italian families, 55.9 percent of those interviewed replied  they had no confidence, while only 29.3 percent is optimistic,  and there is a very high number of those who are undecided (14.8  percent).    This situation is reflected in the assumptions about future  actions. The poll was based on 1,022 telephone interviews. (The  sample was selected on the basis of scientific criteria, taking  into account geographic areas, demographically significant  economic classes, sex, age, and academic diplomas.) Actually,  the poll also investigates possible destinations of private  savings. And here there are many surprises.    For example, one is struck by the very high percentage of  those who believe that in 1994 (to be exact, the question  concerned the next six months) they will be unable to save even  one lira because "all their income will be absorbed by everyday  expenses." No less than 43 citizens out of 100 stated that of  necessity "they were not savers." However, it should be pointed  out that the same question posed in the past (that is, "What did  your family invest in the last six months?) provided even worse  responses, since 47 percent of those questioned then were found  to be nonsavers.    But who is it that manages to save despite everything? What  does that person expect to do in the first half of the new year?  In this situation, the bank wins by far. In fact, 15.7 percent  of those interviewed said they will leave their money in their  checking account and 8.8 percent opted for their bank savings  book. (Probably also included in this category are certificates  of deposit, natural offspring of the old bank books). Despite  the great battage [publicity campaign] over  privatizations and new job placements, the number of those  putting their money in the stock market is practically  nonexistent while the number of those very faithful to  government financial instruments is surprisingly low: Only 8.4  percent say they want to buy treasury bills, treasury  certificates, and multiyear treasury bonds.    Then there is the chapter on consumption. The year of  economic and institutional crisis has also changed Italians'  habits. And while official data refer to an inflation under  control, the people, on the other hand, have the feeling that  prices are continuing to rise. There are a few differences  within the social classes. For example, women are more  pessimistic than men. And the elderly believe that prices are  rising much more than young people do.    Finally, concerning past conduct, in the south they spent  more for food and clothing; in the north; for housing; and in  the center, for transport.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Italians and the Recovery                                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |(In percentages)                                                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Are You Willing to Make Sacrifices in Exchange for Effective Improvements in |  |the Italian Economic Situation?

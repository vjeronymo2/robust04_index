			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The skirmishing in Liberia seems to go on every day  without a break. ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for  Democracy in Liberia], Charles Taylor's NPFL [National Patriotic  Front of Liberia], the ECOMOG [Economic Community of West  African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] peacekeeping force,  all seem to be involved in shoot-outs in various parts of the  country. Now an unknown group has tried to launch a raid by sea  on Monrovia. From Monrovia, Nii Nartey Allison telexed this  report.    According to a spokesman for the African peacekeeping force,  more than 100 people suspected of trying to launch a nighttime  seaborne attack on their headquarters on Tuesday [21 June] had  been arrested. Details surrounding the incident remain scanty,  but the spokesman for the peacekeepers, Major Edema Syllo today  confirmed that some of the suspects had escaped after a heavy  exchange of gunfire with the peacekeepers' gunboat which had  moved in from the nearby Free Port of Monrovia. He said that  those arrested are still being interrogated and that their  identity had not yet been established.    Maj. Syllo said about the same time as the seaborne attack,  a  formation of peacekeeping troops in the Harbel area had come  under fire from fighters of Charles Taylor's NPFL. On the ULIMO  front, he said that peacekeeping troops had moved into  Brewerville late on Wednesday [22 June] after a fierce gun  battle in the area between rival ULIMO factions. He added:  Seven bodies were discovered in a well there.    Meanwhile, the field commander of the African peacekeeping  force, Maj. General John Inienger, today expressed his  objections to warring factions using Monrovia as a base for  their propaganda and for operations. He said: If they go on,  this could lead to a legal and military problem for ECOMOG under  the Cotonou Accord.</p>

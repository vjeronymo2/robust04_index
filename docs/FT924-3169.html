			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Tending to Airbus's clipped wings: Paul Betts on the likely damage caused by Northwest's cancelled order THE European Airbus consortium has just suffered its worst setback in its 20-year history with the largest cancellation of new aircraft orders from its single biggest customer. The decision of Northwest Airlines of the US to cancel orders for 74 Airbus aircraft worth Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2.2bn) was said yesterday to have come as a 'bombshell' to one City aerospace analyst. Northwest, with 140 Airbus aircraft orders, of which 34 have already been delivered, was the largest customer of Airbus. GPA, the Irish leasing company, has 123 orders, Lufthansa of Germany has 111 orders, and Air France 67 orders. The blow for Airbus is more painful because it involves the European consortium's latest jet, the A340 long-range widebody aircraft due to enter service next year. Northwest, one of the A340 launch customers, cancelled all its 24 orders for the new Airbus as well as cancelling orders for 50 A320 twin-engine aircraft. The full scale of recession in the airline industry has been brought home to Airbus. A month ago, Mr Jean Pierson, Airbus chief executive, reached an agreement with GPA over the rescheduling of the deliveries of 82 Airbus aircraft between now and 2003. The consortium has also faced cancellations and order delays from other troubled airlines this year and there are likely to be more in coming months, although none on the scale of Northwest. During a recent record-breaking 15 hour and 21 minute non-stop A340 test flight between Frankfurt and Honolulu, Mr Pierson admitted that 'nobody knows when the industry pick-up will happen'. He said the civil aerospace industry would remain under intense pressure well into next year and probably into 1994. The industry is still suffering from overcapacity. During the past two years, the three main manufacturers - Boeing and McDonnell Douglas in the US and Airbus in Europe - have added about 10 per cent in new passenger seat capacity at a time when airline traffic was slowing. In 1991 airline traffic fell 3 per cent, the first fall since the second world war. The rate of new aircraft production will have to be cut by 25 per cent to 30 per cent during the next three to four years to bring capacity in line with demand. This will involve a cut in deliveries by the big three manufacturers from more than 800 new aircraft deliveries both in 1991 and 1992 to around 550 annual deliveries during the next four years. For Airbus, the immediate implication of the Northwest cancellations will be a further scaling back of its production plans. Airbus has already announced a cut in the rate of future production. It had originally expected to see production rise from 160 aircraft this year to 220 aircraft in 1995 as new aircraft, including the A340, the A330 and the A321, started rolling off the assembly line. Last month, it said it did not expect to produce more than 180 aircraft in 1995. It will now have to trim production targets even further. This is bound to have a big impact on all four Airbus industrial partners - British Aerospace (20 per cent), Aerospatiale of France (37.9 per cent), Deutsche Aerospace (37.9 per cent) and Casa of Spain (4.2 per cent). BAe, which makes all wings for Airbus aircraft, has already scaled back wing production at its Chester facility to reflect the retrenchment in Airbus output. The Northwest cancellation alone, according to Mr Hodgkinson, could cost BAe around Pounds 100m in lost turnover as each A320 wing set accounts for about Pounds 5m of turnover and each larger A340 wing set for around Pounds 10m. The cuts in future production are expected to put additional pressure on jobs in the European aerospace industry. In the UK alone, Airbus supports about 30,000 jobs at some 300 companies, as well as about 7,000 jobs at BAe itself. The continuing recession in the airline industry is also likely to delay Airbus plans to develop new products. Airbus had hoped to launch at the end of this year a programme to build a smaller 125-seat derivative of the 150-seat A320 twin-engine aircraft. Mr Pierson recently said he did not expect the programme to be launched before next March. Now airlines in the depressed market are unlikely to commit themselves to buy the new aircraft. The Northwest cancellation, as well as other order deferrals and cancellations, is likely to force Airbus to make hefty provisions against future aircraft delivery risks when it closes its 1992 accounts in February. Mr Pierson expects Airbus to show an operating surplus in 1992 for the second year running of around Pounds 220m. But he has also warned that the consortium's net profits would depend on the amount of provisions Airbus will have to make to cover financial risks. Mr Pierson is convinced the market will eventually rebound, and Airbus will be in a strong position to take advantage of the recovery with its broad family of technologically advanced airliners. But he recently remarked: 'As I surveyed the battered and beaten state of the airline business, I could not help but recall one of Murphy's Laws of Life: 'You can't win . . . you can't break even . . . and you can't quit.''</p>

			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Japan ready to end ban on rice imports JAPAN has informally floated a proposal to lift its ban on rice imports after a six-year moratorium period to 1999, according to trade negotiators in Tokyo and Geneva. In a second initiative late yesterday in Geneva, Japan is also offering to harmonise at low levels its tariffs on non-ferrous metals, and cut by at least 50 per cent its tariff peaks on a further 150 textile items. A US trade negotiator described the initiative, unveiled during a full meeting of Uruguay round participants aimed at taking stock of progress in negotiations, as 'an additional concrete step' towards successful completion of the Uruguay round of world trade talks. The rice proposal, which was made unofficially during intensive bilateral discussions on reform of farm trade with the US in Geneva, will only be presented formally once the US and the EC settle differences on farm subsidies and market access for agriculture products, an official said. Under the plan, Japan will accept tarification of rice after a six-year grace period, during which a minimum access level of at least 5 per cent of its domestic rice consumption will be imported, an official said. Mr Joe O'Mara, special US trade negotiator for agriculture, said in Geneva that the two sides were trying to conclude the talks by November 1, ahead of the December 15 deadline to complete the Uruguay Round negotiations. Formal headway may yet be frustrated by the refusal of the EC so far to enter any negotiations on opening its market to more farm imports. This is largely due to French efforts to review a US-EC agreement on Europe's subsidised farm exports, and even to withdraw the farm sector from the Uruguay Round agenda. News of progress towards a compromise on ending Japan's ban on rice imports is likely to isolate France on the issue of farm trade, and put fresh pressure on the EC to negotiate tariff cuts in the sector. Negotiators in Geneva were quick to note yesterday that France's domestic problems in selling a farm package were no greater than those of the Japanese government; if Japan compromises on rice imports for the sake of a wider agreement, pressure would increase on France to do the same. A trade negotiator in Geneva said the Japanese initiative on non-ferrous metals amounted to 'one more area where the rest of the Quad (which groups the US, Japan, Canada and the EC) are in agreement, and the EC stands in the way of a package.' Both Canada and the US want tariffs on non-ferrous metals entirely eliminated. The welcome for Japan's initiatives was not extended to a new EC market access package ready to be tabled next week. This proposes adding toys and vegetable oils to the list of items on which tariffs will be cut to zero, and cuts average tariffs by about 33 per cent, against a previous offer of some 23 per cent. One US official, noting that the current US offer achieved cuts averaging 38-42 per cent, said the EC offer 'hardly passes the laugh test'. Meanwhile, in Tokyo, news of the Japanese rice proposal yesterday caused embarrassment for Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, and his government, which was quick to deny reports of a tarification accord. Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, reiterated that Japan had no intention of subjecting rice to the tarification scheme proposed by the Gatt. Meanwhile leaders of the Socialist party, the largest in Mr Hosokawa's coalition, who staunchly oppose the opening of the rice market, threatened to pull the party out of the coalition if the cabinet accepted tarification.</p>

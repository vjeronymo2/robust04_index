			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Notice of Proposed Rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On July 21, 1993, NHTSA published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend part 542 (See 58 FR 38999). In order to solve the problem of manufacturers' late notification of the agency about new lines, the agency proposed to implement section 603(c) of the Cost Savings Act. Under the proposal, each manufacturer would be required to provide, for each of its newly planned lines, its determination whether the line was likely high or low theft, and include a discussion of how it applied the criteria set forth in appendix C of part 541, in arriving at its determination. The appendix C criteria are: Price; vehicle image; lines competitive with the new line; line(s) the new line is intended to replace; presence of any antitheft devices; preliminary theft data for the line, if available. The agency also proposed that a manufacturer be required to submit such information not less than 18 months before introduction of the planned line.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the NPRM, NHTSA stated it believed that requiring manufacturers to submit the necessary information would provide the agency with more timely submissions of accurate and up-to-date data to evaluate. This would enable the agency to select more effectively and efficiently (by agreement with the manufacturer, if possible) those new lines likely to have a high theft rate. Also, since the information would be provided timely and directly to the agency by the manufacturer, the agency presumably would no longer need to rely upon the trade press accounts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to provide manufacturers with lead time to comply with the new mandatory procedures, the agency proposed to continue to permit voluntary submission of information for lines that are introduced before model year 1997, and require compliance with the mandatory procedures for those lines introduced in model year 1997 and subsequent model years. The agency made similar proposals regarding the voluntary and mandatory submission of information with respect to low theft new lines with a majority of major parts interchangeable with those of a high theft line.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA also proposed to remove outdated procedures from part 542. The procedures were applicable to lines introduced before April 24, 1986, the effective date of the theft prevention standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, in the NPRM, NHTSA noted that because of passage of the ``Anti Car Theft Act of 1992'' (ACTA), changes must be made in NHTSA's and manufacturers' evaluation procedures for low theft lines with major parts interchangeable with major parts of a high theft line. ACTA's passage redefined ``passenger motor vehicle,'' for title VI purposes, to include ``any multipurpose passenger vehicle and light-duty truck that is rated at 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight or less.'' (See section 601(1) of title VI.) ACTA's passage did not necessitate changes to part 542's regulatory text.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Comments and NHTSA Response  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to the NPRM, NHTSA received comments from four parties: The Chrysler Corporation (Chrysler); the Ford Motor Company (Ford); the National Truck Equipment Association (NTEA) and Volkswagen of America, Inc. (VW).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In its comments, Ford concurred with NHTSA's proposal to require manufacturers to provide NHTSA with information and supporting analysis on new vehicle lines, beginning with Model Year 1997. Ford stated that it understood the NPRM as indicating that NHTSA is interested only in manufacturers' analyses of new vehicle lines likely to be high theft lines. Based on its understanding, Ford suggested that there was a need to make several minor changes to the regulatory text to make it clear that NHTSA is interested in analyses of new lines likely to be low theft, as well as those lines likely to be high theft.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA believes that the proposal was clear regarding the obligation for a manufacturer to conduct evaluations of each new line using the criteria in appendix C of part 541. Under the proposal, each manufacturer would have been required ``to evaluate each new line and to conclude whether the new line is likely to have a theft rate exceeding the median theft rate.'' In other words, for each line, the manufacturer would have had to indicate whether its evaluation led it to conclude that (a) it is likely to have such a rate or (b) it is not likely to have such a rate. That this was the intended reading of the proposed regulatory text was made abundantly clear in the summary section of the NPRM preamble. There, the agency stated that manufacturers would be required to ``provide an analysis whether the new line is likely to be a high or low theft line.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

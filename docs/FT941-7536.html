			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Observer: Tiny change Is Tiny Rowland, 76, finally bowing out of Lonrho? Reading the runes - ie Lonrho's latest annual report - one might think so. It lacks his usual statement and big picture at the start of the report. Retiring chairman, Rene Leclezio, has taken over the slot. Could it be occupied next year by Rowland's joint chief executive, Dieter Bock? For that to happen Rowland would have to be long retired.</p>

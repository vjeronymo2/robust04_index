			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Israel begins to free Palestinians ISRAEL yesterday freed hundreds of Palestinian prisoners at the beginning of a mass release aimed at bolstering the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and winning over Palestinian opponents. However, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, cancelled the release of members of the Islamic fundamentalist Hamas and Islamic Jihad movements, after the abduction and killing of two Israeli soldiers in the occupied Gaza Strip on Sunday by the Hamas' military wing. Both groups reject the peace accord and have vowed to fight against it. Mr Rabin also told a parliamentary committee that 'prisoners with blood on their hands will not be released'. By the end of today Israel plans to have freed up to 700 prisoners, mostly the sick, women, youths and men over 50, as a first step in the phased release of up to 14,000 Palestinians held in Israeli jails. Most of those released this week have been imprisoned on minor 'offences' such as membership of a banned or 'hostile' organisation, demonstrating and throwing stones. Thousands of relatives crowded at the Eretz checkpoint crossing into Gaza and cheered as buses delivered prisoners to their freedom. Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza closed stores and observed a one-day strike to press for further releases. The Palestine Liberation Organisation sees the release of prisoners as key to confidence-building between the two sides in talks on implementing the peace accord which resume in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba today. The PLO is demanding a much swifter release of all prisoners held on non-life threatening charges and is calling for the release of prisoners of all groups, including Hamas and its leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin. The release of Hamas activists, however, has drawn a barrage of criticism from the Israeli public. Opposition to the freeing of Hamas prisoners is likely to grow after the incident in Gaza on Sunday and release yesterday of a leaflet by Hamas which called the killing of the two soldiers their 'gift to the peace process' and proclaimed: 'There is no peace between us and the Israelis except in the cemetery.' Despite the PLO's insistence on the release of all prisoners regardless of their political affiliation, Israeli officials believe there is a growing opportunity to drive a wedge between moderate and secular Palestinians, who support the peace process, and the rejectionist and Islamic fundamentalist groups opposing it. Mr Rabin also told the parliamentary committee yesterday that Palestinian attacks against Israelis had fallen dramatically since the signing of the peace accord last month. Attacks in Gaza were down this month to 30, from 60 in September, and in the West Bank to 44, from 59 last month.</p>

			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / International Company News: Benetton poised for assets swap BENETTON, Italy's biggest clothing group, is poised to swap assets with Edizione Holding, the private company controlled by the Benetton family. However, Benetton stressed the changes, expected to be announced on Monday, had nothing to do with the resignation on Wednesday of Mr Emilio Fossati, managing director. Shares in Benetton fell for the second day yesterday after confusing press reports and uncertainty about its plans. Benetton's stock fell L356 to L10,432, making an 8 per cent fall since Tuesday. Mr Fossati's departure highlights Benetton's difficulties in retaining top managers. In late 1990, Mr Carlo Buora, finance director, left after less than a year in the job. Analysts attribute the brevity of some managers' stays to cultural and family problems, linked to Benetton's location near Treviso, an unexciting town of 85,000 near Venice. Many executives coming from centres such as Milan leave their families behind and commute home at weekends. Conflicts with the Benettons, who own about 80 per cent of the shares and remain the company's guiding spirits, may be inevitable. Though the family wants to attract top managers, decision-making remains with them. In 1987, the family opposed plans by Mr Aldo Palmeri, the then managing director, to buy Lanerossi, a financially-troubled textiles producer. However, avoiding acquisitions and keeping its own assets to a minimum have been key to Benetton's success. Most production is contracted out, while shops are run by independent retailers on a licensing basis. First half net profits, due in September, are expected to rise 15 per cent to about L92bn (Dollars 81.5m), with sales 6 per cent ahead at L1,220bn.</p>

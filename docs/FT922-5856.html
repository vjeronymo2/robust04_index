			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Obituary of Lord McFadzean: Free marketeer LORD McFadzean of Kelvinside, who has died aged 76, was chairman in succession of Shell, British Airways and Rolls-Royce in the 1970s and 1980s. An outspoken, stocky Scot, he combined a career as an industrialist with an intellectual commitment to free-market economics. As a visiting professor of economics at Strathclyde University from 1967 to 1976 he attacked the theories of John Kenneth Galbraith. When Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979 he described her as 'the most intelligent person I have ever met'. He was born in Glasgow on November 26 1915 and ran away to sea at the age of 14, returning a year later. He trained as an economist, gaining a first-class degree at Glasgow University, then studying at the London School of Economics. In 1938 he joined the Board of Trade and moved quickly on to the Treasury. After the Second World War he worked for the Malayan government and the Colonial Development Corporation. At 36, McFadzean entered the private sector with Shell. Within nine years, his uncompromising approach to efficiency earned him a place on the board and his outspokenness the sobriquet 'Fearless Frank'. In 1972 he became chairman of Shell. In 1976 he was one of the few industrialists prepared to take on the running of the then state-owned British Airways. He instituted job cuts and clashed with the unions. Sir Keith Joseph asked him to write a pamphlet which was published under the title The Economics of John Kenneth Galbraith: a Study in Fantasy. After the 1979 Conservative victory, he moved to Rolls-Royce, which he led through the recession of 1981-83, shedding 20,000 jobs and turning a Pounds 22m loss in 1980 into an Pounds 18m profit in 1981. He was chairman of the Trade Policy Research Centre from 1971 until 1982. He was knighted in 1975 and created a life peer as Baron McFadzean of Kelvinside in 1980. He married Isabel Beattie in 1938. Their daughter, Felicity, married Baron Marsh, the former Labour transport minister. Isabel died in 1987 and he married Sonja Khung in 1988.</p>

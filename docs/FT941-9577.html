			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Clinical Computing to float Clinical Computing, a west London-based company which develops specialist computer software for the healthcare industry, is coming to market via a placing of 4.05m shares with institutional shareholders which is expected to value the group at about Pounds 20m. The company was set up in 1979 by Mr Michael Gordon, the executive chairman, and two Charing Cross Hospital Medical School colleagues. During the late-1980s it developed the Proton suite of generic software packages which help doctors and other healthcare workers record, store, manage and analyse clinical information. 'Proton is designed to help doctors and other medical staff look after patients,' says Mr Gordon, who will retain a stake of about 30 per cent in the company following the flotation. The software, which can be customised by clients, enables the large volumes of data generated during patient treatment to be stored and retrieved electronically instead of on mountains of paper. For example, each of the 70 dialysis centres in the UK treats about 350 patients three times a week and generates about 3.6m treatment notes each year. Clinical Computing has 600 systems installed in the UK, the US and eight other countries, and claims to have no significant competitors in the clinical market. The majority of installations to date have been in dialysis centres, however, Proton systems have been installed for use in 19 other clinical disciplines including diabetic care and obstetrics. Last year the company posted pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.1m on turnover of Pounds 2.6m. The placing will raise about Pounds 3m net of expenses, which will mainly be used to accelerate product development and expand sales and marketing activities. The pathfinder prospectus is due to be issued today and trading in the new shares is expected to begin on February 17.</p>

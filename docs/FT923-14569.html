			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Basle code to avoid repeat of BCCI case LEADING industrial countries have agreed to follow new minimum standards when regulating international banks, in an attempt to reduce banking malpractices in the wake of last year's closure of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. The main safeguard against a repetition of the BCCI scandal, which led to losses of hundreds of million pounds for depositors, is that big international banks will be policed on a worldwide basis by a single bank regulator. In the case of BCCI, no one regulator took responsibility for vetting all of the banking group's worldwide operations, thereby allowing it to disguise the extent of the fraud it perpetrated. The standards were issued yesterday by the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision and were endorsed by the central bank governors from the Group of Ten leading industrial countries together with Luxembourg and Switzerland. If the rules had been in force before the closure of BCCI, responsibility for supervising BCCI would have rested with the Luxembourg regulator, because BCCI's domicile was in Luxembourg. In other words, the regulator in a bank's 'home' country is obliged to take responsibility for the bank as a whole. The standards constitute a voluntary code of practice. However, Mr Gerald Corrigan, chairman of the Basle Committee and president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, was confident that they would be enforced. Nonetheless he stressed that 'no system of supervision is failsafe . . . There is no ironclad protection against fraud or deceit'. There are four main features to the minimum standards: Any international banking group should be supervised on a 'consolidated basis', taking account of its operations anywhere in the world, by a single home country authority. If a bank wants to set up branches in a jurisdiction outside its home country, it will need the consent of both its home country regulator and the regulator in the country playing 'host' to the new branches. A home country supervisor should have the right to receive information on the international operations of banks under its supervision. This will require an understanding on the gathering and sharing of information between the home country and host country supervisors. If a country is unhappy about the international supervision of a bank whose domicile is elsewhere, it can impose 'restrictive measures' on branches of that bank on its territory. Mr Corrigan described this last clause as the newest element in the international regime of bank supervision. He said these 'restrictive measures' could take one of a number of forms. The most draconian sanction would be to ban the branches from the territory. However, a bank regulator might simply set a deadline for the the bank and its home country regulator to meet acceptable standards. Mr Corrigan said there was a 'middle path' available between these two sanctions. A regulator could allow a bank to set up in its territory so long as operations in this territory were grouped in a separately capitalised subsidiary, which would be fenced off from the rest of the banking group. Mr Corrigan hopes that bank regulators throughout the world will adhere to the new standards. Copies have been sent to authorities in more than a 100 countries and he hopes to receive their approval at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund in France this October. However, he accepted that it would be a considerable time before all bank regulators had sufficient resources or expertise to monitor an international banking group effectively.

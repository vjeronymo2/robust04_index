			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> USC;  </P> <P> BURNS NOT READY TO QUIT  </P> <P> DeChon Burns got the word Monday night: Quit football.  </P> <P> But as he ate lunch Tuesday at UC Irvine, the USC sophomore had yet to fully  accept the recommendation of his doctor.  </P> <P> Projected as a starter at cornerback for the Trojans, Burns was told by  neurological surgeon Michael Apuzzo that, because of the structure of his  spinal column, he runs the risk of paralysis if he continues playing.  </P> <P> "He basically said that I have a narrow spinal column, which is hereditary, and  I have a disk in there that's protruding a little bit in the spinal column,  which makes it even more narrow than it already is," Burns said. "The  possibility of paralysis is there if I was to take a blow with my neck being at  the right angle."  </P> <P> Burns, though, has asked Apuzzo to seek other opinions.  </P> <P> "I'm not ready to throw in the towel yet," Burns said. "Maybe a lot of other  people might take this as a sign saying, 'Get out,' but I'm hopeful it's not as  serious as it seems to be and that these other specialists might see something  that was overlooked."  </P> <P> Burns, 20, called himself "confused" but grateful.  </P> <P> "You never prepare yourself for things in life that are so sudden," he said.  "So, as far as accepting it, I'm dealing with it, but at the same time, I'm  kind of hoping I don't have to accept it.  </P> <P> "I'm probably in denial. But whatever the outcome, I think it's for the better  and God is watching over me. I'm very thankful that I'm able to breathe and  move my fingers and hands and turn my neck. I'm looking at is as a blessing in  that it could have been a lot more serious."  </P> <P> A three-sport star at Riverside Rubidoux High School, Burns was injured last  Thursday when he was hit by reserve fullback Ed Chavez, whose block knocked  Burns off his feet and onto his back. As Burns landed, his head snapped back  and "whiplashed off the ground," Coach Larry Smith said.  </P></p>

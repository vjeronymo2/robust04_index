			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> JAPANESE HALT INQUIRY INTO U.S. H-BOMB LOST OFF COAST IN 1965  </P> <P> The Japanese government said today it is dropping its inquiry into the U.S.  hydrogen bomb lost at sea 24 years ago off the coast of Japan.  </P> <P> The U.S. Defense Department had said further queries into the accident could  endanger U.S. military policy.  </P> <P> "The Japanese government understands the U.S. position and has no intention of  making further requests of it," Kyodo News Service quoted an unidentified  Foreign Ministry official as saying today.  </P> <P> The case embarrassed both governments -- Japan because it bans nuclear arms but  appeared to have turned a blind eye to passage of such weapons through its  waters, and the United States because its policy of not commenting on the  location of such weapons came under new scrutiny.  </P> <P> In 1965, a U.S. Navy A-4 Skyhawk accidentally rolled off the carrier  Ticonderoga bearing a one-megaton H-bomb. The pilot died, and the bomb sank in  waters 16,000 feet deep.  </P> <P> The incident was kept secret until 1981, when the Navy said it had occurred 500  miles from land.  </P> <P> But in May it was disclosed that the bomb had sunk about 80 miles from a  Japanese island in the Okinawa group.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Identification of freshwater needs of aquatic resources has caused conflict for a variety of reasons. Debate of scientific issues is fundamentally different from other kinds of debate in that it should yield to scientific investigation. Participants developed issue papers that delineated areas of scientific agreement. Several issue papers showed that conditions in Suisun Bay largely reflected the abundance, recruitment, or survival not only of local species, but also of habitat conditions for species upstream and downstream. A primary result of the issue papers produced for this group was that almost all species studied increased in abundance as a simple function of increased outflow and decreased salinity. The absence of a plateau or peak in the relationship of species abundances and outflow conditions means that science alone cannot identify an optimal outflow. Furthermore, the similar response of species at all ecological (trophic) levels argues strongly that the estuary should be managed using an ecosystem approach rather than on a species by species basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The technical workshops concentrated on developing the scientific rationale for an estuarine index to measure the estuary's response to different levels and patterns of freshwater input. Participants recognized that economic and socio-political considerations should be accounted for at other points in the deliberations. The needs of society, as well as the needs of the environment, should be considered in determining appropriate allocations of freshwater. However, the premise of the workshops was that one should start with the best scientific and technical judgements possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many large-scale changes in the structure of the Delta have been proposed to facilitate water use and to reduce impacts of water withdrawal on aquatic resources. There was general recognition by the group that the present Delta withdrawal and distribution system is a major contributor to the declines of important species. The conclusion and recommendations of the workshops are based upon the present water withdrawal and distribution system and would need to be re-evaluated if any significant alterations to that system are considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The conclusions and recommendations in this report were developed by the estuarine scientists and managers who participated in one or more of the workshops. The complete list of participants and their affiliations are listed in Appendix D. All conclusions and recommendations in this report were reviewed, voted on, and endorsed by a consensus of the estuarine scientists and managers who participated in the fourth and final workshop in the series (26 August 1992). The term consensus is used to represent group solidarity on an issue; a judgement arrived at by most of the scientists and managers present. In all cases, the consensus was unanimous or nearly unanimous. The conclusions and recommendations are arranged in a sequence that ``tracks'' the evolution of thinking of the participants. The conclusions and recommendations reached by the group reflect the participants' best scientific and technical judgements, not necessarily the positions of their affiliated agencies or organizations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following conclusions and recommendations are intended to provide guidance and information on how estuarine standards could be developed and how different levels of protection of estuarine resources could be selected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The full justifications to these conclusions and recommendations are contained in technical papers that accompany this report and in other documents prepared for the San Francisco Estuary Project. (Appendix E).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Important Conclusions and Recommendations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Conclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because of the complex nature of the freshwater delivery and distribution system in the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta estuary, there is at present no single, simple, accurate measure of freshwater input to the estuary that conveys information important to resource managers and to the public, and that is meaningful to those with special concerns about how fluctuations in freshwater inflow to the estuary affect habitat and the condition of the estuarine ecosystem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Recommendation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Estuarine standards should be developed to be used in conjunction with flow standards. One set of standards should be based upon an index of the physical response of the estuary to fluctuations in the input of fresh water. These standards should have diagnostic value in providing, throughout the year, a level of protection to the estuary and to important ecosystem values and functions consistent with environmental goals and objectives for the Bay-Delta estuary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Conclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Estuarine standards to be used in conjunction with flow standards should be based upon an index that is simple and inexpensive to measure accurately, that has ecological significance, that integrates a number of important estuarine properties and processes, and that is meaningful to a large number of constituencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Recommendation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Salinity should be used as an index for the development of some estuarine standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Justification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the first workshop (August 1991), participants identified and assessed a number of indices of the estuary's responses to flow to use in managing freshwater discharge to the estuary. The preliminary, preworkshop, choice was the position of the entrapment zone. This index was abandoned quickly, however. The entrapment zone is important to estuarine ecosystem processes and functions, but at present there is no single, straightforward ``entrapment zone index'' suitable for monitoring the position or strength of the entrapment zone as a function of freshwater input.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / International Company News: Pacific BBA shares drop on profits revision Shares in Pacific BBA, which was spun off on the Australian stockmarket by the UK's BBA group in 1993, fell 13 cents to ADollars 3.35 yesterday, after the company said that profits for the year to end-1993 and the half-year to June 1994 had been overstated because of accounting irregularities in one of the plastics businesses, writes Nikki Tait. It said the overstatement amounted to just under ADollars 3m (USDollars 2.3m) in after-tax profits, 'resulting from a number of accounting entries apparently designed to hide losses on some contracts in the Viscount tool room and inflate profits in the plastics operation'.</p>

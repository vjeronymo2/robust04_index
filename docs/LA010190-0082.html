			<p><P> January 1, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STREET SMART: A TICKLISH ROUTE FROM DISNEYLAND  </P> <P> Dear Street Smart:  </P> <P> For years there has been a major problem experienced by Disneyland visitors who  wish to go north on the Santa Ana Freeway.  </P> <P> After exiting the park and proceeding north on West Street, they must turn  right onto Ball Road, then work their way over to the left-hand lanes so that,  once they've crossed the freeway, they can make a left turn across the  westbound lanes and onto the freeway entrance.  </P> <P> Caltrans is building a new bridge where Ball Road crosses the freeway. It is my  understanding that when this new bridge is completed, Disneyland visitors will  still have to work their way over to the left lanes on this new bridge so they  can make a left turn across traffic on Ball Road to reach the freeway entrance.  </P> <P> Why would anyone spend millions of dollars on a new bridge without making  provision to safely handle the many cars traveling east on Ball Road that would  like to enter the northbound Santa Ana Freeway?  </P> <P> Richard C. Martin  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P> <P> That freeway entrance is a doozy, the kind that makes motorists wish they were  safely back on the Autopia in the Magic Kingdom.  </P> <P> But officials at Caltrans have a ready explanation for why they won't be  eliminating the troublesome left turn on Ball Road.  </P> <P> Given their druthers, the agency's highway engineers admit they would like to  install a cloverleaf-type freeway entrance that would siphon eastbound traffic  off Ball Road's right-hand lane and swing it on a curving strip of asphalt down  onto the northbound Santa Ana Freeway. No muss, no fuss and no left-hand turn.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the land needed for such a serpentine freeway ramp is occupied  by a motel. Caltrans officials say the agency cannot justify purchasing the  property and removing the motel just for a new freeway ramp.  </P> <P> Instead, they plan to do the next best thing. As part of the bridge  construction, Caltrans will erect a new left-turn signal and add an extra  left-turn lane off Ball Road onto the northbound Santa Ana Freeway.  </P> <P> It is hoped that the new turn lanes and traffic light, which will be  synchronized with signals on nearby Harbor Boulevard, will help all those  Mouseketeer groupies and Tinkerbell fans get onto the freeway a whole lot  easier.  </P> <P> Dear Street Smart:  </P> <P> Like everyone in the Los Angeles Basin, I have become increasingly concerned  with our traffic problems. The only solutions I see being offered appear to  involve large sums of money and long-term projects.  </P> <P> The solution is to reduce the number of vehicles on the road. The obvious  answer is car-pooling. Unfortunately, most people give up on the idea because  of the hassles involved in coordinating everyone.  </P> <P> I would like to see local newspapers run advertising at no charge to commuters  listing where people live and work, using the coordinates from a Thomas  Brothers map book. This would provide a quick reference for people who live and  work near one another and who have similar work schedules to form a car pool.  </P> <P> Many large companies use a similar system for their employees. I am suggesting  that this could be tried on an areawide basis.  </P> <P> Much has been written about the number of single-driver vehicles on the  freeways. I think this plan could be a very logical way to reduce that number  and speed up traffic on our freeway system, and it could be done with the least  cost to the taxpayer.  </P> <P> Thomas C. Moore  </P> <P> Orange  </P> <P> It's nice to see someone thinking about promoting car-pooling, which many  transportation experts say is an important weapon in the battle to ease traffic  congestion in the region.  </P> <P> Those same experts, however, say that putting together such a commuter bulletin  board in local newspapers might prove ineffective, since many residents are  squeamish about public listings of their addresses and phone numbers.  </P> <P> Also, there is already a program to serve this purpose. It is called Commuter  Computer, and it offers motorists information about others who live and work  near them in an effort to encourage the formation of car pools.  </P> <P> Those interested can call Commuter Computer at (714) 636-RIDE for information  on car pools, van pools and the nearest park-and-ride lot.  </P> <P> A very valid point. Seat belts save lives. Just ask any CHP officer or  ambulance driver. Street Smart encourages motorists to use them, even if they  sometime wrinkle your tie or blouse.  </P></p>

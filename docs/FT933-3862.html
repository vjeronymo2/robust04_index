			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Colchester Lathe hopes for German recovery FOUR YEARS ago Colchester Lathe unveiled a range of products at EMO, the world's largest machine tool show, and sold 500 machines straight off the stand. 'It was the best show we have ever had,' recalled Mr Tony Sweeten. Next week, as the 1993 show opens in a very different business climate, there will be more new products on the Colchester stand at Hanover. But it would be a miracle if anything like that number were sold. Colchester lathes and those of its sister company TS Harrison are made by 600 Lathes, flagship of the 600 Group's machine tool division, of which Mr Sweeten is managing director. Over the last 18 months, he said, 600 Lathes' sales in continental Europe have fallen by 50 per cent. 'Germany is the industrial powerhouse of Europe and the recession there affects everywhere else,' he said. But Mr Sweeten is not down-hearted: 'We've given a reasonable account of ourselves in a lousy market,' he said. 'We've held our market shares, and even raised them in some cases.' Continental Europe accounts for 30 per cent to 40 per cent of the group's lathe sales, and has long been an important market for Harrison and Colchester. They both produce mainly 'centre lathes' - manual machines to make turned parts that are stalwarts of machines shops and toolrooms. Mr Sweeten said Harrison has been making metric machines for the European market since 1972. The more up-market Colchester has been particularly successful in Germany, helped by good marketing and a high-tech product. Mr Sweeten said the German market first started to decline 18 months ago, and went into a steep fall a year ago - just when the devaluation of sterling against the D-Mark was transforming the terms of trade for UK exporters to Germany, at least in theory. The sharp decline in Germany in the last three months of 1992 reflected a crisis of confidence throughout German industry. Many customers slashed capital spending and simply stopped buying machine tools. Sales in Germany had continued to fall, Mr Sweeten said. He expects the decline will continue until the end of the year. Germany, Europe's largest machine tool market, accounts for about half of 600 Lathes' European exports. But its machine tool market is running at less than 50 per cent of its levels 18 months ago. The decline in German sales has more than offset the benefits of devaluation. It is not all gloom, however. German competitors had higher costs and found it harder to cut them, Mr Sweeten said. In contrast, the 600 Group moved quickly in 1991 to concentrate all its lathe manufacturing at one plant in West Yorkshire. And for the business that remained in Germany, the UK group could offer better technology than its competitors for the same, or a lower, price. So Mr Sweeten believes the lathe business will have improved its competitive position when the continent emerges from recession.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "UN Experts Foul Up on Economy"] </F>   [Text] The proposals of the experts brought to Cyprus to  examine the UN confidence-building measures [CBM's] have been  much discussed. But they appear to have raised more queries  than they resolved. What is clear is that the UN staff imposed  certain aspects of the measures upon the experts, in such a  manner as to make what were supposed to be technical questions  ridiculous precisely from the technical point of view. In  general, the UN staff appear to have bent over backwards to meet  every conceivable Turkish objection, to the extent of proposing  sheer impracticalities.    This is most obviously so concerning the experts' economic  proposals. Why do they state that in the area of Varosha to be  resettled by the Greek Cypriot owners there should be no banks?  Why do they say that monetary transactions there will be in  foreign currency?    It is difficult to conceive how Varosha can be resettled and  developed fully to the benefit of Greek and Turkish Cypriots if  it is not integrated into the economy of Cyprus. Varosha could  act as a bridge between the economies of the northern and  southern parts of the island. But the Cyprus Pound would have  to be a crucial feature of this process.    The Cyprus Pound should be the main currency of the area,  not  simply because it is the currency of the Republic of Cyprus, but  because Turkish Cypriots want to have access to the Cyprus  Pound. It is the strongest unifying force on the island.    For years, Turkish Cypriots have had to suffer the rapid  devaluations of the Turkish Lira. But over the last week or so  they have had to put up with a wildly fluctuating Turkish  currency that has thrown trade into chaos. Confidence in the  Turkish Lira is zero, and Turkish Cypriots have been screaming  for a return to the Cyprus currency. Why, then, should the UN  intervene and say not All reasonable people on both sides of the  buffer zone would like to trade with the Cyprus pound as the  main currency. Does the UN listen only to unreasonable Turkish  Cypriots?    The UN proposals are also invalid from another point of  view.  It is proposed that the laws by which Varosha will be governed  are those in force prior to the withdrawal of the Turkish  Cypriots from government in 1963. The Cyprus Pound was the  legal tender at the time, so why exclude it from Varosha now?    Similarly, there were a number of Turkish Cypriot and  Turkish  banks operating at that time. They are still recognised by the  Central Bank of Cyprus, so it should be possible for the banks  that were operational in 1963 to function in Varosha.    One way out of the currency mess would be for the UN to say  that both the Turkish Lira (the currency used in the  Turkish-occupied north of the island) and the Cyprus Pound could  be used in Varosha. This would satisfy Turkish sensitivities,  while in practice everyone would be free to use the Cyprus  Pound. The ridiculous proposals put forward by the UN experts  simply reduce the credibility of the whole process.    The experts should be presenting suggestions to the UN which  guide the world body towards political solutions that can work.  it is a two-way process that requires interaction of ideas.  Unfortunately, the UN seems to have imposed political solutions  on technical questions, and this just leads to odd proposals.  It's a bit like the old saying about computers: "If you put  rubbish in you get rubbish out."</p>

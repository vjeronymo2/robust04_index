In practice, FDA modified its policies and procedures to comply with these changes as they became effective. The regulations are being updated to reflect these changes. The agency is also adding clarifying language to certain of its public information regulations and making technical changes necessary to update citations and cross-references.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective January 5, 1994.

Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA's practice and policy under the FOIA have undergone a number of changes as a result of legislation, executive directives, and judicial precedents over the past years. FDA modified and updated its practices and policies to comply with these changes as they became effective. FDA is now formally amending its public information regulations to reflect changes that were required by law and which have already been put into effect. Specifically, FDA is updating its public information regulations to reflect provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;508), the Freedom of Information Reform Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99&hyph;570), Executive Order 12600 (June 23, 1987) establishing predisclosure notification procedures, guidelines promulgated by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) (52 FR 10012 at 10018, March 27, 1987), the revised Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) regulations at 45 CFR part 5, and the widely adopted District of Columbia (D.C.) Circuit Court of Appeals opinion in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Public Citizen Health Research Group <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FDA <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 704 F.2d 1280 (D.C. Cir. 1983). The agency is also adding language to &sect;&sect;20.53 and 20.85 (21 CFR 20.53 and 20.83) in order to clarify particular aspects of those regulations that have been the subject of some confusion. In addition, FDA is making technical revisions to certain public information regulations to update citations to cross-references that have changed since the last revision of part 20 (21 CFR part 20).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Procedural Amendments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Investigatory Records Compiled for Law Enforcement Purposes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The language of &sect;20.64, regarding records compiled for law enforcement purposes, is being changed to conform to the 1986 amendments to the FOIA, which broadened the FOIA exemption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7) that protects certain law enforcement records from mandatory public disclosure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Disclosure to Congress  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 20.87 is being revised to reflect the provision of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 that removed the statutory barrier that previously prohibited FDA from disclosing certain trade secret information to Congress, (Pub. L. 101&hyph;508). Section 4755(c)(2) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 amended section 301(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 331(j)) in order to permit FDA to disclose to Congress certain trade secret information that is otherwise prohibited from disclosure except to employees of DHHS or to the courts in relevant judicial proceedings. Such disclosures to Congress may only be pursuant to a request from the Senate, the House of Representatives, any committee or subcommittee with jurisdiction over the matter being investigated, or any joint committee of Congress or any subcommittee of such joint committee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Trade Secret and Confidential Commercial Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12600, issued June 23, 1987, requires Federal agencies to establish predisclosure notification procedures in certain circumstances before releasing commercial information submitted by businesses. FDA has complied with the terms of the Executive Order since it became effective, and has followed the procedures adopted by DHHS in the regulations published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of November 25, 1988 (53 FR 47697). To clarify these practices and for the convenience of the public, FDA is incorporating DHHS' regulations concerning predisclosure notification into FDA's regulations governing the disclosure of trade secret and confidential commercial information at &sect;20.61. Accordingly, the standards and procedures promulgated by DHHS at 45 CFR 5.65(c), (d), and (e) are being added to FDA's public information regulations in &sect;20.61(d), (e), and (f).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 20.61 also is being amended to reflect the narrow definition of ``trade secret'' that was adopted by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Public Citizen Health Research Group <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FDA <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 704 F.2d 1280, 1288 (D.C. Cir. 1983). That definition requires a direct relationship between the information being protected and the productive process. The definition adopted by the D.C. Circuit in that case has become the most widely adopted judicial test for defining trade secret information under the FOIA and is already codified in the DHHS FOIA regulations at 45 CFR 5.65(a). This amendment to &sect;20.61 will not affect agency practice because FDA has distinguished between trade secret and confidential commercial information in accordance with the definition in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Public Citizen Health Research Group <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FDA <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  case since that case was decided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

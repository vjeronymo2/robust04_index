			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ernesto Landos; from the "YSU Radio News" </F> newscast]    [Text] Joaquin Villalobos, FMLN [Farabundo Marti National  Liberation Front] leader, said this Thursday a 60-percent  reduction in U.S. aid to El Salvador may adversely affect the  peace process. During the 11 years of armed conflict, the U.S.  Government invested some $6 billion in El Salvador, and so it is  inconvenient to cut that aid, Villalobos said. He said the  country still greatly depends on foreign cooperation.    [Begin Villalobos recording] We have signed peace accords,  and aid will be reduced by 60 percent two years after signing.  They invested $6 billion in 11 years and should at least invest  30 percent to 40 percent now. I believe this aid cutback is  inconvenient. This may adversely affect the peace process.    The country has been greatly affected by the war in terms of  its economic production recovery. One cannot ask that the  economic recovery be accomplished overnight. We still depend  not only on our participation in international markets but also  on foreign cooperation and remittances from Salvadoran emigres;  therefore, reestablishing production capacity and our economic  incorporation into international markets will take some time.  We require a careful treatment to consolidate our process.  [end recording]    Meanwhile, the former FMLN commander said he has enough  evidence to corroborate the involvement of one of the country's  most prominent businessmen in the death squads. He also said  they are expecting the accuser to testify before the  corresponding court.    [Begin Villalobos recording] What the defense has proposed  now is that the accuser, Mr. (De Sol), say what he has to say.  He has not yet appeared in court, but they want me to appear,  and this is inconvenient. We remain strong and ready to defend  ourselves. What happens is that the timeframe for the juridical  process would not be the same as if deliberations were  political. [end recording]    Villalobos said that until the process receives the  importance and juridical value it deserves, he will not present  the evidence he has against the businessman.</p>

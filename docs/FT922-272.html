			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Anger may mark S Africa funeral A nation-wide display of grief and anger is expected to mark today's mass funeral for 36 of the 42 victims of the Boipatong massacre in South Africa. It remains unclear who was responsible for the killings, which led to the African National Congress deciding to suspend constitutional talks with the government. But the political significance of the occasion will be heightened by its location. The dead will be buried in the cemetery at Sharpeville, the township where in March 1960 police opened fire on an unarmed, retreating crowd, leaving 69 dead. The ANC has called for a day of mourning, and the funeral will be marked by services around the country. President F W de Klerk has said government employees would be given permission to attend services. He urged the private sector to do the same. Police have blamed residents of a hostel complex in Boipatong, near Johannesburg, for the killings. The incident is now being investigated by a judicial commission to which two legal experts from India and Britain have been appointed at Mr de Klerk's request. Efforts to resolve the crisis precipitated by the slaughter continued over the weekend, with Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations secretary-general, accepting Pretoria's invitation to visit South Africa. The invitation was conveyed by Mr Pik Botha, foreign minister, during talks with Mr Boutros Ghali in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, on Saturday. Officials in Pretoria maintain that such a visit is part of efforts to pre-empt the ANC, rather than a concession towards the 'internationalisation' of the South African problem. Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC president, will discuss the crisis with Mr Boutros Ghali at this week's Organisation of African Unity summit in Dakar, Senegal. Mr Mandela is expected to press for Security Council intervention in the form of an international peacekeeping force.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Umberto Rosso: "Berlusconi Loses His Cool"] </F>   [Text] Rome -- So what if the European Parliament has  excommunicated the fascist ministers? "There is no reason to  assume that the members of that Parliament are enlightened by  divine grace and can really understand the situation. In fact  in this instance they have proven the contrary." This was the  comment from Berlusconi, who defended himself by firing  point-blank at the European Parliament. And by acting tough  with reporters. The journalists who gathered outside his house  yesterday morning to ask whether the European Union's "no" will  influence his approach, did not receive his usual smile: "How  can you talk about something that you know nothing about yet?  You are incapable -- most of you, I mean -- of understanding  innovation. You think according to the old patterns and cannot  even see the innovations that are occurring." The antifascist  "Euromotion" has irritated Berlusconi, who referred to Scalfaro  ("the president responded very well") and who now has to deal  with an institutional and political storm.    All senior officials, including Ciampi, are on the  president's side. The outgoing prime minister stressed his  "full support" for Scalfaro's remarks about "Italy's loyalty to  the values and principles that lie at the root of Europe's  Constitution." [Chamber of Deputies Speaker] Irene Pivetti --  following the example of the Senate speaker's immediate response  -- wrote a letter expressing her resentment to European  Parliament Speaker Egon Klepsch, condemning "the substantial  interference in the delicate constitutional procedures under way  in our country." And [Senate Speaker] Scognamiglio announced  that yesterday he also telephoned Klepsch, from whom he learned  of the latter's "opposition" to the motion approved, which he  personally did not vote for.    The resolution has split the parties in two, perfectly (or  almost) matching the actual alignments, with the pro-Berlusconi  front resolutely against and the anti-Berlusconi archipelago in  favor. So the progressive forces and the PPI [Italian Popular  Party] and Segni's center are pleased: According to [Democratic  Party of the Left, PDS Secretary General Achille] Occhetto, the  motion expresses "a not unfounded and widespread anxiety in  Europe" and Scalfaro was wrong to consider it "on the one hand  inevitable and on the other hand undesirable." Forza Italia and  the National Alliance are furious, with the Northern League  somewhere in between. This is what Bossi had to say: "Never  mind Berlusconi and his followers, we have an antifascist past.  Fascism, as it was conceived, no longer exists, but we must  remain vigilant." Then there is Maroni, who should be number  two in the government that will include the ministers that  Strasbourg considers fascists and who, according to the news  agencies, changed, within the space of half an hour, from  complacency to a rejection of the "Euroappeal." His first  comment, released at midday: "Does it constitute a problem for  us? No. If anything, it is a problem for Berlusconi. We too  have been saying these things for some time." Here is his  second version, timed at 1230: "The motion was inadvisable, and  constitutes pressure on the government that is about to be  formed. I have seen the names that are being mentioned for the  government, and I do not think they include any fascists or  individuals that pose a threat to democracy."    The other prospective deputy prime minister, the MSI's  [Italian Social Movement] Giuseppe Tatarella, displayed no such  inconsistencies and said that the resolution is merely  "obsolete, retroactive, and transcended by the people's vote."  "Banana republic stuff," was the comment from Mirko Tremaglia,  the MSI's candidate for the ministry dealing with expatriate  Italians. What about their secretary, Fini? He does not seem  very worried: "The issue will die down when the government  receives parliament's vote of confidence and can work on behalf  of the country's interests."    In any case, the resolution "contains no reference to the  National Alliance." It is "an attack by all the left-wing  forces. Europe will acknowledge that a government including  National Alliance members does not constitute a threat but  guarantees freedom, democracy, and peace for Europe too." The  Left challenged the idea that the European Parliament interfered  in Italy's affairs, albeit with differences of emphasis. Thus  [PDS number two] D'Alema acknowledged that Scalfaro considered  it his duty "to protect our country's sovereignty," but added  that this does not alter the fact that "the anxieties remain."  Nilde Jotti did not exactly agree, saying that, even if the  Italian situation may prompt anxiety, "the resolution, which is  unprecedented, is rather heavy-handed." And the former Chamber  speaker's criticism of Scalfaro was not for having spoken out  ("I would have done so too"), but for his tone: "A response  providing guarantees would have been better." There were  disagreements in the Center too, but these were more to be  expected. Formigoni, former European deputy for the DC  [Christian Democratic Party] and now a member of the PPI's  pro-Berlusconi wing, did not at all appreciate the  excommunication of fascist ministers: "It must have been one of  those motions submitted and approved with no debate, under the  impetus of a tide of propagandist feeling."</p>

			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PREVIEW: ORCHESTRA CONCERT FOR -- AND BY -- CHILDREN  </P> <P> "This concert would be fun for little kids because it's made for them."  </P> <P> So says Daniel Schlosberg, concertmaster in a free performance Saturday by the  Junior Orchestra of the CSUN Youth Orchestra Academy. Daniel should know what  small children would like since, at 12, he isn't far removed from being one  himself.  </P> <P> But that doesn't mean Daniel doesn't know his stuff.  </P> <P> "He's a very accomplished player," said Wes Kenney, director of the youth  orchestra, which actually is two orchestras. The junior group is made up of 65  players ages 11 to 14. The Senior Orchestra has 50 members from 14 to 21.  </P> <P> "They both play at a higher level of difficulty than most school ensembles are  capable of," Kenney said.  </P> <P> Saturday's "Music for Children" concert, set for 2 p.m. at Cal State  Northridge's Recital Hall, includes pieces by Copland, Mendelssohn, Meyerbeer  and Piccini. In keeping with the holiday season, some of the works are carols  and hymns.  </P> <P> Kenney believes that a special empathy develops at a concert where both the  audience and the performers are young.  </P> <P> "Kids can immediately identify that this is something they can do," he said.  "On the stage are people their own age, perhaps classmates. There are other  concerts for kids, but they're performed by adults."  </P> <P> Most of the orchestra is drawn from the San Fernando Valley, but members also  live in West Los Angeles, Malibu, Oxnard, Ventura and Pasadena. The group is  called the CSUN Youth Orchestra Academy because it is housed at CSUN.  Rehearsals take place every Saturday. The junior and senior orchestras each  perform about three times a year. A chamber orchestra, made up of the best  players combined with professional musicians, also gives occasional concerts.  </P> <P> "Our focus is teaching young people ensemble performance," Kenney said. "We  pick a program, a selection of music, and rehearse it for eight or nine weeks."  </P> <P> Tuition for the children is $225 for a season that runs from September to May.  </P> <P> Kenney lives in San Francisco and flies in for rehearsals and concerts. He  works as librarian for the Marin Symphony and has been guest conductor for the  Spokane Symphony and other orchestras.  </P> <P> The junior and senior ensembles are full orchestras, but like a Little League  coach who has trouble finding a catcher, Kenney says some positions are hard to  fill.  </P> <P> "Viola and string bass are No. 1 on the Christmas wish list," he said. "In  winds, trombones are down in ranks. French horns are difficult to find. I  always have lots and lots of flutes."  </P> <P> In Daniel, who lives in Sherman Oaks, Kenney has both a violinist and pianist.  Being concertmaster is no big deal, Daniel said.  </P> <P> "You just have to lead and get all the right bowings and carry out the  conductor's signals," he said. "The other players, maybe they can't see the  conductor and so they have to follow your bowing."  </P> <P> Still, he prefers the piano.  </P> <P> "I spend more time with it, maybe because it's easier," he said.  </P> <P>  "Music for Children" performed at 2 p.m. Saturday by the Junior Orchestra of  the CSUN Youth Orchestra Academy in Cal State Northridge's Recital Hall, 18111  Nordhoff St. Admission is free. Call (818) 885-3074.  </P> <P> MIKE WYMA  </P></p>

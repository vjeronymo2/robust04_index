			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Texas Instruments turns in best quarterly results Texas Instruments, the US semiconductor and electronics manufacturer, yesterday reported its best quarterly results. It also announced a broad restructuring of its European operations and the sale of some its software product lines. About 1,064 jobs will be eliminated, most of them in Europe. Net income for the quarter jumped to Dollars 134m, or Dollars 1.41 per share, from Dollars 81m, or 85 cents, for the first quarter of 1993. Strong growth in semiconductor sales produced a 30 per cent jump in first-quarter revenues, to Dollars 2.45bn from Dollars 1.88bn in the same period last year. The company said it would create business centres with pan-European responsibilities to replace its traditional country-by-country approach. The restructuring is expected to result eventually in annual savings of about Dollars 54m. The first-quarter results include a pre-tax charge of Dollars 83m for the costs of restructuring the European operations. An additional pre-tax charge of Dollars 49m was taken for the costs of divesting 'non-strategic product lines', primarily in information technology, the company said. Excluding the effect of charges and one-time royalty gains, profit from operations for the quarter would have been Dollars 256m and net income would have been Dollars 165m, or Dollars 1.74 per share.</p>

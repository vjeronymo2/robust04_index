			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / World Bond Markets: Small shadow over Pakistan offering - International Pakistan has just begun a new fiscal year, with the government of Ms Benazir Bhutto, the prime minister, set to continue its efforts to improve the country's macro-economic performance and the quality of its foreign exchange reserves. A policy of tight fiscal management has put much-needed brakes on excessive government bank borrowing. The budgetary deficit has been reduced to less than 6 per cent of GDP, down from almost 8 per cent, last year. Meanwhile, official foreign exchange reserves have risen to over Dollars 2.1bn, through a variety of short to medium-term borrowings. A year after last summer's political and economic crisis, the country has recovered from its all-time low reserves of below Dollars 300m. The recovery of reserves has been helped by a three-year Dollars 1.36bn IMF loan agreed earlier this year. Next year, it is planned to cut the budget deficit to between 4 and 4.5 per cent of GDP, and to lower inflation from 10 to 7 per cent. On the back of the past year's performance, the country is preparing to float its first Eurobond offering of Dollars 200m within the next three to four months, to convert some of its short-term borrowings into medium-term liabilities. Many analysts look upon the offer as central to the efforts of the government and the private sector to raise more funds on the Euromarkets. Recent rises in US interest rates followed by selling pressures on international bond markets have cast at least a partial shadow over the future of the offering but senior officials argue that it's impossible for any country to synchronise its domestic conditions with international circumstances. 'When you go to the Eurobond market, particularly when you are a new entrant, you should enter from the point of view of what is the best timing for you domestically, because internationally we do not have any control,' said Mr Mohammad Yaqub, governor of the central bank - the State Bank of Pakistan. According to Mr Yaqub, the country's recent performance in economic management, recovery of foreign exchange reserves and a perception from the international community that it's moving in the right direction strengthen its case. Other officials want to relieve growing budgetary pressures which have continuously forced the country to seek large capital inflows to narrow its current account balance of payments deficit. Almost one-third of the annual budget goes towards servicing the Dollars 23bn official foreign debt and almost Rs900bn (Dollars 29.5bn ) in public sector debt owed to local banks. Officials including Mr Yaqub are convinced that a successful launch of the bond issue would help the country convert some of its foreign exchange reserves, in the form of short-term borrowings, into medium-term liabilities and provide the added cushion needed to further improve macro-economic performance. 'Going to the Euromarket is of prime importance to Pakistan, not only for the government but also for Pakistani companies,' says Mr Nasir Bukhari, chief executive of Khadim Ali Shah Bukhari, a brokerage house. This year, Dewan Salman Fibre Company, a leading Pakistani group, for the first time floated bonds worth Dollars 45m while at least another two are preparing similar ventures. Many businessmen complain about high domestic interest rates, running up to 19 per cent, and a credit squeeze on local banks, which have made it hard to raise capital locally. However, analysts like Mr Bukhari warn against the possibility of a weak investor response, especially after recent events on the bond markets. He wants the government to consider trimming the size of the offer and making adequate arrangements for after-market support. The success of the offer also depends on the government's ability to carry on its economic policies in the coming year, which could be a difficult task. This year's cotton crop has suffered badly, lowering the total output to less than 8m bales from a target of 12m. Cotton is among the most important factors affecting the economy, as it generates almost 60 per cent of exports, directly or indirectly. Some business leaders have also complained of a widening recession, which they say has been caused by tight controls on government spending. As a result, local industry has suffered from falling sales since the beginning of the year. In spite of such concerns, the government claims it is determined to stay on course. However, for the past two years national growth figures have fallen behind target due to the cotton losses, and predicting the future remains a difficult task.</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Observer: Wiped out This is either taking recycling too far, or shows remarkable insouciance in the face of adversity. Some of Ukraine's increasingly worthless interim Karbovanets banknotes are now being turned into toilet paper. A Dnipropetrovsk papermill - about 500km east of Kiev - is turning 35 tonnes of old banknotes into loo-rolls every month. One dollar currently fetches about 135,000 karbovanets on the streets of Kiev, against 50,000 in mid-September. 'We get top quality paper from the banknotes. Only the colour  -blue, pink or green - gives away what it once was,' says Vladimir Vereshchak, the mill's director. It no doubt gives a cynical population some measure of satisfaction, anyway.</p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Retail figures reinforce Dow's negative mood Wall Street THE reversal in US markets continued yesterday morning with share prices giving up ground for a third day, before a late round of programme-buying helped the market recover in the last hour of trading, writes Karen Zagor in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood 8.29 higher at 3,351.51 in volume of less than 194m shares. Other market indices were mixed. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 firmed 1.80 to 409.05, the Amex composite was off 0.23 to 389.90 and the Nasdaq composite lost 2.03 at 567.68. On Wednesday, the Dow fell 26.70 to 3,343.22 after dropping 34.21 on Tuesday. The market's recent negative sentiment was reinforced by the release of retail sales for May, which painted a picture of continued economic sluggishness. The sales report, following Tuesday's release of a sharp drop in April consumer borrowing, added to investors' concerns about the pace of economic recovery. May's retail sales came in only 0.2 per cent higher with analysts expecting an increase of about 0.7 per cent. Stripping out automobile sales in the month, sales were unchanged. In addition, the April retail sales figure was revised to show a 0.4 per cent rise from a previously-reported 0.9 per cent increase. Also contributing to the equity market weakness was a report that jobless claims for the week ended May 30 were unchanged at 407,000 which gave further evidence of a stagnant labour market. Drug company stocks led big board trading through the day, with Bristol-Myers Squibb firming Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 63, Glaxo Holding's ADRs unchanged at Dollars 26 1/2 , Merck rising Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 49 1/4 and Abbott Laboratories holding steady at Dollars 27. The transportation sector continued to bear the brunt of concerns that the recent air fare wars would hurt airline company earnings, with the Dow Jones Transportation Average dropping 3.17 to 1,331.84. Among airline issues, AMR, parent of American Airlines, rose Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 63, Delta Air Lines slipped Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 57 1/8 , USAir was off Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 12 1/4 and United Airlines eased Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 115 3/4 . Burlington Northern, one of the biggest US railroad companies, fell Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 39 after an analyst at First Boston downgraded the rating on the stock from 'buy' to 'hold'. Amdura, a manufacturer of industrial hardware, plummeted Dollars 5 to Dollars 3 after a delayed opening. The company said that it was hiring an investment banker to help with a possible debt restructuring. Amdura, which expects to turn in a loss of Dollars 1.07m for the quarter to March 31, said that a holder of 10.5 per cent of its common shares has recommended a capitalisation plan to cut the company's debt. Canada TORONTO stocks closed slightly higher in moderate trading. Based on preliminary data, the TSE 300 index rose 16.74 points, or 0.50 per cent, to 3,385.37, although declining issues led advances 266 to 254. Trading volume of 22.9m shares was down from Wednesday's 24.9m, and trading value was CDollars 255m against CDollars 359.7m.</p>

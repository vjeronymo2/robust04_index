			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Nursultan Nazarbayev by Manfred </F> Quiring; place and date not given: "Now He Is Keeping His  Distance From Moscow"]    [Text] [Quiring] You reject dual citizenship. Why?    [Nazarbayev] I am afraid that this infamous dual citizenship  would split our society. With a recently issued ukase I have  fundamentally changed some not particularly fortunate passages  of the Kazakh Law on Citizenship. I passed on to Boris Yeltsin  and Viktor Chernomyrdin the draft treaty on principles  associated with the acquisition of citizenship in Kazakhstan and  in Russia. We should adopt laws that facilitate this.    [Quiring] On the eve of elections in Russia statements by  Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev that Russia wants to protect  the interests of its fellow citizens in the former Union  republics caused excitement. How do you see this today, after  Zhirinovskiy's election success?    [Nazarbayev] The key phrase is "on the eve of elections."  An election campaign has its own laws. However, I am also  quite sure that such statements have not at all reassured the  Russians who live in national republics -- in particular not  those who never had these problems.    [Quiring] In Kazakhstan almost 50 percent of the population  are Russian. What is your point of view about this fact?    [Nazarbayev] I am completely calm when I think of the act  that in Kazakhstan there are 8 million Kazakhs and 5 million  Russians. Some media want to see a problem where there is none.  Often there is talk of migration. However, this process is  unavoidable also under normal circumstances, all the more so  when an empire collapses.    Kazakhstan, like Russia, is a multinational state. For many  centuries Kazakhs here have lived together not only with  Russians, but also with Ukrainians, Belarusians, Germans, Poles,  Uigurs, Dunganes, and -- since the fateful time of the Stalinist  deportations -- also with Koreans, Chechens, Ingushes, and  Turko- Mezhets. I am convinced that there will be no ethnic  conflict in Kazakhstan.    [Quiring] But emigration continues to increase?    [Nazarbayev] I am seriously worried about that. Many  Germans, for instance, are leaving us. As regards the Russians,  I can give you the following figures: Last year more than  200,000 left the country, not only for Russia. By 1990 80,000  to 100,000 people left our republic every year. An  approximately equal number came to us. However, when listing the  current migration figures, one forgets -- for whatever reason --  to note that last year about 160,000 Russians came to Kazakhstan.    [Quiring] Among the political personalities who brought  about the end of the USSR, you are considered to be one of the  most far-sighted. Most recently, you have distanced yourself  from Moscow. How do you see the development of relations with  Russia?    [Nazarbayev] Thank you for the compliment, but I was not  invited to "seal the end." In fact, I have always advocated  integration in all spheres of our life. Now, also, I am of the  view that only together can we can find a way out of the crisis.    I cannot agree with the second part of your question. We are  not distancing ourselves from Moscow. On the contrary, we are  striving for closer contacts within the framework of the CIS.  For this purpose, however, we must bring our laws closer  together; we must form a common parliament and a common  government, for which one could take the Consultative  Coordination Committee of the CIS as a basis. We must  immediately establish customs, banking, payment, and other  unions, as they are envisaged in our treaty on the economic  union.    [Quiring] For a long time you were one of the most active  advocates of the CIS. After the collapse of the ruble zone, do  you still believe that the CIS has a future?    [Nazarbayev] The introduction of an independent currency --  and I have said so often -- was a forced step. Right to the end  we hoped to find a joint solution with Russia for the ruble  problem. However, the conditions proved to be unacceptable.  However, nothing bad happened for anybody. The difficulties,  which are linked with the introduction of national currencies,  are unavoidable in view of the temporary delineation. However,  it cannot be ruled out that we can come to a common circulation  of money in the future, perhaps even to the creation of a common  currency, following the model of the European Union.    [Quiring] In contrast to Russia, the parliament and the  local soviets in Kazakhstan have dissolved peacefully. Still,  is this a rejection of parliamentary democracy?    [Nazarbayev] Not at all! Now more than ever the republic  needs a professional, constantly working parliament, which is  able to adopt laws of a high quality and thus to establish a  reliable basis for the reforms, which we are implementing. The  special powers given to the president are valid only until a new  parliament is convened and apply only to issues, which are  linked with the economic reform. The elections for the new  parliament will be held on 7 March 1994.</p>

			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Defence factions fight for cash in 'review by stealth': David White identifies the military equipment projects that are vulnerable to the axe THE FATE of military equipment projects worth several billion pounds will be decided in the next few weeks. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, has to put the seal on new long-term costings, a secretive exercise conducted every year by the Ministry of Defence in conjunction with the Treasury. This year it has become, in the words of one senior MoD official, 'a defence review by stealth'. Government expenditure plans announced last November cut Pounds 1.05bn from the defence budget over the next two financial years. Projections for subsequent years will suffer commensurate reductions. In addition, the MoD has to find Pounds 80m a year to pay for reinstating 3,000 of the army posts it had hoped to cut following a decision by Mr Rifkind to reprieve the jobs and cancel two regimental mergers. Although some savings can be made in running costs, the bulk will come from new equipment purchases. The future of thousands of private-sector jobs hangs on the outcome - in companies such as British Aerospace, GEC-Marconi and the Swan Hunter shipyard on Tyneside. For the first time the costings for defence equipment are being extended to cover the next 15 years instead of 10 years. The three services are battling between themselves for weapons they will field well into the next century. The following are the main projects considered vulnerable in the short-term to being scaled down, postponed or abandoned: Helicopter carrier: The order for a Pounds 170m ship to support Royal Marines operations was due this October. But it is understood not to feature in the firm spending proposals put to ministers. The future of Swan Hunter and its remaining workforce of 2,200 are staked on the project. It has been competing for the contract against VSEL, the Cumbrian submarine builder, which would use a hull from the Norwegian-owned Kvaerner Govan yard of Glasgow. Swan Hunter, with no other naval shipbuilding work on its books beyond next year, would also be prime contender to build two new large assault ships worth about Pounds 200m each. Invitations to tender for the first of these were in theory due this spring, but could now be delayed. The navy is desperate to rescue these 'amphibious' ship projects and says they are its top priority. Alternative cuts could include disposing of its four new Upholder-class patrol submarines, which have cost the government about Pounds 800m to build. Type 23 frigates: Thirteen have been ordered so far from GEC's Yarrow Shipbuilders and Swan Hunter. The last three-ship contract worth Pounds 400m was placed with Yarrow early last year. The question now is when the next batch will be ordered, and if it will be the last. Sandown class minehunters: The navy has four of these from Vosper Thornycroft of Southampton, with a fifth being completed. The MoD invited tenders for up to seven more but let them lapse in 1991. The plan is due to be revived but with fewer additional vessels. Challenger tanks: The new Challenger 2 is due in service in 1995. Along with the 140-tank order from Vickers the MoD had plans for upgrading the existing fleet of about 400 Challenger 1s, all less than 10 years old, with the same new Royal Ordnance gun. The army is willing to field fewer tanks but wants them to be of Challenger 2 standard. A contract for new turrets or for 200 more Challenger 2s could be worth between Pounds 400m and Pounds 600m, providing between three and six more years of work for Vickers' tank assembly lines. Anti-tank rockets: A four-nation project to develop a 'terminal guidance' cluster weapon for multiple rocket launchers, known as MLRS 3, is 70 per cent complete. The US, which has an alternative system of its own, is set to pull out of the project later this year, however, and so is Germany. Britain, after putting Pounds 100m into development, may abandon the venture rather than go 50-50 with France. The French are committed to it and the British army considers the system a battle-winner, but the Treasury regards it as overlapping with planned air-launched weapons. At stake are 200 specialised jobs at Thorn EMI, the British partner in the industrial consortium. Army helicopters: Tenders have finally been invited for the purpose-built attack helicopter the British army has long wanted - a contract potentially worth up to Pounds 2bn. The army favours the McDonnell Douglas Apache, which Westland is promoting. British Aerospace is backing a European alternative, the new Franco-German Tiger, while GEC is proposing a cheaper option with a version of the US Bell SuperCobra. But the number purchased could be well below the 126 originally planned. The 1998 target for entry into service could also move. Tornado Mid-Life Upgrade: Plans costing up to Pounds 1bn for re-equipping the RAF's Tornado GR1 bombers could be scaled down to Pounds 300m. To be decided is how many of about 100 operational aircraft to upgrade and to what extent. GEC-Marconi is deeply involved. Original plans include replacing the aircraft's terrain-following radar with a 'passive' system. Troop-carrying helicopters: The MoD has had second thoughts about its plan to buy the 25 utility variants of the EH101 naval helicopter made by Westland and Italy's Agusta for the RAF. It now favours a competition and says it is not ready to place an order, although Pounds 1.35bn of government money has gone into developing the EH101. The RAF wants helicopters soon, and stopgap solutions being mooted include second-hand French-made Super Pumas. Replacement for the Bloodhound missile: The MoD is officially 'evaluating' bids in a Pounds 500m-plus contest to replace the Bloodhound air-defence weapon, already withdrawn from service, with a new medium-range surface-to-air missile (MSAM). BAe and Raytheon of the US are proposing a mix of Patriot missiles and an extra purchase of Rapier 2000 systems, while GEC is backing a Franco-Italian project, SAMP-T. Hughes of the US is promoting a ground-launched version of the Amraam air-to-air missile which the RAF is buying. A decision has already been delayed. The MoD has to decide whether to press ahead, go for a limited interim programme or to abandon the project and wait for a system better suited to countering the threat from ballistic missiles. The Treasury has demanded that a balance be struck in air defence between missiles and purchases of the new four-nation Eurofighter 2000 aircraft. The Eurofighter project is considered secure, although the issue of how to set about a revised programme is far from settled with the German government. The UK, having initially indicated a requirement for 250 Eurofighters, still has to work out how many it really wants. The aircraft is clearly the RAF's overriding priority. It is not certain how and when decisions on all these options will be divulged. But there is sure to be bad news for at least some contractors.</p>

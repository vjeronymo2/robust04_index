			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / FT Guide For The Serious Investor (1): Life without double-digit returns - Introduction / As investors face a period of adjustment, they should realise that tax-saving is not everything THE FINANCIAL services industry is eager to befriend the wealthy investor. Whether your lump sum comes from a redundancy pay-off, an early retirement package, the sale of a business, or the death of a relative, you will be sure to find plenty of people willing to advise you how to invest it. The problem lies in telling the difference between those who will make you wealthier still and those who will make themselves wealthy at your expense. Those who seek to help will display themselves in many guises: private-client stockbrokers, private bankers, independent financial advisers, financial planners, solicitors and accountants. Often the services will be very similar: private client stockbrokers offer money market accounts for your spare cash; private bankers emphasise their skills in money management. Choosing an adviser may, in the end, come down to whether you feel you can trust the individual concerned, whatever the category of organisation he or she works for. A good rule of thumb is to distinguish between technical and investment expertise. There are plenty of people who can give sound advice about tax and pension planning. But it would be a mistake to assume that your accountant knows where the stock market will be in six months time, or whether ICI will outperform Hanson. If he knew all the investment answers, he would have quit accountancy to live in Barbados long ago. Many investors will feel the need for a good adviser at the moment. For those who live off the income from their savings, the past three years have been challenging. Interest rates have tumbled around the world, reducing the attraction of the easy option of keeping money on deposit. Those who managed to switch out of cash at the right time - UK long gilt yields were still 12 per cent in early 1990 - have reaped the benefits. But many people realised what was happening late in the day and have only started to contemplate the switch in recent months. For them, choices are difficult. Lower interest rates have led to a rally in the prices of financial instruments. Bond yields have tumbled - 30-year US Treasuries were offering a touch over 6 per cent in August, long gilt yields around 7.5 per cent. Meanwhile, equity yields dropped below 3 per cent in the US, and 4 per cent in the UK. Even though economic recovery appears to be under way in both countries, those yield valuations look quite expensive by historical standards. So not only do equities and bonds offer, by recent standards, a modest income; there is always the prospect that if the interest-rate cycle turns, there may be a sharp fall in share and bond prices. Nevertheless, with inflation subdued in most leading economies, the world could be due for a long period of low interest rates. The bulls argue that the old measures of equity valuations, based on periods when inflation was much higher, are no longer relevant. Even so, investors face a severe psychological adjustment: they can no longer expect the double-digit percentage returns they received in the past. Some argue that a major investment theme of the moment is the gradual transfer of economic power from the high-wage west to the low-wage developing world, and in particular the Far East. The correct investment approach, therefore, is to buy bonds in the developed world and equities in the so-called emerging markets. Certainly, a week rarely passes at the moment without a new emerging markets fund being launched on an enthusiastic investment community. For those seeking ideas for their own investment strategies, this survey includes articles on portfolio planning - with tips from three financial advisers - and on unit and investment trusts, which the wealthy can easily overlook. Tax is also a very important issue for the wealthy investor, especially as the 1980s tax-cutting tide appears to be receding, with governments in the US, UK and Germany all producing tax-raising packages. For the British investor, there are a number of tax breaks available, from the soon-to-be-abolished Business Expansion Scheme (BES) to the flourishing personal equity plan (Pep). The survey has articles on the major shelters, as well as pieces on coping with capital gains tax and inheritance tax, and on setting up a family trust. As a wise investor once said, 'there are worse things in life than paying taxes', and it is a mistake to be carried away by the tax-free label. It is far better to earn 10 per cent and pay tax on the profits than to lose 5 per cent in some badly timed tax-free investment. Nevertheless, sometimes the tax shelters seem too good to be true; under the BES, for example, cash-backed property deals can offer to double the top-rate taxpayer's money over five years at minimal risk. And Peps have probably been of most benefit to wealthy investors (the most likely to pay CGT), who have simply transferred a chunk of their portfolios into tax-free form. For the international investor, it is the offshore tax havens that supply the siren voice. It is a mistake to think these havens are really tax-free: a UK investor is obliged to pay tax on his or her worldwide income. But a classic use for an offshore fund is to postpone tax until the individual is in a lower, or simply more advantageous, tax bracket. The activities of Bernie Cornfeld, and more recently Barlow Clowes, have indicated the dangers of investing beyond the regulators' net. Some offshore centres, concerned about their reputations, have tightened up their regulations and established compensation schemes; in the Managed Funds pages of the FT, investors should look for the label 'SIB-recognised', which indicates regulation of a standard similar to that applying in the UK. Such is the potential of the 'jet-set' market that many highly respectable firms have set up offshore funds. The giant US group Fidelity, for example, has a range of money market funds in Bermuda and a range of equity and bond funds in Luxembourg. With modern executives frequently moving between countries, the offshore market is likely to grow substantially; so this survey contains an article on financial planning for expatriates and a profile of the Channel Islands. Finally, the serious investor should not forget the importance of other types of cover; which is why the survey has pieces on insurance, both for your life and for your possessions, and, given the ever-rising cost of healthcare, on the latest medical insurance plans. Failure to insure oneself properly against these costs may be more financially ruinous than making the wrong stock-picking decision.</p>

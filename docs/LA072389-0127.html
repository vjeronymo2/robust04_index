			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REVISED STATE RULES BAR COUNCIL VOTE IN SIGNAL HILL  </P> <P> This city of 8,000 inhabitants has no movie theater or major chain supermarket.  There is only one major department store. But there are sensational views and  brushy hillsides ripe for housing developments.  </P> <P> In the most literal sense, this is a small city. A 2-square-mile city  surrounded by Long Beach, "The Hill" is a place where just about every property  owner has a vested interest in civic affairs.  </P> <P> And therein lies the problem.  </P> <P> The state Fair Political Practices Commission revised its regulations last year  to require that public officials automatically disqualify themselves from  voting on any project within 300 feet of any real estate they own, including  their homes, because it could present a conflict of interest.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Voting Power Annuled  </P> <P> City officials recently discovered that the revised regulations, when applied  to Signal Hill, wipe out the voting power of a majority of the five City  Council members and Planning Commission members on issues related to the most  important developments in the city -- luxury hillside housing that could  increase the city's population by 25%. Three members of each panel live within  300 feet of the proposed projects.  </P> <P> Two other planning commissioners and a council member reside within 2,500 feet,  the zone in which public officials are barred from voting if they believe a  project would increase their property values or business revenues by $10,000 or  more.  </P> <P> In Signal Hill's case, the 2,500-foot distance from the proposed luxury  developments boundary includes all but the northwest corner of the city.  </P> <P> "What value is there to being on the City Council if I can't sit here with a  vote and represent the people?" asked an exasperated Mayor Gerard Goedhart last  week as the City Council fumed over the ruling. Goedhart and council members  Louis Dare and Sara Ann Hanlon are directly affected, along with planning  commissioners Michael Noll, Jack McManus and Alan Ross.  </P> <P> City Atty. David Aleshire said he sought the commission opinion after public  officials were asked to vote on developments near their homes. He said the  ruling could affect other small cities as well. "It's really a problem trying  to apply these rules," he added.  </P> <P> The only way to put together a quorum for a vote on an issue is for the  disqualified members to draw lots among themselves. The winner would be allowed  to vote every time that issue arose, but only to break a tie vote.  </P> <P> Of course, that means decisions on some issues have to be delayed when one of  the city's two eligible voting council members is absent, as was the case last  Tuesday.  </P> <P> One agenda item involved what normally might be a more mundane function of  civic government: the realignment of a street. But because 20th Street was  being altered so that it will better serve the new developments on the hill,  City Atty. Aleshire said the conflict-of-interest regulations applied.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Quick Action Needed  </P> <P> One of the two qualified voters, Councilman Richard Ceccia, was absent. The  matter had to be held until next Tuesday despite the developer's pleas that the  project's success hinged on quick action.  </P> <P> "This is a frustrating situation for all of us," Goedhart said as the council  prepared to move on to the next item. "Maybe we should invite the FPPC (to the  next meeting so) they could see us in action." The quip drew polite laughter.  </P> <P> The council already has taken the first step toward fighting the regulations.  The members sent a letter to state Sen. Robert G. Beverly (R-Manhattan Beach)  asking for legislation that would exempt small cities such as Signal Hill.  </P> <P> "While the FPPC is trying to stop conflict of interest and rightly so, there  are special situations that need to be addressed. When there is a very large  percentage of the community affected, it needed to be represented by the full  council," the letter states.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Revised Last Year  </P> <P> Sandra Michioku, spokeswoman for the commission in Sacramento, said the  conflict-of-interest regulations were revised last year to clear up  misunderstandings among elected officials, who thought they were too vague.  </P> <P> While the commission's response to the Signal Hill inquiry was considered  merely an opinion, the commission has full authority to enforce its  regulations, Michioku said.  </P> <P> She noted, however, that public officials are allowed to vote in situations  where they believe the benefits of a project would accrue equally to all  residents.  </P></p>

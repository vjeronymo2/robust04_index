			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Midlands finds talk of price rises 'nonsensical' AT LEAST there is a housing market now - there was not in the autumn and the winter, said Mr Peter Veitch, a partner at Hadleigh Steven Viney, the Birmingham estate agent. 'But we're quieter now than we were six weeks ago. That throws me slightly. It was a quiet Easter. It's quiet now.' The driving force behind the market is the growing demand for homes at low and medium-price levels, agreed estate agents in the west Midlands. By that they mean prices up to Pounds 100,000. In the first quarter Dixons saw the number of its transactions running 15 per cent higher than last year. 'The most interesting phenomenon,' said Mr Bob Scarff, the managing director, 'is that we're seeing more of people selling for the first time and staying in the buying market.' Mr Philip Amphlett, managing director of Andrew Grant, said: 'People have been buying for the last four years out of necessity. Now we're getting people who are encouraged enough to start trading up again.' But agents can find little evidence to support building society surveys suggesting an increase in prices. 'To suggest prices have gone up by over 1 per cent in a month is nonsensical,' Mr Veitch said. To some extent the slack appears to be tightening. Agents have much the same amount of stock as they had three months ago. Mr Les Hill, business manager of Birmingham Midshires Property Services, said: 'In available properties we're probably keeping pace with what we started the year with. We have been instructed on more properties, but then we have sold more.' But this is not a sellers' market. Buyers are 'very canny indeed', Mr Veitch said. Mr John Allen, area director of Shipways, Royal Life Estates, said: 'Offers are still coming in below the asking price. We're trying to get our vendors realistic: it's supply and demand, isn't it?' He notes that 'under Pounds 85,000, sellers are less likely to accept a reduced offer. At the top end buyers are less likely to offer the asking price.' Mr Hill suggested that although 'there is a certain amount of chancing your arm', most deals conclude at about 10 per cent below asking price. Of course, the asking price can change. Mr Scarff said: 'Typically houses have been on the market three months before they're sold. But they're price sensitive. You can have one that's been on the market a year, then the price is reduced and it sells.'</p>

			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VIEW FINDER: ODDS &amp; ENDS AROUND THE VALLEY  </P> <P> All Dressed Up  </P> <P> "I don't even carry pants for little girls anymore -- they won't wear them.  They all want to wear dresses now, and the more roses and bows and lace the  better," said Kathy Kahn, owner of The Little Prints, a children's clothing  store in Woodland Hills.  </P> <P> Two-year-old Olivia Korenberg of Sherman Oaks refuses to wear pants, although  her 4-year-old sister Emilie will sometimes wear them. "They say pants are for  boys," said their mother, Francoise Korenberg. "We dance a lot and they like  the way the dress turns when they turn."  </P> <P> Some little girls love dresses so much that they wear two of them  simultaneously. "We see a lot of little girls layer their cotton knit summer  dresses," said Cassie Thompson, general manager of The Chocolate Giraffe, a  children's clothing store in Encino. "They wear a sleeveless one over one with  short sleeves, then use a T-shirt ring to bunch up the top one so you can see  the other one underneath."  </P> <P> Another popular summer look for little girls is skeggings -- bicycle-type  shorts with a skirt sewn over them.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Than 31 Flavors  </P> <P> Her job is to eat ice cream every day, sometimes as much as half a gallon. "I'm  forever buying ice cream at the supermarket, I'm forever going to competitors'  stores to see what flavors they have and I have samples sent to me from all  around the country when someone in another region introduces a new flavor,"  said Carol Kirby, vice president of Baskin-Robbins USA Co., the ice cream  manufacturer with more than 2,250 franchises nationwide.  </P> <P> Californians are about average in their ice-cream consumption, she said. "The  highest per-capita is in New England, although you'd think it would be warmer  places," Kirby said.  </P> <P> Since 1946, Baskin-Robbins has introduced more than 650 flavors, and the  formulas and flavor essences of each are stored in the "flavor library" at the  company's Burbank headquarters.  </P> <P> According to Kirby, pralines 'n' cream is the company's biggest seller. "As far  as flavors that didn't seem to appeal to anyone, there was date ice cream, or  pistachio ice cream that wasn't green, or ice cream with pears in it," she  said.  </P> <P> Some flavors that aren't successful in the United States do very well overseas,  such as mango, kiwi and papaya ice creams, which are popular in Southeast Asia  and Japan. Red bean, sweet corn and green tea ice creams have all be  specifically developed for Japan. "We didn't even try to mass market them  here," Kirby said.  </P> <P> Other flavors make comebacks, such as peanut butter and jelly ice cream. "It  didn't do very well about 10 or 15 years ago, but it's very popular right now,"  Kirby said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Big-Buck Trucks  </P> <P> Can you imagine spending $100,000 for a truck and not even taking it for a test  drive? "It's not necessary," said Tom Roch of Sun Valley, who has been selling  trucks for 35 years. He now sells Peterbilts at Engs Motor Truck Co. in Pico  Rivera.  </P> <P> "Just driving a truck tractor around the block, you're not going to learn  anything. You have to carry a trailer and a load to know what it's going to do,  so we rarely go out on test drives. Well, with new people you have to do it  occasionally," he says.  </P> <P> Today's top-of-the-line trucks resemble compact RVs. "They have sleeping  compartments with refrigerators and microwaves. Some have bunk beds that are  full-sized twins. And television is very common in a sleeper today," Roch said.  "They have sinks with running water. Some have their own auxiliary power system  so that when they're parked they can have electricity other than from the  batteries. And they've got CD players with high-quality speakers."  </P> <P> Then there are those glorious lights. "It's up to each individual's taste. Some  love to load them up with lights so they look like a Christmas tree coming down  the highway," Roch said.  </P> <P> Peterbilt trucks are the No. 1 seller in this area, according to Roch, although  nationally they are in roughly fifth place. When asked if he owned a Peterbilt,  Roch replied, "Oh, heavens no! But they are fun to drive."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Creative Visualizations  </P> <P> Picture yourself sitting alone on a beach, enveloped in radiant sunlight, lost  in the sound of the surf, your feet snuggled into the warm sand. Are you there  yet?  </P> <P> Every Wednesday from 7 to 8:30 p.m., cancer patients from around the Valley  meet, along with their spouses and family members, in a room at AMI Tarzana  Regional Medical Center to listen to this and other relaxing scenes being  described to them by Marilyn Stolzman, Ph.D., a psychotherapist with a private  practice in Woodland Hills.  </P> <P> Called "Cancer Support through Creative Visualization," the free weekly  counseling group is "an add-on that patients can do for themselves in  conjunction with prescribed medical treatment. You use the picture-creating  part of your mind -- the right brain -- to create positive images to move you  in a positive direction," Stolzman said.  </P> <P> Patients are encouraged to repeat mental exercises daily to help them manage  stress and to even help control nausea.  </P> <P> The group is sponsored by the Burbank-based Hematology, Oncology, Palliation  Education Foundation and the medical center.  </P> <P> Carol Lyons of Canoga Park, a frequent participant, was diagnosed as having  breast cancer a year ago. "I often feel out of control, and this group helps me  feel more in control," she said. Lyons is accompanied by her husband, Harry,  who uses the techniques to help him with his heart ailments.  </P> <P> For information, contact Sue Shearer at (818) 708-5460.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Overheard  </P> <P> "It couldn't be any harder to get my daughter into Radcliffe than it is getting  her into a local nursery school." -- Mother of toddler at Power of Play in  Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

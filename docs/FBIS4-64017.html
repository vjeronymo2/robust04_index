			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 26 TASS -- The State Duma today voted  against Sergey Baburin's move to express no confidence in the  government. The move was put to the vote and turned down by the  overwhelming majority of the deputies.    The attempt to topple the Chernomyrdin cabinet had been made  hot on the heels of the debate in the lower chamber about the  inadequate deliveries of food and petroleum products to Russia's  northern regions this year. Baburin proceeded from the critical  remarks made by the speakers who said the government was  unjustifiably slow in organising the deliveries.</p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / India to probe spy scandal Indian authorities yesterday stepped up their inquiry into a spy scandal which erupted last week at the heart of India's premier space organisation and threatens to jeopardise the country's missile programme. Two top scientists of the Bangalore-based Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) were arrested by Indian police on suspicion of having leaked vital information on India's space programme. Detectives will also investigate Indian press reports hinting at the involvement of two unnamed west European countries in the espionage. Bangalore's scientific community has reacted with shock and disbelief at the arrest on November 30 of Mr Nambi Narayanan, deputy director of Isro's Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre. Mr Chandrasekharan, Indian representative of Glavcosmos, the Russian space agency, was arrested on November 3 for allegedly leaking defence secrets to two Maldivian women suspected to be intelligence operatives. India successfully launched a polar satellite launch vehicle in October. The space programme has powered ahead in spite of a setback last year when the US attempted to stop Moscow from going ahead with a Dollars 250m deal to provide India with cryogenic engines. The US said the engines could be used by India to launch missiles and would violate the Missile Technology Control Regime.</p>

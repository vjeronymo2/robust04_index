			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES ELECTION  </P> <P> These days voting sites are difficult to obtain. I wish other businesses would  follow the example of the mid-Wilshire branch of Merrill Lynch Realty Co. They  graciously allowed a portion of their premises to be used as a polling site,  furnishing election workers with a fine place to work.  </P> <P> There is a dire need for workers on Election Day. Young people and men in  particular should volunteer to work the elections. They pay is small, but the  satisfaction derived is wonderful.  </P> <P> ELEANOR GAFFNEY  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOVIETS GRILL KGB CHIEF BEFORE HIS REAPPOINTMENT  </P> <P> Legislators today questioned KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkov about the workings of  his secretive agency and laughed in disbelief at some of his answers, but they  voted by a resounding majority to reappoint him.  </P> <P> The most aggressive deputies were unimpressed with Kryuchkov's responses to  queries on phone taps, informers and dossiers. But they relished the first  opportunity in Soviet history for a public grilling of the boss of the KGB,  which killed millions of Soviet citizens during the reign of Josef Stalin and  is still feared by many citizens.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Six Nay Votes  </P> <P> Only six members of the 542-member Supreme Soviet voted against the 65-year-old  Kryuchkov, who has been KGB chairman since last year and was deputy chairman  for 10 years before that.  </P> <P> Kryuchkov's confirmation came despite derisive snorts of laughter from the hall  when he claimed that the KGB does not tap Soviet citizens' phones and  complaints from several deputies about the KGB's network of informers.  </P> <P> Kryuchkov said the agency, which performs both domestic and foreign security  functions, "strictly follows Soviet laws" and has only a few "helpers" who  inform on their neighbors and colleagues.  </P> <P> Lawmaker Boris Yeltsin said Kryuchkov's statements about informers were  "insincere" and that in reality "an army of many thousands constantly informs  on what is happening in each work collective."  </P> <P> Yeltsin said there were agents in every Soviet institution. Yet during the 10  years he spent as Communist Party chief in the city of Sverdlovsk, "They never  caught a single spy."  </P> <P> Kryuchkov refused to reveal the KGB's budget despite repeated inquiries, but he  said it would be published soon and "you will be surprised when you see it."  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> CITY OF LOS ANGELES 1989 PILOT PROGRAMS  </P> <P> Looking for ways to improve its operation, the city of Los Angeles sponsors a  number of pilot programs in areas ranging from crime prevention to child care.  The money for these experimental programs comes from federal, state and local  governments, as well as from private corporations. This is a list of many of  the major programs approved in 1989.  </P> <P> </P> <P> California Youth Authority Re-Entry  </P> <P> PURPOSE: This one-year program, which began operating this month at the Fred C.  Nelles school in Whittier and the Ventura school in Camarillo, is aimed at  protecting society by providing training, counseling, self-esteem building and  job preparation six months before parole for 316 incarcerated youths.  </P> <P> FUNDING: A grant of about $754,000 is administered through the Community  Development Department and financed through the federal Job Training  Partnership Act.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Child Care Revolving Loan  </P> <P> PURPOSE: A one-year effort that is scheduled to start in December, the program  will offer loans to city residents who want to open child care centers in their  homes and who have begun the 60-day licensing process. Prospective child care  providers can receive loans of up to $2,000 to buy toys and cribs, meet  licensing requirements or help pay for insurance. The loans will be issued at  two points below the prime rate and will be payable within three years.  </P> <P> FUNDING: The city and the nonprofit California Community Foundation, a  charitable organization that works with United Way, have provided $225,000.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bilingual Home Health Workers  </P> <P> PURPOSE: Designed to train 168 participants, mostly Latinos, to become home  health workers and provide in-home care to people with AIDS, the program began  in April with 16 trainees. After completing eight weeks of training,  participants are placed in jobs with local home health agencies. Twelve of the  16 have completed the course and received their certificates.  </P> <P> FUNDING: A $600,000 Job Training Partnership Act grant will pay for the  two-year project.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Day Laborers  </P> <P> PURPOSE: A controversial six-month project, approved by the city in February,  is aimed at regulating the hiring of illegal immigrants, who typically  congregate at selected intersections, waiting to be hired by private employers.  The first site opened in Harbor City in late October and a second will open in  Sun Valley sometime next month. A total of six hiring sites eventually will be  set up around the city.  </P> <P> FUNDING: The city is providing $90,000 through the Community Development  Department.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Drew Medical Center  </P> <P> PURPOSE: In this six-month program that began in July, 36 school dropouts and  teen-age parents are being trained for a variety of health-related jobs,  including medical assistant, X-ray technician, ward clerk and laboratory  assistant. Participants will earn six-month certificates, be placed in jobs and  become eligible to receive up to 12 college credits from the Drew Medical  School. In some cases, participants will be able to use the program to satisfy  course requirements in Drew's associate's and bachelor's degree programs.  </P> <P> FUNDING: A Job Training Partnership Act grant is providing $194,675.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Neighborhood Pride  </P> <P> PURPOSE: Providing constructive outlets for youths who might be tempted to join  gangs or experiment with drugs is the goal of the program, which began July 1  and is scheduled to run through June 30, 1990. Up to 10 young people, ages 14  to 21, are paid the minimum wage to help professional artists design and paint  15 large murals in their neighborhoods, from Venice to South-Central Los  Angeles. Nine of the murals are expected to be completed by next summer.  Backers hope the yearlong program will instill in participants a sense of pride  in their work and neighborhood.  </P> <P> FUNDING: The nonprofit Social and Public Arts Resource Center will spend  $405,383 on the program, which is administered through the city's Cultural  Affairs Department.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Community Service Center  </P> <P> PURPOSE: The two-year project, a joint venture of the Community Development  Department and the Los Angeles Housing Authority, is designed to get more  residents at five of the city's most problem-plagued housing projects off the  welfare rolls and into the workplace. The first center opened Nov. 14 at Ramona  Gardens in East Los Angeles. Additional centers are planned at Nickerson  Gardens in Watts, San Fernando Gardens in Pacoima, Rancho San Pedro in  Wilmington and Mar Vista Gardens in West Los Angeles. The program offers  project residents counseling, job training and services ranging from child care  to basic education classes.  </P> <P> FUNDING: A $1.3-million Job Training Partnership Act grant is administered  through the Community Development Department.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Operation Clean Sweep  </P> <P> PURPOSE: This six-month program broadens the city's attack on graffiti and  calls for fines against property owners who do not sign a consent form allowing  the city to paint over graffiti at city expense. A new city ordinance makes it  illegal to leave graffiti on surfaces visible from a public roadway. If a  property owner refuses to sign the form, the city will cover the graffiti, send  the owner a bill or, as a last resort, assess the costs against the owner in  the form of a lien. Since the program began Sept. 8, the Department of Public  Works has received 915 requests to clean up graffiti. About 700 of those have  been granted.  </P> <P> FUNDING: The city, through the Department of Public Works, will spend $500,000.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Police Substation in Housing Projects  </P> <P> PURPOSE: Designed to crack down on gang- and drug-related crime in the city's  housing projects, the six-month program began in July at crime-plagued Imperial  Courts in Watts. Police hope to build a relationship of trust with the tenants.  A sergeant and 10 officers who volunteered for the program use a converted  apartment as their headquarters and work with two officers from the Housing  Authority's police force. Eventually the pilot project could be expanded to  more of the Housing Authority's 21 public housing projects.  </P> <P> FUNDING: The city budgeted $19,245 for furniture, office and technical  equipment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Refuse Collection Truck Operator  </P> <P> PURPOSE: The project, which started in September and ran for six weeks, helped  train 29 young people and adults to operate refuse collection trucks and  prepared them for placement in full-time employment. The Department of Public  Works operates a combination classroom and on-the-job training program. After  completing the program, each participant received a Class B motor vehicle  license and was hired by the city for two months on a part-time basis.  Twenty-two participants have prepared to take the Civil Service examination to  qualify for permanent employment, and 11 have passed.  </P> <P> FUNDING: A Job Training Partnership Act grant of $200,000 is administered  jointly through the Community Development Department and the Department of  Public Works.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stolen Vehicle Recovery Network  </P> <P> PURPOSE: In order to help curb the ever-growing problem of car theft, the  three-year program, approved in March, involves installing a "James Bond-type"  tracking device in about 150 Police Department patrol cars and a number of  police helicopters. Homing devices that work with the tracking equipment will  be available to the public in January for about $600, police said. If a car  with a homing device is stolen, police can track it down by sending out a radio  signal that activates the transponder in the car.  </P> <P> FUNDING: The LoJack Corp. of Braintree, Mass., an auto alarm dealer, will  donate $1.5 million worth of tracking devices and other equipment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Secured Area Foot Beat Enforcement (SAFE)  </P> <P> PURPOSE: Prodded by pleas from residents of crime-plagued neighborhoods, 60  police officers have been bused sinced early October to eight epicenters of  gang activity and drug dealing in the city. Police say the program already has  reduced crime considerably in the target areas. Statistics, however, were not  immediately available.  </P> <P> FUNDING: The Los Angeles Police Department is spending $750,000 for this  scaled-down, three-month program, which is to run until Dec. 1. Mayor Tom  Bradley balked at spending $2.5 million for the program, but promised to keep  it alive until June 30, 1990. The City Council will have to come up with money  for the patrols after current funding runs out.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Watts Friendship Sports League Task Force  </P> <P> PURPOSE: Operating at four city recreation centers -- Imperial Courts, Jordan  Downs and Nickerson Gardens housing projects and 109th Street Park -- the  program gives 240 youths in the grades 1 through 6 the opportunity to boost  their self-esteem through sports participation.  </P> <P> FUNDING: The city, through the Department of Recreation and Parks, is spending  $12,960 for the soccer season, which began in October and continues through  mid-December. The task force running the program is now seeking $44,000 from  private corporations for the basketball, track and field and baseball seasons.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Homeless Evaluation and Linkage Program  </P> <P> PURPOSE: Dubbed HELP, the three-month demonstration program at Weingart Center,  which began in October at the center, is designed to expand outreach services  to 15,000 to 20,000 homeless people in the Skid Row area. Social workers match  the homeless with existing jobs, housing and substance-abuse programs. Since  the program got under way, more than 220 people have been helped, 95% of them  receiving housing and meals.  </P> <P> FUNDING: The city and county have provided a total of $67,000.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Adult Sponsors for Youth at Risk  </P> <P> PURPOSE: A two-year anti-gang program run by the Community Development  Department, this effort is designed to pair as many as 500 adult volunteers  with children who live in five of the city's housing projects to help them  resist the lure of gang life. The program, which began last month at Mar Vista  Gardens, Ramona Gardens, San Fernando Gardens, Nickerson Gardens and Rancho San  Pedro, is aimed at youths between the ages of 8 and 14. Under the program, the  city also contracts with community organizations for after-school education,  child care and sports activities.  </P> <P> FUNDING: A $2-million grant comes from the U.S. Department of Health and Human  Services.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Youth at Risk Advocacy Unit  </P> <P> PURPOSE: The one-year program, which began in July, coordinates all  youth-at-risk programs throughout the city, which include programs for school  dropouts, nonviolent youthful offenders, truants, welfare youth, young people  learning English as a second language, pregnant teen-agers and teen-age  parents, learning-disabled and mentally retarded youths, victims of physical,  emotional or sexual abuse or violent crimes, and youth who have witnessed  violent crimes. The unit is in the process of setting up a hot line providing  information on where to go for gang-and drug-related services.  </P> <P> FUNDING: The city, through the Community Development Department, is spending  $2.1 million.  </P> <P> Sources: Los Angeles Community Development Department, Department of Public  Works, mayor's office, city clerk, Police Department and the Cultural Affairs  Department.  </P></p>

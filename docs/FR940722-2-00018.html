Armenis. This Notice satisfies the requirements of 10 CFR 1706.8(e) with respect to publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Under the Board's Organizational and Consultant Conflict of Interests Regulations, 10 CFR Part 1706 (OCI Regulations), an organizational or consultant conflict of interest (OCI) means that because of other past, present, or future planned activities or relationships, a contractor or consultant is unable, or potentially unable, to render impartial assistance or advice to the Board, or the objectivity of such offeror or contractor in performing work for the Board is or might be otherwise impaired, or such offeror or contractor has or would have an unfair competitive advantage. While the OCI Regulations provide that contracts shall generally not be awarded to an organization where the Board has determined that an actual or potential OCI exists and cannot be avoided, the Board may waive this requirement in certain circumstances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board's mission is to provide advice and recommendations to the Department of Energy (DOE) regarding public health and safety matters related to DOE's defense nuclear facilities. This includes the review and evaluation of the content and implementation of health and safety standards including DOE orders, rules, and other safety requirements, relating to the design, construction, operation and decommissioning of DOE defense nuclear facilities. In late 1991, Congress amended the Board's enabling Act, broadening the Board's jurisdiction over defense nuclear facilities to include the assembly, disassembly, and the testing of nuclear weapons. With this increase in responsibility, the Board revised its priorities to include reviews of additional facilities, including, principally the Pantex Plant (Pantex), Nevada Test Site (NTS), and additional facilities at Oak Ridge Y&hyph;12 Plant. The Board also recognized the need to direct its attention to the activities of the weapons design laboratories such as Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), and Sandia National Laboratory (Sandia). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two matters of immediate concern to the Board are the safety of ongoing weapons disassembly operations and maintenance of the capability to safely conduct nuclear testing operations. While the DOE had been engaged in these activities for decades, significant changes in the national security posture resulted in shifts in emphasis within DOE. Unprecedented numbers of simultaneous nuclear weapon retirements strained DOE's capabilities to develop and implement safe and well-engineered procedures. A Congressionally-mandated and Presidentially-extended nuclear testing moratorium removed the primary mechanism (i.e., an active, ongoing testing program) by which the capability to execute tests safely was exercised and ensured. At the same time, the weapons programs at the nuclear weapons laboratories were losing skilled and experienced personnel due to retirement, downsizing, and reassignments. This combination of issues required the Board to increase its attention, and with it the number of associated reviews, at both Pantex and the NTS. Further, the Board recognized that it needed individuals with expertise in multiple technical disciplines, not previously required, to effectively meet the challenges and responsibilities of its new authority. These technical disciplines included conventional and nuclear explosive technology and safety, nuclear materials handling and storage, criticality safety, and nuclear weapons assembly, disassembly, storage and testing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the Board initiated an employee recruitment effort for individuals with formal training and experience in weapons related disciplines, it also recognized a need for technical assistance from outside experts who have direct relevant experience in this area. The Board identified Mr. Nicholas P. Armenis as an individual with the requisite knowledge and experience needed to provide the Board with immediate assistance in the weapons area and entered into an agreement with him for support services. Under this arrangement, Mr. Armenis provides technical expertise with respect to the design of nuclear weapons currently being returned to Pantex for dismantlement, including historical insight related to specific design and test details of the weapons systems. In particular, his expertise related to the mechanical aspects of weapons physics packages is being utilized to ensure the safe disassembly, handling, and storage of these nuclear weapons systems. Through the Board's direction, he has participated in reviews of various weapon dismantlement procedures, observed the complete dismantlement of selected weapons, and provided valuable insight into DOE developed operating and inspection standards for these activities. The Board believes that its activities, supported by Mr. Armenis, have contributed to the following achievements at Pantex; institution of a practice whereby the responsible DOE laboratories (LANL, LLNL, Sandia) review procedures for disassembly of nuclear weapons for identification of potential safety questions; and improved conduct of operations in disassembly of nuclear weapons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

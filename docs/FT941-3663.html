			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Productivity gains boost Greggs Greggs, the baker, reported a very good 1993, with pre-tax profit up 29 per cent to Pounds 9m for the 53 weeks to January 1, against Pounds 6.97m for the 52 weeks to December 26 1992. Turnover rose 9.3 per cent to Pounds 110.4m (Pounds 101m), or 8 per cent adjusting for the effect of the extra week. The company said an improvement in its pre-tax margin from 6.9 per cent to 8.2 per cent reflected productivity gains and improved energy efficiencies. Earnings per share were up 30 per cent to 53p (40.6p). A proposed final dividend of 12p makes a total of 18p (15p), an increase of 20 per cent In January, Greggs opened its 500th shop and plans to add a net 20 outlets this year. 'We're the biggest retail bakery company in Britain and the most profitable,' said Mr Mike Darrington, managing director. During 1993 its London business, acquired in 1987 and since expanded, moved into profit for the first time. All other divisions improved their performances and profitability, with Scotland showing the best profit increase. Net cash stood on January 1 at Pounds 12m. This year Greggs is investing Pounds 14m including Pounds 8m on two new bakeries in London and Birmingham. Allowing for this investment programme, financed from cash reserves, it anticipates having net cash of between Pounds 6m and Pounds 7m by the end of this year. Mr Darrington forecast a very satisfactory improvement in profitability for the first half of the present year. The investment programme was likely to mean slower profit growth in the second half and early 1995. However, its prime aim, he said, was to enhance the quality and enjoyability of Greggs' products. Britain, he thought, placed too much emphasis on efficiency and too little on making products people wanted to buy. 'I see more talk about getting unit costs down than about making excellent products. 'If they are not going to enjoy the product, it does not matter how cheap I make it.'</p>

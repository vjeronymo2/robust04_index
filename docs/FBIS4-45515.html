			<p>Coca-Dependent   Economy   <F P=102> PY2106215694 La Paz PRESENCIA in Spanish 12 Jun 94 p 7 </F> <F P=103> PY2106215694 </F> <F P=104>  La Paz PRESENCIA </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Delfin Arias Vargas] </F>   [Text] According to several government officials,  alternative development, understood as a process of  socioeconomic transformations, is the main instrument intended  to reverse the economy that depends on coca in the Chapare  region.    According to official data provided by the Government  Ministry and other state and private institutions that work in  programs seeking to replace coca crops with other products,  those remarks are based on the gradual increase in  agroindustrial activities in that controversial area.    Although this solution is apparently feasible, there are  several objections such as the inconceivable influence of drug  traffickers to maintain justifiable prices for the surplus coca  leaves, the precarious economic situation of most peasants in  the Chapare region, and the lack of assured markets for the  products they intend to replace, without mentioning the  industrialization of coca for a reduced national market that  makes the project already approved by the executive branch  unfeasible.    Notwithstanding this situation, government officials claim  that the change is possible. They argue that in the past few  years the investment of more than $200 million in the region has  helped conduct a gradual transformation that will help improve  the production capacity and the growth of alternative crops.    Gaston Martinic, chairman of the National Fund for  Alternative Development (Fonadal), stated: "If we manage to  make the peasants understand this, namely the peasant producers  of coca, we will be paving the way toward the fulfillment of the  anti-drug fight's objectives, in addition to achieving a process  for development and voluntary replacement of coca crops."    In a seminar sponsored by the La Paz Reporters Association,  Martinic explained that preliminary studies have determined that  the share of the coca-cocaine economy in the country's GDP in  1987 was 26 percent. He added that coca production yielded $238  million, mainly benefiting drug traffickers.    Since then, drug enforcement action has allowed substantial  achievements, including the eradication of almost 25,000  hectares of coca crops considered illegal by Law No. 1008.  However, the action has caused the loss in value added tax  revenue of $472.3 million for the country, which uncovered the  national economy's dependency on the coca-cocaine circuit,  Martinic added.    Official reports on projects carried out through March in  Chapare allow us to cite the following results that, considering  the 250,000 inhabitants living in that region, cannot be called  successful, according to peasant leaders, who even question the  figures' accuracy.    With the support of U.S. AID and the UNDCP [United Nations  Drug Control Program] of the United Nations, 818 km of roads  were restored, 618 km were made usable, and 19 bridges were  built in the region.    They said that in the past few years U.S. AID has subsidized  the construction of 38 schools, the provision of drinkable water  to 59 towns, the revamping of 15 community centers, and a vast  social assistance program.    Concerning electric services, 394 km of primary lines, 110  km  of secondary lines, and 24 transformers were installed, and  1,165 street lights also were installed.    The same reports add that the increase in alternative crops,  which despite the gradual increase, only matches the surplus  coca crops estimated at 35,500 hectares.    Bananas: A total of 7,075 hectares were planted in 1986, but  in 1993 banana plantations reached 10,875 hectares. Pineapple:  In 1986 a total of 395 hectares of pineapple were harvested,  but 2,618 hectares were planted in 1993. Black pepper: The  first crops reached 32 hectares in 1993. Passion fruit: A total  of 63 hectares of this fruit were planted in 1993. Subsistence  crops: In 1986 a total of 8,000 hectares were planted, while in  1993 planting reached 11,558 hectares. Heart of palms: A total  of 241 hectares were planted in 1993 alone.</p>

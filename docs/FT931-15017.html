			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Australian jobless rate declines AUSTRALIA'S unemployment rate fell by 0.1 points to 11.3 per cent in December, the government said yesterday. Mr Peter Baldwin, the junior employment minister, said the fall was consistent with continued growth in the economy, which is recovering from an 18-month recession. However, economists said it was probably a technical correction following a large increase in the previous month. Unemployment is likely to rise over the next three months as school leavers enter the employment market. The weak jobs market will contribute to growing pressure on the government to produce a fiscal stimulus before the next election, which must be held by June. Mr Paul Keating, the Labor prime minister, is believed to have been working on a series of policy proposals to be announced before the election is called. The government is unlikely to stimulate the economy by easing monetary policy because of continued weakness of the Australian dollar.</p>

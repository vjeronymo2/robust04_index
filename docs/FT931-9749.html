			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: Western Mining halves payout as profits tumble WESTERN Mining, the Aus-tralian metals and commodities producer, has come through another six months marred by low prices and asset write-downs with a halved dividend and reduced profits. The company is cutting its interim dividend from 6 cents to 3 cents a share following a 44.3 per cent reduction in net equity-accounted earnings to ADollars 53m (USDollars 35.8m) for the six months ended December. Total revenue improved 2.6 per cent to ADollars 820.4bn. The result was before an abnormal loss of ADollars 26.2m, mainly reflecting amortisation and asset write-offs. This compares with abnormals a year ago of ADollars 200m when the company wrote down the value of its mining properties, mainly in the gold mines. The biggest blow to the group, headed by chief executive Sir Arvi Parbo, came from low world nickel prices which cut nickel earnings from ADollars 19.5m to ADollars 7.9m. Average nickel prices received fell 8.8 per cent in the year, with a 6.8 per cent cut in output contributing to higher unit costs. Oil earnings fell to ADollars 27.1m from ADollars 31.2m and the equity contribution from the Alcoa aluminium group fell to ADollars 56.5m from ADollars 77.8m. Gold earnings remained static at just over ADollars 40m, but the Olympic Dam copper-uranium project pushed ahead strongly, lifting earnings to ADollars 27.4m from ADollars 10.3m. Despite the tight trading conditions, the company lifted capital expenditure to ADollars 194m from ADollars 170m, mainly on expansion of nickel capacity. Western Mining is to proceed with development of the Mt Keith nickel deposit in Western Australia at a likely cost of about ADollars 350m and had also reached agreement in principle for the sale of the Chibougamau gold mine in Canada. The result followed a tax credit of ADollars 11.3m (against a ADollars 24.7m charge) and depreciation of ADollars 174.5m, against ADollars 135.6m. Exploration expenditure written off fell to ADollars 34.1m from ADollars 45.4m and the company's interest expense fell to ADollars 16.1m from ADollars 21m.</p>

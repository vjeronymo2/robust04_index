			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Portugal (1): Euro-train's bumpy ride - The country's modernisation drive is slowing down as it wrestles with ambitious targets for European economic and monetary union. The challenge now will be to keep on track PORTUGAL'S express train to modernisation is having to slow down as economic and political uncertainty threatens to derail plans for European Economic and Monetary Union (Emu). No-one has yet pulled the emergency brake in panic, but after the recent financial markets' turmoil, some passengers are wondering if it might not be a good idea to jump off the Euro-train altogether. Firmly in the driving seat, Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva shows no sign of trepidation. For the prime minister and his right-of-centre social democratic administration, there is no realistic alternative to deeper European union for Portugal - or for Europe. He believes much of the damage caused by upheavals in the financial markets could have been minimised or avoided had appropriate institutions and instruments been there to counter it. 'What all this (turmoil) has shown is that we need more, not less, co-operation; that it is important to press ahead more urgently with Emu,' he says. There is broad support for this policy in Portugal, from the ruling Social Democrats to the Socialist opposition. Portugal will not have a referendum on the Maastricht treaty, whose ratification will be approved by parliament shortly. This requires minor constitutional amendments, but the socialist party says it will support the necessary changes. Dissent over Europe, which had been subdued and mainly left to the political fringes, was given a boost by the Danish No to Maastricht and the narrow victory of the Yes vote in France. Arguments about sovereignty, however, have taken second place to concern over the costs of European union. Farmers and industrialists who feel threatened by the single market have been more insistent in their calls for protection, lower interest rates and a devaluation of the escudo. The government's response is that interest rates are falling anyway, and that producers must become more efficient rather than rely on competitive devaluations to sell their wares. The problem for Portugal is that as a small, open economy it cannot avoid the consequences of economic downturn - or significant currency devaluations  -in its major markets. Lower international growth already is reflected in a downward readjustment of expectations for Portuguese GDP growth to 2-2.5 per cent from 3 per cent forecast a year ago. While this remains sturdy enough by European standards, it is sharply down on the 4.5 per cent average annual growth rates registered by Portugal in the five boom years that followed its accession to the Community in 1986. 'Of course growth will be lower, but we'll keep growing. We have no indications pointing to a recession. We are concerned about the international situation and our budget reflects our concern. This is the time to cut expenditures,' says Mr Cavaco Silva, who is prepared to use the crisis in Europe as an additional reason for tightening up at home. A tough budget for 1993 aims at further reducing the budget deficit from above 5 per cent to below 4 per cent of GDP. As there will be no extra taxes to help balance the government's books, the difference will come mostly from reducing expenditure, with most ministries asked to cut recurrent spending by 5 per cent. Unnecessary or inefficient public services will be abolished or rationalised, and public sector wages will be kept firmly in check, both to control costs and to set an anti-inflationary example to the private sector. Inflation is forecast to decline, from a little above 9 per cent this year to 5-7 per cent. Keeping inflation and wages down may prove difficult with unemployment at below 4 per cent, while investment must be maintained at high levels if the process of modernisation and restructuring of the Portuguese economy is to continue. However, the government is prepared to accept a rise in unemployment as it would help to reduce labour market rigidities. The government is to attack inefficiency on several fronts at once. The civil service will be trimmed, the health service reformed and partly privatised, the country's top-heavy armed forces will be cut with a large number of officers given early retirement, the capital's police force will be reorganised, university fees are to be raised and set according to a means test, and a new law aims to make strikes more difficult, especially in the public sector where labour unrest is greatest. Privatisations will be accelerated. There have been howls of protests from students, army officers and trade unions - a combination that proved such a potent political cocktail in the heady days of revolution in 1974-75. But today each group pursues widely different and divergent interests, the colonial wars are over, democracy has been firmly anchored, and prosperity has raised individual expectations. There has been a sea change in attitudes, and the government is confident it can ride the storm. Part of this confidence stems from experience. A two-month strike by public sector transport workers last winter was highly unpopular and ended, not for the first time, in defeat for the unions. Earlier reforms also proved unpopular initially but eventually went through. With an absolute majority, the government has another three years before a general election, and by then it hopes to reap the benefits it expects to flow from its reforms. Meanwhile, the opposition is in disarray and in no condition to mount an effective counter-attack. As the largest opposition party, the moderate Socialist party should be leading the charge against the government, but its policies on key issues are not fundamentally different from those of Mr Cavaco Silva's Social Democrats, and it is weakened by internal party strife. The once-powerful hard-line Communist party is ageing and declining, while the small right-wing CDS is looking for a coherent programme under a young and relatively inexperienced new leader. With the political initiative firmly in the government's hands, an economy still growing and the general feeling of most Portuguese that they are better off today than they were five or 10 years ago, Mr Cavaco Silva would seem to have little to worry about, were it not for international uncertainties which could throw the government's strategy off course. A major part of that strategy relies on continued high levels of investment, with foreign investment playing a crucial role. The opening up of eastern Europe has not noticeably affected investment levels in Portugal, but the worldwide economic downturn is delaying investment decisions, as well as making it harder for Portuguese manufacturers to export. Yet Portugal needs more investment and EC assistance to engage in real economic convergence with its richer EC partners. That is why a resolution to the current crisis within the Community and early agreement on a new package of EC funds including the new 'cohesion' fund to help the EC's poorest states modernise their infrastructures is so important for Lisbon. The transition from a backward, underdeveloped economy to a modern one has only recently begun, with striking progress achieved in the past six years. But much has still to be done to overcome structural weaknesses and make industry competitive. 'We have a problem in the agricultural sector, and even at the end of the transition period (2001) which we have negotiated with the Community, it will not be easy to compete abroad. It's a sector where we have real difficulties. Another matter for concern is the limited capacity of entrepreneurship in Portugal, and you can't create that by decree,' says Mr Cavaco Silva. So far, the government's strategy of gradual change has been remarkably successful - with help from the EC and a favourable international environment. The challenge now is how to keep on track towards Emu under less auspicious conditions - provided that is, that the Emu station itself has not been knocked down or specially redesigned for trains running at different speeds.</p>

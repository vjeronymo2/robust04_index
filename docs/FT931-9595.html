			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Louis Newmark loss mounts LOUIS Newmark, the Surrey-based watch merchanting, engineering and specialist equipment group, tumbled further into the red in its half year to October 3. On turnover down 13 per cent to Pounds 10.7m (Pounds 12.2m), partly reflecting the loss of the Swatch agency in June 1991, the pre-tax deficit increased to Pounds 993,000 against Pounds 187,000 in the comparable period. Turnover in continuing activities dipped by 1.6 per cent. The outcome was struck after interest charges increased to Pounds 531,000 (Pounds 62,000) as a result of the decision to cease capitalising interest on the group's investment in access control systems. Losses per share were 33.5p (6.3p). The directors said the second half would be materially better than the first and next year should show continuing recovery. The company is in discussions with a third party with a view to their making a capital injection.</p>

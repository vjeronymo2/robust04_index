			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Crimean Economics Minister Andrey </F> Chernyavskiy by announcer Igor Gavrilov in Moscow on 8 June;  first in a series of features on Crimea entitled "The Last  Frame" -- recorded]    [Text] [Chernyavskiy] When in February we came for our  first acquaintance with Crimea, with Simferopol, we were taken  aback by the Crimean people's exceptionally poor standard of  living, although this is apparently the same for all of Ukraine.  The Crimean economy has been drawn into the general economic  crisis that has gripped all the former CIS countries, but this  crisis is particularly dramatic in Russia and Ukraine.  Inflation is galloping ahead in Ukraine; it is a particular  feature of the Ukrainian economy, a particular feature of its  leadership because of specific stances taken by the leaders and  senior officials in the Council of Ministers and the bank, the  people who make these kinds of decisions.    Last year, as you know, the Russian ruble depreciated to  one-tenth of its value and the karbovanets to one-hundredth of  its value. When you have this kind of depreciation of the  currency, you get a very rapid drop in the standard of living  for workers in the public sector, first and foremost, and the  pensioners. Social tension increases sharply. The incomes of  Crimean people have diverged from, and not overtaken, those of  their neighbors across the Kerch strait, from Krasnodar Kray.  All of this has given rise to great discontent with Crimea  being part of Ukraine, to calls for Crimea to join the ruble  zone and so on.    Analysis of the situation of Crimea demonstrates, moreover,  that Crimean industry and agriculture were set up first and  foremost to trade with Russia and Crimean industrial  enterprises. Crimea has a lot of top-class enterprises that  received large sums of capital investment even in the stagnation  years and are now lying idle. These enterprises were oriented  towards trading with Russia and obtaining materials from Russia.  As economics minister, I have already had several trips to Kiev  for consultations with the leadership of Ukraine on the reforms  in Crimea. It is clear to us that any steps we might take can  only be done with the good will of Ukraine. Moreover, certain  steps were very well received by Ukraine, not well in the sense  that somebody approved these steps in themselves, but in the  sense that there was a view that these kinds of things needed to  be done in Ukraine -- in particular, currency regulation. The  fixed rate of the karbovanets is a colossal obstacle to getting  Ukraine out of crisis. And now, as far as I know, Ukraine  itself has made a decision to move to a floating exchange rate.    Crimea is a unique region in terms of its natural resources  and its geographic situation, and we certainly need bolder  economic solutions for Crimea, in my view.    [Gavrilov] That means you're saying there could be a free  economic zone set up here, like many that have been set up. I  believe such proposals have, in outline, been made?    [Chernyavskiy] Yes, we have come across such projects. You  couldn't really make the whole of Crimea a free economic zone,  because these zones are set up in areas where there are open  spaces away from the inhabitants. Well, Crimea has developed  industry and developed agriculture cooperatives actively with  Ukraine and we are therefore not looking to set up a free  economic zone. We are talking about the possiblity of  implementing economic reforms more rapidly than Ukraine in the  areas of currency regulation, of having a more active program of  attracting foreign capital into Crimea. Many investors say they  would put money into Crimea, but the stability question wipes  out their intentions.    Crimea and Ukraine have a difficult relationship on the  question of allocating central credit resources to Crimea. One  could generalize and say credit allocation in Ukraine is not  quite normal and is reminiscent of Russia at the start of 1992.  All in all, everything in Ukraine reminds me of our Russian  history of two or three years ago. However, in the area of  finance and credit, Russia has made tangible steps forward in  those years and has to some extent succeeded in setting up and  stabilizing a new finance and credit system. I see that in  Russia now there is no great difference between the Central Bank  of Russia bank rate and that of commercial lending rates. In  Ukraine there is this difference.    [Gavrilov] A lot of people are now talking about the Saburov  team, Saburov's Moscow team, and you're a full member of that  team. Can you tell me, please, what this team is? Is it people  who just happen to be there or are they all people of like mind  who knew each other before?    [Chernyavskiy] This idea arose because President Yuriy  Meshkov invited Saburov in effect to be prime minister of  Crimea, and Saburov then decided to invite in several people  from Moscow to be able to implement a certain agreed policy.    [Gavrilov] Do you notice the effect that people say that  Moscow invaders are coming in to get Crimea's economy to pick  up? One hears rejoinders that "they" have lived in Moscow with  their offices of economists and academics.    [Chernyavskiy] Professionally, I don't personally believe  anybody is pushing me in Crimea, and it has always been the case  that there have been a lot of people in the natural sciences  coming here. If you're talking about economic centers, economic  institutions, one's own economic school, there is none of that  in Crimea.    [Gavrilov] Tell me, is it going to be hard for you and your  Moscow friends to come here and work?    [Chernyavskiy] Yes, of course, it has been quite a drastic  step and, of course, it is very difficult work. Moreover, we  have taken a very big drop in income because officials are  poorly paid in Crimea by Russian standards. For the time being  I still see my mission in Crimea as interesting.    [Gavrilov] You won't run away?    [Chernyavskiy] That's a good question. When we came to  Crimea in February, I and probably all members of the team  started to look at Crimean problems from the standpoint of  Crimea and... [broadcast of interview ends]    [Gavrilov] That was Crimean Economics Minister Andrey  Chernyavskiy.</p>

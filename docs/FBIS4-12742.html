			<p>BFN     [Text] Israel and the PLO decided to discuss several  disputed issues after the Gaza-Jericho agreement is signed,  Major General Amnon Shahaq, head of the Israeli delegation,  announced in Cairo.    Our correspondent in Cairo Arye Gus reports that the two  sides decided that the Palestinian police force in Gaza and  Jericho will number 9,000 men, with 6,000 of them to be deployed  immediately after the agreement is signed. They will be armed  with automatic rifles and guns, and will have at their disposal  120 machine guns and 45 armored vehicles. Some 310 officers and  policemen will be allowed to enter the area at this stage.    Another 50 deportees, including 'Arafat's adviser 'Akram  Haniyah, will be allowed to return to the territories within two  days. Also, there will be a gradual and massive release of  5,000 prisoners. These will not include members of Hamas  [Islamic Resistance Movement] and terrorists whose hands are  tainted with blood.</p>

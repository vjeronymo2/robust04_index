			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Li Dahong (2621 1129 1347): "Will There </F> Be New Progress in People-to-People Negotiations Between the Two  Sides of the Strait This Year?"]    [Text] With the 1994 New Year holiday barely over, Chiao  Jen-ho, the newly appointed deputy board director and  concurrently secretary-general of Taiwan's Straits Exchange  Foundation [SEF], is to arrive in Beijing at the invitation of  the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS]  to negotiate routine affairs of the two organizations. Much  common understanding was reached in cross-strait talks over  day-to-day affairs last year, will there be new progress in the  upcoming Beijing meeting on that basis? Will the accords of the  "Wang-Gu talks" be implemented in a comprehensive way in the new  year?  <H3>  China Mainland Pushes the Comprehensive Implementation of  the Accord of the "Wang-Gu Talks" </H3>   As the first contact and talks between high-ranking figures  over the past 40-some years, the "Wang-Gu talks" that took place  in Singapore in April 1993 raised the curtain of a new stage for  the institutional dialogue and negotiation between authorized  nongovernment organizations.    In its wake, ARATS set out a proposal for implementing the  relevant accords of the "Wang-Gu talks" in a comprehensive way,  namely, negotiations on specific affairs related to  repatriation, crackdown on maritime crimes in joint efforts,  dealing with maritime disputes over fishery, protection of  intelligent property rights, and ties and agreement between  justice courts of the two sides. In addition, negotiations  should be conducted on economic topics and science and  technological exchanges in the spirit of the accord as early as  possible. In mutual cooperation, ARATS and SEF conducted work  negotiations on three occasions in Beijing, Xiamen, and Taipei  in late August, early November and late December last year  respectively.    Through these negotiations, especially the work negotiations  held in Taipei for the first time on 21-22 December,  comparatively great progress was made on many issues by the  joint efforts of the two sides.    --The ARATS negotiation group participating in talks in  Taiwan was a step toward implementing the "Wang-Gu talks"  accords as well as anm advance in ARATS-SEF ties and exchanges.    --These negotiations have further deepened common  understanding in "repatriating people who have entered the other  side in violation of relevant rules and regulations and related  issues" and "negotiating handling of maritime fishery disputes."    --The two sides have exchanged views on such routine topics  as the crackdown on maritime criminal activities, such as  "maritime smuggling and robbery," and "the rights and privileges  of Taiwan businessmen investing on the mainland"; --The two  sides reached important common understanding on "the principle  of repatriation of hijackers," within the basic framework of the  accord on repatriating hijackers between the two shores, by  careful study of the wording of the overwhelming majority of  this accord gone through.    People here believe that should an accord on the  repatriation  of hijackers be reached between the two sides, its significance  will go beyond insuring safety in air traffic between the two  sides, and it will play an important role in augmenting and  promoting ties and exchanges between the two shores in every  respect; this being so, it will certainly be welcomed by and  assessed highly by Chinese both at home and overseas.  <H5>  Where Lie the Hurdles That Affect ARATS-SEF Cooperation? </H5>   Although a series of results at a certain stage have been  scored in cross-strait people-to-people talks, no accord was  eventually signed. The fundamental cause lies in the fact that  Taiwan has included some political issues that were quite beyond  the two sides' common understanding for the time being in the  negotiations on routine affairs in an attempt to create the  so-called "independent sovereignty" and "equal judicial powers"  to fulfill its pursuit of "two equal political bodies." That  did not fall in line with the orientation of being  non-governmental, economic, routine, and functional, set by the  "Wang-Gu talks" accords. Both ARATS and SEF are  non-governmental organizations, and differences in political  issues between the two shores should not have been brought up in  negotiations on people-to-people affairs.    In ARATS-SEF negotiations on routine affairs in 1992, the  two  sides established a common understanding by each making an oral  statement that "the two sides of the strait adhere to the one  China principle," thus making major progress in ARATS-SEF  negotiations possible thereafter. With the accords on  cross-strait utilization and verification of notaries and on  "inquiries about and compensation for registered letters,"  especially, the realization of the "Wang-Gu talks" was itself a  breakthrough; all this showed that two authorized  non-governmental organizations from the two shores might settle  some routine issues surfacing in cross-strait people- to-people  ties and exchanges and push forward various cross-strait ties  and exchanges under the condition that political differences  between the two shores remain unsettled, so long as some issues  lacking unanimity are avoided while adopting a practical  attitude and practice.    Now the Taiwan authorities insist on so-called "equal  judicial powers" in routine negotiations of non-governmental  organizations. Essentially, they are creating "two Chinas" in  disguise; beyond a doubt, that is an impasse.  <H3>  Doing Substantial Work Is the Best Way To Resolve  Cross-Strait Issues </H3>   Thus, to resolve routine issues in cross-strait exchanges,  the practical and constructive way can only be what Tang Shubei  has set out that the two sides "should refrain from involving  sensitive issues that lack common understanding," "avoid issues  pending unanimity between the two sides with technical wordings."    When Chiao Jen-ho first took office as SEF deputy board  director and concurrently secretary-general toward the end of  last year, he said that to adopt practical way, accumulate  common understanding in routine topics, augment the foundation  of mutual trust was a task of top priority for basic solutions  to cross-strait issues.    At the just-concluded third session of the ARATS first  council in Beijing, the work agenda decided on by ARATS for 1994  included: Promoting reciprocal visits of ARATS and SEF  responsible persons and pushing for the second Wang-Gu talks;  continuing to promote cross- strait economic exchanges and  cooperation; doing more substantial work to protect the  legitimate rights and privileges of Taiwan businessmen's  investment on the mainland; striving for negotiations with SEF  over such issues as "the rights and privileges of Taiwan  businessmen's investment on the mainland and related issues,"  "cross-strait reciprocal visits of figures from industrial and  business circles," "development and exchanges in energy and  other resources," and the issue of "cross-strait exchanges in  science and technology," while striving to reach some accords;  at the same time, making preparations in joint efforts for  convoking a conference authorized by both sides on  people-to-people economic exchanges. In addition, on the basis  of the two sides acquiring common understanding in negotiations  on routine affairs, efforts will be exerted to resolve existing  differences and strive to sign an accord with SEF as early as  possible.    An authoritative figure here indicated that one of the  important results of "Wang-Gu talks" was to have common  understandings written down in an accord, namely, "both sides  believe that there is a need to augment economic ties and make  up for each other's shortages with mutual benefits." The  "Wang-Gu talks" were not easily realized; the two sides should  set great store by the results. Only by implementing related  accords in a comprehensive way to score results in the  negotiations on five routine topics, including economic and  scientific and technological exchanges, as early as possible  will it be possible to consolidate and develop the results of  "Wang-Gu talks," thus pushing further development of  cross-strait relations.    People are waiting to see whether or not genuine efforts  will  be exerted in Chiao Jen-ho's upcoming trip to Beijing to  implement the "Wang-Gu talks" accord in a comprehensive way in  the new year.</p>

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / UK Company News: Drug launch delay hits Haemocell Haemocell, the USM-quoted maker of medical and surgical equipment, attributed its increased first-half loss of Pounds 783,000 to the costs of preparing for the launch of a new drug, S350, in the US. Absence of US regulatory approval had delayed the launch by at least three months. The outcome for the second half would be influenced by the timing of approval. Turnover in the six months to February 29 rose 63 per cent to Pounds 305,000. In the comparable period a loss of Pounds 608,000 was reported on sales of Pounds 187,000. This time administration and other expenses took Pounds 866,000 (Pounds 694,000) and interest payable was Pounds 21,000 against Pounds 3,000 receivable.</p>

			<p><P> October 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OLDIE GIANTS ARE GOODIES IN WASHINGTON;  </P> <P> NFC: EXPERIENCE MAKES A DIFFERENCE IN NEW YORK'S 24-20 VICTORY.  </P> <P> When undefeated New York lined up against the once-beaten Washington Redskins  Sunday to resume one of the league's great rivalries, many considered the  Giants the NFL's best team east of San Francisco.  </P> <P> The Redskins, by contrast, seemed to be in tough shape. An injury had cost them  quarterback Mark Rypien, and their new passer was a second-year pro who, they  feared, would blow hot and cold.  </P> <P> He blew both. The more mature New York quarterback, Phil Simms, directed a  cleverly designed pass offense that at times rivaled San Francisco's as the  Giants outplayed Washington, 24-20, in a game that came down to the usual  rousing Giant-Redskin finish.  </P> <P> Washington's erratic young quarterback, Stan Humphries, gave the Redskins a  chance to win during a fourth-quarter drive but threw his third and most  crippling interception with two minutes left.  </P> <P> That interception, by New York safety Greg Jackson, came on second down at the  Giant 42. There was time enough to throw the ball away and try twice more in  favorable field position -- but Humphries still has to learn that.  </P> <P> Only two years ago he was playing for Division I-AA Northeast Louisiana.  Sunday, he was making only his second NFL start.  </P> <P> He was no match for Simms. On the day's three decisive plays, Simms, a 12-year  NFL veteran who completed 22 of 25 passes in a Super Bowl game, threw three big  passes for gains of 80, 61 and 63 yards to win his fifth consecutive game from  the hard-luck Redskins.  </P> <P> "Our three big plays and their three (interceptions) were the difference," Bill  Parcells, the coach of the Giants, said. "It was a typical Giant-Redskin game  -- very exciting even for the coaches and players."  </P> <P> Said Redskin Coach Joe Gibbs: "They gave (Humphries) a lot of different looks.  I don't think you could ask any more of a young quarterback."  </P> <P> The game was played in what felt like July weather before an overheated,  screaming, capacity crowd of 54,737 in one of the league's loudest stadiums.  And the Redskins may have lost it in the first 20 minutes when they dominated  linebacker Lawrence Taylor and the others in the Giant defense, driving up and  down the field but scoring only three points.  </P> <P> That gave Simms his first shot: an 18-yard pass that wide receiver Stephen  Baker carried another 62 yards to the touchdown that put the Giants in the lead  for good, 7-3.  </P> <P> Thereafter, on two other 80-yard drives, Simms was to set up the two touchdowns  on passes down the middle for 61 yards to tight end Mark Bavaro and for 63  yards to fullback Maurice Carthon.  </P> <P> Parcells had concluded over the winter that the Redskins would be vulnerable to  such plays in their double-double defense -- one in which they separated their  two safeties to join cornerbacks and get two men on each Giant wide receiver.  </P> <P> This left a broad avenue in the middle for Bavaro and Carthon. Each time, Simms  hit them in stride.  </P> <P> Simms' other Giant-killing pass, the one to Baker, was simpler to throw and, in  the end, more productive. A 5-foot-8, 160-pound sprinter from Fresno State, the  littlest Giant was running a crossing pattern from far left to far right when  Simms hit him. The ball got there an instant after New York's other crossing  receiver, Mark Ingram, had picked off the Redskin cornerback running with  Baker.  </P> <P> It was an illegal but effective pick of the kind introduced to 1980s football  by the 49ers -- whom the Giants resembled as Simms passed for 283 yards,  averaging almost 13 yards per throw. He completed 13 of 22 attempts.  </P> <P> Humphries kept the Redskins close. He could not wrest the lead from Simms, but  Humphries moved Washington repeatedly with what was often surprisingly good  football for a virtual rookie.  </P> <P> At 6 feet 2 and 223 pounds, Humphries is an instinctive runner who gained 41  yards on six scrambles. Moreover, he has the big arm expected of NFL  quarterbacks.  </P> <P> "It's always expected," Simms said. "But a strong arm is overrated. (Humphries)  will be a better passer when he has been up here awhile and throws with more  (touch)."  </P> <P> Five times Humphries marched the Redskins into scoring position. But they  dribbled away the first three chances when he couldn't throw with quick  accuracy when the Giant defense, pressed against its goal line, had less ground  to cover than it had at at midfield.  </P> <P> On Humphries' fourth chance, Gibbs saved him with a trick play, calling for a  halfback pass by Earnest Byner to wide receiver Ricky Sanders for a 31-yard  touchdown.  </P> <P> On his fifth chance, Humphries finally completed a close-in pass, throwing 10  yards on third and eight to Clark, setting the Redskins up at the Giant  two-yard line for the touchdown that made it 21-20 with six minutes left.  </P> <P> They were to get no closer. In the last six minutes, the Redskins beat  themselves with three mistakes -- kicking off out of bounds to award Simms  possession at his 35, inadvertently touching a New York punt to give the Giants  the ball back at the Redskins' one-yard line and throwing a final interception.  </P></p>

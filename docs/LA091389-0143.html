			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> MGM/UA TELLS $1.20-BILLION BUYOUT OFFER FROM UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY  </P> <P> MGM/UA Communications Co. said today that it has received a new buyout offer,  worth an estimated $1.20 billion, from an unidentified New York Stock  Exchange-listed company, topping an earlier $1.05-billion deal with Australia's  Qintex Ltd.  </P> <P> The successor to the United Artists and Metro Goldwyn Mayer Hollywood studios,  MGM/UA struck gold with its Oscar-winning "Rainman" last year but has had a  spotty financial record in recent years.  </P> <P> Under the new offer, all common stock owned by principal shareholder Kirk  Kerkorian's Tracinda Corp. would be acquired for $23.16 each, subject to  adjustment.  </P> <P> Later, remaining shares would be acquired for the same price plus interest, at  a total of about $1.20 billion.  </P> <P> Speculation centered on a handful of Big Board companies as possible  purchasers, including Paramount Communications Inc., Walt Disney Co., News  Corp. Ltd. and Sony Corp.  </P> <P> Topping the list was Paramount, which failed in its bid to break up the  Time-Warner merger and acquire Time Inc. in a $12.2-billion buyout offer. The  maneuver was widely viewed as a takeover protection, and since then Paramount  has been rumored to be looking for another acquisition.  </P></p>

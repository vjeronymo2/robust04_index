			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Lagos hit by protest over poll backdown TRAFFIC in Lagos, Nigeria's biggest city, was disrupted yesterday at the start of a planned week-long protest called by civil rights activists, after the military government's cancellation of the presidential election last month. A pall of smoke from burning tyres hung over some areas, but there were no reports of violence in the city. The government later warned it would take measures to enforce the rule of law. It said its opponents, who included 'foreign forces', should not mistake patience for weakness. The protest was the most serious in Lagos since the annulment of elections which Mr Moshood Abiola, a millionaire Moslem businessman, claimed to have won, and the biggest in the city since riots in May 1992 over shortages of fuel. Civil disobedience in south-western Nigeria, organised by the Campaign for Democracy (CD), is aimed at persuading Mr Abiola's Social Democratic party (SDP) to reject President Ibrahim Babangida's plan to hold fresh elections before a handover to civilian rule on August 27. The non-party CD is the only group to take an uncompromising stance against the government's latest agenda for transition to democracy. The group - comprised of civil rights activists, students and academics - has called for student groups to be formed to force the military government out of office. Tens of thousands of people marched through the business centre of Lagos Island and the densely populated mainland to a rally at the SDP's campaign headquarters. Many protesters appeared to be 'area boys', youths hard hit by unemployment brought on by Nigeria's battered economy. A Reuter correspondent said protesters starting from Mr Abiola's home at Ikeja in mainland Lagos had virtually taken over the suburb where the domestic and international airports are. 'It's like a carnival,' he said. Many of the protesters chanted or waved placards saying 'Go now IBB' (the president's initials) or carried posters of Mr Abiola, declaring him the election winner. Markets and businesses stayed closed and public transport was scarce. The main trunk road through the city was blocked by barricades and burning tyres. Last night, there were reports of similar protests elsewhere in southern Nigeria. Tight security was reported at Kano and Kaduna in the mostly Moslem north, home region of Mr Bashir Tofa of the National Republican Convention (NRC), the other presidential candidate in the June polls. The SDP and the NRC have been holding meetings for the past week and were due to meet President Babangida in the capital Abuja last night.</p>

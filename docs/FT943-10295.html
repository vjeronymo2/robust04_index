			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool New Zealand wool prices were higher again at a sale on August 4, with China active but Western Europe and Japan also buying strongly. It is not always clear whether at such an early stage in the selling season there is pressure to cover urgent outstanding requirements helping to raise prices which may not later be maintained, or whether the wool market is set on an even more definite upward trend than many already believe. Australian wool prices made no all-round further advances at this weeks auctions but the market there did close firmly after signs of limited softness on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Eastern States indicator closed at 680 cents, only one cent lower than a week before.</p>

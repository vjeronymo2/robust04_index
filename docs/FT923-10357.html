			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Agreement near on Nafta dispute mechanisms US, Canadian and Mexican negotiators working on a North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) are near an agreement on setting up dispute-settlement procedures, governed by a Commission and permanent secretariat, and empowered to authorise sanctions within 30 days of a finding, Nancy Dunne reports from Washington. Under a partial Nafta text draft obtained by the Financial Times, disputes between the countries may be brought to Gatt or a forum under the US-Canada Free Trade Agreement. Once the complaint process begins under one forum, it cannot switch to others. The forum worries US citizen and environmental groups; they fear US food and safety standards can be deemed trade barriers if taken to Gatt. Despite pledges that US standards, federal and state, will be safe from attack on trade grounds in Nafta, they are unconvinced. The Commission is given authority to implement Nafta, set up committees, working and expert groups, and supervise committees. It has strict deadlines by which to operate, most stringent concerning perishable commodities. The Commission's main members will be the three governments' trade ministers, meeting at least once a year to review the commission's work. The three governments will choose 30 panellists, serving three-year terms, to rule on disputes, and expert in law, international trade, and dispute resolution, chosen for objectivity, reliability and sound judgment. Complaints can go to a five-member arbitration panel, which may seek information and technical advice, but with no requirement to do so. This will annoy environmentalists wanting a stronger voice in such matters and more open proceedings than allowed for in Gatt. 'The unacceptable secrecy and lack of a role for non-governmental groups is maintained, but the text places some initial burden of proof on the challenging party,' said Ms Lori Wallach, trade programme director at Public Citizen. 'This could have been an improvement over Gatt. Unfortunately, it is meaningless; any party may take any dispute to Gatt instead of using Nafta dispute resolution.'</p>

			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Two acquisitions and change of name for BTG Business Technology Group, the photocopier and facsimile sales and service company, announced yesterday that it was to make two acquisitions and change its name to Berkeley Business Group. At the same time it reported a reduced pre-tax loss of Pounds 96,000 on turnover of Pounds 5.98m for the half year to June 30 against restated losses of Pounds 233,000 on turnover of Pounds 8.76m. In its first significant expansion since the installation of a new management team last October, the group is acquiring Captain Cargo, a parcel and freight delivery service, and Photostatic (EMG), a photocopier servicing company. The consideration for Captain Cargo is Pounds 8.3m, to be satisfied by Pounds 5m in cash with the balance settled by the issue of 34.7m new ordinary shares. Photostatic is to be acquired for Pounds 1.53m - Pounds 1.13m of which will be paid in cash, with the balance made up of 4.71m new ordinary shares. To fund the cash element of the acquisitions and provide fresh working capital, BTG is to raise about Pounds 10m via a placing of 143m new ordinary shares at 7p apiece. Of these, some 72m have been placed firm and 71m have been conditionally placed subject to clawback on a 9-for-10 basis. The placing has been underwritten by Guinness Mahon. In the year to end-December 1993 Captain Cargo made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.3m on turnover of Pounds 15.1m, while Photostatic reported profits of Pounds 51,000 pre-tax on turnover of Pounds 2.08m. For the first half, BTG's operating profits were Pounds 42,000 compared with losses of Pounds 92,000. Losses per share emerged at 0.12p (1.02p). BTG's shares were suspended at 8 1/2p at the company's request pending shareholders' approval of the acquisitions and fund raising. As part of the transaction Mr Malcolm Burge, managing director of Captain Cargo, will join the board of BTG.</p>

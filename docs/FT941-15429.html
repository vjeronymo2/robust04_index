			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Macedonia in IMF deal Macedonia has reached agreement with the International Monetary Fund on repaying Dollars 85m in overdue loans to the World Bank and launching an economic reform programme, writes Karen Hope from Skopje. The arrangement will give the former Yugoslav republic access to an IMF standby facility of about Dollars 35m this year, and up to Dollars 80m in World Bank funding for road, railway and telecommunications modernisation. The Macedonian government estimates that UN sanctions imposed on its main trading partner, Serbia, have cost the Macedonian economy Dollars 2.5bn. The country's gross domestic product is projected to fall by 15 per cent this year, following a 10 per cent drop in 1993. The structural reform programme, launched this week, aims to cut annual inflation from 240 per cent in 1993 to 70 per cent this year and trim the public sector deficit from 13.5 to 6.7 per cent of GDP. The government plans to increase tax revenues, reform the banking system and privatise almost 200 state companies. European Union member countries have so far pledged Dollars 20m with the US contributing another Dollars 5m. The mayor of Tuzla, in Bosnia, yesterday broadcast a desperate appeal on Sarajevo radio, warning of an imminent catastrophe because of food shortages, writes Laura Silber from Belgrade. Mr Selim Beslagic said a 'humanitarian tragedy' was about to take place in the city, the Bosnian government's biggest stronghold, with food left for just five days. His appeal followed a Nato communique on Tuesday which called on Bosnian Serbs forces to allow the opening of the Tuzla airport or risk punitive air strikes. It also coincided with a push by Serb forces on Moslem-held Olovo, south of Tuzla. The fall of Olovo would completely cut off land access to Tuzla and expose it to attack.</p>

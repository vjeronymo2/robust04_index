			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / FT Guide for the Serious Investor (13): Tax-deals for enterprising risk-takers Kenneth Clarke showed himself to be on the side of the angels last November, when his first Budget introduced the Enterprise Investment Scheme - a means of encouraging direct equity investment in small unquoted companies by offering tax incentives, writes Bethan Hutton. The EIS has many similarities with the defunct Business Expansion Scheme, but lacks the loopholes which allowed the BES to be used as a way of obtaining 40 per cent tax relief on investments in bank-guaranteed residential property schemes, or schemes where you could borrow your money back after six months. The tax perks of the EIS are only available for investing in genuinely risky small trading companies. The up-front tax relief has also been reduced, so that fewer people will be tempted to invest for tax reasons alone. It may be some consolation that it will be possible to offset losses against income or capital gains tax, another innovation. Also, in an angel-friendly move, the BES prohibition on investors becoming paid directors of the companies they invest in has been removed. This only applies if the investor has no previous connection with the company. The department of trade and industry (DTI) expects the EIS to be used mainly by companies making small private equity issues. With a fund-raising limit of Pounds 1m per company per year, the glitzy publicity campaigns given to many BES launches will not be cost-effective. However, a few public EIS schemes have already been launched, ranging from a shipping company, to a film, to a chain of pubs. The main elements of the EIS are: To participate, companies must be unquoted trading companies, and may raise up to Pounds 1m a year. No property-related or financial businesses qualify, and companies may not make a binding commitment to buy back investors' shares. Individuals may invest up to Pounds 100,000 in EIS schemes each year, with a minimum investment of Pounds 500 in any one company. Tax relief of 20 per cent tax relief is available on the initial investment. Gains from the investment are tax-free if it is held for at least five years. If the company collapses, or the investment is realised at a loss, total or partial losses can be offset against income tax or CGT. The department of trade and industry has published a free guide to the EIS for investors and businesses. Copies can be obtained from: DTI Small Firms Publications, PO Box 1143, London, W3 8EQ.

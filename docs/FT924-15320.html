			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Survey of Technology in the Office (13): Make way for the virtual office SOME companies are using the opportunity of contracting out services to reduce what is offered, says Mr Keith Lawson, design director of the Business Design Group. Mr Lawson, who helps companies plan and run their office environments, says: 'Companies who contract-out space planning to us are starting to talk about the virtual office and ask whether everyone needs their own desk. 'The answer is 'No.' People who are out of the office a lot don't need to come back to the same workspace as long as they have access to office services. 'They will live out of two briefcases - one containing work and the other containing the things which personalise their desk, such as family photos.' Dr Frank Duffy, chairman of DEGW, an architectural practice which specialises in designing the working environment, says: 'With the proliferation of information technology, the penny has dropped that you can intensify space use. Many of our clients including IBM (UK), PA Consulting and Arthur Andersen, have started to apply the concept of time-sharing to office space. 'With imagination, one workspace, costing over Pounds 5,000 a year can be used by three or even five people.' The Responsible Workplace, a multi-client study produced by DEGW and the Building Research Establishment, will be published by Butterworths in February 1993.</p>

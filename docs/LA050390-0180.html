			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAILED EX-HUD OFFICIAL RECOUNTS SEVERANCE DEAL;  </P> <P> HOUSING: DUBOIS GILLIAM TESTIFIES THAT PIERCE OKD THE LUCRATIVE PACKAGE DESPITE  INQUIRY. HE ALSO ALLEGES FUND DIVERSION AFTER PRESSURE FROM BUSH'S STAFF.  </P> <P> A former top official at the Department of Housing and Urban Development  continued Wednesday to rebut former HUD Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr.'s claim  that he was a "hands-off" manager who was unaware of fraud and abuse within the  agency.  </P> <P> DuBois Gilliam, HUD deputy assistant secretary for program policy development  and evaluation during the Ronald Reagan Administration, told a House  subcommittee that Pierce -- although aware Gilliam was under investigation by  HUD's inspector general -- nevertheless approved an expensive severance package  for him.  </P> <P> Gilliam, who has admitted taking bribes in connection with his work at the  agency, also described how he diverted HUD funds to help a Kansas City Latino  program after being pressured by staff members in then-Vice President George  Bush's office.  </P> <P> Gilliam is serving an 18-month prison term for manipulating HUD grants.  </P> <P> "I told the secretary the investigation was getting hot and I was going to  leave, and that I might need some help," he told members of the House  Government Operations employment and housing subcommittee, which is  investigating HUD. "He said he would help me in any way he could."  </P> <P> Gilliam said he asked Deborah Gore Dean, Pierce's executive assistant, if she  could obtain approval from Pierce to give him control, after he left the  agency, over 400 subsidized rental units designated for renovations under the  Section 8 moderate rehabilitation program.  </P> <P> The designation he sought would have allowed Gilliam to award the units later  to developers of his choice in return for consultant fees. The subcommittee has  described the agreement as a kind of "gift certificate."  </P> <P> "She talked to him and came back and said I could have 250 units," Gilliam  said. "She said the secretary thought that by asking for 400, I was being  greedy."  </P> <P> Gilliam estimated that the resulting consultant fees and tax benefits  eventually would have provided him with $1 million to $2 million. "It would  have given me a good start after leaving government," Gilliam said.  </P> <P> Gilliam said that he thought he needed Pierce's approval because of the large  number of units involved.  </P> <P> "I felt if I'd gone in and asked Deborah for 10 or 15 units, she could have  made that decision on her own," he said. "But because of the large number, I  knew that type of decision had to be made by the secretary."  </P> <P> Gilliam said, however, that he never received the units "because the (HUD  inspector general's) investigation got hot."  </P> <P> After Wednesday's subcommittee hearing, Paul L. Perito, Pierce's attorney,  issued a statement denying "all allegations of wrongdoing and improper conduct"  on the part of his client and attacking Gilliam's credibility as a witness.  </P> <P> "It is inconceivable that this subcommittee has accepted at face value the  unsubstantiated testimony of an admitted cheat and liar who repeatedly violated  the public's trust while at HUD," Perito said.  </P> <P> Pierce is the subject of a criminal investigation by independent counsel Arlin  Adams, a former federal judge, to determine if he illegally favored Republican  consultants in awarding multimillion-dollar contracts during his eight years as  HUD secretary.  </P> <P> Gilliam, testifying under a grant of immunity from further federal prosecution,  was the first former HUD official to contradict Pierce's sworn testimony that  he generally did not involve himself in funding decisions and directed his  subordinates to make awards based on merit.  </P> <P> Two other former high-ranking department officials, Dean and Lance H. Wilson,  have refused to appear before the subcommittee. Pierce, after his initial  appearance before the panel last May, has refused to testify further on advice  of his counsel.  </P> <P> Gilliam, who served in the HUD post from June, 1985, to September, 1987, said  he helped divert funds for the Kansas City Latino project after being told that  unidentified staff members in then-Vice President Bush's office wanted it  financed.  </P> <P> Gilliam said the funds were sought by Hector Barreto, then president of the  U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, to study the feasibility of building a  Latino trade center. He said he initially told Barreto the project was  ineligible for funding under rules governing grants from the secretary's  discretionary fund for special projects.  </P> <P> Then, Gilliam said, "he (Barreto) told me that he'd had a meeting in the vice  president's office." A short while later, he said, Dean called him and  "indicated to me that she'd received a call from the vice president's staff and  they wanted to get the project funded."  </P> <P> Gilliam said Barreto again visited him, and "I assured him we'd work it out."  </P> <P> As a result, he said, he asked a Kansas City assistant city manager to provide  the money from the city's Community Development Block Grant funds, another HUD  program. Gilliam said he arranged to replace that money with funds from the  discretionary fund.  </P> <P> White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked Wednesday whether Bush's office  interceded on Barreto's behalf when Bush was vice president, replied: "I don't  know. I've never heard of Hector Barreto."  </P> <P> Gilliam, whose credibility has been under attack, insisted that he has been  telling the truth.  </P> <P> "I'm here under oath," he said. "I've been granted immunity. I have no reason  to lie."  </P> <P> Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), chairman of the subcommittee, noting that  Gilliam is due for parole and that he will be released from prison shortly,  said there was no incentive for Gilliam to perjure himself before the panel and  "spend several more years in prison."  </P></p>

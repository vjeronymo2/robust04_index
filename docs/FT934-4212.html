			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance and The Family: 'Victims' get a break - Employee loans / The Budget and You Cheap or interest-free loans provided by employers have been taxable as a benefit in kind for staff earning Pounds 8,500 a year or more. But the Inland Revenue now accepts that the rules can operate capriciously and has announced a thorough reform of the legislation, writes David Cohen. Such a loan will be taxable only to the extent that the interest rate is less than the 'official' rate - the taxable amount is the extra interest that would have been due, had the loan been at the official rate. The official rate is set from time to time by the Revenue and is intended to be broadly in line with mortgage rates. But this has swept up two categories of employee who should never have been caught in this particular tax net. The first comprises employees of banks and building societies who borrow from their employer on the same terms as ordinary members of the public. It is not unusual for mortgage rates to be below the official rate; while the official rate is 7.75 per cent at present, some lenders are offering mortgages under 7 per cent. In future, employees of a company which lends money as part of its business and who receive loans on the same terms as outsiders will be exempt from tax, provided that the loans to the public are more than just a token few. The other innocent victims are those who borrow in a foreign currency. Interest rates in currencies other than sterling will usually bear no relation to the official rate. But an employee who borrows yen at 4 per cent now will still be taxed on 3.75 per cent (7.75 - 4.0), even if 4 per cent is the market rate in Japan. Acknowledging the potential injustice, the Revenue will in future be prepared to set a lower official rate for loans in a foreign currency where interest rates in that country are significantly lower than in the UK. But an employee will be entitled to take advantage of a foreign official rate only if he normally lives in that country and has actually lived there in the present year or the previous five years.

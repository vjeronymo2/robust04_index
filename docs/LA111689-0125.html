			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEACHER GROUPS ASSAIL CULVER CITY PAY PROPOSAL  </P> <P> Negotiators for Culver City teachers have reached a new agreement on salary and  benefits with the Culver City Unified School District, but leaders of the two  teachers groups that spearheaded last month's defeat of a tentative contract  say the new proposal is still not good enough.  </P> <P> The new tentative one-year contract, announced Tuesday by the Culver City  Teachers Assn., calls for a 7% pay raise and an 8% increase in school district  contributions to fee-for-service health plan premiums, according to association  President Bess Doerr. The contract rejected in October contained increases of  6% and 7%, respectively.  </P> <P> "I think it's a good agreement," said Doerr. "I think we got everything we're  could get."  </P> <P> But David Mielke, president of the rival Culver City Federation of Teachers,  disagreed.  </P> <P> "I'm encouraged, but I don't think it's the best we can do," he said.  </P> <P> Mielke, whose union was ousted last year as bargaining representative by the  Culver City Teachers Assn., said that because the district made some  concessions with little pressure from the community or teachers, he wants to  see what happens if teachers start speaking up at school board meetings or  walking picket lines.  </P> <P> "My instinct tells me that if you can move them without pressure, you can move  them more with pressure," he said.  </P> <P> Referring to the Los Angeles teachers strike in May and the recently concluded  strike in Beverly Hills, Mielke said: "This is the year where there's a real  heightened awareness of teachers' salaries. . . . This is the year to bring  that pressure to the board."  </P> <P> Howard Bennett, chairman of School Employees Assn. for Lifetime Health  Coverage, had harsher words for the proposed contract.  </P> <P> "It's terrible, it's just bad," said Bennett, an English teacher who for the  last two years has waged a boisterous campaign to win full health coverage for  present and future retired teachers. "I call on every voting member to vote no  on it. Let the (union) go back and do better."  </P> <P> Eliminated from the revised agreement was a provision that capped the amount of  money the district paid for health insurance for retirees between 55 and 65,  Doerr said. Retirees are currently provided full coverage for those 10 years.  </P> <P> Under the old contract, retirees 65 and older have no health coverage at all --  not even Medicare -- unless they were enrolled in the Social Security system in  another job. An apparent consensus has emerged among the various teacher  factions and district officials that the new contract needs to provide some  health coverage for these retirees, although there continues to be disagreement  over how to do so.  </P> <P> The district agrees in the new tentative contract, as it did in the rejected  one, to take advantage of a new state law that, starting next year, will give  teachers the option of buying into Medicare, a benefit from which California  teachers were excluded before 1987. The district would split the cost -- 2.9%  of annual salary -- of entering the system and also provide $1,250 a year for a  Medicare supplement for retirees 65 and older.  </P> <P> Under the new proposed contract, the district will postpone from Jan. 1 to July  1 the date it will allow teachers to enter the Medicare system, according to  Assistant Supt. Ralph R. Villani. The money saved from the postponement will  cover the increased salaries and health benefits. Each raise of one percentage  point in salary costs the district about $100,000, Villani said.  </P> <P> The first tentative contract was defeated on Oct. 10, 111 to 86. Doerr of the  teachers association said several factors contributed to the defeat: high  expectations brought on by the 8% raise striking Los Angeles teachers won  earlier this year; the continuing political battle between the rival Culver  City teacher organizations, and the vocal opposition to the contract from  Bennett and his allies, who are seeking comprehensive lifetime health coverage.  </P> <P> Bennett maintains that the coverage provided by Medicare and a supplement is  insufficient.  </P> <P> Doerr, however, said that although Medicare and a supplemental plan may not be  the perfect lifetime health benefits, "they're four giant steps forward."  </P> <P> She said that although she expects the new proposal to be criticized, several  teachers told her after the last vote that all they wanted was "just a little  more money," and she thinks that it will pass when it is voted on later this  month.  </P> <P> Others did not share Doerr's satisfaction with the district's latest offer.  </P> <P> Dave Ruebsamen, a history teacher at Culver City High School, said that he and  many of his colleagues are waiting for Doerr's group to come through with the  10% raises and lifetime health coverage it promised during its campaign to  decertify the rival federation as bargaining representative.  </P> <P> And pointing to Los Angeles as an example, Ruebsamen said he's not ready to let  the district off the hook when it pleads financial hardship.  </P> <P> "Other districts that have suffered the same financial crunch have made the  adjustments," he said. "This district has not. Never."  </P> <P> Ruebsamen said the morale in the district is the lowest he's seen since he  started 17 years ago. Administrators and teachers "used to talk about keeping a  positive teaching environment. We were a family. Now, I think there's an  attitude of it's us against them."  </P> <P> When asked about morale in the district, Villani said he thinks that morale in  the profession as a whole is low.  </P> <P> Besides, he said: "Whenever there's negotiations going on, a favorite thing for  teachers to say is that their morale is low," he said. "I'd like to see  teachers get paid more. We're not getting paid what we should, but what can the  board do? We have a limited budget."  </P> <P> Doerr said the district's 280 teachers, counselors, nurses and librarians will  most likely vote on the proposed contract the week after Thanksgiving.  </P></p>

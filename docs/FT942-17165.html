			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / International Company News: Unions blamed as Lorenzo fails in airline bid Mr Frank Lorenzo's ATX Corp said it would appeal against a US Transportation Department decision denying it a certificate of fitness to operate an airline, Reuter reports from Washington. Mr Lorenzo blamed trade union influence for the rejection. The department, in its rejection of ATX's bid to start up a short-haul, low-fare East Coast airline, cited Mr Lorenzo's record of safety and regulatory compliance problems. His application was fought by airline unions, who charged him with driving two of his former carriers, Eastern Air Lines and Continental Airlines, into bankruptcy. Mr Steve Kolski, ATX president, said that 'the decision to turn down ATX was made by the department as a political pay-off to organised labour with total disregard for the law, consumers' interests, or the rights of private investors to start their own business'. Mr Randolph Babbitt, Air Line Pilots Association president, said that 'justice has been done, and the public interest has been protected'.</p>

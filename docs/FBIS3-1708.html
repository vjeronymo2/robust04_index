The exact date for holding the talks will be officially  announced when the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  inspections of the DPRK nuclear sites begin on March 1, said  Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Thomas Hubbard at a regular  news briefing.    The IAEA inspectors have received their visas and are  expected in Pyongyang late Tuesday [1 March] afternoon. The  IAEA said that they can complete their inspections at the DPRK's  seven nuclear facilities in about two weeks.    When the inspections begin tomorrow, Hubbard said,  "Announcements also will be made concerning plans for the  U.S.-ROK (Republic of Korea) military exercise Team Spirit '94."    Also on the same day south-north working level talks will  resume in Panmunjom to arrange for south-north dialogue on  exchange of special envoys, he said.    Hubbard stressed that "The undertakings of the United States  regarding Team Spirit '94 and a third round of U.S.-DPRK talks  are based on the premise that the IAEA inspections will be fully  implemented and that the south-north nuclear dialogue will  resume."    Asked whether other two suspected nuclear sites will be  included in these inspections, Hubbard said that "we do not  require that in advance of the third round."    But he said, "Our basic position remains that we are seeking  a full resolution of the nuclear issue."</p>

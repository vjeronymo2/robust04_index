Branding this as an unpardonable crime, a MINJU CHOSON  analyst today says:    The open argument for the "possibility of the use of nuclear  weapons" by the U.S. military contradicts the principle of the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).    The NPT itself is an inequitable treaty favorable only for  the nuclear-weapon states. Moreover, the United States, a  nuclear power, is presenting nuclear threat to non-nuclear  states, frequently violating the NPT, which it signed.    Its nuclear threat still remains and is getting more  undisguised today after the end of the Cold War, not to speak of  the Cold War era.    The United States is intensifying nuclear threat to the  DPRK,  a non-nuclear and peaceful state. Although the United States in  its joint statement with the DPRK in June last year committed  itself not to use force of arms including nuclear weapons or  pose a threat, it has never ceased nuclear blackmail to the DPRK  with nuclear war exercises targeted against it.    The U.S. is increasing its nuclear threat to the DPRK by  manipulating even the International Atomic Energy Agency. It  has reversed the agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S.  contact in New York and is going to stage the Team Spirit 94  joint military maneuvers, a nuclear war game against the DPRK.    The United States is a nuclear war criminal who has already  imposed nuclear disaster on humanity.    The United States must clearly see the demand of the times  and the desire of the world people and act with discretion.</p>

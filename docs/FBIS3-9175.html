Smiljic: "Dubrave -- A Time Bomb"] </F>   [Text] Although Scandinavian and French troops have been at  Dubrave Airport near Tuzla for 10 days now, there is no sign  that the opening of the airport could occur very soon. There  are many reasons for this.    It is no secret that during the construction of any military  airport, ways of destroying it if the luck turns are always  foreseen. In the course of the hysterical campaign for opening  this airport, the Western media and politicians simply forgot  this fact and subsequently found themselves in a tight spot.    The airport near Tuzla is a time bomb and should not be  taken  lightly, recounts Radovan Kecojevic, the former Yugoslav  People's Army's [JNA] top expert for pyrotechnics and the man  who mined Tuzla Airport. So far, 14 explosions have  reverberated on the runways of this airport, while countless  other highly destructive time bombs remain hidden. Unless the  explosives at the airport are painstakingly and expertly  defused, tragedy is unavoidable. This task, providing that the  JNA submits the plan showing where the mines are on the runways,  will take several months.  <H5>  I Did Not Give the Attestation </H5>   Before the war, Radovan Kecojevic worked as a pyrotechnics  expert at Dubrave Airport and was head of the team that mined  the airport's runways. Since he remained in the town after the  JNA withdrew from Tuzla -- which was taken over by the Muslims  -- he was pressured by Alija's army to defuse the bombs at the  airport, or to at least give them "attestation" that the airport  could be used. Kecojevic says that he did not do so for moral  reasons, and because he knew that he could not undertake such a  task without expert and thorough preparation.    There are 42 storage spaces housing explosives under runway  number 1. All these places have been masked and hidden, says  Kecojevic. Even if the UN troops were to find the so-called  "Finnish highly explosive shells" ["finski fugasi"], they would  have trouble defusing them because of the different ways in  which these highly explosive shells are activated.    Kecojevic explained how every army takes care to maintain  variety when mining its military airports in order to surprise  the enemy if he manages to capture the air base. Our collocutor  also stressed that the JNA devoted a lot of attention to this  problem. The airport near Tuzla was mined in several different  ways, and a combination of various detonators was used.    Some of the storage spaces for explosives at Dubrave Airport  have electric detonators, says Kecojevic. It is possible to  blow up these storage spaces from a greater or smaller distance  with the help of thin electric cables, with immense consequences  for the manpower and aircraft at the airport.  <H5>  The Detonators </H5>   However, the highly explosive shells with mechanical  detonators, chemical detonators, and those with a combination of  the two present the greatest danger, claims this top  pyrotechnics expert. Nor, indeed, should we exclude the highly  explosive shells that can be remotely activated with radio waves.    The mechanical detonators of the highly explosive shells  react to vibrations of the ground and shocks on the runway  caused by landing aircraft. For example, if a heavy transport  aircraft were to cause vibrations on the runway, an explosion  would occur. The same thing can occur with detonators made from  glass and plastic ampules, which could go off suddenly during  take-off or landing.    There is a great chance of the runway being blown up. I  witnessed this myself on 24 May 1992, when the Muslims took me  to the airport in order to inspect its condition, says Kecojevic.    Describing what he found at the airport after the JNA left,  this expert says that the main runway had nine large craters, 7  meters deep and with a radius of some five to six meters.  Runway number 1 was unusable, and in November of the same year,  another five chain explosions occurred, causing similar damage.    The situation is somewhat different on the airport's runway  number 2, situated in Cigulje near Zivinice. It is possible  that some of the highly explosive shells on this runway have  been detected and defused. Nevertheless, there were numerous  storage spaces for explosives on this runway, and it is certain  that not all have been removed.    Radovan Kecojevic does not exclude the possibility of  Dubrave  Airport being opened. According to him, this can be done after  some eight to 10 months of work by pyrotechnics experts and  engineering units. Since the Muslims did not have such experts,  and since the UN experts have only just recently arrived at the  site, they face an enormous task. Before this task is tackled,  the French legionnaires have to clear the airport's substantial  surface of infantry antitank mines, which were planted without  any order.</p>

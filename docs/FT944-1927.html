			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Moorgate assets dip Moorgate Investment Trust saw undiluted net asset value per share dip by 5.3 per cent, from 162.1p to 153.5p, during the half year to November 30 - a modest outperformance against its benchmark, the Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index, which fell 6.2 per cent over the same period. Net revenue declined to Pounds 712,000 (Pounds 828,000), reflecting the managers' decision to invest in lower-yielding shares 'with superior earnings and dividend growth prospects', according to Sir Mark Thomson, chairman. Earnings per share consequently emerged at 2.52p, against 2.93p, but the interim dividend is maintained at 1.7p and a modest increase in the final (2.55p) is anticipated.</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Glaxo rejects restructure strategy Glaxo, Europe's largest drugs group, has rejected the paths followed by most pharmaceuticals companies saying its strategy does not require restructuring or rationalisation programmes, mergers, joint ventures or alliances with generic drug producers, or vertical integration. 'Our competitive strengths - financial, scientific and commercial - lead us to focus rather than dissipate our energies,' said Dr Richard Sykes, chief executive. Glaxo warned that growth over the next five years would be slower in the US and Europe than the past five years. The group would concentrate on maximising sales of established products, further penetrating global markets, promoting innovative medicines and investing in developing regions. Dr Franz Humer, chief operating officer, said it was necessary to take a long-term view rather than instituting lay-off programmes. There had to be a flexible approach tailored to individual markets. For example, the German sales force had been cut this year after a 20 per cent collapse in sales there, while in Spain, where sales were growing rapidly, the sales teams had been expanded. Sales in developing markets - Asia Pacific, Latin America, the Middle East and eastern Europe - were Pounds 511m last financial year and could triple in the next five years, said Dr Humer. The opportunities for Zantac, the world's best-selling drug, continued to outweigh the threats, said Dr Sykes. The group would continue to expand the overall market for peptic ulcer treatment, for instance by promoting the drug for the treatment of ulcers caused by anti-arthritic drugs. Imigran, the migraine treatment, had generated sales of Dollars 115m (Pounds 77m) in its first seven months to October, making it the group's most successful launch, 20 per cent ahead of Zofran, the anti-nausea treatment, over the same period. Dr Sykes shrugged off data suggesting Zofran was not as effective as Kytril, SmithKline Beecham's competitor. One resent study showed equal effectiveness, and another showed Zofran was superior, he said. The drug should be launched in Japan in the first half of next year.</p>

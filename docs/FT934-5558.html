			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / NZ finance minister sacked New Zealand Prime Minister Jim Bolger replaced Finance Minister Ruth Richardson yesterday in a cabinet shake-up that could signal an end to radical economic reforms, AP reports from Wellington. This follows an election setback for Mr Bolger's National party, which saw its parliamentary majority slashed from 34 seats to a single seat. Mr Bolger blamed the rebuff on uncompromising free-market policies, the dismantling of a highly regulated labour market, and cuts to New Zealand's generous welfare system. Ms Richardson, regarded as an architect of those policies, was replaced by Mr Bill Birch, a former labor minister. She refused another cabinet job.</p>

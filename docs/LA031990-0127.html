			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JACOB'S WELL REACHES OUT TO THE NEEDY;  </P> <P> MINISTRY: THE PASTOR AND MEMBERS OF A CHURCH CATERING TO STREET PEOPLE AND POOR  FAMILIES DISTANCED THEMSELVES FROM RESPONSIBILITY FOR A MEMBER ACCUSED OF GOING  ON A CRIMINAL RAMPAGE.  </P> <P> As Pastor Robert B. Town stood at the lectern of the Jacob's Well Christian  Centre one recent Sunday, he surveyed a roomful of about 150 church-goers, half  of whom he later described as former drug users, gang members or prison  convicts.  </P> <P> "It's good to have faith in God!" Town told them, his voice booming over a  loudspeaker.  </P> <P> "Y-e-a-h!" replied the congregation, most of them wearing T-shirts, jeans and  hopeful smiles as they looked up from rows of folding chairs.  </P> <P> From a makeshift sanctuary in an industrial warehouse here, Jacob's Well is a  Christian church catering to street people and low-income families. Earlier  this month, it was thrust into the news when police accused a member of going  on a violent rampage, stabbing his mother and her boyfriend, then killing the  3-year-old daughter of another church member.  </P> <P> The accused, Michael Robert Pacewitz, a 21-year-old with a history of drug use  and mental illness, said in an interview after his arrest that he indeed  carried out the attacks. Once regarded by church officials as a model convert,  Pacewitz contended that he had been driven to violence by the devil and that  while carrying out the attacks he was under the influence of methamphetamine.  </P> <P> Now, as Pacewitz awaits a preliminary hearing on murder and attempted murder  charges, Town and others at Jacob's Well want to distance themselves from the  suspect and his statements.  </P> <P> "What he did had nothing to do with this church," Town said. "We tried to help  him, and he was doing very well when he was here. But he relapsed back into  drugs and we're sorry for that."  </P> <P> Russ Spittler, a religion professor at the Fuller Theological Seminary in  Pasadena, says churches such as Jacob's Well play a crucial role in meeting the  spiritual needs of people who otherwise might feel they have no place to  worship. Although street people are welcomed in many more established churches,  Spittler said, "research has shown that people are comfortable in church with  people like themselves."  </P> <P> But Spittler and other experts question the effectiveness of any church in  dealing with members who may have deeply rooted mental disorders that can lead  to drug abuse or other serious criminal problems.  </P> <P> In his interview from jail, Pacewitz said church officials at Jacob's Well had  encouraged him to quit taking medication for his mental illness and instead  rely solely on his faith in God.  </P> <P> Town strongly denied that Pacewitz was told any such thing. The pastor added  that new converts, in fact, are told to consult with a doctor before ceasing  any medication. Town explained that "we tell them that God can heal them" but  stressed that Jacob's Well -- which follows a doctrine of traditional Bible  teaching -- has never held itself out as a drug rehabilitation program.  </P> <P> Town, 36, grew up in the small town of Wickenburg, Ariz., and attended a  charismatic church in his youth. He said he dropped into a "partyhead" mode  during his young adulthood and drank alcohol and used drugs. About 10 years  ago, when Town was running an exterminating business, he was saved and  dedicated his life to preaching, he said.  </P> <P> He spent four years studying under a pastor at his church in Arizona, then  moved his wife and two young children to Orange County, where he opened the  church now known as Jacob's Well.  </P> <P> Since then, the original congregation of about 50 has grown to about 250. The  church began in his home, then moved to a small shopping center, then a year  ago to its current location in the 2000 block of Raymer Avenue.  </P> <P> Although the pastor says many former criminals attend the church, there have  been few problems aside from an occasional theft.  </P> <P> "If they're getting saved, I don't worry too much about them," Town said,  adding that he has five burly ushers ready to intervene should any trouble  occur during services.  </P> <P> In 1987, some of the church's neighbors complained that members of Town's  congregation were too enthusiastic in their proselytizing, blared rock music  and held loud revival meetings late at night. In a newspaper interview then,  Town downplayed the controversy, saying his parishioners only wanted to "tell  about the love of Christ."  </P> <P> At the opening of one recent service, a Christian rock band led a rendition of  "Let's Clap for Jesus," while Town, standing atop a carpeted altar, clapped and  sang along with his congregation.  </P> <P> Then Town presided over a wedding ceremony for two church-goers before  delivering a sermon about good versus evil, ending each sentence with a hearty  "amen!" The congregation cried back "amens" and "hallelujahs."  </P> <P> At the close of services, the band struck up "He's a Savior of My Soul, My  Jesus" as Town called to the altar anyone wishing to be saved that morning.  Slowly, they came forward until a dozen church-goers kneeled in tears at the  altar as Town murmured in a soothing voice: "God loves you this morning."  </P> <P> In recent interviews, several Jacob's Well church members said they were able  to quit drug habits solely by believing in God. Outreach counselor Todd  Maloney, for example, said he kicked an eight-year cocaine and alcohol  addiction after being saved by the church four years ago.  </P> <P> "I tell you what, God did a miracle," said Maloney, 30, who goes to low-income  neighborhoods in North Orange County each weekend to convert transients and  other people. "I had a $2,000-a-week coke habit; I had lost a business, a house  and was being evicted from my apartment."  </P> <P> Andy St. Pierre, 26, a church usher, said he had been a cocaine addict since  age 10 before being converted by the church 2 1/2 years ago.  </P> <P> "I gave my life to Jesus . . . and here I am," said St. Pierre, who supervises  one of two houses the church offers to members who have no other place to live.  Pacewitz had lived with St. Pierre in one house on West Commonwealth Avenue in  Fullerton.  </P> <P> Churches can be effective in fulfilling spiritual voids that contribute to drug  abuse, said Arne Benson, assistant administrator of the Starting Point of  Orange County, a Costa Mesa clinic that offers both inpatient and outpatient  drug treatment.  </P> <P> But Benson and other experts say that -- apart from a person's religious faith  -- medication, psychiatric counseling and even hospitalization are vital to any  successful treatment of mental problems that make it difficult to kick a drug  habit.  </P> <P> Benson said drug abuse usually stems from emotional, psychological and  biological factors, and that while religion may aid the first two categories,  he believes it does nothing to address the last.  </P> <P> "Any treatment that does not address recovery for all three factors is doomed  to failure," Benson said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE EVOLUTION OF PC FAX;  </P> <P> TRANSMISSION TECHNOLOGY IMPROVES BUT BUGS PERSIST  </P> <P> Technology buffs long considered facsimile a stone-age invention, a tawdry  substitute for the real computer communications that would help bring about the  "paperless office."  </P> <P> Somewhere along the way, the paperless office got buried beneath an unexpected  avalanche of faxes. But the very success of fax has spurred the development of  a set of computer-based fax products that may help fulfill the elusive promise  of effortless electronic communications.  </P> <P> The principle behind the basic PC fax board is simple: Install one in a  personal computer or on a computer network, and you can receive a fax and print  it out. Or you can do the reverse, sending off anything in your computer to a  remote fax machine.  </P> <P> Computer-generated fax also boasts better resolution than regular fax. The  notorious "junk-fax" generators, who send advertising to thousands of fax  machines at a time, truly appreciate the PC fax's capacity for sending multiple  copies automatically. PC fax, indeed, can be a boon for all those who, by  choice or chance, do most of their work on a PC.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Early Versions Complicated  </P> <P> "Increasingly, the important information we need to do our jobs will be on a  PC, and if you want to share that with someone, you'd want to do it by pushing  a few buttons," said Richard Gough, manager for communications products at  Intel's personal computer group. "We're very bullish on the fax board  opportunities."  </P> <P> This all sounds nice, though in fact things are not yet so simple. Fax boards  in their early incarnations -- and they've only been around for about three  years -- violated the basic principle that made fax so successful: ease of use.  Some products required a string of cumbersome commands to operate, as opposed  to the crude simplicity of sticking a piece of paper into a machine.  </P> <P> And sending a paper document by PC fax isn't very practical, as it requires an  expensive document scanner. Furthermore, when a fax is received in a PC, it can  only be viewed or printed out. The computer can't actually work with the data  without an expensive software program called an optical character reader.  That's because a fax is a graphics file, a literal representation of the  physical appearance of a page, rather than a data file in which letters and  numbers are stored as computer bits.  </P> <P> The result of these shortcomings? "PC fax is pretty much a drop in the bucket  right now," according to Judy Pirani, a market researcher with the firm BIS CAP  International. Just 40,000 fax boards were installed last year, she said,  compared to 1.125 million fax machines.  </P> <P> But help has arrived and more is on the way. Major electronics companies such  as Intel, Hayes and AT&amp;T have stirred themselves to the potential of PC  fax, and a new set of advanced products is emerging that makes PC fax much  easier to use and vastly extends its functions.  </P> <P> PC users who invest $500 to $1,000 in a fax package can now get easy-to-use  systems that operate automatically, without disturbing other computer  operations, and provide a variety of special features. PC fax, in fact, will  soon have most of the characteristics of that technologist's dream, electronic  mail.  </P> <P> "As a universal electronic mail system, fax already exists," observed Hugh  Mackworth, marketing vice president at Palo Alto-based Gammalink, a pioneer of  personal computer fax. "Every business has access to a fax machine, so everyone  now has an electronic mail address."  </P> <P> Conceptually, Mackworth said, the company now regards fax machines not as  stand-alone devices, but as "remote printers and scanners for computers."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Need Same Board  </P> <P> For PC fax to be a real full-service electronic mail system, though, what's  still needed is a way to transfer documents between two computer faxes in a  format that allows them to be edited (or massaged, as data junkies like to put  it), just like any other computer files. Philip Begosian, chairman of a key fax  standards committee and manager of software development at Milpitas,  Calif.-based Xecom, explained that while some fax boards permit this type of  direct file transfer, such capabilities work only if both parties have the same  brand of board.  </P> <P> That situation, however, is changing. "Every company had recognized the  significance of file transfer, but they realized they were not benefiting from  it and had to get together to decide how to implement it," Begosian explained.  The result was a recent agreement on a U.S. standard for file transfer among PC  faxes, which vendors are expected to incorporate into products beginning this  fall. In contrast to traditional PC-to-PC linkups using modems, which require  the would-be correspondents to fiddle with various settings and hope for the  best, fax file transfers will be as easy and reliable as fax.  </P> <P> An arriving document might even come with a message that flashes across the  receiver's screen, alerting him to the contents. "This is exactly the type of  activity that is going to provide a platform for this market to develop," said  Garry Betty, vice president for sales at Hayes, the large modem company that  recently purchased the technology of market leader JT Fax. "The keys to the  development are going to be software and standards."  </P> <P> File transfer, moreover, is not the only innovation that will make fax more of  a full-function communications tool. Work continues on further additions to the  so-called Group 3 fax standard that will eventually allow higher speeds, error  correction, better resolution and serial ports to connect fax machines with  computers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Major Firms Involved  </P> <P> With these innovations, it's not surprising that PC fax boards are no longer  the exclusive province of obscure Silicon Valley enterprises. Intel, the big  semiconductor company, has gotten into the game with a widely admired fax  board, AT&amp;T now has a fax product, and even IBM sells PC fax devices that  it buys from Gammalink. These firms are expecting broad interest in  computer-based fax in the corporate world, where the devices can be installed  in computer networks or large computer systems and used by many people.  </P> <P> And as the boards proliferate, so will the possible uses. Gough described a new  24-hour-a-day service in which Intel customers seeking technical information  can call a phone number, follow a series of synthetic voice commands, punch in  numbers on the telephone and get an Intel PC to automatically fax the needed  documents.  </P> <P> Dataquest, a market research firm, expects that fax boards will account for 15%  of the total fax market by 1993, against just 3.6% today. So 15% of those  greasy faxes that are now cluttering desktops will sit neatly in computer  files. Not quite a paperless office, perhaps, but it's a start.  </P></p>

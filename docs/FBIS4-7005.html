			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Talk of the Week" feature] </F>   [Text] Dear listeners: In an earlier broadcast, one of  the leaders of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, Mr. Le Quang Dao,  spoke about the aims and significance of the party Central  Committee's resolution on the great national unity and  strengthening of a Unified National Front in current times.    In this Talk of the Week, Mr. Dao speaks about the tasks of  the Vietnam Fatherland Front in implementing that resolution.    Mr. Dao maintains that to make full use of all advantages,  overcome difficulties and challenges, and push down all threats  now as more than before, it is required to implement great  national unity and strengthen a United National Front, raising  unity to an ever-higher level. This will create a strong  motivation for the development of Vietnam's history. It is  required to rid Vietnam of poverty and backwardness and build it  into a powerful country with rich people and an equal and  civilized society. This would implement the last will of the  late President Ho Chi Minh to build a Vietnam of peace,  unification, independence, democracy, and prosperity; and  contribute positively to the cause of peace, independence,  democracy, and progress in the world.    Mr. Le Quang Dao pointed out that to obtain the  above-mentioned objectives, the Vietnam Fatherland Front unites  Vietnamese people of all social classes, ethnic groups,  religions who reside in Vietnam and abroad, and approve of the  common objectives mentioned above. The front takes a great duty  as its common objective and can accept the different viewpoints  which are not running counter to the common interest to mobilize  people in building and defending the nation.    The Vietnam Fatherland front will broaden its activities  from  charity and humanitarian to political, economic, social, and  cultural activities to be suitable to each social circle and  class.    The Front promotes the positive role of front-ranking people  in all social classes and quarters, ethnic groups, religions,  and revolutionary veterans, attracting all talents to state  institutions, social-economic, and mass organizations.    After highlighting the contributions of the Vietnam  Fatherland Front in institutionalizing the great unity of the  Vietnam Communist Party and state as well the Front's  participating in building a state governed by law, a state of  the people, by the people, and for the people, Mr. Le Quang Dao  concluded:    In the new period of time, the Vietnam Fatherland Front is a  political alliance, a voluntary union of mass organizations and  individuals representing all social classes, strata, ethnic  groups, and religions. In the coming years, the Vietnam  Fatherland Front will broaden its organizations and activities  to become a substantial organization of great national unity.  The Front shows aspirations and will of people of all strata,  focuses the people's wisdom, and unifies all members' activities.    The Front joins the administration in implementing democracy  and social renewal; takes care and protects the legitimate  interests of the people; builds, supervises, and defends the  administration. It also participates in management and  implementation of economic, cultural, social, security, and  national defense tasks to become a steady bridge linking the  people with Communist Party and the state.</p>

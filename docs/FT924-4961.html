			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Matsushita staff sent on sales odyssey MATSUSHITA, the world's largest consumer electronics group, has launched an unprecedented drive to boost sales with a plan for staff to visit 10m Japanese households in three months to find out what would encourage consumers to spend more. About 500 Matsushita staff have been sent from Osaka and Tokyo to work with more than 19,000 local retailers from Hokkaido in the north to the island of Okinawa in the far south in making the household visits, usually in the evenings and at the weekends. Matsushita earlier this month reported a 65.6 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to Y67.9bn (Pounds 359m) in the six months to September, largely as a result of a slide in Japanese demand for videocassette recorders, televisions and audio products. The company, which sells internationally under the Panasonic and Technics brand names, launched the campaign at the start of last month and plans to complete most of it by the end of the year. Staff are using computer records of customers kept at local shops to visit regular customers, check whether their Matsushita products are working properly, make repairs free and ask customers what sort of new products they would buy. The results will be analysed at Matsushita headquarters in Osaka in the spring as part of a broad review of group strategy. About 60 per cent of Matsushita's Japanese sales are made through about 19,000 small independent retailers which serve local markets. Matsushita has told the retailers that their ability to compete with department store chains will depend on their ability to build strong links with local customers. The retailers will be expected to make at least five home visits a day for most of next year. Matsushita's main competitors such as Toshiba and Sony are less dependent on small retailers, making about 60 per cent of their sales through large chains. In common with other manufacturers, Matsushita is attempting to discard the orthodoxy of the late 1980s that it needed a huge variety of consumer products. It is concentrating on making fewer, simpler products, with fewer model changes.</p>

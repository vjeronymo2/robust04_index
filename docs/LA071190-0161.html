			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> BETROTHED, ICE STAR TORVILL SAYS  </P> <P> Olympic ice dancer Jayne Torvill said today she's engaged to American sound  engineer Phil Christensen, who is touring with pop star Phil Collins.  </P> <P> The 32-year-old skater said she met 35-year-old Christensen when he worked on  the Torvill and Dean ice show tour of the United States last year.  </P> <P> But she said their romance didn't begin until January when he asked her for a  date -- at a hamburger restaurant. Three months later, he gave her a diamond  engagement ring.  </P> <P> "I'm very, very happy," she told reporters here, where the ice show is on tour.  Torvill said work commitments mean they cannot yet set a wedding date.  </P> <P> Christensen, from Chicago, is on tour until October with Collins; the Torvill  and Dean tour doesn't end until September.  </P> <P> Torvill and skating partner Christopher Dean won a gold medal in the 1984  Olympics and went on to perform their ice dance routines all over the world.  </P> <P> The engagement ended years of speculation over Torvill's relationship with  Dean, who told reporters he was overjoyed at her engagement.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FILE  </P> <P> Theologian Hans Kung, who will be in Southern California next week to take part  in a Christian-Buddhist dialogue and to publicize a new book, will give a  public lecture Thursday night in Claremont as part of another scholarly  meeting.  </P> <P> Kung, an outspoken professor at the University of Tubingen, West Germany, who  has engaged in theological disputes with the Vatican, will talk about a  cross-denominational model for Christianity under the title: "Religion in the  Post-modern Age." The lecture, at 7:30 p.m., will be held in the Mudd  Auditorium of the School of Theology at Claremont.  </P> <P> The event is part of the joint regional meetings of the Society of Biblical  Literature and the American Academy of Religion. The meetings begin Thursday  afternoon and end Saturday. Robert Ellwood, chairman of USC's School of  Religion, will give a plenary address 11 a.m. Friday on his recently published  theory about evolutionary stages of major world religions.  </P> <P> Kung co-authored, with Julia Ching of the University of Toronto, "Christianity  and the Chinese Religions," to be published next week by Doubleday.  </P> <P> He will be among a select number of Christian and Buddhist scholars who will  take part in the fifth and possibly final Christian-Buddhist theological  dialogue from Friday through Monday, March 20, at the new Hsi Lai Buddhist  Temple in Hacienda Heights. In a separate engagement, Kung will give a talk at  7 p.m. next Saturday at Westwood Hills Christian Church in Westwood.  </P> <P> The Christian-Buddhist dialogue will end March 20 with a lecture by Jeffrey  Hopkins, a religion professor at the University of Virginia. His talk, about  Tibetan Buddhism as a religious option, will be at 7:30 p.m. in Claremont  Graduate School's Albrecht Auditorium.  </P> <P> HOLIDAY  </P> <P> At sundown Sunday and in services Monday, the Lenten period will begin for  Eastern Orthodox faithful, who celebrate Easter on April 30 this year. Western  Christianity, which calculates the date for Easter differently, will observe  the holiday on March 26. For Eastern Orthodox Christians, the first Sunday of  Lent, March 19, is an important date because it also commemorates the return of  icons to church worship in AD 843 after they were banned in the previous  century.  </P> <P> ACTION  </P> <P> Inspired by "AIDS Masses" and similar Christian services for those afflicted  with the fatal disease, Reform Jewish leaders have planned a community service  of "remembrance, healing and hope" for 4:30 p.m. Sunday at Leo Baeck Temple in  West Los Angeles. The sermon will be given by Rabbi Alexander Schindler of New  York, president of Reform Judaism's Union of American Hebrew Congregations  since 1973. The service is an outgrowth of a regional AIDS committee designed  to help Reform congregations formulate policies on employees who contract AIDS  and how to lend support to afflicted people.  </P> <P> More than 3,000 members of the Los Angeles Stake, or region, of the Mormon  Church were expected to participate today in a disaster drill that assumes  telephone lines have been knocked out. Bishops of the nine congregations will  be told the circumstances at 9 a.m. and asked to use other communications over  the next two hours. "We will plant messages with certain families saying that  there is a gas leak in their homes, or that a family member needs medical  attention," said Lynn O. Poulson, a Los Angeles Mormon leader. The Mormon  Church, which faced great adversity in its early history, has long preached  preparedness and cooperation in emergencies among its membership.  </P> <P> DATES  </P> <P> Penny Lernoux, a one-time city editor of the Daily Trojan, will lecture on  Catholicism's struggles in Latin America at 6 p.m. Monday at USC's Taper Hall.  Now Latin American affairs writer for the National Catholic Reporter, she has  written her third book, "People of God," to be published this year by  Viking-Penguin.  </P> <P> A four-part film series on Gnosticism, a religious movement of the early  Christian era that was later branded a heresy, will be shown by its British  film maker, Stephen Segaller, next Saturday at the NuArt Theater in West Los  Angeles. Segaller said he will introduce each segment of the  "semi-dramatization" of Gnostic influences through the ages. The program,  lasting from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., will cost $37.50.  </P> <P> PEOPLE  </P> <P> Cardinal Timothy Manning, 79, took the microphone in hand and sang a couple of  Irish melodies for the audience at an early St. Patrick's Day parish party late  last week at Holy Family Catholic Church in South Pasadena. Msgr. Clement J.  Connolly, the pastor at Holy Family and former secretary to Manning when he was  archbishop of Los Angeles, also contributed vocal solos. The cardinal resides  at the parish rectory. JOHN DART  </P></p>

			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / International Company News: Hoechst plans big restructuring Germany's Hoechst chemicals group is to sweep away its antiquated, centralised management and operational structure in the most ambitious shake-out ordered so far by Mr Jurgen Dormann, the new chairman. The changes, effective from January 1, will reduce the number of operating divisions from 15 to seven and transfer responsibility for divisional strategy and profits to their managers, the company said. This will leave the main board free to concentrate on group strategy, supported by a central administration comprising about 200 people. Previously centralised responsibilities for factories and departmental functions are to be passed down to individual divisional managements. 'We need more entrepreneurial initiative, market and customer orientation and greater flexibility,' the group said in a notice to staff. The current structure was 'a fine-meshed net, trapping and considerably delaying decisions, business processes, customer demands and change,' it added. Mr Dormann, who took charge in May, said recession had exposed structural weaknesses in the group which had not yet been repaired. It could not allow itself to fall into such a situation again, he said, recalling that it had been forced to close more than 20 German fine chemicals plants during the recent slump. Mr Dormann warned that decentralisation did not mean operating divisions could allow themselves the luxury of heavy overheads. 'It is the job of divisional chiefs to keep their structures lean or slim them even further,' he said. Under the plan, future operating divisions will comprise chemicals, special chemicals, fibres, plastics and film, engineering plastics, pharmaceuticals and diagnostics. The number of business units, covering distribution, packaging and other functions, will also be cut from 120 to about 30, while subsidiaries, such as Schwarzkopf personal care, Uhde plant construction, Herberts coating and paints and Messer Griesheim industrial gases, will be run as independent companies. The possibility of merging central engineering services into Uhde is currently under investigation. The move will destroy the pyramid structure commonly found in many German groups - with most decisions being made at the apex - and replace it with a flatter hierarchy in the modern Anglo-American style. It follows specific restructuring measures, such as the consolidation of global fibres operations into one division now controlled out of the US. The healthcare business recently announced closer integration of its French subsidiary, Roussel Uclaf, into other pharmaceuticals operations. Mr Jean-Pierre Godard, drugs chief, said the aim was to cut out duplication in research and manufacturing and increase gross operating margins, currently about 10 per cent of sales, to 14 per cent within three years. Including a reduction of 800 in the workforce, the rationalisation measures are expected to save the group DM200m (Dollars 129m) a year, Mr Godard said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 21 (YONHAP) -- A North Korean official  in charge of bodyguards for "dear leader" Kim Chong-il was  arrested in China by authorities there and deported after  fleeing his country, it was reported Thursday.    Five statistics officials from Yanbian Korean autonomous  prefecture in Jilin Province, northeastern China, confirmed the  report. The ethnic Koreans are visiting Seoul to receive  training.    According to the officials, the unidentified deputy chief  bodyguard of Kim Chong-il, son and heir-apparent of President  Kim Il-song, fled to Guangzhou in southern China via Thailand in  late March.    Chinese authorities, at the request of North Korean  officials, arrested the man while he was in hiding at a  Guangzhou hotel. The man was then handcuffed and sent back to  North Korea through the Chinese border city of Tumen near the  Tumen River, and there is a strong possibility he has been  executed, the officials said.    The ethnic Korean officials, however, said they could not  determine his identity and did not know how the man had come to  visit Thailand.</p>

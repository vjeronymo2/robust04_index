			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Arts: A business partnership - Sponsorship 'Arts sponsorship is more effective than advertising - we have measured it.' Geoff Shingles is chairman of Digital, the computer company, and the most committed corporate sponsor of the arts in the UK. Despite a difficult trading year, which has led to redundancies, Digital has raised its sponsorship budget in 1992 by 10 per cent to Pounds 550,000. 'But on top of that', says Shingles, 'you must spend Pounds 1.50 on promotion and entertainment to make every Pounds 1 work'. Digital spends the money other companies invest in corporate advertising on arts sponsorship. It started in 1986, when it came to the aid of a beleaguered Sadler's Wells (nothing changes) and chose dance as an under-exploited arts form with which it could make a big impact. The focus on dance continues, but Digital has diversified into supporting the theatre, especially the Royal National, and the visual arts, with a touring Turner exhibition. Shingles does not regard Digital's support as altruistic. 'Sponsorship is a straightforward business decision. When I'm criticised for paying the wages of dancers while computer staff are losing their jobs I say that by supporting the dancers I'm saving more jobs at Digital.' Quite simply Digital has used dance in particular to meet the key personnel that are influential in buying its systems. It targetted 8,000 of them in 1986 and has now had the opportunity - through sponsorship - to meet over 6000 in agreeable surroundings. 'I reckon it has worked out at around Pounds 1,000 a contact'. Some of those contacts have led to profitable new business. Digital UK's success with the arts has been taken up by Digital companies in Europe. Next month 140 young musicians gather in Luxembourg to rehearse for the summer tour of the European Community Youth Orchestra. This year the ECYO is in over-drive, visiting eleven countries, culminating on New Year's Eve at London's Barbican for a special concert to mark the opening of the Single Market. The ECYO is backed by the European Commission, and member countries, but its main cash lifeline is Digital, which has increased direct backing from Pounds 70,000 in 1987 to Pounds 700,000 for this tour. By the end of 1993 the company will have invested Pounds 2.5m in the orchestra, plus an even larger sum devoted to support services. The aim is the same - entertainment opportunities. Last December, Digital guided the ECYO to Russia, to help it meet the right people as it established offices in Moscow and St Petersburg. 'Music is a common currency. Its image is universal', says Shingles, something which cannot always be said of advertising. Of course there is also a promotional spin off. The company's name has become better known through the sponsorship and it feels that by backing a range of dance, including contemporary, rather than a safer arts form, its image is seen as livelier than that of the competition. In the last ten years Digital has doubled its market share. Shingles is not soft hearted about sponsorship. 'Things run their course. I tell the arts companies 'this is not philanthropy; not charity, but a business proposition'.' So the time will come when Digital explores other avenues. Indeed, it is having a brain-storming session to drum up new ideas this month. But in the UK it is committed to the end of 1994 and it would be surprising if Digital abandoned its reputation as a partner of the arts. British Telecom must be the most cultivated sponsor in the country: cultivated by worthy causes that is. It is a dull arts outfit, to say nothing of sports club, charity, hospital, etc., that does not want to lay its hands on a little of the company's Pounds 3bn annual profit. BT devotes half of one per cent of this, around Pounds 15m, to good causes. The arts has just gained another chunk through a Pounds 1m, over three years, sponsorship of the National Touring Exhibitions, organised by the South Bank Centre on behalf of the Arts Council. The touring exhibitions, which bring great art to small towns, started during the second world war in an effort to raise morale. Currently on the road, in Jarrow, is 'Ready, Steady, Go', paintings of the 1960s. Forthcoming attractions include 'Flora Photographica', a show of flower photographs. The BT money will help to promote over 60 touring exhibitions in the next three years, with the aim of raising awareness - and audiences. It is BT's largest arts sponsorship and sits alongside its much criticised 'New Contemporaries' shows. As well as national penetration, educational projects retain their appeal to sponsors. RTZ Corporation has just announced one of the largest schemes, embracing five institutions - Guildhall School of Music, Royal College of Art, the Royal Academy of Arts, Lilian Baylis Youth Dance Company, and the Centre for Young Musicians - and extending over three years. Each group will receive Pounds 60,000. The money will be mainly devoted to scholarships and masterclasses and, in the case of Lilian Baylis, the creation of a new youth dance company. In addition, the five will pool their talents in October for a week long arts festival at St James's Piccadilly to showcase their work. This will cost a further Pounds 70,000, of which Pounds 40,000 comes from the Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme. BMW is one company planning to increase its sponsorship budget - currently around Pounds 50,000 - next year. Its aim is to cover the country with prestige events that its distributors can use for entertaining clients. The next will be at the King's Theatre Edinburgh in September. BMW is putting up the Pounds 10,000 needed to make viable the Royal National Theatre's week-long visit with The Madness of George III, starring the award winning Nigel Hawthorne. McDonald's is putting up Pounds 45,000 to sponsor Dick Whittington, the Christmas panto at the Nottingham Playhouse. It is believed to be largest ever sponsorship of a pantomime. The Playhouse is also boosted with Pounds 100,000 from Home Brewery to support its next two seasons. This follows on from the Pounds 50,000 that the local Home Brewery gave the Playhouse in 1991.</p>

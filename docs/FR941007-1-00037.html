			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since issuing the 1991 Consumer Advisory, NHTSA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intensified its efforts to work closely and cooperatively with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interested parties on this issue. For example, NHTSA has worked  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to bring about a better understanding of rear-facing infant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restraint/air bag interaction through the auspices of the Society  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Automotive Engineers (SAE) and its technical committees on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> child safety issues. As a result of mutual concerns on the part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of government and industry, the SAE was able to publish consensus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidelines dealing broadly with the interaction of child  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restraint systems (including rear-facing infant restraints) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air bags. The agency worked with State and local governments to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disseminate the information about the latest, mutually arrived  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at, recommendations concerning rear-facing infant restraint/air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bag interaction. NHTSA has also worked with the American Academy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Pediatrics (AAP), a group of doctors who specialize in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> care of children. As a result, the AAP has disseminated the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warnings about air bags and rear-facing infant restraints to its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40,000 members through its newsletter and Family Shopping Guide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for Car Seats.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the agency has reemphasized its commitment to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> educating the public on this issue. In April 1992, the agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reissued its Consumer Information Bulletin, ``Transporting Your  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Children Safely.'' This bulletin provides several pages of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidelines on the use of child restraints in vehicles, including a chart depicting the optimum restraint type for various sizes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and weights for children. For example, the bulletin recommends  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that from birth to 9&hyph;12 months or 20 pounds, a rear-facing infant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restraint be used. The bulletin also states: ``Rear-facing child  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety seats should always go in the rear seat in cars equipped  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with passenger-side air bags.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In October 1992, based on the final results of the testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mentioned above, NHTSA published a final report describing child  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restraint/passenger air bag interactions (Child  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Restraint/Passenger Air Bag Interaction Strategies, DOT HS 808&hyph;004, October 1992). The report concluded that rear-facing infant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restraints should not be placed in the front seat of a vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a passenger air bag.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to the October 1992 final report, NHTSA amended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> several safety standards to require warnings concerning the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interaction of air bags and rear-facing infant restraints. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the September 1993 final rule, as described above, the agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required that specified information, including information about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proper placement of rear-facing infant restraints, be placed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on labels in vehicles equipped with air bags. This warning label  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must be on the sun visor of any vehicle equipped with an air bag  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufactured after September 1, 1994. It also required that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional, more detailed information about air bags be provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the owner's manual. Consumers were again cautioned by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department not to use rear-facing infant restraints in seating positions protected by air bags in an October 28, 1993 news  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> release.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On February 16, 1994, the agency took a further step to try  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to alert parents to the issue of air bag/rear-facing infant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restraint interaction. It published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule amending Standard No. 213,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Child Restraint Systems <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FR 7643). The amended Standard No. 213 requires that the warning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> label for a rear-facing infant restraint include a warning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against using the restraint in any vehicle seating position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipped with an air bag. It also requires that the printed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instructions for a rear-facing infant restraint include safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information about air bags.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Believing that steps in addition to providing consumers with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information were needed, members of the American Automobile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers Association (AAMA) met with NHTSA on January 24,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994. AAMA asked for the meeting to explore the possibility of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installing an air bag cutoff device to allow rear-facing infant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restraints to be placed in air bag-equipped passenger seating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> positions. AAMA representatives discussed the general concept of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an air bag cutoff device, which could be either automatic or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manual. However, the representatives emphasized that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry is not quite ready to install automatic devices because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> automatic cutoff technology is not yet ready for production. At  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the meeting, AAMA asked whether Standard No. 208 would permit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such devices and, if not permitted, whether the agency would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider initiating rulemaking to permit such devices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

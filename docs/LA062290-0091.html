			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRYING TO MOVE AHEAD, LONG WILL BACK UP;  </P> <P> RAMS: QUARTERBACK WILL CADDY FOR EVERETT IN AN ATTEMPT TO RESURRECT HIS  ONCE-PROMISING CAREER.  </P> <P> Chuck Long, once a bright star in his own galaxy, is now destined to be  outshone by a supernova, Jim Everett, as Long embarks on a second career at the  Rams' new halfway house for quarterbacks.  </P> <P> You think it's easy leaving your ego at the door when the hat-check man hails  from Purdue? It's a price you pay for rehabilitation, and Long appears  determined to pull his career back up from the bottom rung.  </P> <P> Before his recent trade from Detroit for a draft choice, Long never imagined  teaming with Everett. They weren't just college contemporaries, but heated Big  Ten rivals -- Long at Iowa, Everett at Purdue. They weren't the best of  friends, either. What they shared was a conference, the gifts of being a  quarterback and a common time in football history.  </P> <P> "Me and Jim Everett on the same team?" Long was thinking a while back. "It'll  never happen. But you never say never in this business. I don't think I'll have  a problem with Jim. I don't think he'll have a problem with me."  </P> <P> In 1986, they shared the same ambitions going into the National Football  League. Though many pegged Everett all along as the better pro prospect, Long's  collegiate career was more storied. Only Bo Jackson separated Long from the  Heisman Trophy in 1985.  </P> <P> Both quarterbacks were first-round draft choices, Everett going first to  Houston and Long to Detroit.  </P> <P> As Long says of his life, "A lot of it is timing."  </P> <P> Everett refused to play for the Oilers and forced a trade to the Rams, who  entrusted him to the tutelage of passing whiz Ernie Zampese. The rest is  history.  </P> <P> Long took his lumps as the lowly Lion starter, showing some promise at first.  Then he watched as the team changed coaches, from Darryl Rogers to Wayne  Fontes; and then offenses, from conventional pro-style to the unconventional  run-and-shoot.  </P> <P> The slow-footed Long was a trot-and-shoot quarterback at best and had a history  of arm problems. Long played in just seven games in 1988 and appeared only once  last season after having had off-season surgery on his throwing elbow. He  completed two passes in five attempts in 1989.  </P> <P> "I was out of football for a year," Long said. "And I was out of football in a  run-and-shoot offense. I was probably at the lowest level in my playing career.  It's funny how I got to that point. Everything turned about 180 degrees for me  in about a year-and-a-half span."  </P> <P> Despite the odds against winning his job back from Rodney Peete this summer,  Long was determined to do so. Then came his one-way ticket out of town, via the  University of Houston.  </P> <P> "I think that all changed when they drafted (quarterback) Andre Ware," Long  said of the Lions' first-round draft choice.  </P> <P> Four years after being touted as Detroit's future, Long was suddenly Detroit's  past. Still, given their stability at quarterback, Long was surprised when the  Rams called.  </P> <P> Perhaps he shouldn't have been. While the San Francisco 49ers had long ago  taken out quarterback insurance with the acquisition of backup Steve Young, the  Rams have waged war precariously with Everett, resigned to prayer that he  remain standing at the end of each season.  </P> <P> The Rams were looking for a scaled-down version, pay scale and otherwise, of  the 49ers' Young and enlisted Long.  </P> <P> Long and his ego had several discussions concerning his new duties.  </P> <P> "It's tough, not an easy thing, because I was once a starter in this league,"  he said. "It was something I had to come to terms with. You have to put the ego  aside in some cases. "  </P> <P> Long came to this realization: He could either have his spine rearranged by  starting for another team such as the Lions, or he could try to put his game  together from scratch with a winner under the guiding hand of Zampese.  </P> <P> "I don't want to get into another situation like Detroit, where I go in, I  start, I get banged around and struggle," Long explained. "Then all of a  sudden, they're booing me by the end of the year and they're looking for other  guys. That's not the type of thing I wanted to get into again."  </P> <P> But can you teach an older quarterback new tricks? Ram Coach John Robinson  thinks so.  </P> <P> "We told Chuck we could put him back in an environment that suits him,"  Robinson said. "He's an accurate and precision passer, not a power passer. Our  offense is perfectly suited for him. I think we'll bring the best out in him."  </P> <P> And what becomes of current Ram backup Mark Herrmann? That depends on whether  Robinson keeps two quarterbacks or three, a decision that hasn't been made.  Robinson thinks of Herrmann as his short reliever, a competent quarterback who  can get the Rams through a game if Everett goes down. If Everett is injured for  an extended period, then Long would be the answer.  </P> <P> Long, in the meantime, hopes to re-establish himself with his peers and show  the league that his arm is sound again after surgery.  </P> <P> "I think that with time, in this system, I can re-establish myself in the NFL,"  Long said. "This is probably the best place for that. . . . The Rams never led  me on in any way. I know exactly what I'm getting into. I never like to accept  a backup role, but in this case I feel I can accept it."  </P> <P> Of course, Long also envisions returning someday to center stage and reliving  his rivalry with Everett. Because both quarterbacks are 27, though, Long knows  his career won't be blossoming in Anaheim.  </P> <P> "I'm not saying I'd want to leave, don't get me wrong," Long said. "If I play  the rest of my career here, I'll be happy with that. But it is in the back of  my mind that, maybe, something will happen down the line. But I'm not going to  count on that."  </P></p>

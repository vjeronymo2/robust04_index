			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY;  </P> <P> JET LANDS SAFELY AFTER ENGINE FAILS  </P> <P> An engine failed as an America West jetliner took off from Orange County's John  Wayne Airport, but the pilot of the Boeing 757 was able to circle back and land  safely. An airline spokesman said the 157 passengers aboard the Phoenix-bound  plane were never endangered and that the landing was uneventful. The pilot  radioed the tower to call out airport fire crews, but the plane was able to  taxi to the gate without incident. Some witnesses reported hearing a bang or  small explosion just after the twin-engine jet climbed off the runway. When the  pilot realized there was a problem, he shut down the Rolls-Royce-manufactured  engine on the plane's right side and banked to return for landing.  </P></p>

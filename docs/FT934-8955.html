			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / International Company News: Exchange watchdog called into Murdoch share row INSTITUTIONAL fund managers yesterday sought to involve the Australian Securities Commission in the heated debate over differential voting rights. Mr Rupert Murdoch sparked the debate with his desire to introduce a new class of 'super shares', with multiple voting rights, at News Corporation, the media, film and publishing group. At present, share structures incorporating differential voting rights do not feature on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). The exchange is already considering whether it should change its listing rules to permit these in the wake of News Corp's proposal. Yesterday, the Australian Investment Managers' Group (AIMG) - which represents most of the large institutional shareholders - said it saw implications for the takeover provisions written into corporate law. It 'would encourage the ASC to explore' these, it said. After a meeting of members, the AIMG formally expressed 'overwhelming support' for the principle of one share, one vote, and 'strong opposition to any proposal that effectively allows a major shareholder to gain and pass control of a corporation without paying a market premium'. There are fears in this case that, because the super shares would lose their multiple voting advantage if they were sold, the Murdoch family interest would enjoy 'creeping control' of News Corp over time. Mr Murdoch currently controls - directly or through Cruden Investments, the family company - almost 33 per cent of News' equity. Mr Peter Griffin, chairman of the AIMG and vice-chairman of Rothschild Australia Asset Management, said the fund managers were concerned that the introduction of differential voting rights would be 'extraordinarily detrimental to the image of the Australian capital markets'. If control of corporations became concentrated in the hands of minority share-holders, Australian companies could also be 'severely constrained in their ability to tap international and domestic capital markets'.</p>

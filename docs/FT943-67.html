			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Finance and Investment (3): Healthy again but more cautious - Banks / In Europe, many are moving into an acquisitive phase The world's banks are in very good health. If that seems an odd view in a year when Japanese banks are still struggling to recover from the 1980s, when bank shares fell sharply after US monetary policy tightened, and two large European banks went through severe financial crises, consider this: In the US, which sets a pattern for banks in industrialised countries, high interest margins and profits from securities trading have rescued banks spectacularly from the trough of 1989-90. Retained earnings have let them build up capital to the point where many bought back shares this year. In the UK, the European economy which has recovered fastest from recession, banks' provisions against bad debts halved in the first six months of the year. Banks' return on equity rose to about 20 per cent, provoking protests from consumers and staff unions that they were making excessive profits. In Hong Kong, the financial centre which has benefited strongly from the boom in trade and capital flows among the emerging Asia-Pacific economies, banks have reaped huge gains. HSBC Holdings gained 63 per cent of its profits from the UK colony although only 29 per cent of its assets are there. The banks' state of health in most large economies is such that many have started to worry about being over-capitalised. In contrast to the crisis in the US at the turn of the decade when banks such as Citicorp were highly leveraged, financial ratios have started to look excessively prudent. It has also led to a renewed spate of consolidation in the US, where banks have competed to buy each other. Banks are being bought at more than twice their book value, compared with share trading levels of between 30 and 40 per cent of book value for the worst affected banks four years ago. Worry over capital is less intense in Europe, where capital ratios are lower. But moves such as Lloyds Bank's Pounds 1.8bn bid for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society, and Swiss Bank Corporation's Dollars 750m purchase of the US asset manager Brinson Partners, show banks moving into an acquisitive phase. The recovery of world banks stems from three factors: Steady falls in short-term interest rates in the US until February established a sharply sloped yield curve which let banks make large and stable securities trading profits. This pattern was followed in Europe until the rise in bond prices which took most banks by surprise in February. The large bad debt provisions made at the turn of the decade and in the early 1980s first against problem country debt, and then against lending in OECD countries have dropped sharply. The release of problem country provisions following debt re-scheduling has contributed to banks' profits. The shock of low profits - and some losses - led to banks re-pricing assets and imposing higher fees and commissions. This has raised operating income and return on assets to well in excess of the late 1980s. Net interest margins for US regional banks stood at 4.8 per cent during 1993. Such factors have helped banks in industrialised countries which were badly affected by real estate problems to recover faster than expected. In Scandinavian countries, where banks were given public support in 1991, banks are preparing for privatisation after half-year results showing a strong recovery. World banking has not been without its crises in 1994. In Spain, there was the near-collapse of Banco Espanol de Credito after over-rapid expansion. In France, Credit Lyonnais also faced a large crisis leading to the imposition of a new management after years of aggressive growth. In addition, the universal banking system of continental Europe has come under increased scrutiny. The Schneider affair has damaged the reputation of Deutsche Bank, the monolith of German banking. It has also raised questions about whether banks are fit holders of equity stakes in companies. The process of bank privatisation in Europe, combined with the growing influence of institutional investors, is likely to lead to a divestment of industrial holdings. The shake-up of Banco Portugues do Atlantico as a result of a hostile bid by Banco Comercial Portugal is one example. The biggest crisis has been in Venezuela, which defied the trend for Latin American banks to attract increasing interest from overseas investors. The government has provided more than Dollars 7bn of aid to some of the best known banks following the failure in January of Banco Latino and runs on other banks. Venezuela is the exception in a generally sunny picture for the world's banks. But there are already signs that the rest of the decade may not prove as clement as the first half for banks. Although operating profits are strong, they are under pressure in a variety of ways in OECD countries. One problem is that the traditional growth in loan demand seen in economic recovery has been late in coming, and weak where it has emerged. Growth has resumed in the US, but banks remain cautious about taking on assets related to property, and balance sheets are not expanding fast. A second difficulty is that windfall profits last year from trading ended abruptly following a rise in US interest rates. This led to sharp falls in operating profits at banks with big trading books. Operating profits before provisions fell by 45 per cent in the first half at Swiss Bank Corporation. Finally, banks face an uncertain regulatory climate. The Basle committee of international banking supervisors is now working on new rules for capital to be applied to securities and currency trading. This could lead to higher charges, even if banks are allowed to use their internal risk models. The IMF/World Bank meeting is an opportunity for banks to remind themselves how much better times are than in the days of the problem country debt crisis and the OECD recession of the late 1980s. For now, they have a lot of capital at their disposal; it remains to be seen how long it will last.</p>

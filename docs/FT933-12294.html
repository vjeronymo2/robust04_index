			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Special Report on Second Cars: Checks and balances - Buying second-hand MOST people who buy a private car new know that its value will drop by Pounds 2,000 to Pounds 3,000 even before they drive it away from the showroom. That is what happens when the first name is entered in the registration document. So, it makes financial sense to buy a 'nearly-new' car instead. Buying a car is also about image, though - particularly, the image of ourselves which we wish to convey to others. In the boom years of the 1980s the desire to project the right image often took precedence over financial common sense but the recession has produced a cannier consumer who is more concerned about value. A recent survey by RAC Motoring Services revealed that more than 60 per cent of those questioned were considering buying a used car next time 'to save money.' But this cannier consumer is having an impact on the used car market already. Prices of desirable, low-mileage models have been rising steadily this year. Andrew Wilkinson, senior editor of the CAP Black Book - used by the car trade as a guide to prices - explains that there is a shortage of cars, caused partly by the dramatic downturn in new vehicle registrations since 1990 and the tendency during the recession for companies to keep their fleet cars longer. He says that ex-fleet cars, even those with high mileages, are 'making very strong money' just now. And the poor condition of some of these vehicles is not deterring buyers from paying relatively high prices. 'Even executive and high-performance cars, which in the recent past have been out of favour and difficult for a dealer to sell at anything but low prices, have now made a comeback,' Wilkinson adds. Only the 'hot hatch' models have not been following the rest of the market - although, even here, prices have stabilised. Buyers are more confident about used cars because it has become clear that modern vehicles last well and tolerate high mileages. Neither is rusty bodywork the problem it was, as manufacturers have taken to using much more galvanised steel and better production techniques. A nearly-new car today will usually come with a manufacturer's transferable rust warranty. While these are complicated and hardly worth the paper on which they are printed, they are an indication that makers are taking the matter seriously. Many cars have transferable manufacturers' warranties, offering genuine protection against major defects. Some Japanese makes are offering warranties for three years or 60,000 miles. Dealers often offer warranties when selling used cars, but some are better than others. If the dealer offers warranties that do not cover electronics and other expensive items, you could probably do better buying one from an insurance company. There are always some risks associated with buying used cars. Astonishingly, there is no totally reliable way of proving who owns a vehicle. You cannot rely on the registration document; it shows only the 'registered keeper,' who might not be the owner. It could be a leased company car. And if you buy a car that turns out to be stolen, in nearly every case you have no right to keep it. HPI Autodata, during test marketing early in 1993, was asked by more than 10,000 people if the cars they were about to buy had a 'record.' Searches showed there was cause for concern in one-third of cases. The vehicle was not what it appeared, had been reported as stolen or at risk from theft, was the subject of an accident write-off, or had outstanding finance. HPI has data on millions of cars, provided by insurance companies and finance houses throughout the UK. Recently, it went national with its information service. Instant data, followed by written confirmation, is available on used cars registered after August 1986 for a Pounds 15 fee by phoning 0722-422 422 between 8 am and 8 pm Monday-Saturday. Another way a buyer can protect himself is to ask for the invoice that the seller received when buying the car. (In this connection, it is also a good idea to keep safely the paperwork you obtain). Other documents might help, such as MOT test certificates and servicing documents. In any case, a would-be buyer should ask for documents giving the full service history of a used car. This helps combat another big risk - that the car might have been 'clocked' (ie, had its odometer turned back). Trading standards officers estimate that this has happened to 20 per cent of used cars; the lower the recorded mileage, the higher the price that can be charged. Villains are also getting better at repairing cars written off by insurance companies, welding two or three bodies together to make one so expertly that only an experienced engineer can spot the deception. The best protection against this fraud is to ask for an inspection by the Automobile Association (0345-500 610) or the Royal Automobile Club (0800-333 660). Charges start at about Pounds 100 but vary considerably depending on the size and complexity of the vehicle. The Consumers' Association offers an action pack on buying a used car. This costs Pounds 4.45 by mail order from PO Box 44, Hertford Z, SG14 1SH, or at the Which? bookshop, 361 Euston Road, London. It is available for Pounds 9 at other bookshops.</p>

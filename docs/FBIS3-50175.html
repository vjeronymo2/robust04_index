			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Relayed by Warsaw TV Polonia Network in Polish] </F>   [Text] [Announcer Krystyna Czubowna] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy  will arrive in Poland on 27 January on a private visit. This  was decided by Polish politicians, claims Janusz Bryczkowski,  who has invited the leader of the Russian nationalists. In his  opinion, ignoring a politician of this standing is proof of a  lack of the self-preservation instinct.    [Correspondent Wojciech Hoflik] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy will  be  accompanied by his closest colleagues, including Aleksandr  Vengerovskiy, deputy president of the Russian [State] Duma,  among others. They will visit Warsaw, Krakow, Auschwitz, and  Grunwald.    [Janusz Bryczkowski, leader of the Self-defense National  Front, identified by caption] It is not a tribute to be paid to  those who were murdered in Auschwitz. This was not our aim.  The motivation was simply human curiosity of a man who would  like to see the Auschwitz [concentration] camp. [video shows  Bryczkowski speaking at a news conference]    [Hoflik] Up until now, no Polish politicians, other than the  ones who support the [Self-Defense National] Front, have  expressed their willingness to meet the leader of the Russian  nationalists, although, according to Bryczkowski, they still  have a chance to do so. It is even more worrying because this  may be the last opportunity to improve the poor relations with  our eastern neighbor, Janusz Bryczkowski believes. This is  called for by Polish raison d'etat.    [Bryczkowski] Unfortunately, after the division of Europe  imposed by Stalin, we were given a part of Europe to which we  have no full territorial rights, and one must openly talk about  this. However, one must also openly say that, despite the fact  that we have no full rights to these territories that we were  given, we will, at the same time, insist that the European  borders not be changed, as Mr. Zhirinovskiy and other great  Russian Federation politicians have declared it.    [Hoflik] Members of the Self-Defense National Front feel  strong bonds with the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia and are  counting on close cooperation with this group. We are not  Fascists, Bryczkowski stresses, unless everyone who struggles  for sovereignty is a Fascist.    [Vladimir Voronkov, press councillor of the embassy of the  Russian Federation, identified by caption, speaking in Polish to  camera] This is Mr. Zhirinovskiy's private visit. He has not  been invited by the Polish Sejm but by political parties. This  is all I can say.    [Hoflik] Do you envisage the possibility of a scandal, like,  for example, in Bulgaria?    [Voronkov] We hope it will not come to that.    [Hoflik] Is the embassy on alert?    [Voronkov] No, not at all.</p>

			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Legal oddities in line for abolition One of the strongest arguments for the government's drive against red tape is the sheer oddity of some of the regulations being abolished. For example, methylated spirits cannot be sold between 10pm on Saturday and 8am on Monday. Meths drinking, the Department of Trade and Industry says, is a thing of the past, so legislation enacted 105 years ago can be repealed. Scottish hairdressers are not allowed to open on Sunday. English haircuts on the Sabbath are apparently legal. Shops need a specific licence for selling kettle de-scaler. It is classed as a poison. The two government establishments which test gun barrels, in London and Birmingham, have to ask permission from ministers if they want to raise their prices. Since they are required to be non-profit making, the DTI evidently thinks Mr Heseltine has better things to do. Women in Scotland are not allowed to work in slaughterhouses. English women are apparently more robust. But some curious regulations which Lord Sainsbury's task force wanted abolished are apparently to stay. Tobacconists must still display a warning about health risks measuring not less than A3 size (it used to be A4). And the law which states that betting offices are not allowed to have fruit machines will probably stay, says the Home Office.</p>

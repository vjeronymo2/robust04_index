			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Ireland forced into sharp base rate rise - Weak sterling undermines the Irish punt THE Irish Central Bank yesterday raised its base rate by 3 percentage points to 13.75 percent, as sterling's weakness continued to undermine the punt on the foreign exchange markets and the Irish government reaffirmed its determination to keep the punt aligned with the German mark. The rise in the central bank's key short term facility was triggered by a dramatic surge in short-term money market rates in Dublin to between 20 and 25 per cent at the end of last week, as speculative pressures drained liquidity from the market. Mr Brendan Lynch, the chief economist at Bloxham stockbrokers in Dublin, said: 'Almost everybody from individuals to companies trading in the UK market have been putting their money into sterling in the expectation of a devaluation (of the punt).' Mr Bertie Ahern, the Irish finance minister, said yesterday, however: 'It is clearly in the overall national interest that we continue with our existing exchange rate policy of maintaining the current parities of the Irish pound within the narrow band of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.' He said low inflation (an annual 2.8 per cent in August), a healthy balance of payments surplus on the current account (around 7 per cent of GNP), public spending under control, and rising manufacturing output and exports precluded the need for a devaluation. Business and opposition political leaders were quick to throw their support behind Mr Ahern's defence of the punt yesterday. Mr Ruari Quinn, the economy spokesman for the opposition Labour party said: 'We are between a rock and hard place. We have a large residual dependency on the UK economy, but if we follow sterling down it would be like swimming towards the Titanic.' About 31 per cent of Ireland's exports are destined for the UK, and some 40 per cent of its imports come from Britain. Exporters, especially those working on tight margins in the food industry, are therefore being squeezed, while their own domestic market faces stiffer competition from UK imports. Yesterday's interest rate rise, now signifies a real interest rate of almost 11 per cent, allowing for a 2.8 per cent inflation rate, adding further pressure on profits. Business leaders were already warning last week that promised pay awards over the next two years under the tripartite programme for social and economic progress, would now have to be renegotiated, a proposal immediately ruled out by Mr Peter Cassells, head of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU). Retail banks and building societies are expected to pass on the interest rate increase in the coming days, which will have a big impact on personal disposable incomes. Eight out of ten householders in Ireland own their own homes. Mr Michael Green, head of the Construction Industry Federation, warned yesterday that the housing market and construction industry could face major cuts if interest rates could not be reduced again soon. Mr Ahern said he was 'confident that these increases will be for a short period only and that a return to lower interest rates will be possible when the markets settle down again'. A key weapon in the government's defence of the punt in the past fortnight has been its remaining exchange controls, which limited the availability of funds to speculators in offshore markets. These controls are due to be dismantled, however, by the end of the year, leaving the punt as exposed as the other currencies have been hitherto in the ERM. Even with the controls in place, it is estimated that central bank reserves, which stood at IPounds 3.03bn at the end of July, have shrunk by more than 50 per cent. The government will also face increased exchequer borrowing costs, as its floating rate notes and gilt issues mature. It is estimated that of the IPounds 4bn in Irish gilts held by non-residents, some IPounds 500m have been sold since the ERM crisis began. The government will be under pressure to keep interest rates high, to underpin its securities and to roll over maturing gilts. The credibility of the government's economic policy is thus facing its severest test since the punt joined the ERM in 1979. There will be no relegation for Ireland to a 'second division' EC according to Irish ministers. The question is whether the markets believe that is now feasible.</p>

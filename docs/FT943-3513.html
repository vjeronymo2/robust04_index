			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Narrow Quebecois win boosts markets Canada's financial markets rose sharply yesterday as investors took heart from the separatist Parti Quebecois' unexpectedly narrow victory in Monday's elections in Quebec. Although the PQ won 77 of the 125 seats in the National Assembly, it gained only 44.7 per cent of the popular vote, against 44.3 per cent for the outgoing Liberals. Bond and currency markets were buoyed by pointers that many Quebeckers voted on Monday for a change in government rather than for independence, and that the PQ may have an uphill battle gaining a majority in a referendum to decide whether the predominantly French-speaking province should remain part of Canada. The Bank of Canada intervened to slow the rise of the Canadian dollar, which closed more than a full US cent up at 74.38. Canada's commercial banks responded to the improved markets by cutting their prime lending rate from 7.25 per cent to 7 per cent. Recent opinion polls show that close to 60 per cent of Quebeckers oppose outright independence. However, the PQ's leader, Mr Jacques Parizeau, reiterated his determination to press ahead with a referendum next year. The PQ has pledged to push a formal declaration through the Quebec legislature expressing a desire to begin sovereignty negotiations with Ottawa. It will also set up a commission to draw up an independence constitution. In English-speaking Canada, Mr Bob Rae, premier of Ontario, called for the referendum to be held as soon as possible. The PQ, which held office from 1976 to 1985, failed to gain a mandate in a referendum 14 years ago to negotiate a loose form of sovereignty for Quebec. Mr Ghislain Dufour, head of the Quebec Patronat employers' organisation, with more than 400 member companies, offered to co-operate with Mr Parizeau but urged him to focus on jobs, social problems, public finance and high taxes. 'We differ with the PQ on many issues and our offer of co-operation excludes independence,' he said. 'Mr Parizeau must end the constitutional uncertainty as soon as possible.' Quebec's business leaders largely kept out of the election campaign, while privately backing the Liberals. They opposed Mr Parizeau's promises to the big unions, such as public service job security, his high-spending policies and commitment to separation. Now they are forming a detailed strategy to swing the expected referendum against independence. 'The PQ has a mandate to govern but not to lead Quebec into independence,' said Mr Michel Vennat, a lawyer-businessman and Counsel for Canadian Unity chairman. David Buchan reports from Paris: The French foreign ministry yesterday reacted to the Parti Quebecois election victory by restating its carefully, if inelegantly, worded policy of 'non-indifference and non-interference' towards relations between Canada and the majority francophone province.

			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / International Company News: MGM-Pathe reaches settlement MGM-PATHE, the embattled Hollywood studio acquired by Mr Giancarlo Parretti's Pathe Communications for Dollars 1.3bn last year, has won a brief respite in its fight for survival. The company has reached an out-of-court settlement with a group of creditors who had filed a suit to force the studio into involuntary Chapter 7 liquidation. The studio has agreed to pay Dollars 15m of claims in full, and the creditors will join in a motion to dismiss the case. A hearing has been scheduled in a federal bankruptcy court for Thursday. The settlement with creditors was crucial to MGM-Pathe's survival. Credit Lyonnais, the French bank, had made a Dollars 145m loan contingent on the suit's dismissal. Credit Lyonnais, an important backer in several of Mr Parretti's acquisitions, has already provided at least Dollars 250m in loans to MGM-Pathe. The promised Dollars 145m loan should be sufficient to allow MGM-Pathe to release several films which have been delayed because of the studio's severe cash-flow problems. MGM-Pathe's future, however, is far from certain. About Dollars 70m of the Dollars 145m loan is already spoken for in undisputed claims which the company said it would pay as soon as the creditor petition is dismissed. And the company, which has sold its valuable film library, is in desperate need of a large hit film. Credit Lyonnais, which has been facing growing criticism at home over its dealings with Mr Parretti, has become more aggressively active in the studio's management. Pressure from the bank is believed to be behind the ousting of Mr Parretti from the helm of Pathe Communications last month. In addition, MGM-Pathe must reduce its obligations to Credit Lyonnais to Dollars 125m by the end of November or the bank will gain voting control of Pathe and will be allowed to sell 51 per cent of MGM-Pathe or Pathe Communications. As part of its plan to repay Credit Lyonnais, a 40 per cent stake in MGM-Pathe has been essentially put on the block.</p>

			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INSPECTION PROCEDURES OKD FOR REMAINING CHILEAN FRUIT  </P> <P> The federal Food and Drug Administration approved inspection procedures late  Friday for all remaining varieties of Chilean fruit in cold storage since two  cyanide-tainted grapes were found March 12 in cargo unloaded in Philadelphia.  </P> <P> The FDA previously cleared the way for inspection of grapes, berries,  nectarines and pears, requiring 5% of each boatload to be scrutinized before  allowing it to move into stores.  </P> <P> The three biggest Southland retailers -- Vons, Ralphs and Lucky -- have said  they planned to await fresh shipments, not due in Los Angeles until Monday. But  Judy Decker, a spokeswoman for Lucky Stores, said Friday that Lucky now expects  to be selling fruit Easter weekend.  </P> <P> The two new freighters, the Americus Rex and Columbian, are carrying about  5,000 tons of fruits, said Richard Eastes, general manager of the importing  firm of David Oppenheimer-California. Inspectors already working overtime are  likely to be swamped by the new arrivals as they work their way through stored  grapes and berries, then nectarines and pears and now the remaining species --  including the season's first Granny Smith apples.  </P> <P> The inspection regime will lighten April 6 with arrival of the Reefer Tiger,  however. With FDA inspectors now checking fruit in Chile, the agency said  domestic inspection can drop to 1% samples on ships that left port after March  17.  </P> <P> "We're not out of it," Eastes said, "but we're working through it."  </P></p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Further stoppages planned at BBC Unions representing BBC technicians and journalists will today draw up plans for further industrial action after a 24-hour walkout over pay and hours disrupted radio and TV programmes yesterday. The technicians' union Bectu and the National Union of Journalists said the response to the strike had been 'magnificent'. News output was badly hit, with the flagship Radio 4 Today programme and Breakfast News scrapped and TV bulletins shortened.</p>

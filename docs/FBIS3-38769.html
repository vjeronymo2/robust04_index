			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Alain Juppe defended a strong  French position in Brussels yesterday. He was supported, in  particular, by Belgium, the Netherlands, and Italy.    According to today's edition of LE FIGARO, three French Navy  warships, including the aircraft carrier Foch, are to leave  Toulon in the next few hours to join three other French warships  already in the Adriatic. The aircraft aboard the Foch -- some  20 Super Etendard -- would complement the Air Force elements  made up of Mirage and Jaguar aircraft already based in Italy.</p>

			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Car chiefs to lobby Clinton on petrol tax MOTOR industry executives and union leaders are to meet Governor Bill Clinton in Arkansas for talks that are sure to raise speculation the president-elect may be preparing to reverse his opposition to higher petrol taxes. Mr Clinton will meet the chief executives of the three leading US car makers, as well as Mr Owen Bieber, president of the United Auto Workers trade union, to discuss economic and motor industry issues, including health care costs and the burden of government regulation. But Mr Alexander Trotman, head of Ford Motor's worldwide car operations, said his company would use the meeting to press its case for higher petrol taxes - a case backed by Mr Harold Poling, Ford chairman, at the economic conference Mr Clinton hosted in Little Rock last month. The idea of increased US petrol taxes, which are low by international standards, has gained support in recent months from a surprising coalition of fiscal conservatives, environmentalists, carmakers and international economists. Mr Paul Tsongas, Mr Clinton's principal rival last year for the Democratic party's presidential nomination, argued for higher petrol taxes as a way to reduce the federal budget deficit, and Mr Ross Perot, the Texas independent candidate, urged an increase of 10 cents a gallon for each of the next five years. But Mr Clinton is reluctant to adopt such a measure, which he says would weigh unduly on the middle class. Although last month he opened the door for balancing higher petrol taxes against other tax breaks for the middle class, he said he regarded an increase of 15 cents a gallon as excessive. Every additional 1 cent would raise about Dollars 1bn (Pounds 660m) a year of extra revenue, although the precise effects on US driving habits and fuel consumption are hard to gauge. The car manufacturers are latecomers to the coalition, but their support for higher petrol taxes is contingent on relief from the current Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency rules, which seek to lower petrol consumption by obliging car companies to achieve an average of 27.5 miles per gallon with their models. The US vehicle market is recovering slowly from recession and analysts expect car and light truck sales to grow 7-8 per cent in 1993, to about 13.7m, writes Martin Dickson from New York. That compares with growth of 15 per cent or more in previous economic recoveries.</p>

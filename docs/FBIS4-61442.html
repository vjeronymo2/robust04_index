			<p>BFN     [Text] The European Union [EU] agrees to provide financial  assistance to build two new reactors in Ukraine, on one  condition, however: that all of the Chernobyl nuclear electric  power station's generating sets are closed down. This was a  statement made at a news conference in Strasbourg, held by five  of the European Parliament's most influential party groupings  that united in a campaign for the Chernobyl nuclear power  station to close down. It was announced that 100 million ECU  [European currency unit] would be allocated by the EURATOM  [European Atomic Energy Community] organization. Some of the  money will be provided from the TACIS [Technical Aid to the  Commonwealth of Independent States] program and by the European  Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Members of the European  Parliament stressed that the G-7 member states would make a  considerable contribution.</p>

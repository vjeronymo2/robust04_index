			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Trade surplus grows as import demand weakens JAPAN'S trade surplus in August rose 31.6 per cent on a year earlier to Dollars 7.5bn (Pounds 3.8bn), as demand for imports continued to weaken and China surpassed Germany as the country's third largest trading partner. The Ministry of Finance said the increase in the surplus was due to an appreciation of the Japanese currency. In yen terms, exports were marginally lower, but imports fell by 7.7 per cent, reflecting the slowing of the domestic economy. In dollar terms, Japan's exports rose by 6.9 per cent to Dollars 26.5bn and imports fell 0.4 per cent to Dollars 19bn. Seasonally-adjusted, exports fell 2.8 per cent from a month earlier to Dollars 28.2bn, while imports were down 5 per cent to Dollars 19.5bn. The most striking increase in exports was in semiconductor equipment, which rose 12.3 per cent in apparent response to improvement in the US computer market and as a result of falling demand in the domestic market. Similarly, steel exports increased 12.9 per cent by volume, though only 2.7 per cent by value, as leading steel makers sought replacement markets for their products. Motorcyle exports rose 17.9 per cent by volume and 20.3 per cent by value. Exports to the US rose by 2.9 per cent to Dollars 7.74bn, while imports fell 7.4 per cent to Dollars 4.2bn, leaving a surplus of Dollars 3.5bn, up from Dollars 2.9bn in the same month last year. Meanwhile, Japan's exports to the EC rose 10.2 per cent to Dollars 4.7bn and imports edged 0.3 per cent higher to Dollars 2.5bn. The largest increases in exports to the EC were in car parts (up 36.7 per cent), integrated circuits (up 18.3 per cent), office machinery (17.7 per cent), and passenger cars (15 per cent). Each of these Japanese industries is reporting slower sales and falling profits in the domestic market. Trade with China continued to expand sharply, with exports from Japan 26.6 per cent higher and imports rising 29.7 per cent. Another sign of increased demand from the fast growing southern Chinese economy was a 30.9 per cent increase in exports to Hong Kong. The consistently large increases in trade with China sees that country on the verge of becoming Japan's second largest trading partner, a position that it is likely to consolidate in coming months. A year ago, China was the fifth largest partner, behind the US, South Korea, Germany and Taiwan.</p>

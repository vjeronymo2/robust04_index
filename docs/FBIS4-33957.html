			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed interview with former Minister of Economy Juan </F> Carlos Hurtado Miller; place and date not given: "Hurtado  Proposes Putting All CPT Privatization Revenues Into  Agriculture;" first paragraph is EL COMERCIO introduction]    [Text] A new "agrarian reform" so the campesinos will no  longer just be producers, but will instead become businessmen,  with full financing to come from the over $2 billion generated  by the privatization of the CPT [Peruvian Telephone Company] was  proposed yesterday by Juan Carlos Hurtado Miller, former  Minister of Agriculture (during the government of Fernando  Belaunde) and former chairman of the Council of Ministers and  Minister of Economy and Finance (during the present government).  A former Popular Action activist, Hurtado Miller (born in Lima  in 1940) graduated from the National Agrarian University in  1962, a year after the present head of state, Alberto Fujimori.  In an interview with EL COMERCIO, he said it is now time for  agriculture to emerge from the prostration in which it has been  sunk for the past 20 years.    [EL COMERCIO] Why should agriculture be the priority sector  to get the $2 billion from privatizing the Peruvian Telephone  Company?    [Hurtado] For economic development reasons. This sector can  give the fastest response with a little investment. We can  improve our food supply and diversify our exports. We would also  be able to stabilize our food growth, improve our price  structure, and create greater territorial integration. On the  social side, it is urgent to attack critical poverty and improve  the occupation of Peru's territory.    [EL COMERCIO] Why has agriculture been the sector least  favored by the state in recent times?    [Hurtado] There are spectacular figures that destroy the  economy. From 1980 to 1984 agricultural subsidies declined  systematically. That trend was reversed in 1985; agricultural  subsidies soared and came to $944 million in 1988. In 1989 these  subsidies were $2.64 billion. And subsidizing a sector in such a  total, massive, and generic manner as was done in agriculture by  the former government does not help that sector. Those subsidies  favor consumers and undermine the real growth of agriculture.    [EL COMERCIO] Are you suggesting there should be no  subsidies  for agriculture?    [Hurtado] The subsidy system has to exist, but it needs to  be  guided, focused, and financed with real resources -- it also  must be temporary. There cannot be an indiscriminate expansion  of subsidies via the Central Reserve Bank. This government (the  Fujimori administration) deactivated the Agrarian Bank because  it thought the Agrarian Bank was causing inflation. That is not  true. What creates inflation is (inorganic) issues by the  Central Bank.    [EL COMERCIO] Do you think the time has come to promote  agro-industry with the resources generated by privatization?    [Hurtado] This is a great opportunity for Peru. People say  we  are going to get $6 billion through privatization. The agrarian  sector represents 30 percent of the country's population. So it  should get 30 percent of the resources from privatization: $2  billion. I propose that all the revenues from privatizing the  CPT be allocated to the agrarian sector. We need to develop two  types of agro-industry: high-tech for export purposes and  intermediate-level technology.    [EL COMERCIO] Then we would not need to rely on external  sources to finance agricultural development? What the now  flourishing Public Treasury can provide for us is more than  sufficient?    [Hurtado] These resources from privatization ($2 billion)  can  generate nearly $1 billion in credit, either from multinational  organizations, from development banks, or bilateral loans from  other countries. In the next three or four years we could get $3  billion. That would create a great boost for the agrarian  sector, which provides 11 percent of our Gross Domestic Product.  <H5>  The Proposal </H5>   [EL COMERCIO] Tell us about your proposal for using the  resources from the CPT's privatization.    [Hurtado] On a national level we need to make up the deficit  in the National Food Reserve by allocating $50 million for  production areas. We need to establish a production and market  information system and a Promotion Fund to create agricultural  and seed production services with private industry to ensure  vertical growth in agriculture.    [EL COMERCIO] What needs to be done to revitalize  agricultural exports?    [Hurtado] We propose to create a fund to promote exportable  crops and export guarantees, starting by targeting specific  zones for production and promoting social development. The  BLADEX [Latin American Export Promotion Bank] and FLAR [Latin  American Reserve Fund] can provide us with $100 million. We are  also proposing agricultural credit insurance to cover natural  disasters.    [EL COMERCIO] But agriculture also needs technological  support....    [Hurtado] Our proposal contains a technical assistance  program, to complement credit, and two programs: one for the  creation of high-tech agroindustry and the second for primary  processing with intermediate-level technology. These proposals  total $520 million, with the resources to come from  privatization. And we are also considering another $350 million  in additional funding that could be financed by international  development banks or by bilateral credits.    [EL COMERCIO] Your proposal, divided by regions (coast,  mountains, and forests), comes to $1.6 billion. For the coast  you propose establishing a loan guarantee fund. What would that  involve?    [Hurtado] Commercial banks do not make agricultural loans,  and they are not going to. They say this is a problem of land  ownership titles. Only 54 percent of our cultivated land area  has ownership titles. The Loan Guarantee Fund could have $50  million in cash so that Peruvian banks will earmark $1 billion  for agrarian credit. I will also mention midterm financing for  advanced irrigation systems for 100,000 hectares at a cost of  $200 million. We also need a saline land recovery program  because 30 percent of the total of $600 million is for the coast.    [EL COMERCIO] What about resources to stimulate agrarian  production in the mountains, which have recently experienced  population declines, and the forests, where coca plantations now  occupy our arable land?    [Hurtado] For the mountains we are proposing another $600  for  three projects: the South American llama and related species  breeding project, the rural development program, and  communications infrastructure. For the forests we suggest two  programs: a coca crop replacement program with a guaranteed  price, so the state will start to buy from the forests to create  incentives by promoting other crops like rice or corn. The other  program is the improvement of our road system. Right now it is  cheaper to import rice from South Vietnam or the Philippines  than to get it from Huallaga. That would be the $2 billion  agrarian development program. So in the future campesinos will  not get used to living on subsidies or gifts, paternalism, or  simply on state aid. Instead, the role of private activity will  be preponderant, it will be the driving force. In summary,  producers will become businessmen with the determined support of  commercial banks and with the state providing resources.</p>

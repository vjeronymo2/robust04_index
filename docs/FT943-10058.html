			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Mexican rebels stage assembly as poll nears Some 6,000 delegates and observers from Mexico's main radical and leftist political groups set off for the Lacandon jungle in the southern state of Chiapas yesterday to participate in a self-styled convention of democracy convened by Zapatista insurgents. The convention was called by Sub-Comandante Marcos, the Zapatista spokesman, after the rebels rejected the government peace proposal for a resolution to the eight-month old Chiapas conflict. The Zapatistas launched their rebellion in the impoverished southern state of Chiapas on New Year's Day. Mr Marcos has said the delegates will discuss the need for a transitional government, a new constitution, and a peaceful movement to democracy. A preliminary round of talks began on Saturday in the city of San Cristobal de las Casas. In highly disorganised sessions, delegates generally read out prepared speeches late into the night, mostly supporting Zapatista demands for an end to rule by Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party and establishment of a transitional democratic government. The convention has been dismissed by many as an exercise in propaganda by Mr Marcos, who commands a force of a few thousand poorly armed peasants based in the Chiapas jungle, which is encircled by the Mexican army. The government has done nothing to prevent the event going ahead, insisting that the meeting and delegates pose no threat to national security. Even some of those present sought to play down its significance. Mr Pedro Moctezuma, an aide to presidential candidate Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the opposition Party of Democratic Revolution, attending as an observer, described the meeting as an exercise in 'verbal therapy' for the left. Nevertheless the convention has put Mr Marcos at the centre of the political stage less than two weeks before the presidential election on August 21. Some are concerned he will use the event to unite radical groups around him to protest against the election results. Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the candidate of the ruling PRI, is well ahead in opinion polls and is strong favourite to win. Many of the delegates said the real objective of the assembly was to press the government into holding fair elections, and to prepare a common response if fraud is detected. But those interviewed disavowed violence, claiming, as Mr Marcos has said in recent interviews, that the convention is intended to prevent Mexico sliding into civil conflict. 'We believe that Mexico is at a turning-point,' said Mr Javier Estrada, a 34-year-old teacher who travelled 70 hours in a bus from the central state of Zacatecas to reach the convention. 'We are here to show that civil society wants a free election and is prepared to act to get it. But we have to avoid armed struggle.' Each delegate supposedly represents a popular organisation made up of a handful to several hundred people, giving them a little more influence than their small numbers suggest. The large majority seem to support the presidential candidacy of Mr Cardenas, who has sent observers to the convention but is keen to maintain his distance from it. The response to the first day of talks was mixed. 'It was absolutely awful,' said one writer present as an observer. 'It was a diatribe of leftist, populist rhetoric.' However, others claimed to be inspired by the experience. A member of a dissident oil union said that 'after 65 years of (one party rule) we are going back to political school'. The convention delegates will be living rough in the Lacandon, where there is no accommodation for them, running water, electricity or sewage facilities. The organisers will not let anyone leave the convention until it ends, probably on Wednesday, and have imposed a news black-out until final declarations are made.</p>

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Management (Markketing and Advertising): Sour taste of sweet debate - The row over food ads directed at children is reminiscent of the tobacco debate During one typical week of children's television programmes on Independent Television in the UK last month there were 388 advertisements, well over half of them for food products. Of these commercials, three-quarters were for breakfast cereals (mostly the sugary kind), confectionery, fast food, soft drinks, ice cream and lollies. In 22 hours of children's TV, there was just one ad for fruit. To the National Food Alliance - a campaigning umbrella group which includes such unlikely bedfellows as the British Dental Association and the National Farmers Union - the figures say it all. On Monday the NFA published the results of a Mori survey which claimed to show that three-quarters of parents think food advertisements do not encourage children to eat healthily. According to the poll, two-thirds of parents want to see tougher restrictions on food ads. All advertisements for fatty and sugary foods should be banished from programmes that large numbers of children are likely to view, says the group in a submission to the Independent Television Commission, the body which regulates commercial TV. The Advertising Association, which represents both advertisers and the advertising industry, furiously described the survey as 'a superficial and cynical attempt to steer the political debate about the Health of the Nation (the government's white paper on strategy for improving health published in July 1992) on to advertising'. Food advertising is not about diet but about individual brands, says the association: 'Brand adverts are not tools of social engineering, even if the NFA would like them to be.' The AA sees advertising as once again being made the scapegoat. Many of the arguments, and certainly the level of emotion, are reminiscent of the debate surrounding tobacco advertising. In turn, the association is launching the results of its own research at a seminar in Cambridge today. Conducted by Leeds University researchers, it concludes: 'Rather than families seeing advertising as distorting the pattern of their children's eating, in fact, advertising is perceived as potentially positive in that it may encourage children to try out new foods.' The latest row was sparked by the government in March when it said that its Nutrition Task Force - one of the bodies set up after the Health of the Nation white paper - would be taking an interest in advertising. The ITC and the Advertising Standards Authority, the body which polices printed advertising, were asked to scrutinise their codes of practice in the light of the white paper dietary targets. These targets include a huge reduction in the consumption of fat. Diet, and in particular fat consumption, is seen as a highly significant factor in the incidence of coronary heart disease and strokes, among the greatest causes of preventable premature death and disability. The advertising industry was asked to look at how it could 'encourage positive use of the advertising message to promote dietary advice consistent with the Health of the Nation'. Meanwhile, the ITC and ASA were to 'identify any desirable changes' to advertising codes, paying particular regard to advertising to children. The ITC already applies some rules in the area: TV ads must not, for example, encourage children to eat frequently throughout the day, or to consume food or drink, especially sweet, sticky foods, near bedtime. Advertisements for confectionery or snack foods must not suggest they are substitutes for a balanced meal, and there are also restrictions on health claims that manufacturers are allowed to make. The ASA applies a similar code. The NFA wants these codes strengthened to the point where ads for sweets and many snack foods would be banned from children's programmes and the 9pm 'watershed' would be applied to ads for fatty or sugary food featuring, for example, cartoon characters or toys. The group points to the tougher restrictions applied in some other countries. For example, Canada, Sweden and the Flanders regional government in Belgium ban advertising to children during children's programmes. France bans use of children in food ads. Ads for sweets in the Netherlands, allowed after 8pm, feature a toothbrush logo to remind children to brush their teeth although, says the NFA, 'the effectiveness of this has been questioned not just from a dental health perspective but from the apparent endorsement such logos give to confectionery products'. The AA replies that 'the effects of advertising are badly misunderstood. Advertising restrictions will not improve the nation's health'. In its response to the government's Nutrition Task Force, it says: 'A strategy for improved health is best addressed by a targeted programme of public eduction, encouraged by public authorities and supported by food manufacturers and retailers.' The AA's research from Leeds University certainly highlights the extent to which public education is still needed if government targets are to be met. One of the most startling findings is that 'nutrition' appears to be about the least important factor when it comes to planning the family menu. The researchers concluded that planning, buying, preparing and cooking food account for 37 per cent of families' concerns, while whether the family would actually eat and enjoy the food accounted for a further 51 per cent. Nutrition and health accounted for 7 per cent and even then the subjects tended to be associated with specialised 'health' foods and vitamin tablets, rather than daily intake. The exact role that advertising has to play in the process of raising public awareness - the AA maintains, self-effacingly, that advertising's role in these matters is always vastly overrated - is likely to remain a matter of controversy.</p>

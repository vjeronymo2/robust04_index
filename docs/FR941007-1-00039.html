			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With regard to automatic cutoff devices, the agency expects that manufacturers would design these devices so that they would automatically ensure that the front passenger air bag is activated during the barrier crash test because a 50th percentile adult male dummy is in the seat. Thus, there would not be two possible test conditions under those circumstances. Therefore, if so designed, automatic cutoff devices would be allowed by Standard No. 208.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to manual cutoff devices, two test conditions are possible. In one, the device is in the ``ON'' position and the air bag is deactivated. In the other, the device is in the ``OFF'' position and the air bag is activated. The position of a cutoff device is not specified in Standard No. 208, so the presumption arises that the Standard must be met regardless of whether the device is in the ``ON'' or ``OFF'' position.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, before reaching such a conclusion, the agency considers the language and purpose of the standard to see if any limits on the test condition are implied. In the past, the agency has found such limits when one or more of the possible conditions could not occur under normal driving conditions. The purpose of Standard No. 208 is for a vehicle to provide automatic protection for vehicle occupants at all times when the vehicle is operating. Therefore, if the cutoff device could be used when the vehicle is being operated, there is no implied limit on the position of the device during the test. Since the injury criteria presumably would not be met when the air bag has been deactivated, the device would result in a noncompliance with Standard No. 208. Therefore, the agency concludes that manual cutoff devices are not currently permitted by Standard No. 208.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The above conclusion about manual cutoff devices applies only to vehicles that comply with the automatic protection requirement by means of air bags. If a vehicle is voluntarily equipped with air bags, as some light trucks are, the installation of a manual cutoff device is permitted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Decision to Allow Manual Cutoff Devices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA believes that a regulatory dilemma now exists because drivers of two-seater vehicles, i.e., vehicles which have no designated rear seating positions, might be forced to ignore the cautions against placing an infant in the front seat. Although some manufacturers may be able to devise an air bag system that would accommodate an infant in a rear-facing infant restraint placed in close proximity to the dashboard of a vehicle equipped with a passenger air bag, concerns voiced by the AAMA indicate that, in general, most vehicle manufacturers are concerned that existing air bag designs do not currently provide the special type of protection needed to avoid injury to infants in rear-facing infant restraints placed on the front seat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the automatic technologies now under consideration appear too immature for immediate application to the problem, the agency is proposing to amend Standard No. 208 to permit a manual cutoff device. NHTSA has concluded that manual cutoff devices should be optional; they should not be mandated. A mandatory installation requirement could penalize manufacturers that have produced, or intend to produce, a passenger air bag that is not harmful to infants in rear-facing infant restraints. The agency believes that a mandatory requirement would needlessly stifle innovations and could impede future advances in air bag technology. In addition, the agency believes that some vehicles with only one row of seats may allow the seat to be moved far enough rearward so that the combination of air bag type and design and vehicle seat position does not pose a threat to a child in a rear-facing infant restraint. Thus, a cutoff device would not be necessary in the vehicle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Details of Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Affected Vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA is proposing to allow manual cutoff devices in passenger cars and light trucks since, as noted above, these vehicles are required to have passenger air bags by the late 1990s. NHTSA has also tentatively concluded that manual cutoff devices should be allowed only in passenger cars and light trucks which do not have forward-facing rear seats. If vehicles are equipped with at least one rear seating position, that position can be used for a rear-facing infant restraint. Even in vehicles without air bags, NHTSA recommends the rear seat as the optimum location for any child restraint. Accordingly, NHTSA does not believe that manual cutoff devices should be allowed in vehicles with a forward-facing rear seat. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [I. Mikhaylov report: "In the Sea of Japan, for All That!: </F> That's Where Our Liquid Radioactive Waste Will End Up, It Would  Seem"]    [Text] Journalists of Vladivostok and also foreign  correspondents accredited in the kray center satisfied  themselves of this once again at a news conference conducted by  Ye. Stomatyuk, chairman of the Natural Resources Committee of  the administration of the kray. It is he, incidentally, who was  head of the kray interdepartmental commission inspecting the  state of radiation safety in the handling of radioactive waste  at the Zvezda Plant, which was in the city of Bolshoy Kamen on  30 March of this year.    Quite a lot has already been written about this problem  (KRASNOYE ZNAMYA of 17 February, "Nuclear Scrapes," and of 31  March, "Large Dollar Sum for Moscow," and a mass of publications  in the local and central papers), and I will emphasize merely  that the above commission reached yet again the conclusion  concerning the impossibility of the storage of liquid  radioactive waste in the current tanks in direct proximity to a  center of population. The situation has deteriorated  particularly at TNT-5, at which leaks were discovered. A real  threat of radioactive contamination hangs over the waters of the  Gulf of Ussuriysk and Bolshoy Kamen Bay, especially since the  development of an emergency situation is expected in April-May  with the arrival of settled warmth.    The commission recommended in May that the liquid  radioactive  waste be dumped in the Sea of Japan at the points determined in  the 1980's. It had not been considered possible doing this  earlier on account of the fact that the liquid radioactive waste  had frozen to a thickness of 60-70 cm. And, second, the urgent  building of repositories and an industrial plant for  decontaminating and reprocessing the liquid radioactive waste.    The first recommendation could be canceled if in the very  near future Moscow either allocates the funds for the designated  construction or permits Japanese firms to embark on the  realization of their own proposals. In this case the tankers  would temporarily be taken to a place presenting no danger to  people's lives.    Journalists had attempted to take part in the work of the  commission, incidentally, but the Pacific Fleet representative  barred them from the liquid radioactive waste storage sites. And  the question at the news conference as to whether the Pacific  Fleet would submit to a decision of the administration on the  dumping of liquid radioactive waste in the Sea of Japan if such  were adopted was not inappropriate in this connection. According  to the constitution, the fleet is required to submit inasmuch as  local authorities are entitled, when it comes to questions of  the environment, to adopt independent decisions. But Russia has  yet to act so rectilinearly in accordance with the law. It is  not known what Moscow will tell the Pacific Fleet.    The work force of the Zvezda Plant and the population of the  city of Bolshoy Kamen will have something to say also, for that  matter. Their opinion cannot be relegated to the last positions,  I believe.</p>

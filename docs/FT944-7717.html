			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / International Company News: McDonald's expands in Europe McDonald's, the US fast-food group, is planning a big expansion of its restaurant chain in central and eastern Europe by the end of the decade, in spite of what it says is a shortage of entrepreneurs in the region able to take on franchises. The company says it will spend up to Dollars 650m in increasing the number of outlets from 60 to 500 by the year 2000. Most of the new restaurants will be in central Europe, with about 20 per cent in the former Soviet republics. Mr Andreas Hacker, managing director of McDonald's Central Europe, said yesterday the company was still relatively unknown in central and eastern Europe. He added it was having difficulty finding franchise partners because 'we are looking for a type of entrepreneur that is basically non-existent in these countries'. He said potential franchisees must be familiar with products, quality control, staff management, and 'how to give a TV interview'. Only 25 per cent of the 60 outlets in the region are owned by franchisees, compared with 80 per cent worldwide. Mr Hacker said the ratio of franchised to company-owned outlets in the region would fall as the brand name became more familiar and more suitable entrepreneurs emerged. McDonald's yesterday announced an agreement, initially worth Dollars 500,000, with ICL, the UK computer company, to supply computer services to link newly-opened outlets to its regional headquarters in Vienna. McDonald's has invested about Dollars 100m in central and eastern Europe to date. It has 23 outlets in Hungary, 12 in the Czech Republic, 18 in Poland and one in Slovenia. It also has three restaurants in Serbia, and another three that have been closed because of the UN embargo on the country will be re-opened when the blockade is lifted, Mr Hacker said.</p>

			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / International Company News: Volvo awaits shareholder's decision on Renault merger The first of Volvo's major shareholders is expected to decide today whether it will back the Swedish group's controversial plans to merge its car and truck operations with state-owned Renault of France. The so-called Fifth Fund state pension group holds only 1.3 per cent of the voting capital in Volvo. However, a decision by its board is seen as a key indicator of whether new information published by Volvo on Monday has swung opinion among sceptical institutional shareholders in favour of the deal. A decision is also expected tomorrow by the Fourth Fund state pension group which, with 7.5 per cent of the voting capital, is the second-largest shareholder in Volvo after Renault, which holds 10 per cent. The pension funds are regarded by Volvo as core shareholders which must be won over if a secure majority is to be gained for the merger at the rescheduled shareholders meeting on December 7. On Monday, Volvo said the French state had undertaken not to use a golden share it plans to hold in the merged Renault-Volvo company to force down Volvo's proposed 35 per cent holding in the new group. Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, has also set a target of privatising Renault by the end of next year. Both issues are central to Swedish concerns about the merger. Renault is also hosting a meeting of major Volvo shareholders in Paris today, in a further bid to win support for the deal. Meanwhile, Volvo said yesterday a motion had been tabled by a single, unnamed shareholder for the December 7 meeting calling for the immediate sacking of Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo chairman, if the merger is voted down. General Electric of the US has pulled out of the bidding for Gota Bank, a state-owned Swedish bank which the government plans to sell off by the end of the year, officials said yesterday. GE was the only foreign bidder for the bank.</p>

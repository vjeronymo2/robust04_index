			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Hydrocarbon propellants are flammable. Precautions should be taken in receiving, unloading, transferring, storing, and filling hydrocarbon aerosol products. The listing of these compounds as acceptable substitutes does not exempt producers or users from other applicable regulatory or industrial standards such as those promulgated by OSHA. However, because of the widespread use of these materials, industry is already familiar with the safety precautions necessary in switching from a CFC filling operation to one using hydrocarbons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) HFC&hyph;134a, HFC&hyph;125 and HFC&hyph;152a. HFC&hyph;134a, HFC&hyph;125 and HFC&hyph;134a are acceptable substitutes for CFC&hyph;11, HCFC&hyph;22, and HCFC&hyph;142b as propellants in the aerosols sector. HFC&hyph;152a has both zero ozone depletion potential and a comparatively low global warming potential. However, HFC&hyph;152a by itself is flammable, and necessary precautions should be taken when using this chemical.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HFC&hyph;134a and HFC&hyph;125 also have no ozone depletion potential, yet these compounds do have atmospheric lifetimes and could contribute to global warming. Despite these concerns, the Agency has listed these substitutes as acceptable in today's rule-making since they meet the needs of specialized applications where other substitutes do not provide acceptable performance. The use of these HFCs by themselves is acceptable, as are blends of these chemicals with other acceptable substitutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Dimethyl ether. Dimethyl ether is an acceptable substitute propellant for CFC&hyph;11, HCFC&hyph;22 and HCFC&hyph;142b in the aerosols sector. The principal environmental concern for the use of DME is its ability to contribute to ground-level ozone formation. However, the Agency's screen of effects from increased use of VOCs in aerosol products suggests that increases in groundlevel ozone formation from use of DME can be controlled through existing VOC regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Compressed gases. Compressed gases are acceptable substitutes for CFC&hyph;11, HCFC&hyph;22 and HCFC&hyph;142b as propellants in the aerosols sector. The Agency believes that although compressed gases such as air, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen are presently only used in about 7&hyph;9 percent of the aerosol products, their use will grow in the future. These gases have low toxicity and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industrial practices for using these substitutes are well established. Since these gases are under significantly greater pressure than CFCs and HCFCs, containers holding these gases must be larger and bulkier, and safety precautions should be undertaken during filling operations. Carbon dioxide and nitrogen are non-flammable and do not require the use of explosion proof gassing equipment. Nitrous oxide, while non-flammable, can create a moderate explosion risk under certain temperature and pressure conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Alternative processes. Alternative processes are acceptable substitutes for CFC&hyph;11, HCFC&hyph;22 and HCFC&hyph;142b as propellants in the aerosols sector. Alternative processes such as finger and trigger pumps, two-compartment aerosol products, mechanical pressure dispenser systems, and nonspray dispensers (e.g., solid stick dispensers) have found increasing use as replacement for conventional aerosol products. The Agency believes that these products do not pose any significant risks, since they rely on mechanical force to replace the propellant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) HCFC&hyph;22, HCFC&hyph;142b. HCFC&hyph;22 and HCFC&hyph;142b are acceptable substitutes for CFC&hyph;11 as aerosol propellants. Users should note, however, that under section 610 of the Clean Air Act, extensive restrictions already govern the use of HCFCs as aerosol propellants as of January 1, 1994. Only one exemption for HCFCs used as aerosol propellants was granted under section 610 (58 FR 69637). Today's listing allows the use HCFC&hyph;22 and HCFC&hyph;142b in the exempted application, but general use restrictions established under section 610 must still be followed. Decisions taken under section 610 are described earlier in this chapter, as are the exemptions under section 610.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The principal problem with HCFC&hyph;22 and HCFC&hyph;142b is that they have significant ODPs and are therefore classified as class II substances. Yet in limited where flammability is a technical impediment to use of other alternatives, HCFC&hyph;22 and HCFC&hyph;142b may be the only alternatives to replace other ozone-depleting propellants. The exemption for HCFC&hyph;141b use as an aerosol solvent under section 610 reflects these user needs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Solvents. (a) Petroleum hydrocarbons. C6&hyph;C20 petroleum hydrocarbons are acceptable substitutes for CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;113, methyl chloroform (MCF) and HCFC&hyph;141b as solvents in the aerosol sector. Petroleum hydrocarbons, both naturally and synthetically derived, have a long history of safe use, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any risks due to increased tropospheric ozone formation or worker exposure can be controlled by existing regulations. Concerns for risks from these compounds in possible uses as pesticide aerosol solvents have already been addressed under FIFRA authorities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) HCFC&hyph;141b. HCFC&hyph;141b, either by itself or blended with other compounds, is an acceptable substitute for CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;113 and MCF as an aerosol solvent. Under section 610 of the Clean Air Act, extensive restrictions already govern the use of HCFC&hyph;141b as an aerosol solvent as of January 1, 1994. Limited exemptions for HCFC&hyph;141b use as an aerosol solvent were granted under section 610 (58 FR 69637). Today's listing allows the use HCFC&hyph;141b in the exempted applications, but general use restrictions established under section 610 must still be followed. Decisions taken under section 610 are described earlier in this chapter, as are the exemptions under section 610.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The principal problem with HCFC&hyph;141b is that it has a comparatively high ODP&hyph;0.11. This is the highest ODP of all HCFCs; in fact, the ODP of HCFC&hyph;141b is about twice as high as HCFC&hyph;22. Yet in certain cases, such as where flammability is a technical impediment to use of other alternatives, HCFC&hyph;141b may be the only alternative to replace other ozone-depleting solvents. Several companies contacted the Agency under both section 610 and 612 indicating that they have tested alternatives, and that in some cases only HCFC141b meets performance or safety criteria. The exemptions for HCFC&hyph;141b use as an aerosol  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solvent under section 610 reflect these user needs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Other chlorinated solvents. Trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, and methylene chloride are acceptable substitutes for CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;113, MCF and HCFC&hyph;141b as solvents in the aerosols sector. These substitutes have the technical capability to meet a large portion of the needs of the aerosols  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry. However, the Agency anticipates that, due to toxicity concerns associated with the use of these alternatives, the market share for these other chlorinated solvents will not increase substantially.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

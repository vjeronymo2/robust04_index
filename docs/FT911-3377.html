			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Public entry to police cases urged SERIOUS allegations against police officers should be heard at tribunals open to the public, Judge Francis Petre, chairman of the police complaints authority, said yesterday. The authority, an independent government-appointed body, oversees investigations into serious complaints against the police. Its annual report published yesterday shows that it is supervising 60 per cent more cases now than in 1987. Judge Petre, introducing the report, said that the proposed tribunals hearing serious cases would include independent representatives and recommend punishments to chief constables. Less serious allegations would still be handed by police forces internally, but with lower standards of proof than at present. The authority believes that the standard of proof in complaints against police officers is unnecessarily high. He also criticised the level of secrecy surrounding the handling of complaints. At present, those making complaints are not informed of disciplinary decisions made by chief constables. Last year the authority received 7,156 new cases for consideration - 16 per cent more than in 1989. The authority's report expresses concern at the length of time taken to complete investigations into complaints.</p>

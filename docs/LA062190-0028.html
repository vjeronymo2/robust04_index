			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 47 CERTIFIED MARKETS DOT REGION;  </P> <P> RETAILING: STATE APPROVAL GUARANTEES QUALITY STANDARDS AND THAT A FARMER -- NOT  A MIDDLEMAN -- IS DOING THE SELLING.  </P> <P> There are 47 certified farmers' markets in Southern California -- stretching  from Santa Maria south to Pacific Beach. Some are farmers' markets in the  strictest sense, where the sole purpose is the direct sale of farm products.  Others have expanded the concept to include educational demonstrations,  entertainment and booths selling prepared foods or nonfood items.  </P> <P> Before a farmer can sell commodities at a certified farmers' market, the county  agricultural commissioner must check that the farmer actually grows what is  sold. This inspection guarantees buyers they are purchasing directly from the  farmer, a family member or employee.  </P> <P> Certification also guarantees the produce meets the same quality and maturity  standards required for supermarkets. It does, however, exempt the produce from  normal standards for size and appearance, as well as packing and labeling  requirements; therefore, some produce in the farmers' markets may vary from  normal size and might be blemished.  </P> <P> Certified farmers' markets are part of a direct marketing program of the  California Department of Food and Agriculture. The program offers technical  assistance to nonprofit organizations, local government agencies and one or  more certified producers who want to open and operate a certified market.  </P> <P> Here's a list of the markets, divided by county:  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES COUNTY  </P> <P> Alhambra -- Chico Street (east of Garfield Avenue, north of Main Street).

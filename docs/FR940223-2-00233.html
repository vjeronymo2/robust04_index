Background and purpose.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The DOT National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's program for Youth Traffic Safety Education offers the opportunity to train young volunteers aged 16 to 25 to be proficient in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> traffic safety and then become positive role models for traffic safety behaviors for both younger children and their young adult peers. The children, youth, and young adult populations are over-represented in fatal motor vehicle crashes and are therefore at very high risk of being involved in potentially life-threatening or debilitating motor vehicle incidents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the U.S., injury is the leading cause of death for people ages 1 to 44. Traffic crashes alone are consistently the leading cause of death for persons between the ages of 5 and 34. Many of the deaths and injuries that occur on our roads are not the result of unavoidable incidents. By and large, these consequences are the result of failure to take proper precautions such as wearing safety belts and bicycle helmets as well as unsafe behaviors such as speeding and impaired driving. These losses strike particularly hard on young families and young children.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Attempts to improve chances of survival focusing on injury prevention call for traffic safety programs to increase safe behaviors. Increasing safe behaviors depends largely on educating individuals about precautionary measures and rules of the road such as using child safety seats to transport young children, buckling up all motor vehicle passengers, practicing safe bicycle and pedestrian behaviors, not speeding, and never driving impaired or riding with an impaired driver.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. Scope of work.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This project calls for a two-phase activity for the grantee to train young adult volunteer participants on critical traffic safety issues and to conduct educational activities using trained volunteers to promote highway safety for children and youth from prekindergarten through eighth grade. The educational activities use peer and cross-age mentoring as a teaching technique that has been found quite effective with this age group. Phase one is the development and conduct of training. Phase two is the program implementation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prior to applying, the potential applicant shall conduct a preliminary assessment and problem identification, to the extent possible, of the current status of community traffic fatalities and injuries as well as safety activities and resources, consulting sources such as the state office of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> highway safety, law enforcement agencies, hospitals, health clinics, and local chapters of other organizations involved with traffic safety efforts such as SAFE KIDS Coalition, Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), and Students Against Driving Drunk (SADD). The state office of highway safety may be able to provide a general outline of the problem and many of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities underway within a designated area. The applicant shall use the preliminary assessment to help design a complementary plan of educational activities, providing both the preliminary community assessment and the educational activity plan as part of the application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i. Program Phase One.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Phase one will entail completing the preliminary community assessment, finalizing the educational program plan, and developing and implementing the training component. In preparation for dealing with the complex and technical highway safety issues, a training program for community service volunteers including specialized training and experiential learning will be the integral part of the preparation for conducting educational safety activities. The training program will be developed and implemented with the consultation and coordination of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (``NHTSA'') and community experts corresponding with the educational activity plan. The training program must also be coordinated with and approved by the traffic unit of the local law enforcement department. Ideally, local law enforcement will be represented in training sessions to the extent possible. All participating program volunteers will complete initial training demonstrating a minimum level of knowledge and skills before beginning traffic safety education activities. The training program may extend into the program implementation phase as appropriate for continued instruction and consultation with experts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ii. Program Phase Two.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The grantee will then utilize trained volunteers to implement key traffic safety programs to meet local needs using available resources. Programs should incorporate one or more of the following traffic safety areas: child passenger safety, pedestrian safety, bicycle safety, safety belt use, and alcohol impairment. Several activities may be done concurrently or consecutively for added impact in a given traffic safety area or increased exposure to distinct traffic safety issues. Subjects may also be combined for a more comprehensive traffic-safety message. Suggested activities in the corresponding traffic safety areas include but are not limited to the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Child Passenger Safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Bounty Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A Bounty Program utilizes volunteers to work with merchants and others to remove no-longer-safe child safety seats from the reuse and resale markets. No-longer-safe car seats include those manufactured before current standards; no longer containing labeling identifying model and manufacturer; missing parts; containing broken, cracked, frayed, or rusted parts; under recall; or previously involved in a motor vehicle crash. Volunteers could work with local newspapers to publish public service announcements in the classified sections alerting the garage sale market about the program. Safe child car seats are available at low cost in many areas through discount stores, car seat loaner programs, insurance companies, and other sources. Additional child passenger safety activities could include working with local distributors to develop a local shopping guide specifying sites with child safety seat model availability and price lists. A ``how to'' manual is available from NHTSA to help establish a bounty program. (Can be conducted in conjunction with hospitals, police departments, fire departments, and day care centers.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

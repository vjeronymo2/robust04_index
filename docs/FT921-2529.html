			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Leading Article: After apartheid PRESIDENT F W de Klerk has won the referendum. Now his troubles begin. In the most momentous decision in their 400 year history, white South Africans have shown they accept that minority rule can no longer be sustained. Yet it is too soon to enjoy the luxury of excessive hope, and the world must now find ways of assisting South Africa to consolidate its transition to a post-apartheid society. The perils that lie ahead remain daunting. A third of voters opposed reform and opted for the fantasy of apartheid. The danger of violence from these right-wing extremists has never been greater. They have many supporters within the ranks of the police and the army. Their last constitutional opportunity to resist political reform has been resoundingly lost. The government has emerged from the referendum better equipped to cope with this threat. The significance of Mr de Klerk's victory goes beyond the mandate for negotiations that will end white rule. A new alliance between Afrikaans- and English-speaking whites has been forged, bringing the liberal Democratic party and the ruling National party together in pursuit of a common goal. If he is to disarm extremists of the left and the right, as sooner or later he must, the president can now claim strong political backing. Painful process It has been a painful process. White South Africa inflicted much suffering before bowing to the inevitable. The impact of sanctions, the fear of isolation and of spiralling violence - all added up to overwhelming pressure to abandon apartheid. Had Mr de Klerk's gamble failed, internal conflict would have been inevitable. An un-stable South Africa would have jeopardised the fragile peace process in Angola and Mozambique. The region's worst drought in living memory would have claimed many lives in the absence of secure access to South Africa's ports and railways, needed to import the maize required to prevent starvation. That nightmare is over. The way is open for the early installation of a multi-racial interim government, based on principles already agreed by the 19 organisations attending the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa). This should cement an alliance between Mr de Klerk and the African National Congress president, Mr Nelson Mandela, the two men who hold South Africa's future in their hands. Negotiating skill But Mr de Klerk still needs all the help he can get. The ANC may be the Nationalists' most promising partner, but not all of its leaders are natural democrats. Its links with the South African Communist party persist. Maintaining human rights and a private enterprise economy will require great negotiating skill and a huge amount of luck. As yesterday's budget shows, South Africa's economy is depressed. There is no chance of meeting rising black expectations and assuaging white extremists' fears within existing financial resources. So there are many potential pitfalls ahead. The new South Africa deserves substantial assistance to help it redress the legacies of apartheid, and boost an economy sapped by the need to run a balance of payments surplus in order to service its external debt. It should have access to International Monetary Fund facilities, and recourse to the World Bank and other lending agencies. The sooner the outside world ensures that these resources are made available, the better the prospects for a democratic South Africa.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to the actions noted above, NIH proposes to limit the citation of authority for issuance of the regulations to the Secretary's general statutory authority for the issuance of regulations set forth in section 215 of the PHS Act, rather than citing the statutory authority for each research project grant program. The latter provisions do not require or explicitly authorize the issuance of regulations and thus 1 CFR part 21, subpart B, does not require inclusion of those statutes in the authority citation. It is also proposed to make minor changes required by new statutory authority, simplify the language in &sect;&sect;52.2&hyph;4 and 52.6, update PHS Act section numbers referenced in part 52 as necessitated by enactment of legislation, and update the listing of HHS policies and regulations in &sect;52.8. The purpose of this notice is to invite public comment on these proposed changes. The following statements are provided for the information of the public. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Impact Statement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary has reviewed this proposed rule in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, and has determined that it will not: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in Executive Order No. 12866. Therefore, the Secretary has determined that the proposed rule does not require: (1) An assessment of benefits anticipated from the proposed amendments; (2) an assessment of costs anticipated from the proposed amendments; or (3) an assessment of costs and benefits of potentially effective and reasonably feasible alternative to the proposed amendments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because of the nonsubstantive nature of the proposed amendments, the Secretary certifies that the proposed regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, and therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis, as defined under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. chapter 6), is not required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations do not contain information collection requirements subject to review and approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) numbered programs affected by the regulations are: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> 93.113_Biological Response to Environmental Health Hazards <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 93.114_Applied Toxicological Research and Testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 93.115_Biometry and Risk Estimation_Health Risks from Environmental Exposures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 93.118_Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) Activity <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 93.121_Oral Diseases and Disorders Research <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 93.135_Centers for Research and Demonstration for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 93.136_Injury control Research Projects <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 93.154_Special International Postdoctoral Research Program in Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 93.173_Biological Research Related to Deafness and Communicative Disorders <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 93.184_Disabilities Prevention <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 93.198_Biological Models and Materials Resources Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 93.242_Mental Health Research Grants <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 93.262_Occupational Safety and Health Research Grants <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 93.271_Alcohol Scientist Development Award; Scientist Development Award for Clinicians; and Research Scientist Award <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 93.273_Alcohol Research Programs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 93.277_Drug Abuse Scientist Development Award for Clinicians, and Scientist Development Awards <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 93.279_Drug Abuse Research Programs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 93.281_Mental Health Research Scientist Development Award, Research Scientist Development Award for Clinicians, and Research Scientist Award <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 93.283_Centers for Disease Control-Investigation and Technical Assistance <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 93.306_Comparative Medicine Program (formerly called Laboratory Animal Sciences and Primate Research) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 93.333_General Clinical Research Centers <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 93.361_Nursing Research <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 93.371_Biomedical Research Technology <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 93.389_Research Centers in Minority Institutions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 93.390_Academic Research Enhancement Award <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 93.393_Cancer Cause and Prevention Research <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 93.394_Cancer Detection and Diagnosis Research <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 93.395_Cancer Treatment Research <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 93.396_Cancer Biology Research <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 93.821_Biophysics and Physiological Sciences Research <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

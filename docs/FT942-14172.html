			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / IMF seeks labour reform to cut Europe's jobless The sharp rise in unemployment in Europe during the past two decades can only be reversed by comprehensive labour market reforms, the International Monetary Fund warned yesterday in its World Economic Outlook. Against the grim background of Fund projections of a jobless rate of 11.9 per cent in the European Union this year, it calls on Europe to push through basic reforms of its unemployment insurance systems, minimum wage laws, employment protection regulations and 'distortions' that hamper job creation. In a hard-hitting section, the IMF says most recent moves to increase labour market flexibility in Europe 'attempt to correct distortions stemming from labour market regulations rather than to change the regulations themselves'. The IMF makes clear its support for more flexible labour markets on the US pattern. Stronger growth and higher levels of employment, as in the US, mean larger income gains for the economy as a whole, it said. Worries about the 'working poor' can be offset by the redistribution of income to help the low-paid through the tax and benefit system. The Fund doubts whether European labour market regulations reduce income inequalities. Over-generous unemployment benefits can cause unemployment to be concentrated in specific segments of society for a long time while high minimum wages can increase job losses among the young and low skilled. High payroll taxes, nationwide pay deals that hit companies in weaker sectors and regions, and restrictions on laying off workers were blamed for adding to the high level of unemployment in Europe. The IMF also identified similar problems in Australia. It argues that the 'bulk' of such unemployment, in Europe and Australia, is now structural, and that its economic and social costs are 'enormous'. Mr Flemming Larsen, an IMF economist, yesterday added that reducing structural unemployment in Europe could generate income for cutting budget deficits and raising living standards. The IMF cites New Zealand, where the unemployment rate fell by 2 percentage points between March 1992 and September 1993, as an example of the benefits of thoroughgoing labour market reform. The reform of UK industrial relations in the 1980s may also have contributed to the unusually early decline in unemployment during the present recovery. Details, Page 5</p>

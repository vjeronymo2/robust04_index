			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE NOTES;  </P> <P> DESIGN MIX-UP TO DELAY 'SONGS OF WAR' OPENING  </P> <P> The crew at the Grove Shakespeare Festival is working feverishly to redesign  the set of Murray Schisgal's "The Songs of War," which is slated for its world  premiere at the Gem Theatre in Garden Grove as the festival's second offering  of the season.  </P> <P> The radical redesign, ordered by the playwright, has forced the postponement of  the show's opening date from July 7 to July 12, a festival official said  Friday. Previews will not be affected, however; they will run July 5-9 as  previously scheduled. "Romeo and Juliet" opened last night as the season's  first offering, at the Festival Amphitheatre.  </P> <P> Apparently, the "Songs of War" set was designed to look like the back stage of  a theater, under the Grove's misconception that the work is a backstage play.  In fact, Schisgal's strongly autobiographical play does revolve around a  theater performer, and the playwright does want all the props to be visible to  the audience even when they're not being used. But Schisgal intends the work to  take place virtually on an empty stage, as though the central character has  invited an audience to hear the story of his life at a rented theater somewhat  gone to seed and didn't want to go to any expense to dress up the place.  </P> <P> 'KING' CONSIDERED -- At the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa,  officials have added "The King and I" -- with Rudolf Nureyev -- to the list of  musical revivals being considered for next season's Broadway Series.  </P> <P> The Rodgers and Hammerstein classic, which won the 1952 Tony award, will begin  a world tour this fall with Nureyev in the role that Yul Brynner once made his  personal possession.  </P> <P> Other possibilities for the season, reported in The Times in April, are "Les  Miserables," "Chess" and "Starlight Express" and, more distantly, "Jerome  Robbins' Broadway."  </P> <P> In April, Center President Thomas F. Kendrick said that "Chess" was "not  necessarily a show we would want" and that "Starlight Express" was "not at the  top of our list." However, Broadway tour offerings have provided slim pickings.  The great irony is that next season, Broadway has so many musicals in the  offing that it doesn't have enough theaters to accommodate them.  </P> <P> "Les Miz" closes July 23 in Los Angeles after 13 months at the Shubert Theatre  and goes to San Francisco in mid-October for an open-ended run. "Chess," which  has a pseudo-rock music score, played London and New York to mixed notices. It  has been revised and will begin touring in November.  </P> <P> "Starlight Express" also goes on tour in November. Despite negative notices, it  ran for two years on Broadway and closed in January. "Jerome Robbins' Broadway"  is scheduled to begin an open-ended run at the Shubert Theatre in Los Angeles.  The longer it plays there, the more distant the possibility of its coming to  the Center.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> MAN SOUGHT IN KIDNAP, ASSAULT OF EX-GIRLFRIEND  </P> <P> Police are looking for a former USC football player who they say kidnaped and  beat his ex-girlfriend a day after he was freed on bail on a previous charge of  assaulting her.  </P> <P> An arrest warrant has been issued for Jeff Maree, 25, who has not been seen  since he released Laura Zovitch, 20, in front of a Torrance restaurant May 8,  said Manhattan Beach Police Detective Fred McKewen.  </P> <P> Maree abducted Zovitch at gunpoint May 7 in Manhattan Beach and drove her to  Tijuana before releasing her the next day, McKewen said. Along the way, police  said, Maree punched Zovitch so hard that she lost both of her front teeth.  </P> <P> Zovitch ended her relationship of more than two years with Maree several months  ago because of his alleged abusive behavior, McKewen said.  </P> <P> Zovitch spent the night of May 6 with a friend in Manhattan Beach after  learning that a South Bay Municipal Court judge had lowered Maree's bail and  that he had been released from jail.  </P> <P> When Zovitch left the friend's house at 7:30 a.m., she found Maree crouched in  the back seat of her car with a pistol, McKewen said.  </P> <P> Maree forced Zovitch into her car before switching to his own car a few blocks  away, McKewen said.  </P> <P> Zovitch later told detectives that she suggested that the two drive to Tijuana  because she thought that when they crossed into Mexico she would be able to  alert border guards.  </P> <P> But the guards merely waved Maree and Zovitch across the border. After several  hours in Tijuana -- during which a dentist pulled Zovitch's dangling front  teeth -- the Redondo Beach woman was able to convince Maree that he would be in  less trouble with the police if he let her go, McKewen said.  </P> <P> Zovitch was let free on Hawthorne Boulevard in Torrance.  </P> <P> In April, Maree was charged with assault and battery for an alleged March 11  encounter with Zovitch at the apartment the couple once shared on Catalina  Avenue in Redondo Beach.  </P> <P> Maree, a reserve defensive back at USC from 1985 to 1987, came to the apartment  at 8:30 that night and the two argued, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Diana Teran. The  5-10, 185-pound athlete hit Zovitch several times, badly bruising her face and  arms, Teran said.  </P> <P> When Maree learned that charges had been filed in that case, he voluntarily  returned from a vacation at his parents' home in New Jersey and surrendered at  South Bay Municipal Court, said his attorney, J. Michael Flanagan.  </P> <P> Maree's bail was initially set at $22,000, but on April 23 Flanagan asked South  Bay Municipal Judge Thomas P. Allen Jr. to release his client on his own  recognizance. Flanagan said that Maree had shown his good faith by riding a bus  for five days from New Jersey to turn himself in.  </P> <P> But prosecutor Teran asked the judge not to alter the bail until a report was  prepared by the county Probation Department on Maree's suitability for release.  </P> <P> Allen refused to order the report, instead setting Maree's bail at $2,500.  </P> <P> Allen said Wednesday that he had lowered the bail because Flanagan made a good  case that Maree would return to court. The judge said he could not comment  further because the case is still pending.  </P> <P> Maree posted the reduced bail and was released from the men's Central Jail in  downtown Los Angeles on May 6, the day before the second alleged attack on  Zovitch.  </P> <P> Flanagan said he has no idea where Maree is or whether he will appear for his  preliminary hearing in the first battery case, which is scheduled for  Wednesday.  </P> <P> In 1987, while he was still enrolled at USC, Maree was arrested for allegedly  kidnaping another girlfriend. The victim in that case was released unharmed  after Maree drove her from El Monte to Pasadena.  </P> <P> Maree pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of false imprisonment in that case and  was sentenced to three years probation.  </P></p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Algeria struggles to find new direction: Despite the freeing of prisoners and prices, clear policies have yet to emerge NEARLY THREE months after the cancellation of Algeria's first multi-party general election, the country's leaders continue to fly by the seat of their pants, and without much sense of direction. This week has seen the freeing of 400 fundamentalist supporters, including the deputy spokesman of the banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), Mr Rabah Khebir. However, more than 6,300 still languish in harsh desert camps, and the government has this week dissolved nearly half the 450 town councils won by the FIS in June 1990. Algeria's leaders have also announced the freeing of all prices except those of semolina, flour, milk and bread. This will bring about a big cut in overall price subsidies. This follows the unveiling last month of a plan for economic recovery. However, few outside the country are aware of its contents, let alone its philosophy. Those who have read the document say it lacks substance. The government has restored law and order, but continuing assassinations of security and judiciary personnel suggests that calm may not prevail. Last month, the clandestine FIS leadership vowed to fight until an election was held. They described the seven members of the High Executive Council as a 'handful of despots'. The council is chaired by Mr Sid Ahmed Ghozali, the prime minister, but General Khaled Nezzar, the defence minister, is regarded as the key member. The council seized power after Mr Chadli Bendjedid was forced out as head of state on January 11. Between 1965 and 1979, Mr Ghozali did a remarkable job of building the national oil company, Sonatrach. Today he seems to some to be a prisoner of his managerial past. The freeing of prices suggests he may have concluded that a bold policy aimed at restructuring and probably privatising some of the many inefficient state companies is unavoidable. The next few weeks will tell whether Mr Ghozali can rise to a stiff challenge. Many Algerians and not a few foreign partners of Algeria are disenchanted with the prime minister. Their feelings appear to be shared by the 73-year-old Mr Mohamed Boudiaf, brought back in January from 28 years' exile to chair the ruling council. It is unlikely that Algerians will trust any leader until the more blatant cases of corruption and self-enrichment are dealt with. Trials may be a risky way of going about rebuilding confidence, if only because so many senior Algerians, civilian and military, have helped themselves. Yet alongside clearly enunciated reforms, some shock therapy appears unavoidable. Whether senior army officers would allow it must, however, be in doubt. Algeria's room for external financial manoeuvre remains limited but support has been forthcoming from western countries, most notably Italy and Japan, and recently France. Commercial arrears have declined dramatically. But while the government has promoted a more liberal oil exploration and production policy, which is tempting some international oil companies to invest, it continues to block some of the bold reforms unveiled in 1989 by Mr Mouloud Hamrouche, the former prime minister, whose aim was to liberalise imports of sugar, coffee and dairy products. Algeria pays at least Dollars 1bn a year for such commodities, about a fifth more than necessary, because of entrenched interests.</p>

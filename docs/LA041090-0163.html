			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> NOT GAY, SAYS PRINCE EDWARD  </P> <P> Britain's Prince Edward, Queen Elizabeth's youngest son, has angrily denied  that he is homosexual.  </P> <P> "I'm not gay," the 26-year-old prince told the mass-circulation Daily Mirror.  </P> <P> Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the report.  </P> <P> The newspaper said the prince spoke to one of its reporters in New York at a  party Sunday after the Broadway premiere of British composer Andrew  Lloyd-Webber's musical "Aspects of Love."  </P> <P> Prince Edward has worked as a production assistant in Lloyd-Webber's theater  company since dropping out of the marines.  </P> <P> The Mirror said the prince was angered by rumors about his friendship with  British actor Michael Ball, 27, who stars in the musical.  </P> <P> "It's just outrageous to suggest this sort of thing," the prince was quoted as  saying. "It's so unfair to me and my family. How would you feel if someone said  you were gay?"  </P> <P> By speaking out on such a sensitive issue the prince has broken a tradition of  silence surrounding the private lives of the Royal Family.  </P></p>

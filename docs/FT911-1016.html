			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Vice-chairman of Hong Kong exchange quits MR Philip Wong, first vice-chairman of Hong Kong's stock exchange council, last night resigned from the council following a confrontation with the colony's government and the Securities and Futures Commission which could have undermined the international reputation of the exchange. The confrontation centred on a now abandoned practice, which until 1987 gave preferential allocations of share issues to members of the exchange's council. But behind this there has been a row over stock exchange reforms between the authorities and local brokers led by Mr Wong, who was expected to become chairman of the council in October. Mr Ronald Li, chairman until the world markets crash in 1987, was given a four-year jail sentence last October because he accepted preferential share allocations, believing them to be a reward for approving share listings. Along with six other senior officials and advisers, he faces a further trial later this year. Mr Wong was a member of Mr Li's council but was not on the listing committee. He has admitted in a letter to the exchange that he took preferential allocations which he says were 'universally known and implicitly approved by the regulatory authorities'. Last week he was thwarted in a bid to reintroduce the practice when the council overturned a decision it had made in his favour a week earlier. He is believed to have launched the bid, which was almost certainly doomed to failure, in an attempt to exonerate himself for receiving the allocations. His defeat gave the issue wide publicity and precipitated yesterday's resignation which had been informally requested by the government. The problem has arisen because Hong Kong's Independent Commission Against Corruption granted Mr Wong immunity from prosecution for receiving the preferential allocations. It has been suggested he was granted this immunity because he handed the ICAC crucial information regarding Mr Li in 1987. But Mr Wong has denied that he reported Mr Li to the ICAC and is believed to argue that he received immunity because, along with eight others involved in the old exchange council, he agreed to government requests that he should not stand in the 1988 council elections. He was subsequently elected and rapidly became a vice-chairman. He alleges that, following newspaper reports about the immunity, the government and SFC built up a case against him and pushed for his resignation because he was leading local brokers' opposition to stock exchange reforms. The newspaper reports did not directly name him, but hinted at his identity and said the immunity had been granted because he had handed over the information.</p>

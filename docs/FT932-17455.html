			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Farmers reap benefit of Indian reform: Agricultural exports will be encouraged as New Delhi slackens reins on sector INDIAN farmers are to be encouraged to export mainstream agricultural products, in the most significant liberalisation of the country's farm trade policy since independence. The policy, announced yesterday, will extend to farmers the wide-ranging economic reform programme launched in mid-1991 by Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister. The reforms will undermine a central element of post-independence agricultural policy - the principle of restraining exports to keep down domestic food prices and reduce the risk of famine. The measures acknowledge that the old system, with its panoply of price controls and subsidies, has contributed to the stagnation of agriculture in many districts and deprived India of a potentially huge source of export earnings. Mr Pranab Mukherjee, the commerce minister, said in a statement that promoting agricultural exports was essential for boosting investment in agriculture, raising incomes in rural areas and ensuring that the benefits of export-led growth reached the country as a whole. The government is concerned that export growth has flagged recently. However, it risks political opposition over the changes since the reforms might lead to higher domestic food prices. Much will depend on the extent to which the government continues to pay out food price subsidies. There might also be friction in rural areas between rich farmers, who can afford to invest to take advantage of export opportunities, and poorer ones. Under past policies, agricultural exports have been dominated by internationally traded commodity crops including tea, coffee, high-grade rice, nuts and spices. Exports of staple crops have either been restricted or banned outright. Fruits and vegetables accounted for just Dollars 142m (Pounds 100m) of total agricultural exports of Dollars 3.3bn in the year to March 1992. Processed foods totalled only Dollars 77m. Under the new policy, businessmen will be free to set up export-oriented units in agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry, poultry, and fish-farming. They will be allowed to import capital equipment and materials duty free - in the same way that industrial export-oriented units already can. In an extra concession, such units will be allowed to sell up to 50 per cent of their output in the domestic market, compared with a 25 per cent limit for industry. The immediate impact on exports will be slight as such units could take time to establish themselves. But the potential effects are great since fertile parts of India, such as the northern state of Punjab, could well become internationally competitive exporters. In other measures announced yesterday, the government permitted accountants, lawyers, journalists and other professionals to import capital equipment at a concessional duty rate of 15 per cent. Mr Mukherjee said in his statement that India's 'abundance of highly skilled human resources' gave it a competitive advantage in services. The minister also took a further 144 items off the list of banned imports. The newly decontrolled products include poultry feed and other goods of interest to farmers.</p>

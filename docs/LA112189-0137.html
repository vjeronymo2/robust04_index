			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PICKENS BRINGS ANTI-JAPAN PUSH TO COUNTY  </P> <P> Corporate raider T. Boone Pickens inaugurated the Orange County chapter of his  "shareholders rights" organization Monday with a vigorous attack on Japan.  </P> <P> Pickens, chairman of the Texas energy company Mesa Limited Partnerships and a  longtime critic of corporate management practices, called for a ban on Japanese  acquisitions of U.S. companies, even though he conceded that such a move would  not be in the interest of shareholders in the short run.  </P> <P> He accused Japanese firms of operating "cartels" that systematically exclude  U.S. companies from Japan and artificially prop up Tokyo's domestic financial  markets.  </P> <P> He also referred in ominous terms to Japanese "encroachment" with direct  investments in the United States and said the time had come to "shut it down."  </P> <P> Although Pickens maintained that he favors free trade, he said U.S.  policy-makers should tell the Japanese: "We're all through doing business with  you until you let us in" to the Japanese market.  </P> <P> Pickens, who has been trying to win a seat on the board of a Japanese firm in  which he owns a 26% stake, acknowledged that Japanese buyouts are often a good  deal for U.S. shareholders.  </P> <P> But he also said in his talk at the Four Seasons Hotel that in the long term,  shareholders would be better off if the United States implemented harsh  retaliatory trade measures against Japan.  </P> <P> The United Shareholders Assn., a lobbying group founded by Pickens in 1986,  aims to represent the interest of stockholders against what Pickens and others  regard as the abusive practices of entrenched corporate managers.  </P> <P> The group has fought federal and state legislation aimed at blocking hostile  takeovers and has attacked corporate anti-takeover measures such as so-called  "poison pills."  </P> <P> The county chapter of the group, headed by Randy Young of the Santa Ana  investment banking firm Everhart Corp., is the 35th local chapter and hopes to  speak on behalf of about 600,000 county shareholders.  </P> <P> The group is lobbying for a cut in capital gains taxes and has sought to  publicize its cause with a "hit list" of 50 U.S. companies the group holds to  be the worst at protecting shareholder interests.  </P> <P> Fluor Corp. of Irvine is among those on the Target 50 list. A Shareholders  Assn. member is pushing the firm to adopt a secret ballot for the election of  directors.  </P></p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Letter: Success achieved through tailoring services to market needs Sir, With distribution logistics fast becoming an even bigger global concern, I read the FT's survey on Distribution Service (September 3) with great interest. However, in the article 'A hidden force ready for action - Japanese eye UK market', the remark by Mr Jack Mather, chief executive of NFC, that '(The Japanese) come in on the back of Japanese manufacturers - they all trade and link together - and use them as a base. Then they'll spread to other customers', makes us Japanese sound like some sort of germ. It spoilt, at least for me, the up-till-then impartial and objective analysis of Japanese distribution network systems. I cannot deny that there are many undesirable aspects about the Japanese manufacturer-distributor relationship. But it would only mean another bout of meaningless 'Japan-bashing' to criticise current systems without trying to find out what makes them click, and without saying what exactly critics want done about it. I may well be mistaken, but I feel the main reason for Japan's 'success' in this area was that which seemed to be asked for throughout the survey - an understanding of the customer's business and services tailored to market needs. True, some Japanese companies may continue to prefer all-Japanese 'exported' systems, but there are limits to this, and as the confidence and scale of Japanese business grow, many already realise the merits of local networks and are using the most efficient, logistic system regardless of nationality. Surely local customers will also want to give their custom to the provider of the best services in the same way? In an increasingly borderless world, we must do our best to understand and learn from one another in order to reap the benefits of mutuality and reciprocity, and make the best use of the 'good' competition available to achieve co-prosperity worldwide.

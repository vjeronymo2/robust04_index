			<p>BFN     [Text] The military has reaffirmed that it will not  participate in the forthcoming constitutional conference. This  was again emphasized by the director of defense information,  Brigadier General Fred Chijuka, in Zaria, Kaduna State, while  answering questions from newsmen. He said that as an  organization responsible for the defense of the sovereignty and  integrity of the nation, the military should not take part in  the conference. Gen. Chijuka said that the Armed Forces  expected Nigerians to [words indistinct] rather than the  military asking to play certain roles in the government of the  country. On the Bakassi Peninsula, the director stated that  Nigerian troops had succeeded in checking the activities of the  Cameroonian gendarmes.</p>

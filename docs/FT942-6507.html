			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Observer: Nuts The polluter must pay. And so say all of us. Last week, Petrobras, Brazil's state oil company and one of the most inefficient in South America, was blamed for an oil spill which polluted 18 beaches along the Sao Paulo coast. It was the second worst on record, according to the environmentalists. Cetesb, an environmental agency, sprang into action and announced that Petrobras was to pay double the maximum fine, since it was by no means its first offence. But - and such are the joys of inflation - what was a daunting sum in 1991 now amounts to just Dollars 2. Less than the cost of a cup of coffee.</p>

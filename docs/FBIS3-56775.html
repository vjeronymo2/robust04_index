			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] INTERFAX has learned that a session of the RF  [Russian Federation] Security Council to be chaired by Russian  President Boris Yeltsin is to be held on Wednesday, January 19.  Well-informed sources assert that the agenda will include  several issues related to the development of Russia's military  doctrine confirmed by the Security Council last November. In  particular, it is to consider several military-technical aspects  of the doctrine.    This document contains a model of the defensive-industrial  complex activity under the system of market relations.  Competitive development of arms proclaimed by the doctrine must  rule out harmful parallelism in creation and development of  various kinds of armaments and to provide for rational spending  of allocated funds.    High quality of the Russian army's military equipment should  enjoy priority. The document stresses that military equipment  of the Russian army should obligatorily correspond to world  standards.    The session to be held behind closed doors is to consider  several issues regarding recent reshuffles in the supreme  echelons of power.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6. The primary investment objective of the J&hyph;P Money Market Fund is maximum current income consistent with liquidity and stability of principal. The VIP Money Market Portfolio seek to obtain as high a level of current income as is consistent with preserving capital and providing liquidity through investment in high-quality U.S. dollar-denominated money market securities of domestic and foreign issuers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. JP Investment Management Company (``JP Management'') provides investment advice and management services to the J&hyph;P Money Market Fund. JP Management is a registered investment adviser and wholly-owned subsidiary of Jefferson-Pilot Corporation and is an affiliate of Jefferson-Pilot. JP Management receives an annual investment advisory and management fee on an annual basis of .50% of the  <!-- PJG 0320 forcenewline --> J&hyph;P Money Market Fund's average daily net assets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company (``Fidelity Management''), a registered investment adviser, is the investment adviser for the VIP Fund, including the VIP Money Market Portfolio. Fidelity Management is a wholly-owned subsidiary of FMR Corporation, which is not an affiliate of Jefferson-Pilot. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prior to January 1, 1994, Fidelity Management's advisory fee was based on the VIP Money Market Portfolio's gross income, as follows: (a) Monthly gross income equivalent to an annualized yield of 5% or less was subject to an annual fee rate of 4% of the Portfolio's gross income; (b) monthly gross income in excess of an annualized yield of 5% was subject to an annual rate of 6% of that excess; and (c) the management fee was limited to a weighted average of a graduated series of annual limitation rates ranging from 0.5% of its average monthly net assets up to $1.5 billion to 0.4% of its average monthly net assets in excess of $6 billion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As of January 1, 1994, Fidelity Management's advisory fee for the VIP Money Market Portfolio is comprised of: (a) A basic fee rate, and (b) an income-based component. The basic fee rate is the sum of two parts: (a) a group fee rate based on the monthly average net assets of all funds advised by Fidelity Management, and (b) an individual fund fee rate of .03%. The group fee rate ranges from a maximum of .37% to a marginal rate of .1325% if total assets in all of the funds advised by Fidelity Management rise. One-twelfth of the combined annual fee rate is applied to the VIP Money Market Portfolio's net assets averaged over the most recent month, giving a dollar amount which is the fee for that month. If the VIP Money Market Portfolio's gross yield is 5% or less, the basic fee is the total management fee. The income-based component is added to the basic fee only when the VIP Money Market Portfolio's yield is greater than 5%. The income-based fee is 6% of that portion of the VIP Money Market Portfolio's yield that represents a gross yield of more than 5% per year. The maximum income-based component is .24%. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Applicants propose to substitute shares of the VIP Money Market Portfolio for all outstanding shares of the J&hyph;P Money Market Fund attributable to the Contracts (``Substitution'') as soon as practicable following the issuance of the Commission's order. Applicants state that Jefferson-Pilot will supplement the prospectus for the Separate Account to reflect the proposed Substitution. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. At the close of business on the date of the Substitution, Jefferson-Pilot will redeem for cash all shares of the  <!-- PJG 0320 forcenewline --> J&hyph;P Money Market Fund it currently holds on behalf of the Separate Account. On the business day following the Substitution, Jefferson-Pilot will redeem for cash all shares of the J&hyph;P Money Market Fund that it currently owns, representing its ``seed money'' investment held directly in its General Account. The J&hyph;P Money Market Fund will process a redemption request and, simultaneously, the VIP Money Market Portfolio will process a purchase order for the exact amount of the redemption proceeds. The redemption request and the purchase order will be at prices based on the current net assets values per share next computed after receipt thereof and, therefore, in a manner consistent with Rule 22c-1 under the 1940 Act. Monies attributable to Contract owners currently invested in the J&hyph;P Money Market Fund will be fully invested at all times. The full net asset value of and number of redeemed J&hyph;P Money Market Fund shares held by the Separate Account will be reflected in the Contract owner's accumulation unit values following the Substitution. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. All expenses and transaction costs of the Substitution, including applicable brokerage commissions, will be assumed by Jefferson-Pilot and reflected in the redemption proceeds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. Within five days after the Substitution, Contract owners will be sent a written notice of the Substitution (``Notice''), the prospectus for the VIP Fund, and the supplement to the prospectus for the Separate Account describing the Substitution. The Notice will advise Contract owners that for a period of thirty days from the mailing of the Notice (``Free Transfer Period''), Contract owners may transfer all assets, as substituted, to any other available Subaccount, without limitation and without charge. Following the Substitution, Contract owners will be afforded the same contract rights, including surrender and other transfer rights, with regard to amounts they have currently invested under the Contracts. There are no currently applicable surrender fees or redemption charges under the Contracts. Applicable deferred sales charges, however, will be imposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

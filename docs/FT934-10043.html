			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / Budget 1993: Attempt to halt VAT on reading material PUBLISHERS are redoubling their efforts before Budget to try to head off the threat of VAT on reading material, Raymond Snoddy writes. Everyone from national newspaper proprietors to book publishers is alarmed that the chancellor might decide to extend VAT to cover books, newspapers and magazines. This week the Henley Centre, the consultancy group, published a study showing VAT on newspapers would result in a gradual fall in the quality of local newspapers. Previous Henley research showed that a rise in the cover prices of national newspapers has 'a substantial negative impact' on the sale of local titles and national papers. The Periodical Publishers Association, trade body of the magazine industry, also warns this week that the introduction of VAT at the standard rate of 17.5 per cent will make British publishers the highest taxed in Europe. The association points to the fall in newspaper circulations in the Irish Republic after the introduction of VAT. Sales there have fallen 25 per cent since 1981 compared with a fall of about 10 per cent in Britain during the same period.</p>

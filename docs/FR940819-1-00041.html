			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> County/day of month/time of day. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  When there is an injury that is not caused by a train accident or highway-rail grade crossing accident, FRA presently cannot determine the county of the incident or the exact date of the incident since the current Form requires railroads to report only the month, year, and State. Requiring the county in which the incident occurred in block ``5d'' will assist FRA safety inspectors in determining which sites or railroad shops have more injuries or illnesses. Requiring the exact date, including the day of the month, in block ``5b'' and time of day in block ``5c'' will assist FRA safety inspectors in records inspection. It will also assist the railroad industry in determining whether more accidents occur on certain days or times of the week.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Gender/ethnicity. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  FRA proposes requiring the gender and ethnicity of the person injured or ill in an effort to help identify whether particular groups of individuals, particularly trespassers, are more susceptible than others to certain injuries and illnesses. Language barriers or unfamiliarity with road signs, especially railroad crossing signs, may contribute to many of the accidents that occur at highway-rail grade crossings. Submission of information on gender in block ``5h'' and ethnicity in ``5i'' would furnish FRA with the data relevant to demonstrate whether or not this is in fact the case. If the data collected in these blocks showed that particular ethnic groups were more prone to certain injuries and accidents, then FRA would attempt to identify what the exact problem is and then develop remedial programs or other appropriate policies and procedures to prevent recurrence of such injuries and accidents in the future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Circumstance codes. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  When there is an injury that is not associated with a rail equipment accident, the only information about the incident currently collected is (i) what the person was doing at the time of the incident and (ii) the type of injury. This is not sufficient data for safety analysis. For example, if an individual received an electric shock while using portable power tools, there is no way to determine, under the current reporting system, whether the cause of the incident was defective equipment, improper use of equipment, undesired contact with a power line or box, or some other circumstance such as stepping on a power line. FRA needs to collect ``cause'' or ``circumstance'' codes for such injuries and illnesses. FRA thus proposes to develop new codes, in addition to those currently used, to describe the cause and/or circumstance of such incidents. Appendix 6 to this NPRM provides a list of the proposed circumstance codes that is to be used when completing the ``Railroad Injury and Illness (Continuation Sheet).'' Specifically, these circumstance codes would be used to complete the information in blocks ``5m_Physical Act,'' ``5n_Location,'' ``5o_Event,'' ``5p_Result,'' and ``5q_Cause.'' Appendix 6 is merely a preliminary sample of the list of circumstance codes and should not be considered all-inclusive. The list of circumstance codes, once finalized, would be printed in the FRA Guide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Terminations or permanent transfers. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As discussed earlier in the NPRM, FRA proposes to eliminate the requirement for submission of the ``Annual Summary Report of Railroad Injury and Illness'' (Form FRA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F 6180.45). Data on terminations and permanent transfers is presently collected on Form FRA F 6180.45. In order to continue to gather this data, FRA proposes collection of this information by the addition of block ``5v,'' entitled ``Terminations or Permanent Transfers,'' to Form FRA F 6180.55a.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Narrative on unusual circumstances. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  FRA also proposes the addition of a narrative block ``5w'' on Form FRA F 6180.55a that would allow the reporting railroad the opportunity to provide details (up to 250 characters) on any unusual circumstance(s) surrounding the railroad worker's injury or illness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In summary, FRA proposes to amend Form FRA F 6180.55a to require railroads to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Note all injuries and illnesses that are due to the release of hazardous materials and the associated injury problem (burn, rash, inhalation, etc.);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

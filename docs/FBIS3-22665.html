			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Jan Benes and Lubor Kohout report: "We Are Under the </F> Threat of Bacteriological Weapons!"]    [Text] According to findings by CESKY DENIK reporters, a  very dangerous family of bacteriological and virological weapons  is secretly stored on the Czech Republic's territory. Our  country is a signatory to the Geneva Convention, which this  obliges us not to allow our army to develop bacteriological or  virological weapons, use them, or store them without  international approval.    Within the framework of the former Warsaw Pact, the then  Czechoslovak Socialist Republic was authorized to develop  bacteriological weapons. A very secret site was designated for  this purpose in the Military Research Institute near Techonin in  the Orlicke Hory mountains. The Research Institute operated  within the framework of the Military Medical Academy in Hradec  Kralove. Scientists from other Warsaw Pact countries  participated in the development and testing of these very  dangerous and inhumane weapons. They were mostly from the former  Soviet Union -- from a Leningrad institute -- Bulgarians, and  others. CESKY DENIK reporters have found out that the species  of the bacteria and viruses developed in Techonin had been  stored in various places in the Czech Republic until recently.  On other, unknown places, they may still be stored. This is not  only a violation of the Czech Republic's international  obligations, but also a criminal act -- at the very least -- of  posing a public threat with unpredictable consequences.    It is very likely that in the Military Research Institute in  Technonin species of biological weapons are still being stored,  or have been destroyed only very recently. They are for  example, a culture of cholera, the plague, smallpox, tularemia,  meningitis, and the rare psittacosis.</p>

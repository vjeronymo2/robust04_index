			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Personal View: If I were a government minister . . . I was recently discussing the state of the information technology industry in the UK with a trade and industry minister. I had already said that I had not come to seek money - this puts ministers at their ease - but that I thought it was time the DTI, indeed the government, showed leadership with regard to some of the major issues facing industry. These discussions often cause me to consider what I would do if I were in the other person's shoes. How would I behave if I were a DTI minister? Clearly, I would need to make some broad assumptions: I would be in a government promoting healthy markets, rather than 'picking winners'; the government would remain committed to sound money, low inflation and low interest rates; and it would be playing a positive role in Europe. The principal areas of consideration are: Competition: First and foremost, the government's role is to ensure that there are a few, simple, transparent and consistent rules designed to promote a competitive business environment. These should be applied lightly but unfailingly. Since competition has to be seen in a European Union context, the government must vigorously advocate similar rules in those areas where it is appropriate to have an EU-wide policy - for example, state aid. Trade policy: The UK is still a leading trading nation. It needs open markets for its goods, services and capital investment. Conversely, the UK's market must be fully open too. We must continue to promote open markets in the EU and in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. But we have a particular responsibility towards our neighbours in central and eastern Europe. It seems bizarre that we maintain aid programmes - such as the UK Know How Fund and the EU's Phare programme  - designed to improve their industries, while at the same time denying them full access to our markets. Technological Base: To be competitive, Britain needs to invest continually in its technological base. This means that the DTI and Office of Science and Technology must share a single, clear vision for the UK as a technology provider and innovator. The government should mobilise all the considerable science and technology talent in this country behind improving the competitiveness of UK industry. Programmes to encourage innovation and engineering excellence will provide measurable benefits for industry, higher education and society as a whole. The process of nurturing engineering and science talent must start in the schools. The aim would be to develop fine, well-rounded individuals who would strive to be winners. Best practice: Globalisation of markets continues apace. To ensure the UK stays genuinely competitive, its companies need to benchmark themselves against the strongest competitors. As a minister I would do everything possible to promote benchmarking: for example, using mechanisms such as the DTI innovation unit. I would work with the Training and Enterprise Councils to find better ways of transferring technological innovation and best practice throughout the business community, linking up with the DTI one-stop shop concept. People: None of the above will happen unless we have highly skilled, motivated people. Britain needs to put more power behind the Investors in People programme. By insisting that large companies should be accredited as Investors in People before they can bid for government business, overnight a large percentage of UK-based companies could be motivated to stop pussy-footing over training. After all, the UK's lack of skilled labour and its effect on its national competitiveness are not new phenomena - royal commissions have identified it as a big issue as far back as 1884. Finally, on the basis that the government should also take the medicine it so freely dispenses to industry, I would implement Investors in People policies throughout government service and back them up with performance-related pay schemes. To eliminate unnecessary red tape, 'bureaucracy reduction' would be one of the performance measures and, of course, government would be run as a total quality management operation. This approach would enable the DTI and industry - 'our customers' - to speak the same language. Customer satisfaction could be measured by, perhaps, looking at export performance and job creation figures; or perhaps it should be assumed that the general election is the ultimate expression of 'customer satisfaction'?

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive report"] </F>   [Text] Sources close to the Hamas Movement in Jordan have  said that approximately 90 members and supporters of the  movement in Jordan have been arrested and that some Muslim  Brotherhood members, who support Hamas, or who consider  themselves to be part of Hamas were also arrested.    The sources stated that these measures were taken after the  passports of Muhammad Nazzal and Ibrahim Ghawshah, Hamas  officials in Jordan, were confiscated even though their  passports are valid for five years. The sources added that such  an action is unconstitutional.    In a telephone conversation with AL-BILAD, Interior Minister  Salamah Hammad refused to comment on the passport issue  considering it an issue not worth discussing. On the issue of  arrests, Hammad said: I have not heard about it, and I have no  idea about what you are saying.</p>

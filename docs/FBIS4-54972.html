			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Belgrade, 7 May (TANJUG) -- Representatives of  the Serbian National Renewal [SNO] announced at a news  conference today that the relevant authorities have banned the  party's convention scheduled for Victory Day on Monday at the  Republic Square in Belgrade. The SNO said that Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy, chairman of the Liberal-Democratic Party of  Russia, was to have addressed the convention.    A decree banning the convention, signed by Milos Vukobrat,  head of the interior affairs department of Belgrade's Stari Grad  municipality, stresses that the decision was passed because "if  the meeting goes ahead and there is a breach of public order,  the safety of people and property will be threatened, and public  transport will be interrupted." [passage omitted]    [Zoran] Atanaskovic [chairman of the SNO executive  committee]  said: "We believe that this is a political ban, and the SNO's  final stance is that the convention will go ahead as planned,  regardless of whether our appeal to overturn the ban is accepted  or not." According to him, there have never been any incidents  at SNO meetings. He added that the party is ready to guarantee  safety to all participants in the meeting, and that 200 bouncers  will be provided.    Jela Jovanovic, chairman of the SNO's political council,  confirmed that Zhirinovskiy and his closest aides will arrive  tomorrow afternoon and spend three days in Belgrade. According  to her, immediately upon his arrival, Zhirinovskiy will have a  meeting with republic of Srpska president Radovan Karadzic and  then hold a news conference in the International Press Center.

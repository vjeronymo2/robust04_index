			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH ABANDONS VOW, CALLS FOR TAX INCREASE TO REDUCE DEFICIT  </P> <P> So, President Bush has finally gone back on his "no new taxes" promise, and the  only decision to be made is who must pay them. I propose that we wipe out the  federal deficit by imposing on each American who voted for Bush in 1988 a  onetime luxury tax, the luxury in this case being naivete.  </P> <P> In addition to its eminent fairness, my scheme is educational: An electorate  forced to pay a cash price for its gullibility will eventually stop falling for  campaign promises that are obviously impossible to keep.  </P> <P> MONTE MONTGOMERY  </P> <P> Crestline  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Yin Xuecheng (3009 1331 2052) and Zou Aigou </F> (6760 1947 0948]    [Text] Nanjing, 23 May (XINHUA) -- Premier of the State  Council Li Peng conducted a six-day inspection of Jiangsu from  17 to 22 May. During the inspection, he pointed out that since  the Opium War, the Chinese people have been struggling for over  150 years and they are now faced with an excellent opportunity  for development. As long as we resolutely seize this  opportunity, follow the direction given in Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, handle well the relationship between reform,  development, and stability, forge unity, and strive forward,  China has great hope for development.    Li Peng and his party, accompanied by Chen Huanyou,  secretary  of the Jiangsu provincial CPC committee and governor of Jiangsu,  and travelling along the Grand Canal, inspected commodity grain  production bases and state-owned large and medium-sized  enterprises in Lianyungang, Huaiyin, Yangzhou, and Zhengjiang,  and visited farmers' families and talked with local cadres and  the masses.    The great land along the Changjiang and Huaihe in early  summer is surging with vitality. Li Peng said he had been in  Jiangsu several times and had witnessed Jiangsu's development  and changes amid reform and opening up. Jiangsu's conscientious  implementation of the principle and policies of the CPC Central  Committee has brought about rapid economic development and  marked improvement in the living standards of urban and rural  citizens, and it has positively contributed to the state. He  continued, saying that in the course of the economic  development, it is not only necessary for localities to take  their local interests into consideration, but also to  subordinate themselves to the requirements of the state and  handle well the relationship between the state and localities.  He expressed the hope that Jiangsu would make persistent  efforts and score even greater development.    The main purpose of Li Peng's current tour is to inspect  state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises and village and  township enterprises in Jiangsu. Li Peng made detailed  inquiries into the production and operations of the Lianyungang  Port Affairs Bureau, Yangzhou Transport and Container Limited  Company, Yangzhou Passenger Bus Manufacturing Plant, and  Zhengjiang Jiangkui Enterprise Limited Company. He noted that  operations at many state-owned large and medium-sized  enterprises were good. He said they produce marketable products  to compete both on the domestic and foreign markets. They  possess advanced technologies. They exercise strict management.  Their products are very competitive, and their economic  efficiency is high. But we should also see to the fact that in  the course of deepening the reform and of moving toward a market  economy, some enterprises have met with varying degrees of  difficulties, resulting in low economic efficiency. This has  been caused by many factors. We should not only have full  confidence in helping state-owned large and medium-sized  enterprises operate well, but also attach importance to existing  problems at state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises. He  pointed out the need for the state-owned large and medium-sized  enterprises to face up to market competition; always strive to  make their products adapt to domestic and foreign markets'  needs; stress marketing; actively develop markets; establish  good mechanisms adapted to the socialist market economy; attach  importance to technological progress; enhance reserve forces for  enterprise development and competitiveness; and to stress  national structure and economic benefits in the areas of  development. He said it is groundless for some to equate  state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises with low  efficiency enterprises. We have full confidence and we believe  that we will surely help state-owned large and medium-sized  enterprises operate well through our efforts.    Whether in Huaiyang, located in the hinterland of north  Jiangsu, or in Yangzhou and Zhenjiang, on the two banks of Chang  Jiang, Li Peng has shown great concern over the problems of  agriculture, villages, and peasants. In Yanzhuang Village,  Gaogou Town, Lianshui County, he held a forum with cadres at  provincial, city, county, town, village levels and cadres from  peasants' groups on the issues concerning ways to increase  agricultural production, readjust agricultural structure, and  improve the living standards of peasants. In Wuan Township,  Gaoyou City, he checked the growth of summer grain in the field  and visited peasant families. In Longshan Village, Dantu  County, he inspected the Longshan United Eel Corporation to  learn about the development of the situation. He stressed:  Agriculture is a major matter of vital importance to the  state's overall economic situation and social stability, and its  development must receive attention. Under the circumstance of  fairly low agricultural efficiency, in particular, the role of  agriculture as the foundation of the national economy must not  be shaken. He hoped that Jiangsu would fully display its  abilities in developing a diversified economy after stabilizing  food production; increase per mu area yield and pay attention to  efficiency at the same time after securing land for growing  grain; and support the development of the collective economy and  village and town enterprises in rural areas, as well as  gradually develop optimum scale farming, after stabilizing and  improving the household-based system of contracted  responsibility with remuneration linked to output.    During his inspection, Li Peng came to Huaian -- the  hometown  of Zhou Enlai, a great proletarian revolutionary. He paid a  visit to the memorial hall and former residence of Zhou Enlai  and viewed an exhibition of Zhou Enlai's feats. He said: We  should emulate Comrade Zhou Enlai's lofty moral character -- his  absolute devotion to the cause of revolution and his deep love  for the people.    After hearing the briefing of the Jiangsu provincial party  committee and government, Li Peng emphatically noted: Price  hikes have slowed down over the past two months, but stabilizing  the market and commodity prices remain an important task of  governments at various levels.    Discussing the gap between south and north Jiangsu, Li Peng  said: Judging from the national standard, Jiangsu is  economically developed; however, there is certain difference  between the north and the south of the province when the two  areas are compared with one another. South Jiangsu, which has  become prosperous first, is responsible for helping the north  develop economy, so that it will also become rich as soon as  possible. North Jiangsu has its own superiority -- in land,  resources, and labor, for example -- and its key tasks at  present are to further solve the transportation problem and  improve its technical and management levels, so as to gradually  narrow the difference.    Also participating in the inspection tour were Chen Jinhua,  He Chunlin, Liu Jiang, Huang Zhendong, Guo Lin, Jiang Yunbao,  and responsible persons of relevant departments under the State  Council.</p>

			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Minorco digs deep The shuffling of assets between Minorco and its South African parents is motivated by more than a desire for geographic neatness. Anglo American is shedding mining assets which could require substantial capital expenditure in currencies other than rand. Minorco has cash in abundance to fund such investment, and can claim another stride towards becoming a genuine natural resources group rather than a piggy-bank for South African interests. Whether a wholly independent Minorco would have wanted to extend its position in pulp and paper - or take a stake in TransAtlantic, Mr Donald Gordon's insurance and property vehicle - is open to question. If the deal helps close the discount to net assets at which Minorco's shares now trade, shareholders might anyway applaud. But there is room for doubt in this regard. By taking shares rather than cash, Anglo American's influence over Minorco is increased. That will be scant comfort to investors wary of buying into a minority position. The deal does nothing in the short term to address the question of Minorco's Dollars 1.1bn cash pile. Without hard evidence that management can spend wisely, the discount is likely to remain. Still, Minorco seems to be buying some attractive base metals reserves at the bottom of the cycle. Profits should eventually benefit further out when metals prices rise. Exactly when that will show through in the form of increased earnings per share is difficult to fathom. Profits from the acquired assets will have to rise smartly from last year's meagre Dollars 30m to make up for the issue of another slug of shares. There could be something of a wait.</p>

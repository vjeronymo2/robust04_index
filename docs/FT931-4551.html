			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Foreign buying supports Nikkei's advance ACTIVE foreign buying countered profit-taking by investment trust funds, and equities gained further ground in volume of 850m shares, the heaviest trading since September 1991, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average advanced 161.83 to 17,848.30, making a 6.1 per cent rise over the last two trading days. The index opened at the day's low of 17,724.89 and rose as high as 18,047.16, breaching the 18,000 mark for the first time since September last year. Profit-taking by the investment trusts pared some of the gain during the afternoon. Volume climbed to almost four times the recent market average, on active buying by arbitrageurs and short-covering by foreign investors. Gains led losses by 761 to 291, with 124 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks added 18.87 at 1,339.77, although in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index closed just 0.32 up at 1,074.97. In spite of the rise, some derivatives traders were cautious ahead of Friday's price fixing for settlements of March contracts of stock index futures and options. Mr Masa Sato at SG Warburg said the market could decline towards the end of the week as the bulk of options positions held by market participants would become profitable if the Nikkei index were to fall below 17,500. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone was once again the focus of trading. The issue closed unchanged at Y780,000 in active trading after hitting the day's peak of Y829,000. Traders noted profit-taking by investment trusts. Fujikura, a cable maker closely linked to NTT, retreated Y11 to Y599 on profit-taking. Foreign investors sought steel and electrical issues. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day, put on Y10 at Y317, NKK Y8 at Y265, Hitachi Y26 at Y747 and NEC Y56 at Y767. Companies with close ties to the Japan Railway Group firmed on speculation that the issues will benefit from the expected listing of JR East later this year. Nippon Signal, the railway signal maker, moved ahead Y20 to Y1,360, while Tekken, a construction company and contractor for JR companies, gained Y13 at Y773. Aids-related shares firmed on active buying by speculators. Ube Industries ended Y30 higher at Y390 and Nippon Zeon Y16 dearer at Y588. In Osaka, the OSE average was 309.16 firmer at 18,793.44 in volume of 212.4m shares. Pharmaceuticals, electronics and constructions were among leading gainers. Nintendo, the video game maker, climbed Y320 to Y10,200. Roundup POLITICAL events again dominated some of the larger Pacific Rim markets. HONG KONG took heart from renewed prospects of Sino-British talks soon and shares resumed their record-breaking run. The Hang Seng index finished 25.84 stronger at an all-time high of 6,508, having touched 6,557.10 during morning trading. Turnover improved to HKDollars 4.62bn. The previous record of 6,502.81 was set last Friday. Banks were the best blue chip performers, with HSBC rising HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 70. Hang Seng Bank closed HKDollars 2.50 up at HKDollars 69.50 after touching HKDollars 70. Electronics companies were ahead on expectations of improved sales to the US. AUSTRALIA tried to take its lead from events on Wall Street, but continuing election nerves held gains in check and the All Ordinaries index ended 16.6 firmer at 1,633.7. Retail trade and jobs vacancies data helped the mood. Retail stocks fared well, notably Coles Myer, which rose 11 cents to ADollars 4.75 as retail trade figures boosted hopes for its interim results, due tomorrow. SINGAPORE was mixed, with banks continuing to shed some of their recent gains. The Straits Times Industrial index eased 3.32 to 1,657.72 in volume of 221.9m shares. OCBC Foreign declined 30 cents to SDollars 11.70 and UOB Foreign dipped 15 cents to SDollars 8.95. Inchcape was 15 cents lower at SDollars 6.05. BOMBAY suspended trading around midsession after shares came under unrelenting selling pressure. The BSE index fell by 132.64, or 5.4 per cent, to 2,318.56 before trading was stopped by the authorities because of the 'abnormal movement' of prices. TAIWAN saw particular weakness in financials as the weighted index receded 127.11, or 2.8 per cent, to 4,474.47.</p>

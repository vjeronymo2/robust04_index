			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Specifics and Progress of </F> Privatization in the Ukrainian Agro-Industrial Complex"]    [Text] A program for reforming the ownership arrangements  of enterprises in the dairy and meat industries in 1994, which  has been developed by the Main Administration of the Dairy  Industry (Holovmolprom) and the Main Administration of the Meat  Industry (Holovmyasprom) of the Ministry of Agriculture and  Foodstuffs of Ukraine, calls for the privatization of 314 dairy  and 90 meat- processing enterprises.    The production potential of the agro-industrial complex, as  the domain of the Ministry of Agriculture and Foodstuffs of  Ukraine, consists of 433 enterprises of the Holovmolprom, of  which 370 are dairy enterprises. Some 109 meat-processing  enterprises and 149 state-owned sovkhozes, which specialize in  animal husbandry, report to the Holovmyasprom. As of the  beginning of April of this year, 93 dairy enterprises (21  percent of the total number) and 40 meat- processing enterprises  plus five sovkhozes, 17 percent, were privatized.    At present, integrated agro-industrial associations are  being  created in the agro-industrial complex with the participation of  agricultural producers, processing enterprises, and trading  organizations through their transformation into public  joint-stock companies: In the dairy industry, 31 associations  have been created, and in the meat-processing industry--21. Some  581 and 406 company- operated outlets, respectively, operate in  these sectors at present. For now, the leasing of property  remains the main ownership arrangement; 187 enterprises of the  dairy industry and 58 enterprises and sovkhozes of the  meat-processing industry operate in this format.    The reluctance of agricultural commodity producers to  deliver  their products to monopoly enterprises that engage in processing  milk and meat has recently become a characteristic peculiarity  of the agro- industrial complex. The farms are setting course  for the acquisition of their own minicomplexes for smoking meats  and other processing equipment.    According to data from the Ministry of Agriculture and  Foodstuffs, at the enterprises privatized with the participation  of agricultural producers the proportion of the stock held by  the latter remains comparatively small; besides, it differs  substantially in different Ukrainian oblasts. Thus, at the  Novaya Odessa Cheese Plant (Nikolayev Oblast), the share of  commodity producers comes to 49 percent and at  CHERKASSYRMOLPROM, to 35 percent, whereas at the LUHANSKMOLPROM  leased enterprise, this indicator is as low as 14.2 percent, and  at the Gadyach Cheese Plant (Poltava Oblast), 4.3 percent. At 11  enterprises in Odessa Oblast, at whose facilities the Odessa  Joint-Stock Company for Meat Production and Processing was  created, the proportion of stock held by agricultural producers  came to 52 percent, at the Konotop Meat-Processing Combine to 73  percent, and at the Zaporozhye Combine to 40 percent.    At present, 47 enterprises of the dairy industry are  undergoing privatization. The fastest pace of privatization is  characteristic of Kiev and Cherkassy Oblasts--22 enterprises in  each, Chernigov Oblast--21 enterprises, and Donetsk and Lugansk  Oblasts--19 enterprises in each. In the meat industry, 29  meat-processing enterprises are being privatized: six in  Vinnitsa Oblast, three in Ivano-Frankovsk Oblast, two  enterprises in Kiev, Kirovograd, and Poltava Oblasts each, four  enterprises in Sumy and Khmelnitskiy Oblasts each, five  enterprises in Cherkassy Oblast, and one enterprise in Chernigov  Oblast.    The above statistics indicate that although privatization in  the agro-industrial complex of Ukraine is advancing, it is  advancing very reluctantly. According to data from the Ministry  of Agriculture and Foodstuffs, associations in Transcarpathian,  Rovno, and Chernovtsy Oblasts have not embarked on the  privatization of enterprises in the dairy industry at all. As  far as the meat- processing industry is concerned, enterprises  in Volyn, Dnepropetrovsk, Transcarpathian, Nikolayev, Rovno,  Ternopol, Kharkov, Kherson, and, once again, Chernovtsy Oblasts  bring up the rear.</p>

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / NatWest confirms 4,000 staff to go Further evidence of the contraction in the financial services sector came yesterday as National Westminster Bank confirmed that it expects to lose about 4,000 jobs this year. The bank's UK branch network will bear the brunt of the losses, with a forecasted fall in staff numbers of 3,400. Other cuts will be in support areas. Unions expect further job losses to be announced today by other financial institutions. On Monday, Barclays announced 3,000 job losses during the next two years - in a new round of staff cuts. The Bifu banking union accused the banks of releasing details of their job-cutting programmes ahead of expected announcements of large profits. Mr Alan Ainsworth, Bifu assistant secretary, said: 'Big profits seem to be no bar to cuts in staff, more branch closures and a worse service to the customer. 'It seems that no matter what the question, NatWest's answer is always another round of job cuts.' Mr Ainsworth blamed the cuts partly on a desire among the banks to bring their cost-income ratios down to rates more comparable with building societies. NatWest Staff Association is hopeful that there need be no compulsory redundancies in the branch network. Mr Stuart Chandler, head of personnel at NatWest, yesterday said that the bank was committed to reducing job numbers through natural wastage. He said the use of technology had had an important impact on activities such as traditional back office processing. In 1993 4,000 job losses were announced - but only 3,000 jobs were cut. Only 270 of these were compulsory. Mr Chandler also highlighted the 1,600 new jobs which NatWest plans to create during the year, in activities such as NatWest Markets, where 200 UK jobs will be created, and in card processing. NatWest employs about 92,000 staff.</p>

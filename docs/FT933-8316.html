			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Kuomintang rift poses threat to hold on power A CHALLENGE to President Lee Teng-hui's leadership of the ruling Kuomintang Nationalist Party has widened internal divisions which pose a growing threat to the party's 44-year hold on power in Taiwan. Delegates to the KMT's 14th congress, which opened yesterday, said that they were seeking sufficient signatures to nominate a rebel candidate - Mr Chang Feng-shu, 65, a former minister of state and mayor of Taipei  - in tomorrow's elections for the party chairmanship. Mr Lee is expected to retain the post. But the dissidents' move underlined growing anger within the party at the slow pace of democratic reform and of measures against corruption. In last December's parliamentary election, the KMT's share of the vote fell to a record low partly because of popular disquiet about corruption. Unrest within the party was highlighted last week when six prominent members of parliament broke away to form the New Party, saying the KMT had become corrupt and paid too much attention to interests of wealthy businessmen. Mr Lee acknowledged yesterday that the party was threatened by internal factional struggles and growing political opposition. 'In recent years, pluralism in society has led to differences in political ideology among our comrades, posing a severe challenge to us in elections,' he told the congress. 'Implementing internal reform is more difficult than tackling external challenges. But our goal has been set and we must overcome all obstacles,' Mr Lee said. The congress is expected to drop most of the 12 'mainlanders' - veterans who fled to Taiwan with General Chiang Kai-shek in 1949 when the Communists took power in China - from the 31-member Central Standing Committee. This will virtually complete the transfer of power from the veterans to local-born politicians such as Mr Lee. The internal travails are partly a reflection of this transfer, as Taiwanese people take an increasingly pragmatic view about relations with China. The New Party is advocating direct transport links.</p>

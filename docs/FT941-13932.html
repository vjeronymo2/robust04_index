			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Markets: Bulls take a run on the middle range - London Even in a week when London stocks closed at record levels, the 135.5 point jump in the FT-SE Mid 250 index on Wednesday was the stuff of bull market legends replete with tales of terrible squeezes and aborted buying programmes. Lacking such drama, the rise in the broad market could not even muster much new economic justification. Ken Clarke squelched hopes of an early interest rate cut by invoking the spectre of inflationary Chancellors-past. 'Nigel Lawson. . . would agree looking back that he had already reduced them too much' when he gave in to public pressure and kicked in the after-burners on his late-1980s boom. The FT-SE 100 rose 83.6 points on the week to a record close of 3,484.2 and a gain of 1.9 per cent since the begining of the year. More impressively, though, the FT-SE Mid 250 pushed on to an 8.3 per cent year-to-date rise, closing up 190 points at 4,105.8. The index, which captures the 250 largest companies below the top-tier 100, has been out-performing the Footsie for a while. Strategists see it as a more effective way than the Footsie to play the UK economic recovery. Judging by the way investors piled into it this week, creating market turmoil in their wake, they believe its attractions will last a while. The day the UK left the ERM in September, 1992, shares began their unchecked run up. As the chart shows, the two indices tracked each other for a few months but by the beginning of last year the Mid 250 began to pull away. This month, it has raced ahead. Investors bought Pounds 3.4bn worth of shares in the index in the first four days of this week, against Pounds 10.6bn all of last month. The vault on Wednesday, when non-Footsie stocks accounted for a hefty 70 per cent of the day's trading volume, was the index's largest one-day gain since it was started two years ago. Part of the gain was attributable to technical factors, particularly a severe stock shortage. One Swiss-based house was said to be caught out trying to amass enough shares to underpin a warrant on the Mid 250. Illiquidity is a problem. The market capitalisation of the 100 index is Pounds 570bn, an average of Pounds 5.7bn per company. Even so, investors can be frustrated trying to buy or sell the bottom 20 or so Footsie stocks in quantity. The Mid 250 has a market capitalsiation of Pounds 173bn, an average of Pounds 700m per company. The smallest is Amstrad at Pounds 235m. Not only is stock hard to come by, but investors tend to buy for the longer term. 'You have to work as hard to put half a million pounds into a 250 stock as, say, Pounds 200m into BTR,' says Mike Bishop, a director of Gartmore, the fund manager. But do not be dazzled by the fireworks. 'There are investment trends here that the illiquidity masks,' says Robert Buckland, UK equity strategist at NatWest Securities. Investors are buying the stocks for their UK exposure. The general manufacturers sector, for example, embracing contractors, building material suppliers, engineers and other highly cyclical stocks, account for 32 per cent of the Mid 250 against only 14 per cent for the Footsie. Electricity and water stocks, favoured for their dividend growth, account for 11.2 per cent against only 5.1 per cent of the Footise. Many of the constituents also offer better exposure than big stocks to currency and interest factors, argues Paul Walton, equity market strategist at James Capel. 'If the major exporters lose out from weak European markets and a strengthening pound then domestic stocks - typically smaller cap - are better placed and moreover should benefit from any subsequent interest rate cut.' He forecasts that the Mid 250 and FT-SE Small Cap indexes, the latter covering the bottom chunk of the All Share Index, will outperform the Footsie by 15 per cent and 25 per cent respectively this year. One might, however, draw a note of caution from a longer perspective. From the end of 1985 to the end of 1988, the Mid 250 outperformed the Footsie by about 25 per cent. By its subsequent trough, in September, 1992, it had underperformed by about 9 per cent. Thanks to this week's gains, the index is now about two-thirds of the way back towards its peak outperformance. Corporate corroboration of the smaller company investment story came with several items of company news. Spring Ram (kitchens and bathrooms), Stanley Leisure (betting shops and casinos) and Crest Nicholson (house builder) tapped shareholders for some Pounds 80m in rights issues. Evidence of the potential for smaller companies' growth was also supplied by Carclo, the engineering group. Its pre-tax interim pre-tax profits were up 41 per cent, thanks in part to successful integration of Arthur Lee, the steel maker it bought in June. The biggest story of the week - the rejigging of Guinness and LVMH's cross-ownership - hardly fits the mould unless Tony Greener, Guinness's chairman, has a particularly Machiavellian scheme in mind. The UK group has swapped its 24 per cent stake in the French group for a 34 per cent stake in its Moet Hennessy drinks subsidiary and Pounds 416m in cash. The new arrangement could come in handy for Guinness if it tried to hive off a nice little drinks business should LVMH's media and fashion adventures cause it grief. Tesco also conceded that smaller might be perkier. Three years ago, launching a Pounds 572m rights issue, it extolled the virtues of its mammoth 72,000 sq ft flagship stores. The stock has gone down hill ever since. This week it sharply cut capital spending, began depreciating its land and buildings and talked of building more compact 20,000 sq ft Metro stores. The switch spoke volumes about the suddenly less grandiose visions rampant in the retail food sector.</p>

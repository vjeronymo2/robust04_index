			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Technology - Steel Takes on Aluminium: On course for a head-on collision / Automotive The motor industry urgently needs lighter, stronger materials to meet demands for more economical and environmentally-cleaner vehicles. The lighter the car, the less fuel it consumes and the smaller the amount of pollutants it emits. But manufacturers are also being pulled in another direction. Legislators want more safety features, such as airbags and side-impact anti-intrusion bars. Consumers increasingly want air-conditioning, compact disc systems and other comfort features. These add weight - and lots of it. The first Volkswagen Golf of the early 1970s weighed on average 750 kg. Thanks to all its extra systems, today's Golf weighs around 1,000 kg. If VW could pare the car's weight back to 1974 levels while retaining modern convenience and safety features, the 1994 Golf would travel about 17 per cent further on each gallon. Volkswagen's executive cars division, Audi, jolted the world steel industry with its launch earlier this year of the A8, a luxury car with an all-aluminium bodyshell comprising a skeleton-like frame made of extrusions and castings, clad in pressed aluminium panels. The body structure is said to be nearly 40 per cent lighter than the steel equivalent. Audi and its partner Aluminium Company of America (Alcoa) have installed specialised production facilities allowing output of up to 30,000 cars a year. More disconcerting yet for steel makers is that VW/Audi says it sees no reason why even high-volume cars such as the Golf should not have aluminium bodies early next century, while Alcoa says it is prepared to spend Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) or more on a partnership with any car maker seeking to produce aluminium-bodied cars in annual volumes of 100,000 units or more. In North America major car makers such as Ford are also pressing ahead with development programmes for aluminium-bodied cars. In addition, a consortium of more than 20 steel-makers from around the world has embarked on a collaborative project aimed at designing the lightest possible steel bodyshell for cars. It has engaged Porsche Engineering Services, the US consultancy engineering arm of the German sports car maker, to lead the project, which is setting out to show that a 20 per cent weight saving in a steel bodyshell can be achieved by optimising design using current pressing and body-welding systems, and 35 per cent by designing from scratch and utilising advanced technology. Even though VW/Audi has such a big commitment to aluminium body structures, it is keeping its options open. It is collaborating with Mercedes-Benz, BMW and the German and French steel industries in their own parallel programme to see whether thin, high-strength steels can achieve the same weight saving as aluminium, but at lower cost and using conventional pressing and welding equipment. If it can be demonstrated clearly that this is so, steel makers say they believe other steel-favouring factors should prove decisive: easy repairability within an established repair infrastructure; easier paintability; and easier and cheaper recycling. A recent report by the Iron and Steel Institute maintains that whereas automotive steels are routinely shredded, melted and reformed into new products, aluminium body parts comprise different alloys with low tolerance both towards each other and outside contaminants, and so have to be recycled separately or downgraded into lower value products. In terms of energy conservation alone, the implications of even a 20 per cent cut in body weight are enormous. Applied across the world car population, according to Ludwig Hamm, Porsche's head of body engineering, fuel savings would equal the annual consumption of more than 6m cars. It is not only in the area of weight saving that steel makers are seeking to preserve their automotive markets. Steel makers have been investing heavily in mills to produce a variety of coated steels. A major part of this investment, around Dollars 25bn worldwide, has gone into zinc coating lines. What began, in the 1960s, as a limited supply to the automotive industry of hot-dipped galvanised sheet for use in exposed underbody parts has grown into the wholesale supply of steels with deep two-sided coatings. The approach has helped to roll back part of the challenge to steel from the plastic composites sector, much of whose appeal has rested on its non-corroding qualities but which continues to suffer considerable problems of recyclability.</p>

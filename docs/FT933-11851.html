			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Kazakhs to receive Dollars 86m IMF credit THE International Monetary Fund has approved a Dollars 86m credit for Kazakhstan from its systemic transformation facility, a new loan fund designed to help countries from eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union make the leap to a market economy, writes George Graham in Washington. It said Kazakhstan had succeeded in restraining the size of its budget deficit by improving tax collection, cutting spending and reducing subsidies, with a deficit target of 6 per cent of gross domestic product this year. The Kazakh economic programme aims for a sharp reduction in inflation by the end of the year, together with an acceleration of structural reforms and a strengthening of the country's official reserves.</p>

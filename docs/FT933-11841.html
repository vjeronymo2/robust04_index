			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / CBI adds to pressure for interest rate cut: Survey says weaker export markets threaten recovery PRESSURE for a cut in UK interest rates increased yesterday after a report from the Confederation of British Industry warned that weakening export markets in continental Europe put the recovery at risk. The CBI's quarterly survey of manufacturing industry was less positive about growth prospects than three months ago and said companies remained cautious about stepping up investment owing to uncertainties about demand. The tone of the survey has been supported in recent weeks by confidential assessments of business conditions by the Bank of England and the Department of Trade and Industry, which have highlighted the threats to an upturn from export fragility and low UK demand. The reports have given a strong hint to the Treasury that a cut in interest rates might be needed to put a firm platform under recovery. In its monthly monetary report, the Treasury highlighted worries about the deterioration in the continental European economy while painting a relatively bright picture of UK prospects. It said: 'Activity in the main continental European economies seems to have been flat in recent months, and concerns over the prospect for (continental European) recovery have increased.' However, the report said the trend in UK retail sales was strongly upwards, with other indicators pointing to recovery. Many economists believe Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is weighing up a 1 percentage point cut in base rates to 5 per cent, possibly to compensate for an increase in taxation in the November Budget to counter the deterioration in government borrowing. This view was behind a switch out of sterling by investors, causing the pound to fall 2 pfennigs against the D-Mark to close last night in London at DM2.57, reaching DM2.5722 in late trading in New York. Against the dollar, the pound shed more than 1 cent to close at Dollars 1.49, reaching Dollars 1.488 in late New York trading, in while on the London stock exchange share prices had their best day for 2 1/2 months on general bullishness about easier borrowing conditions across Europe. Partly buoyed by theories that the German Bundesbank might cut interest rates at its council meeting tomorrow, the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares closed up 35.2 at 2,879.4. The CBI's survey, a closely followed indicator of UK economic trends, showed that manufacturers' order books had strengthened in the past four months by the largest amount since 1990, clearly indicating an upturn. But while underlining that inflationary pressures remained subdued, the report showed the substantial growth in manufacturing output and exports in the first half of the year might not be sustained in the second half. Pinpointing the CBI's concern that by the end of this year capital spending by manufacturers on plant and buildings will be about a third down on its peak in 1990, Mr Howard Davies, the CBI's director-general, said recent economic trends were 'a matter of concern for the sustainability of the recovery'. The reports by the Bank of England are based on its contacts with some 3,600 companies around Britain and are considered by the Treasury as a useful barometer of business conditions.

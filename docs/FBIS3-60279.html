			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Nadim Kawash] </F>   [Text] Abu Dhabi, Dec 7 (AFP)--Arab states, which control  60 percent of global oil reserves, are proposing a worldwide tax  that could raise more than four billion dollars a year to  protect the environment.    The idea is seen as a "fair" alternative to a proposed  European Community energy tax, which has caused alarm in  oil-producing states on the grounds it would slow down demand  for crude and depress their earnings.    "There are several more effective and fair alternatives to  the taxes on oil products," Arab states said in their 1993 joint  economic report, prepared by the Organisation of Arab Petroleum  Exporting Countries (OAPEC) and two other regional organisations.    "The first is the imposition of a worldwide income tax of  0.25 percent, which could fetch around four billion dollars a  year in the industrial countries and 750 million dollars in  developing nations."    "The sum could be used to clean and protect the  environment."    It is the latest in a series of Arab proposals to persuade  the 12-nation E.C. to steer away from its planned tax, which the  community says is designed to protect the environment by  containing the emission of carbon dioxide.    But Arab and other oil producers charge the E.C.'s real aim  is to secure extra revenue to tackle domestic budget deficits.    Reservations from Britain and other E.C. nations have held  up  enforcement of the tax, which will levy three dollars on every  imported barrel of oil, to rise to 10 dollars by the year 2000.    "Imposing taxes on oil products will not protect the  environment nor will it curb crude imports," said the Arab  report, part of which was carried by the official Kuwaiti news  agency KUNA.    "They will only achieve large increases in government  revenues in industrial countries at the expense of oil  producers."    Gulf Arab states have strongly attacked the tax on the  grounds it would affect them most as oil accounts for nearly 90  percent of their income.    Around four million barrels per day (b/d) of their oil  output  goes to the E.C., while 2.8 million b/d are exported to Japan  and two million b/d to the United States.    One of the scenarios on the effects of the carbon tax on  Gulf  Cooperation Council (GCC) states is that it will depress their  earnings by 14 billion dollars a year, hurting their development  plans.    The revenues of GCC states--Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar,  Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates--are already under  pressure from a sharp decline in oil prices.    Since 1981, their earnings have been slashed nearly  threefold  to 70 billion dollars in 1992.    "Definitely, Arab oil and gas exports will be hurt by the  policies of the industrial nations," said the Arab report, also  prepared by the Arab Monetary Fund and the Arab Fund for  Economic and Social Development.    "Imposing taxes on oil products will also boost consumption  of coal and burning of wood, which will cause further damage to  the environment."    It said Arab oil exports stood at 38.3 percent of the total  world crude exports of 39.7 million b/d in 1992, while natural  gas exports accounted for 12.1 percent of the total world gas  supplies.</p>

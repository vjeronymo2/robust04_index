			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Mitterrand urges caution on sell-offs PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand yesterday said that the conservative government of prime minister Edouard Balladur must exercise 'extreme caution' in the privatisation of state-owned companies important to national interests. Speaking in a televised interview, traditional on France's Bastille day holiday, the Socialist president also said that the franc must be defended and that the maintenance of its parity with the D-Mark in the the European exchange rate mechanism was 'a necessity above all others.' Mr Mitterrand cited Elf-Aquitaine, the oil group, Aerospatiale, the aerospace company, and Snecma, the aero-engine maker, as examples where caution was needed. Elf is expected to be one of the first companies to be privatised as part of the government's programme commencing this autumn. Stressing that there was no constitutional power to block the privatisation law passed by parliament, he said: 'Once it has been passed I become a notary. It is my duty to sign and I sign.' But his comments reflect a debate within the ruling RPR and UDF parties concerning the privatisation of sensitive industries and suggest that the government may retain a 'golden share' to maintain control of companies involved in defence, high technology and energy industries. Mr Mitterrand appeared satisfied with his relations with the centre-right government but refused to be drawn on his relations with Mr Balladur. 'I am in favour of applying the constitution. The people voted and that is all,' he said, referring to the March general elections in which the Socialists suffered a crushing defeat. In a wide-ranging interview, Mr Mitterrand said that he was in favour of a Gatt agreement on the liberalisation of international trade but that any agreement 'must be fair.' He said that problems remained in the sphere of agricultural trade despite greater than expected progress at the G7 summit in Tokyo earlier this month. The French president called for measures to stimulate consumption and to revive the economy. He said that 'everything had been tried' in the fight against unemployment, but that the government should continue to search for new remedies. Mr Mitterrand, appearing relaxed and sharp during the interview, said he had 'recuperated while working' following surgery for prostate cancer last September.</p>

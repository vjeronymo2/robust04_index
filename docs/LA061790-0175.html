			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> I would like to applaud Judge Wapner on his decision handed down for the  defendant during the May 23 airing of "People's Court."  </P> <P> He very astutely judged that the young girl who kicked her date's car was  understandably reacting in anger to what sounded to me like a case of sexual  assault. The young man obviously thought that with no witnesses, she would not  be able to defend her action "in court," but the judge saw through his  arrogance. I thought Wapner's comments were sensitive and thoughtful. The young  man probably deserved far worse than a kick in the car.  </P> <P> Cynthia Hutchison, Westlake Village  </P></p>

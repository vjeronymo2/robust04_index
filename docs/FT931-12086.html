			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Books: Stark look at virgin territory - A book about the bits Dame Freya did not mention FREYA STARK: A BIOGRAPHY by Molly Izzard Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 25, 342 pages ONE OF the curious things about Freya Stark's travel books is that she is always falling ill. It comes as a bit of a shock to the armchair reader to realise that this famous maiden lady voyaging to the remoter corners of Arabia was a hypochondriac: we begin to wonder why. But she cannot have been as frail as all that. Tomorrow, in her home in Asolo, she arrives at her one hundredth birthday. Perhaps it is just as well that the old girl is in no mental state to be aware of this new biography. Molly Izzard, who is herself a long-time Middle East hand, has decided that it is time to de-bunk - to de-mythologise - Dame Freya's carefully presented life story. To do this she has placed herself, as biographer, at front of stage, and described her long and fascinating investigation into the truth behind the legendary image of the Great Traveller. Her exploration of a personality, as she puts it, takes her into territory which Dame Freya (in her voluminous memoirs and published letters) and her faithful friends have always been careful to avoid. The first 35 years, for example, have had only the sketchiest of maps. Now we can see the semi-invalid daughter of an unhappy middle-class marriage, traumatised and scarred by a head wound and jilted by her Italian fiance, taking Arabic lessons with the vague idea of becoming a governess in the Middle East. Once into Lebanon with a wealthy woman friend in 1928, Freya discovered her vocation. But hold on, says Mrs Izzard - she was never a serious explorer: her pre-war travels were very modest and brief affairs, as the local colonial officers always knew, though they were willing to help her and rescue her when she fell sick. Her true gift lay in her writing - 'the deft concealment of the practical under the poetic' as the biographer describes it - in which she re-worked the material first drafted in the thousands of letters she used instead of a journal. Dame Freya, it is correctly insisted, is not worthy of the frequent comparison with Gertrude Bell. That is also true of her wartime activities when she was posted to Cairo and Baghdad to organise her 'Brotherhood of Freedom', the Ikhwan al Hurriyah, a clandestine network of pro-British locals whose importance is hard to assess in these post-Nasser days - a sort of 'Greenmantle in reverse' is Izzard's witty comment (Buchan's version was the Ka'aba al Hurriyah). What is clear is that by the end of the war Freya Stark was a celebrity, her reputation as a Middle East expert established, but by no means justified with hindsight. By this time, and after the necessary passage on Freya's late and absurd marriage to her homosexual colleague Stewart Perowne, Mrs Izzard loses interest. There is next to nothing in this book about the past 40 years of Dame Freya's life, and rather too much on the newly discovered family background. There is also too much speculation about motivation. We are to understand that Dame Freya was in reality an egotistic self-publicist, naive, exploitative and spiteful to old friends, a psychosomatic fantasist who used her symptoms to attract attention, an Edwardian imperialist who never had any sense of Arab nationalism. 'Her preferred associates were wealthy, with important connections or influential family backgrounds, preferably rather grand. She had little time for the humble and the obscure except as ministrants to her own comfort and needs, on whom her bland affability and easy manner usually produced a gratified willingness to be made use of . . .' This last does at least suggest that she had charm, as her friends would certainly agree. Whether she was in love with her mother - or with her father - and what that meant for her sexuality . . . well, by now Mrs Izzard is out of her depth. This book was commissioned by Dame Freya's attentive and long-suffering publishers, John Murray, who, when they saw it, changed their mind. They had earlier declined the eight volumes of collected letters which Dame Freya insisted on publishing in her eighties. But it is worth going back, not just to the 1930s travel books but also to the John Murray 1988 selection of letters in one volume, Over the Rim of the World. There is a tone of voice in them which this mischievous, very readable birthday present does not adequately acknowledge.</p>

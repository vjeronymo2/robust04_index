			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Personal View: Temptation that must be resisted Imagine that, in September 1992, sterling had been realigned within the exchange rate mechanism instead of floating out. Suppose that it had been pegged at about its present level of DM2.37 with either 6 per cent or even 2.25 per cent bands. Then one might conclude that there would have been little difference between the 2.37 peg and today's 2.37 float. But this is not correct. If Britain were in the ERM, and the peg were credible, interest rates would have to exceed the 8.5 per cent of Germany - say, around 9 or 10 per cent or even higher if the market suspected further devaluation, compared with 6 per cent today. As for the French franc, the Dutch guilder and other ERM currencies, their interest rates remain dominated by Germany - as indeed was the UK's before last September. Britain would simply rejoin the club. Interest rates of more than 9 per cent would prolong and deepen Britain's recession. The growth of all measures of the money supply would suffer a relapse. Indeed, it is likely that the money supply would actually fall. There would then be a serious risk of a widespread financial collapse. While it is painful but possible to work out the large overhang of debt in corporate balance sheets and household portfolios with interest rates below 6 per cent or so, rates above 10 per cent pose monumental problems. A domino-like collapse cannot be ruled out. I suspect that the government knows and appreciates the disaster that would follow re-entry today. Indeed, the prime minister, Mr John Major, has ruled out early re-entry. But suppose that the hopes of the market are realised and that German interest rates are substantially reduced in the months ahead. Then would Mr Major be tempted in? It all depends. But it is clear that, if and as the Maastricht bus rolls on, Mr Major will be under considerable pressure to rejoin the ERM. The negotiations for monetary union and the European (Monetary Institute) Central Bank will commence shortly after the ratification of Maastricht. Since the ERM is the only road to convergence and monetary union, it follows that the really serious negotiations can take place only among those who are in the core of the ERM and, perhaps, are within striking distance of achieving the conditions of monetary and fiscal 'convergence' required for acceptance into the union. Ardent European that he is, Mr Major, egged on as always by those inveterate 'joiners' in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, will have a great incentive to participate in the ERM and be admitted to this exclusive club. Of course, no great harm will be done to Britain if German interest rates fall to, say, 4 per cent at the end of 1993 and stay there. Then what has long been a persistent and large deviation between the interest rates required by the ERM and those needed for Britain's domestic economy will at last be small beer. But is it plausible? Will such harmony persist? More to the point, should Mr Major mortgage Britain's future on such a conjecture? In my judgment, Bundesbank interest rates are unlikely to fall to these levels in the course of 1993. The persistence of inflationary pressures in Germany will keep rates high and they are unlikely to be less than 6 per cent by December 1993. The question then arises: will Mr Major be so pressurised by the need to be at the top ERM table that he will nevertheless risk aborting Britain's recovery? One hopes not, but it would be foolish to believe that political priorities will not prevail. The best one could hope is that, by cutting interest rates, Mr Major will drive sterling down to such a level - say, DM2.00-DM2.20 - that, on entry to the ERM at that prevailing rate of exchange, the depressing imposition of high German interest rates will be largely offset by the boost to the economy of such a low exchange rate. I would not, however, suggest that this is a likely stance for the government. The French and others would complain bitterly about 'competitive devaluation' and the FCO, as well as the Treasury, would soon call a retreat. I conclude that, to secure his seat at the top Emu table, Mr Major is likely to attempt re-entry into the ERM during the next year. One hopes for a less disastrous run than that which we endured in 1987-92, but it would be foolish to expect it. The author is vice-chairman of AIG Trading Corporation</p>

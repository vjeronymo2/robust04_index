			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 19, 2-7 May 94] </F>   [Text]  <H5>  Industry </H5>   The Ukrainian Ministry of Statistics made public its data  about the national economy's status in the first quarter of 1994.    According to the ministry's report, Ukraine's production  slump accelerated with GNP having dropped by 34 per cent and  national income by 36 per cent versus the first quarter of 1993.    Ukraine's industrial production was particularly hard hit by  the economic crisis with industrial output having reduced by 38  per cent and labor productivity by 32 per cent, as compared with  the same period of 1993. Over three thirds of Ukraine's  industrial enterprises reduced their output.    Ukraine's ferrous metallurgy, chemical, petrochemical, oil  refining, light, pulp and papermaking industries are listed  among those hit worst of all by the crisis.    Production of basic fuel amounted to 27.3 million tons of  the  so-called conditional fuel in 1994's 1st quarter, which was by  4.3 million tons, or 14 per cent, less than a year ago. Primary  crude petroleum treatment halved with resultant drastic  curtailment of automotive gasoline, diesel fuel and oil fuel  production.    Production drops affected the bulk of products, manufactured  by the chemical and petrochemical industries, such as mineral  fertilizers, automobile and truck tires, synthetic resins and  plastics.    The timber industry's curtailed production resulted in a  fivefold reduction in pulp, paper, and cardboard manufacture.  <H5>  Agriculture </H5>   The vernal sowing campaign is underway across Ukraine. As of  early May, collective and state farms sowed spring crops to  cover 10 million ha [hectares], which was an increase by 64.5  per cent versus the same date in 1993.    1,145,900 ha were sown with white beet, 592,300 ha with  sunflower and 73,800 ha with potato seeds.    The situation in Ukraine's animal husbandry remained  complicated, though early and promising stabilization trends  appeared. Livestock's productivity and fodder supply somewhat  improved. Thus, averaged per cow milk yield was 424 kg versus  413 kg in 1993's 1st quarter. However, meat production in  slaughter weight dropped by almost a third, same as egg  production (by 21 per cent).    Ukraine's livestock and poultry capita reduced by 11 per  cent.  <H5>  Construction </H5>   Ukraine's housing, industrial and societal construction  decelerated, too. Total dwelling area construction amounted to  967,000 sq. m., which a reduction by 46 per cent versus 1993's  1st quarter.  <H5>  Carriage </H5>   Industrial and agricultural production curtailment, ruptured  economic bonds with partner enterprises in "near abroad"  nations, widespread non-compliance with obligations and chronic,  acute fuel shortages could not but have a most adverse effect on  the Ukrainian transport's performance with its aggregate cargo  haul having dropped from 336 million tons in 1993's 1st quarter  to 206 million tons this year. Cargo carriage by rail reduced  by 35 per cent.    Trucking reduced by over two times (52 million tons of  freightage were carried).    Marine shipment appeared less affected having hauled a total  of 6.3 million tons of freightage, which was a meager 8 per cent  drop versus the year before.    A total of 1.1 b. [billion] passengers were carried by rail,  which was an 18 per cent reduction.  <H5>  Finances and Prices </H5>   Disbalanced finances were an important aspect of Ukraine's  total economic crisis. The state budget's deficit reached 8.6  trillion krb. [karbovantses]. Monetary emission totalled 10.8  trillion krb. in the first quarter of 1994, which was 36 times  the 1993 figure.    Happily enough, inflation rates decelerated from month to  month with January's rate of 119 per cent, February's rate of  112.6 per cent and March's rate of 105.7 per cent.    Overall price growths in the first quarter of 1994 averaged  1.4 times versus 2.7 times in 1993's 1st quarter. It should be  noted that averaged food price growths were not as great as  those for manufactured goods and paid services. The latter  category's price growths were twofold, as compared with food  prices.    Prices for meat, butter, eggs, citrus fruits even lowered,  though other fruits and vegetables became even more expensive.    Children's wear, footwear, books, newspapers,  pharmaceuticals  and office equipment were particularly affected by price hikes.    Transportation services topped the list of most  price-hike-affected paid services, primarily due to  significantly raised prices for passenger carriage by rail and  air (by 2.8 times), followed by health resort and recreational  services and barber and beauty parlor services.    As of early January, Ukraine's unemployment rate averaged  0.29 per cent of the able-bodied adult population.    Relief per jobless individual averaged 169,000 krb. in March  versus 100,000 krb. in January.    Ukraine's population was estimated at 52.1 million, as of 1  April 1994. The number of deaths exceeded that of births by  75,000 in the first quarter.  <H5>  Consumer Goods Production </H5>   Consumer goods production reduced by 39 per cent to total 55  trillion krb., of which over 45 per cent were contributed by  enterprises under the State Committee for food industry and the  Ministry of Agriculture and Foodstuffs, which were followed by  enterprises under the State Committee for light and textile  industries (almost 20 per cent of the sum total).</p>

			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / European Property 2: Pace of change will accelerate - Trade barriers / It will be years before uniformity is possible in the European property network OPERATING in Europe is so old hat to the property professionals that they will barely lift their heads at the passing of '1992'. Surveyors Weatherall Green &amp; Smith, for example, opened their first office in continental Europe  -in Paris - in 1964. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s a string of branches and subsidiaries was laid down across Europe, and the process has not stopped. Last year saw Amsterdam added to the network. Last month, the company moved into Unter den Linden in East Berlin, the sixth Weatherall branch in Germany since the firm opened its first in Frankfurt in 1973. All the leading firms of surveyors have similar networks, developed over the past 25 years or so and constantly evolving. Some - such as Jones Lang Wootton and Richard Ellis - have followed the same path as Weatherall, establishing their own operations. Mr Dick Grillo, head of Weatherall's Amsterdam office, says: 'We hire nationals wherever we go, but the senior partner is usually British. Where we find we are excluded as foreigners from some part of the business or we need a local licence, we hire someone with the qualification or sub contract. It's not a problem.' Others, however, have gone a different route, building up correspondent relationships with existing local agencies in each location. Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks, for example, are internationally known for their links with Zadelhof in Germany and Jean Thouard in France. Hillier Parker has one of the most extensive and formal of these correspondent networks: its International Commercial Property Associates' Network (begun in 1980) is now a virtual mini EC, with 12 members, 40 offices across Europe and 1,400 staff. Mr David Gore, Hillier Parker's international partner, concedes that each route has its advantages and disadvantages. In the 1960s, Hillier Parker had its own operations in France and Holland but during the 1970s it began to believe it could make the best of local expertise through an exclusive link with one local agent per country. 'That way we have both local knowledge and an international overview.' The first correspondent relationship - with Jean Claude Bourdais in France - has given Hillier Parker access to 400 staff in a dozen provincial French locations as well as central Paris and La Defense. In Germany, the correspondent is Dr Aengevelt who has offices in Frankfurt, Dusseldorf, Berlin, Stuttgart and Hamburg. Where the local correspondent agency does not pursue certain types of business - such as in Switzerland where the local partner excludes shopping centres from his range - Hillier Parker may intervene directly on behalf of the client. But the general principle is that the local agent carries out all the work for clients introduced by the British firm to the client's formula. And vice versa in Britain. The advantage to the client is that it can tap local knowledge while retaining consistency. 'And for multi-nationals,' says Mr Gore, 'consistency is everything. Markets, however, are about 'feel' which you only get in the market.' Established firms are, therefore, perfectly comfortable with their networks and their ability to cope with different regional ways of operating. But newcomers and clients remain sensitive to just how wide the differences are. Mr Grillo is unperturbed by Dutch regulations which insist that only a makelaar-taxateur can carry out a valuation for bank lending; his firm has members of the Dutch association of makelaars on its staff. A multinational wanting to set up in the Netherlands would be stumped. This is the issue currently being addressed by the second EC directive on the recognition of qualifications. A first attempt to persuade EC countries to recognise qualifications obtained elsewhere in the Community foundered on French hostility to the lowest common denominator principle which produced a standard they regarded as unacceptably below the French Loi Hoguet conditions for obtaining a carte professionelle. Even this second directive is running into regional professional jealousies, however, and only a handful of countries have so far implemented it. As we went to press the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (the designated authority for recognising most property-related qualifications) was awaiting proposals, based on that directive, to enable continental European professionals to operate in the UK without having to take the whole RICS qualification course. So far only the UK, Ireland, Denmark and Spain have implemented the qualifications directive, even in these broad terms. Harmonisation of fundamental practices in the property field is even less advanced. In fact, property per se is specifically exempted from the 1992 Single Market programme, so wide are the discrepancies between the Napoleonic Code, Roman Law and British Law on which local practices are based. One particularly thorny issue is the question of valuing properties in Germany where there is no central body responsible for setting valuation standards. As a result, Germany remains out of line with the other main markets such as the UK, France and Italy. Under German government guidelines from the mid-1970s, market value is determined to lie between so-called intrinsic and investment value. Investment value splits the income between the site (in perpetuity) and the building (over its economic life). Intrinsic value is a combination of the value of the site and the depreciated replacement cost of the building. This tends to overvalue buildings in secondary and tertiary locations at the expense of those in prime spots. It also prevents agents valuing reversions in a country which combines rents indexed to low inflation with a rising real property market. Over the past 25 years, cross-border demand for property in Europe has effected only minor changes in different local practices such as this. The pace of change will undoubtedly increase with the expansion of demand generated by the Single Market but it will be many years before uniformity is possible in the European real estate infrastructure. Until then, entrepreneurs and executives will need their hands held by professional advisers who combine deep local experience with an international breadth of view.</p>

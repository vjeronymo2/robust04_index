			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Henri Konan Bedie yesterday received  several foreign personalities, including OAU Secretary General  Salim Ahmed Salim and Sierra Leone Foreign Minister Abbas Bundu.  Doukoure Amadou reports:    [Begin recording] [Amadou] It was the former executive  secretary of the Economic Community of West African States  [ECOWAS] and presently foreign minister of his country, Sierra  Leone, who was the last foreign personality to bid farewell to  President Henri Konan Bedie yesterday at 2100. After the  audience, Abbas Bundu stated that he had been sent by Captain  Valentine Strasser to attend late President Houphouet-Boigny's  funeral and then congratulate President Henri Konan Bedie on his  assumption of office of president.    [Bundu, in English fading into French translation] First and  foremost, I was asked by my head of state, Capt. Valentine  Strasser, to bring greetings to His Excellency President Bedie,  to renew the felicitations conveyed to him on his assumption of  the office of president of this great country. My president  also asked me to convey to the government and people of Cote  d'Ivoire, the condolences of the government and people of Sierra  Leone on the death of Houphouet-Boigny. The Sierra Leonean  people join the Ivorian people in sharing the pain inflicted by  the death of the late president. I was also charged with  informing the president concerning what is happening in the  subregion. Last November, the war had almost ended in Sierra  Leone, so the government decided to decree a unilateral  cease-fire and grant amnesty to the rebels.    Thus, a cease fire came into effect on 1 December, which was  to last 30 days. Unfortunately, instead of a reduction in the  war effort, the war intensified. The rebels took the  opportunity to replenish and strengthen their positions by  receiving arms from Charles Taylor of Liberia.    [Amadou] A few hours earlier, President Henri Konan Bedie  had granted another audience, this one with the secretary  general of the OAU. President Bedie discussed the upcoming OAU  summit, which will take place in Tunis in June, with Salim Ahmed  Salim.    [Salim, in English fading into French translation] The  president and myself discussed the heritage left by President  Houphouet-Boigny, not only to Cote d'Ivoire, but also to Africa  as a whole and the possibility of continuing this struggle which  President Houphouet began -- the struggle to improve the  continent's economic situation, the fight to resolve conflicts  in Africa, and the fight to maintain the dignity of our people.    [Amadou] Is there already an idea of the major issues to be  discussed at the Tunis summit?    [Salim] By the time of the summit, the elections scheduled  for South Africa will have already taken place. So there willl  be a new government in South Africa and it is most likely that  South Africa will become a member of the continental  organization at this summit. So the issue of decolonization and  apartheid in Africa will be over.    We shall then have to focus attention on issues of economic  development, economic integration, and issues relating to the  African Economic Community. We shall discuss what should be  done concerning inter-African cooperation, subregional  cooperation, and also we shall discuss the issues of stability  and security -- since we cannot speak of economic development  within an environment of chaos and anarchy.    [Amadou] Both audiences took place in the presence of the  Ivorian Foreign Minister Amara Essy. [end recording]</p>

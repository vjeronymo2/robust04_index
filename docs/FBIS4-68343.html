			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by K. Dushenov, press secretary to Ioann, </F> metropolitan of St. Petersburg and Ladoga: "Warning in Informant  Report-Style"]    [Text] Well, gentlemen, say what you wish, but there is no  greater torment for an intelligent man than feeling that he has  not fulfilled his civic duty, which compels him to report to  high superiors--immediately and in detail--all the shortcomings  and (God forbid!) seditious inclinations of his compatriots that  he may have noted. It must have been this noble feeling that  moved Mr. Gleb Yakunin recently to write an open letter to the  president, which was published by NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on 12  April of this year.    All jokes aside, though! In the letter, written in the genre  of a frankly shameless informant report, the author urges the  president to initiate administrative and criminal proceedings  against the highest hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church.  "The patriarch," according to Mr. Yakunin, "covers up  anticonstitutional activities... of pseudo-Orthodox  chauvinists," while "the agreement signed by Patriarch Aleksiy  II and Minister of Defense P.S. Grachev may potentially result"  in "fascist ideology penetrating the Russian army."    Metropolitan Kirill, chairman of the External Church  Relations Department, was attacked by Yakunin for having dared  to send SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA editors a letter containing the  "seditious" phrase that he is "ready to work together for the  good of our Fatherland and the Russian people." "The  patriarchy," Yakunin draws the conclusion, "through Metropolitan  Kirill officially announced its solidarity with the  national-communist opposition."    But the famous democrat reserved the most vicious slanderous  attacks for the Most Reverend Ioann, metropolitan of St.  Petersburg and Ladoga. The author of the denunciation accuses  him of "preaching anti-Semitism and inflaming religious strife  and enmity between peoples," and openly urges criminal  proceedings against the most authoritative Russian archbishop  under the famous Article 74 of the RSFSR Criminal Code.  (Footnote 1) ("Congratulations, citizen, you lied," one famous  literary character used to say in such situations.)    What is the reason, however, for Mr. Yakunin's unstoppable  rage of denunciation? It turns out that on 22 March 1994 a RUS  PRAVOSLAVNAYA newspaper insert devoted its issue to discussion  of the "forbidden" Jewish question. The key material in that  issue was an article by His Eminence Ioann "Creators of  Cataclysms," in which he answered questions and letters from  readers, including foreign ones. Urging, by the way, that  discussion of this topic be approached "without hatred and  bitterness," "without preconceived conclusions," and without  pinning insulting and unfounded labels onto opponents.  Unfortunately, as the material in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA shows,  this appeal went unheeded.    Keeping in mind G.P. Yakunin's origins, we understand his  interest in discussing the Jewish topic. Moreover, we share his  concern in the part that incompetent consideration of this  issue, as well as hushing it up without good reason, may be  fraught with negative consequences for Russia's sociopolitical  life. It is unclear, however, why at the same time some  politicians persistently try to suppress public, pluralistic,  comprehensive, and interested debate of this burning and topical  problem.    Against the background of the unprecedented groundless  stream  of accusations dumped on Metropolitan Ioann, permit us to pose a  few questions to Mr. Yakunin as well. Such as:    --Why does any attempt on the part of the public to touch on  the "forbidden" topic and begin constructive discussion of it  cause a hysterical reaction on the part of the groveling press?    --Why does the unwritten "double standard" permit, for  instance, Svanidze to feed with impunity the fruits of his  wounded ethnic pride to multimillion television audiences--such  as vulgar concoctions regarding "Zhirinovskiy the Jew"--while at  the same time suppressing all attempts on the part of  "outsiders" to discuss the Jewish question at a serious  scientific-historic and moral-religious level instead of a  kitchen-provincial one?    --Why is the mean and unfounded lie of "Russian  anti-Semitism," "Russian chauvinism," and "Russian imperialism"  being spread so willingly by "democratic" mass media, while the  slandered and plundered Russia is sliding deeper and deeper into  the abyss of public chaos?    One can ask many more such questions. Judging by all signs,  neither the "democratic public" nor the powers that be  apparently have any intention of answering them. On the other  hand, there is still hope that the Russian people, awakening  from decades of atheistic and cosmopolitan haze, will figure out  on their own who is their enemy and who is their friend; who is  a loving--albeit strict--shepherd, and who is a provocateur and  a liar.    As to Mr. Yakunin's exhortations to put Metropolitan Ioann  on  trial, they truly are superb!    In conclusion we cannot refrain from the pleasure of quoting  two excerpts which shed an especially clear light on Mr.  Yakunin's complete theological and political incompetency. The  first belongs to the holy saint John Chrysostom, to this day  revered by the entire Universal Church (even Catholics) as one  of the pillars of the Divine Truth.    "A synagogue is a thieves' den and a lair of beasts," this  holy man said 1,500 years ago (should we perhaps put him on  trial, too, under Article 74?). "Demons inhabit it, and not only  this place but also the very souls of Hebrews. Should we not  avert ourselves from them as a universal disease and a sore for  the entire universe? Is there any evil they have not committed?  Is there a villainy or lawlessness that has not been surpassed  by their infamous murders?... What should amaze us in them the  most? Their dishonesty, or their cruelty and inhumanity?... If  someone killed your son, tell me, would you be able to look at  such person, to listen to him talk? The Jews killed the Son of  your Lord, and you dare to hold court with them in one and the  same place?"    The second quote belongs to Henry Kissinger, the famous  American politician of Jewish origin. "Anybody who has at least  minimally seriously studied Russian history," he said recently,  "knows that it was Russian nationalism that always ensured the  integrity of the country and helped it deal with numerous  enemies and troubles. Now the Russians have lost the huge empire  they built. Could anyone expect a different reaction to this  humiliation other than an explosion of nationalism? I see  Russian nationalism as simply a reality of Russian life, which  we should accept the way it is..."    Very valuable advice for everyone who, like G.P. Yakunin, is  blinded by hatred toward the Russian people and the Orthodox  Church.</p>

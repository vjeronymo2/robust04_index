			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Reformer to lead Armenia ARMENIA'S president yesterday replaced his prime minister with a young economist who pioneered land privatisation in the former Soviet republic, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow. President Levon Ter-Petrosian said he had sacked outgoing premier Mr Khosrov Arutunian for a 'gross breach of etiquette' in criticising parts of his own economic reform programme. His successor, Mr Grant Bagratian, previously deputy prime minister, had quarrelled bitterly with Mr Arutunian, who wanted the state to have greater control over economic reforms. The change of government comes as Armenia is reduced to begging for electricity from its neighbours, including Turkey, its historical enemy. The landlocked republic, starved of natural resources and at war with Azerbaijan, fears energy shortages could lead to a breakdown of law and order. Its last source of fuel - a pipeline from war-torn Georgia - was blown up last week. Its nuclear power station has been closed since a 1988 earthquake.</p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: European steel The main problem with the European Commission's rationalisation plans for the steel industry was timing. The moment to cut capacity is when an industry heads into recession, not when it is clambering back to profitability. No management will cut capacity when its plants, however inefficient, are set to generate cash. Even so, the Commission's failure to tackle the industry's structural overcapacity will have a long-term cost. The pain during the next trough is likely to be that much worse. Continuing excess capacity will once again drive prices so low that steelmakers will be unable to cover their fixed costs. But next time the sector will find it more difficult to export its way out of trouble, particularly to the US where manufacturers appear increasingly competitive. It will also need to cope with imports from eastern European suppliers which should have sorted out their difficulties by then. If Europe's industry is ever to become self-supporting and provide a decent return on capital, the Commission will have to reject demands for state subsidies next time round. Aid may preserve politically sensitive jobs, but it perpetuates inefficient production and costs huge sums to the tax-payers. Most importantly, subsidies threaten free trade. If Europe's steel industry is to prosper it must export, especially to Asia where growth is strong and capacity shortages exist. Asian doors will be justifiably barred to a subsidised European steel sector.</p>

Starodubtsev: "`Our People' in the Duma"]    [Text] The patriots Nevzorov, Vlasov, Ilyukhin,  Tuleyev, Sevastyanov, Baburin, Isakov, Lemeshev, Romanov,  Zyuganov, Starodubtsev, Lukyanov, Govorukhin, and many more  besides who are prepared to defend the interests of the  motherland at the price of their lives have, according to the  election results, been designated deputies of the State  Duma.  <H5>  Aleksandr Nevzorov: `It Is My Duty To Continue the Struggle' </H5>   [Shurygin] Glebych, our wholehearted congratulations on your  victory! You are now a deputy, a politician. What does this  victory mean to you? How do you view your seat in the new  parliament? Who are you in politics?    [Nevzorov] Well, first of all I am not a "politician" in the  form in which society has become accustomed to seeing him. I am  a journalist, I am a soldier. Primarily a professional of my  occupation. And I intend, accordingly, to concern myself  primarily with my field--television commentary. This is the  arena of struggle for me as a politician. I will fight to ensure  that the television screen cease being a Tampax and Snickers  spokesman for lies and begin to tell people the truth about the  entire depth of the tragedy and crisis in which society has  found itself. About its heroes and criminals. For me the mandate  of deputy is a mandate for hard labor, and I perceive it only as  such.    [Shurygin] How was it that you all of sudden left the  television camera and moved into the role of legitimate  politician?    [Nevzorov] A national tragedy had occurred before our eyes.  The regime in the person of Yeltsin organized the mass killing  of our compatriots. My friends were in the shot-up parliament.  Many of them were wounded, several gave their lives. It is a  matter of honor for me as a man and as a comrade in arms to  carry their struggle against the regime. I entered politics as  reinforcements enter the trenches after fierce fighting. And I  will struggle relentlessly against the killers, looters, and  other scum "resting on the laurels" of the October shooting. Let  them be in no doubt about this.    [Shurygin] What sort of elections were these for you? How  were they conducted? What did you find surprising?    [Nevzorov] I specially let my name go forward for the  central  constituency of St. Petersburg, a constituency considered a  bastion of "democracy." The most affluent Petersburgers live  there. It is an area of offices, fashionable supermarkets, and  privatized apartments. And this was my personal challenge to the  Democratic Russia riff-raff, who had nominated a whole cohort of  their candidates. My victory going away--this is my triumph, my  first blow at the murderers, corrupters, and thieves covered by  the mask of "democrats."    I simply proved that, despite the name Nevzorov, which  "liberals" shun like the plague, there are, for all that, still  more of "our people" in society. They are more confident,  stronger, and more active than the "dems." They were "doomed" to  victory!    These elections were more honest and objective than the  previous ones. Having put the "opposition" under a time  constraint with the election campaign, the regime itself found  itself under an organizational time constraint, that is, in  terms of the organization and coordination of these elections.    [Shurygin] Your plans for the immediate future?    [Nevzorov] First of all, to restore "Sekundy." This is not  my  initiative. It is an ultimatum from the electorate. People are  demanding, people are expecting "Sekundy." I intend fighting for  the restoration on LenTV of an atmosphere of real creativity,  not political fawning and the pornography that is flourishing  here today.    [Shurygin] Whose side are you on, Glebych? Who is covering  your rear, who lines up with you?    [Nevzorov] All "our people." My loyal brother Lukyanov,  Starodubtsev, Zhirinovskiy, Zyuganov, and, of course, the  brilliant Aleksandr Prokhanov and his ZAVTRA. I declare,  incidentally, that in accordance with a deputy's right to  monitor the news media, I, on my own initiative, appoint myself  a member of the editorial board of the newspaper ZAVTRA and all  subsequent ones.    Greetings to all!  <H5>  Anatoliy Lukyanov: `The DEN Offensive Is Under Way!' </H5>   I believe that the present elections were not by nature  either democratic or free. I had great doubts before agreeing to  the suggestions that I take part in the elections, but these  were outweighed by the realization that had we shunned these  elections, we would have deprived ourselves of an opportunity to  represent the people's interests not only in the Duma but in  local government also.    I was nominated by the Smolensk Public Assembly. It unites  nonparty people and Communists, people of different  nationalities, veterans, and the youth. It is a broad  organization performing a great deal of patriotic work.    Within a week they had more than twice as many signatures as  were needed, and I was registered as a candidate for deputy. I  drove to practically all districts of Smolensk Oblast. There  were approximately 10,000 persons at the meetings. The mood in  the Smolensk region is diametrically opposite to what it is in  Moscow.    Even in the rural areas, for example, Yeltsin's edict on the  sale of land prompted people to vote against the Constitution  and against the candidates of the Russia's Choice bloc. The  election results are as follows: I obtained 102,000 votes and  was 50,000 votes ahead of my rivals.    The Communists gained second place in Smolensk Oblast as a  whole, Zhirinovskiy coming first. The Constitution was not  supported by the electorate in Smolensk Oblast. It was voted  down by 55 percent of the electorate. This was the general mood,  what is more--both in the city and in rural localities. Very  harsh words were leveled at this Constitution because it was  seen how the individual's existing rights are being abridged,  and there was a very keen awareness of the movement toward  presidential dictatorship.    Speaking of the election results, it seems to me that all  this is logical. People voted not so much for Zhirinovskiy as  against the regime that is being installed in Russia. My views  do not coincide with what Zhirinovskiy says, but this party  expresses the interests of those who keenly sense how  methodically the Russian Empire is being demolished and how an  offensive against the Russian people, against Russian interests,  is under way. Protest in society had matured, and it produced  these results.    The patriotic movement was not represented at the elections.  I believe that, first, everything was done to limit the  participation of the patriotic forces in the elections with the  consent of the authorities and in accordance with their wishes.  The disappearance from the slates of the bloc of Baburin and  other patriotic forces was no accident. With their own hands the  so-called democrats cleared the way for Zhirinovskiy. The  democrats were delighted that Zhirinovskiy, participating in the  constitutional assembly, supported the Constitution and strong  presidential power and, when speaking, distanced himself from  the Communists.    I have spoken about where we part company with Zhirinovskiy,  but the "Demchoice" representative gave him a positive mark. The  "Choicers" calculated that on the main points he would support  both the president and the democrats. They struck, therefore, at  the main opponents--the patriots and Communists. It all turned  out differently. And now they have sensed that the Constitution  could work for Zhirinovskiy also. This is why he has come in for  such a beating in the press.    As far as the Constitution is concerned, I, as a lawyer, can  say with confidence that it has been adopted in defiance of the  referendum statutes. Only one-third of the electorate voted for  the Constitution. One-third of society cannot impose its will on  two-thirds.    It seems to me that the first thing that the opposition  forces in the Duma should do is to return once more to the  question of the Constitution. From my viewpoint, a "pocket duma"  has not resulted. This Duma will be torn by contradictions, and  much will depend on the intelligent, serious formulation of  issues by all blocs. Not counting the centrists, the forces in  the Duma are divided evenly in two. This is a transitional  parliament, which should prepare the ground for real elections.  If this Duma does prepare this ground and adopts the requisite  laws, it will have accomplished its mission.    I dream that one further faction will emerge from among the  independent and single-seat deputies: a patriotic bloc.  According to my calculations, this means about 20 deputies  expressing primarily patriotic views. This faction could, first,  help very considerably the cohesion of healthy forces in the  Duma and, second, bring order to bear in the ranks of the  centrists. This is a serious idea, it needs to be worked on  thoroughly. Yuriy Vlasov, say: With whom will he affiliate? Or  Sergey Baburin, Nevzorov? Such a patriotic faction could help  the work of the Duma very considerably. Newspapers of a  patriotic focus could be the particular spokesman for the  patriotic bloc. Many newspapers, including your DEN, are banned  at this time. You are being published in all cities of  Russia--from Krasnoyarsk to Lipetsk--and even overseas, this is  not the issue. All publications need to be restored.    I believe that one of the first inquiries of the new Duma  will be one concerning the press. It will be raised by many  factions. All the outrages perpetrated by the authorities in  respect to the press--PRAVDA, SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA, DEN,  GLASNOST--were connected with preventing the opposition press  operating before the elections. When I was asked about the  newspaper DEN, I told the electorate that you could ban the  newspaper DEN, but THE DEN OFFENSIVE COULD NOT BE BANNED. DEN  will come, it will unfailingly come, and even if it is today  called ZAVTRA, it will, nonetheless, be that same DEN.    A ban on newspapers is a ban on free thought, it is a fear  of  the opposition. If there is something to set against it, do so.  Fulminating against the so-called "red-browns," the "democrats"  will soon have nothing against which to plead. It would be  boring without DEN!    I myself need to figure out my future actions in the Duma.  There have been many calls and reports in the foreign press  about my alleged nomination for the position of speaker of the  Duma. The best speaker in Europe in 1991 could, it is said, pass  on his entire experience to the young Duma. I treat these rumors  with composure and warily even. We need first to decide the  question of the powers of deputies of the Duma, mine included,  and only then decide the question of leadership of the house.    I do not envy the speaker of our Duma from any party, the  Communist Party included. It will be necessary for him, and this  would be particularly difficult for me, to be in contact with  the people who have unlawfully been oppressing everyone. It  will, after all, be necessary to shake the president's hand. How  could I do this? An Italian newspaper has already decided  everything for us, appointed and elected everyone. Although I  could, of course, teach many people about organization of the  business of the Duma, work with the opposition, and the patience  that a speaker should possess.    What would I submit to the first session of the Duma? My  first wish would be for a cardinal change in government policy.  The formation of a government which can serve the interests of  the whole people and cancel the "shock therapy."  <H5>  Vasiliy Starodubtsev: `They Can Be Moved, Apparently...' </H5>   I considered these elections illegal, but entered the fray  with the desire to have at least this platform because I could  not remain silent. I did not expect that the defeat of Russia's  Choice and the other democratic blocs would be so devastating.  They can be moved, apparently. You just have to vote against  them.    Ten percent of Russians voted for the Agrarian Party. We  could have amassed 20 percent had the election campaign been  better organized. I myself was elected to the Federation Council  for the 71st Two-Seat District at home, in Tver Oblast, since I  could not leave the farm for permanent work in the State Duma.  But I will, I believe, be an active participant in the affairs  of our faction in the State Duma also. Our coalition with the  Communists is the most pressing. We will extend a hand to all  factions that agree with our two priorities: the first, halting  the decline in production and averting the closure of factories  and plants at any price; the second, saving the agrarian  complex, saving the countryside: without this Russia will die  from starvation, reforms indeed!    As far as the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia faction is  concerned, it will, I believe, prove heterogeneous and  amorphous. Whatever the attempts to embroil it with the  Communists or with us, there will, I am sure, be people there  nonetheless who sincerely ache for Russia, not for the sake of  political buffoonery. I am inclined to believe about  Zhirinovskiy himself that he is a Trojan Horse inserted in the  Kremlin to be the trump card in the hidden struggle of Kremlin  political clans. His promises are buttressed by nothing, his  populism is dangerous, and his foreign policy ambitions are  provocative. The final results have not yet been tallied, for  that matter, and we do not yet know who will get how many seats.</p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Jobs: Dismal market still offers some hope of upturn from bottom towards end of year - Executive demand plummets to record low 'OH TO be in England now that April's there.' If the poet Browning were alive today, and happened to be a job-seeking manager, those famous words would not have been called forth by the beauties of brush-wood sheafs, elm-tree boles and what not. He'd have written them simply out of relief that January, February and March are over. Never in the 32 years the MSL International consultancy has been keeping count of executive jobs advertised in leading British journals, has a first quarter's demand plumbed such depths. The handiest indicator of the drop is MSL's index standardised on 1959 market levels as 100. The figure for the three months just ended was 79. The previous lowest for a January-March period - which normally sees the best demand in the calendar year - was the 93 recorded two recessions back in 1976. More recent comparisons are summarised in the table alongside giving the tallies for the past five 12-monthly periods ended on March 31. The figures represent specific jobs, each that comes on the market counting as one no matter how many times it is advertised. The quarter-by-quarter results are shown by the four bottom lines. As may be seen, the last three quarters have successively produced the lowest tallies since 1986, the one for January-March being not much more than half the count for the first quarter of 1990. The upper part of the table gives the whole 12-monthly periods' figures, breaking them down into eight kinds of managerial and upper ranked specialist work ('others' include people such as buyers, economists, company legal staff and variegated consultants). Suffice it to say that not since 1988-89 has any of the eight shown an improvement on the previous 12-monthly tally, the only one with a single-digit percentage fall in 1990-91 being the more senior general management group. There is similarly gloomy news, too, in the consultancy's separate counts of jobs advertised by four broad industries. In the latest 12 months, high-technology companies offered 1,743 posts, down by almost 23 per cent on 1989-90 and by nearly 57 per cent from the 4,009 peak the year before. Retailing's 647 tally was a good 25 per cent down on 1989-90, and 45 per cent on its best of 1,185 in 1986-87. Food, drink and tobacco businesses advertised 687 jobs, a drop of almost 17 per cent from the previous 12 months and 38 per cent fewer than the 1986-87 peak of 1,185. Energy and related companies were mercifully a bit different. True, their latest 2,361 count was down by towards 15 per cent from the previous period, and by 36 per cent from the highest of 3,709 in 1985-86. But at least the most recent figure isn't the industry's worst. Indeed, it is no less than 96 per cent above the miserable 1,204 of 1986-87. The only other good news that lurks in the figures is also of the 'has been worse' kind, and does not show up in the table. Leaving aside the 12-monthly results for the eight categories, and focusing on their quarterly results, I can see two brighter spots. In both cases the January-March tallies, unlike those for the rest of the categories, edged up on the October-December counts. One was general management, with an 11.2 per cent improvement on the final quarter of last year. But it is the other, smaller gain of only 5.3 per cent that I trust is the more significant. For one thing, it is the second improvement of sorts in successive quarters. For another, it is in the marketing and sales group which, since 1959, has usually proved a lead indicator of movements in the executive market as a whole. So there is at least some ground for hope that overall demand will begin to move up from its 32-year nadir in this year's final quarter, if not before. W HICH said, and jobs being scarce, I will turn to two on offer. In each case the headhunters are unable to name the employer, and promise to honour applicants' requests not to be identified to their clients at this stage. New York is the base of the first, being offered by Theo Stegers of Recruitment Matters (15 Great Eastern St, London EC2A 3EJ; tel 071-377 1600, fax 071-377 1801). He seeks a manager for the Dollars 40m-turnover American arm of a British company in business conferences, publishing and exhibitions. Candidates need marketing skills, especially direct mail, besides success in profitably running an operation of at least a broadly comparable kind. Salary around Dollars 250,000. Rest negotiable. Conversely, the second recruit will work for an American group but be based west of London. The job is to manage the executive-selection and assessment activities of a consultancy in management training and development, and is offered through Alan Rundle of Rundle Brownswood, 17 London End, Beaconsfield, Bucks HP9 2HN; tel 0494 676264, fax 0494 670283. Although candidates must be occupational psychologists, they also need to be proven business-generators and skilled all-round communicators with the ability to plan as well as motivate the efforts of a small team. Salary plus incentive bonus around Pounds 40,000. Perks include car of BMW 520i standard.</p>

			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Plateau clarifies suspension request Plateau Mining said that it had requested suspension of its shares on August 6 because it was unable to pay the deferred consideration for Quay Minerals. It is now selling Quay to Glaveport, controlled by Mr James Clark and Mr Owen Eastwood, two of the original vendors. Plateau will then have net assets of less than half the nominal value of its called up share capital and will call an extraordinary meeting. For the six months to March 31 Plateau's pre-tax losses were Pounds 10.5m (Pounds 53,000 profits), after Pounds 9.9m mineral property and related assets provisions.</p>

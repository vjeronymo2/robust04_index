			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Survey of Cardiff Bay and the Barrage (11): Fit for the 21st century - Art for the people FROM THE day he was appointed chairman of the development corporation, Sir Geoffrey Inkin was determined the whole development should not just be about bricks and mortar. He was conscious of the effect such a massive scheme would have on the people already living in Cardiff's docklands. He was also aware of the need to contribute aesthetically to the environment, to produce something that would not only work but would also look good. The corporation would lay down the framework, by attracting the best architects from around the world to design new roads, offices and housing in an imaginative way. But it was essential for him, not only that the buildings themselves should contribute to the overall concept of the new Cardiff, but that public art should add to the feeling that this was a city fit for the 21st century. 'Art in public places is for the enjoyment of the people,' Inkin says. 'It helps create environments which are humane, entertaining and stimulating. They enhance a sense of identity and the scope for art in public places is now immense.' To monitor the quality of the buildings, the corporation, in one of its first moves, set up in 1988 a fine-arts panel, called rather more prosaically the Design and Architectural Review Panel, to keep an eye on proposed designs. A year later, a public art consultancy team was established to research and develop a strategy for public art and its funding. This was followed, in 1990, by the appointment of Sally Medlyn, who was then with North West Arts, as director of the Cardiff Bay Art Trust. Inkin had been impressed by Per Cent for art, the scheme common in the US and in some European countries such as the Netherlands, by which developers put up to 1 per cent of development costs into works of art. Projects in America showed that sculpture, in particular, was not seen as an addendum to individual buildings but as an integral part of any development. Ms Medlyn's trust has had an immediate impact. Three sculptors, French-born Pierre Vivant, who has studios in Paris and Oxford, Eilis O'Connell, from Ulster, and a Gibraltarian, Francis Gomila, working in Smethwick in conjunction with an English architect, Ian Ritchie, were the first winners of awards for works to be erected on key sites. Those works were intended to stimulate interest and were funded out of public money. They have been complemented by others undertaken under the Per Cent scheme by Bradenham Developments, Sharpe and Fisher, and Grosvenor Waterside. 'The initial ideal is up and running' says Ms Medlyn. 'Most importantly, artists are being brought in at an early stage. It is too easy to get an artist to produce a work almost as an afterthought after a development has been created. But we are bringing the artist in, in his or her own right, from the start.' Such schemes are not restricted to works of art. Ms Medlyn's small team is also concerned with improving street furniture. Lamp-posts, public seats and serial works, which will draw visitors around a particular feature, are all being attended to. The most imaginative scheme was unveiled in March, when South Wales Electricity came up with a plan to transform an ugly sub-station into a futuristic creation. Mr Wynford Evans, chairman of the electricity company, says the Pounds 5m scheme will transform the station, which will be the powerhouse of the bay's electricity system, into a building fit to grace the rest of the developments within the bay. 'We presented plans for the new sub station to artists and asked them how they would treat a piece of modern technology in such a way that it would produce minimum environmental intrusion,' says Evans. 'We selected John Gingell, a Welsh artist, who worked with our engineers to produce a strong primary-coloured scheme which will include enormous sculptures symbolising energy and power. The focal point is a 60ft light tower, which will draw attention to the bay by night and day, and the result of the whole redesign is immensely exciting.' The challenge is not just to put up works of art, Ms Medlyn says, but to create places where people can derive pleasure, whether working or visiting Cardiff Bay. Success still needs to be worked at, though. Wales is not a country with a strong architectural heritage, and until NCM published the design for its new headquarters, next to the site set aside for the opera house, there was little evidence of distinctive architecture within the Bay. Architects Holder Mathias Alcock attractively converted an old building for their own use, and the two remaining Victorian buildings within the area were sympathetically turned into flats and a hotel. Elsewhere, there has been little evidence that the design panel has had a great deal of success. Everyone concerned with Cardiff Bay needs to be aware of how much remains to be done before they can be fully satisfied.</p>

			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THEATER VS. STREETS  </P> <P> Re: Story on "Fullerton OK's $4.7 Million for Theater Parking."  </P> <P> Fullerton City Council members (Don Bankhead, A.B. (Buck) Catlin, Molly  McClanahan and Chris Norby) are spending $4.7 million for a parking structure  for the Fox Fullerton Theatre.  </P> <P> Forgotten is the other taxpayer garage on Wilshire -- empty most of the time. I  was surprised to read that $1.1 million has already been spent on the theater.  This should certainly improve the market value when the theater is sold.  </P> <P> Rather than spending money on projects the savings and loan industry wouldn't  touch, the council members should find the means to improve Fullerton's street  lighting and roads.  </P> <P> TED DWYER  </P> <P> Fullerton  </P></p>

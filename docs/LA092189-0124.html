			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STUDIES FIND DANGERS IN EXTENDED-WEAR CONTACTS  </P> <P> Extended-wear contact lenses, introduced nine years ago and now worn by 4  million Americans, are more than 10 times as likely as other kinds of lenses to  cause serious eye inflammations that can lead to blindness, according to  studies published today in the New England Journal of Medicine.  </P> <P> Scientists have long suspected that the more hours a day patients wear contact  lenses, the greater the risk to their eyes, even when the lenses are prescribed  for extended use. But the New England Journal studies -- sponsored by the major  manufacturers of contact lenses and conducted by researchers at Harvard Medical  School and the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary -- are the first to document  the extent of the danger facing those who wear soft contact lenses overnight or  longer. Those users make up about one-fifth of all contact lens wearers.  </P> <P> "The risk of serious eye damage with any lens is minuscule -- only two-tenths  of 1%," said Barbara Kelley, director of public affairs for Bausch &amp; Lomb,  the nation's largest manufacturer of contact lenses and one of the members of  the Contact Lens Institute, which sponsored the study.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Kelley said, the risk was already perceived as being significant  enough that Bausch &amp; Lomb began in April telling users of its extended-wear  lenses to limit wearing time to no more than seven days, after which lenses  must be removed and cleaned according to manufacturer's directions.  </P> <P> In May, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in anticipation of the  publication of the New England Journal study, advised all contact lens  manufacturers to inform patients that a previous 30-day limit on wearing time  should be reduced immediately to seven days.  </P> <P> The studies documented what is considered the worst hazard of contact-lens wear  -- scratching or abrasion of the cornea that can lead to ulceration, which if  untreated could cause permanent damage and even blindness. Precisely what  causes the increased risk of eye damage in patients who wear lenses for long  periods is not clear, according to the Massachusetts researchers.  </P> <P> One theory is that lenses worn around-the-clock result in hypoxia, or a  decreased supply of oxygen to the cells of the cornea, which in turn makes the  cornea more susceptible to abrasion and infection. Another theory is that  extended wear -- especially if the lenses are not cleaned regularly --  increases the opportunity for growth of bacteria, which can endanger the health  of the eye.  </P> <P> People who put lenses in their eyes and leave them there are being "seduced by  the convenience . . . and simply don't take care of their lenses," said David  Krasnow, a Santa Monica optometrist who specializes in fitting contact lenses.  </P> <P> Indeed, the Massachusetts researchers found in a survey of ophthalmologists in  five New England states and in a detailed study of 99 patients with corneal  ulcers, that the overall level of lens care among both patients and control  subjects was "alarmingly low."  </P> <P> "It is estimated," the editors of the New England Journal said in an editorial,  "that 50% of those who wear contact lenses care for them unhygienically." They  don't clean the lenses as prescribed. They allow mold to grow on their cleaning  equipment. They pop the lenses into their mouths to wet them.  </P> <P> One of the reasons for poor compliance with lens-care regimens, especially  among extended-wear lens users, the editors said, is that there has been too  little consumer education. Manufacturers have "overemphasized the convenient  and carefree aspects of using overnight lenses. . . . The trivializing of  contact lenses led one prominent ophthalmologist to say: 'We are not buying  panty hose here. This is a medical device.' "  </P> <P> Contact lenses were introduced on the market in the 1940s as hard,  uncomfortable glass disks about the size of a quarter. Today, contacts are  about the size of a fingernail. They are made of a variety of plastic products  and are worn by about 7% of the U.S. population. The safest are thought to be  those that are made of hard plastic or gas-permeable rigid plastic, but they  are also the most uncomfortable.  </P> <P> By far the easiest to wear, although the most complicated to care for, are soft  lenses, introduced in 1971 and made from a variety of porous, liquid-absorbing  plastics. Extended-wear soft lenses were introduced in 1981 and disposable  extended-wear lenses were introduced last year.  </P> <P> Each type of lens has advantages and disadvantages for correcting specific  vision problems and for preferences and life styles of individual patients, but  some eye-care specialists have become alarmed enough by the risks associated  with extended-wear lenses that they have become less eager to prescribe them.  </P> <P> According to the studies, about two in every 10,000 people who wear standard  hard contacts will get an abrasion on the cornea that leads to an inflamed  ulcer. For those who wear gas-permeable hard lenses and those who wear soft  lenses and remove them every night, the risk is about four in 10,000. But for  those who wear contacts around-the-clock, the risk jumps to 21 in 10,000.  </P> <P> The researchers found that the longer patients wore their lenses, the greater  their risk of problems. But the studies did not distinguish risk rates among  different brands or types of extended-wear contacts. Some eye-care specialists  are hopeful that extended-wear lenses that are disposable will have fewer risks  because they do not require chemicals to clean and do not build up substances  that may be implicated in serious hazards to the eye.  </P> <P> Months before the results of the New England Journal studies were made public,  ophthalmologists at the Emory University Medical School eye clinic in Atlanta  said they had stopped dispensing extended-wear contacts, even though they had  been early enthusiasts for the lenses.  </P> <P> "Most people who wear contact lenses are unaware of the more serious risks  associated with them," the editors of the New England Journal said. The  chemicals used to manufacture them and disinfect them can cause allergic  reactions. Dirt and grit that work their way under the lens cause scratches and  scarring of the eye.  </P> <P> "However, the most dreaded complication is microbial ulcerative keratitis or  corneal ulcer, caused by bacterial invasion of the cornea. Left untreated, this  infection can quickly advance and destroy the corneal stroma, resulting in  corneal perforation and even loss of vision," the editors said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> RISKS LINKED TO SOFT CONTACTS  </P> <P> Contact lenses float on a layer of tears over the cornea, a raised strip of  transparent tissue covering the colored iris and pupil. The smaller contact  lens, which covers only part of the cornea, is known as a rigid or hard lens  and is worn by about one-third of the 20 million Americans who wear contact  lenses. The larger lens, which covers the cornea plus a small portion of the  sclera, or white of the eye, is a soft lens. About 11 million Americans wear  soft lenses that they remove daily. But another 4 million wear soft lenses  specially designed to be left in the eye for up to seven days at a time -- and  it is this group that appears to be at greater risk of corneal ulceration.  Depending on the kind of extended-wear lens, it is either sterilized and put  back in the eye or replaced with a new disposable lens.  </P></p>

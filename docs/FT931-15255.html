			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Poll pact for French opposition FRANCE'S two main right-wing opposition parties yesterday settled two months' tough negotiations by agreeing to field joint candidates in 460 of the 577 constituencies represented in the National Assembly in next month's parliamentary elections, writes William Dawkins from Paris. Of the remaining 117 constituencies, the Gaullist RPR and centre-right UDF will send rival parliamentary candidates to contest 84 seats, Mr Alain Juppe, RPR secretary-general, said. They have not yet decided how to organise their forces in the remaining 33 constituencies. Initially, the right had hoped to limit to 50 the number of constituencies in which the UDF and RPR would fight each other, but internal rivalries pushed that number higher. 'There will be a single candidate in 85 per cent of constituencies and organised duels in 15 per cent,' said Mr Juppe, calling the accord a success. Recent polls suggest the right would win a landslide 400 seats in the assembly. The election will have two rounds of single-candidate majority voting on March 21 and 28.</p>

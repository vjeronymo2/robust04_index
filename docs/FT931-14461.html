			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / German politicians warn of budget cuts THE SLOWDOWN in the German economy will mean an 'inevitable' increase in the government's net borrowing requirement, as well as drastic savings through cuts in tax allowances and reduced social spending, members of the ruling coalition warned yesterday. They hope to finalise plans for a substantial savings package, as part of the wider negotiations for a 'solidarity pact' to finance German unification, in top-level talks today. It is expected to include the introduction of strict means tests to limit social payments, such as children's allowances, to the poorest, and a possible halving in the tax benefits available for home-buyers. It will also attempt to limit the payment of unemployment benefit, to ensure that the dole does not exceed wages available for those still in work. The possibility of substantial cuts in social payments has aroused the anger of the opposition Social Democrats (SPD). If the package is rejected by the SPD, the government will still press ahead and attempt to reach broad agreement with the trade unions and the governments of the 16 federal Lander, according to leaders of the coalition. Both Mr Otto Lambsdorff, leader of the Free Democrats (FDP), the minority party in the coalition, and Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister and leader of the Christian Social Union (CSU), sister party of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU), took a hard line on the negotiations yesterday. Mr Lambsdorff said that there was a forecast shortfall in tax revenues for the 1993 budget of DM5bn (Pounds 2bn), and an increased subsidy of a further DM5bn needed for the Federal Labour Office - which pays unemployment benefit  -as a result of the economic downturn. A further DM1.5bn had been promised to Russia, partly for the accelerated withdrawal of troops from eastern Germany, DM1.5bn for reintroduction of investment allowances in east Germany, and DM4bn as direct federal subsidies for the eastern Lander. That would make a total shortfall of some DM17bn, and Mr Lambsdorff said the coalition partners 'still have to find another DM2bn or DM3bn'. Mr Waigel said in Munich that social payments, including allowances for children and new infants, would be subjected to stricter means testing, as one way of cutting the budget burden in a socially balanced way - to meet the demands of the SPD. However, both he and Mr Lambsdorff said that the coalition would press ahead with the savings package, even if the SPD does not agree. Foreign companies seeking to invest in east Germany widely believe they suffer discrimination compared with indigenous groups, according to a report* published today, writes David Marsh. The report, from the Anglo-German Foundation for the Study of Industrial Society, says foreign companies can overcome this handicap by emphasising the competitive advantages of foreign investment in the east. Foreign companies have made up about 10 per cent of investment channeled to east German through privatisation of state industry holdings since reunification. *British investment in a united Germany.

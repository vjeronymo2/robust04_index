			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REGISTERING TO VOTE  </P> <P> In the Alpha Beta supermarket in Irvine on April 14, a hot, bright California  day, a fraud was committed in the guise of civic service. Two young women armed  with a load of forms were approaching people and asking if said people were  registered to vote.  </P> <P> If not, here was a simple, expedient voter registration process.  </P> <P> How wonderful! How truly innovative and helpful! I was foolishly going to go to  a town hall to register, but this was so convenient.  </P> <P> So many things are run differently here than in Connecticut that I assumed and  was assured by the young women that I was registering to vote. I was most eager  to participate in the primary, so I listed my party preference.  </P> <P> Then, to my chagrin, on June 5, another hot, bright California day and primary  voting day, cheerfully I dressed to go exercise my rights as an American  citizen. At the polling place, there was no record of my being a registered  voter.  </P> <P> I called the registrar of voters. "Why didn't you call when you did not receive  your confirmation in the mail?"  </P> <P> Why? Because in the 20 years I've been registering to vote in the other states  I have lived in, I was registered at point of registration. There was no  explanation by the young women at the time I filled out that form that I should  receive mailed confirmation or call the registrar of voters. They, in fact, led  me to believe this was a legitimate procedure.  </P> <P> Maybe they didn't like my party choice. Maybe it was "lost in the mail." Maybe  it should be a felony for political parties to canvass for voter registration  since they might be tempted to circular file some voters. Maybe this method of  registering is not well-conceived.  </P> <P> JOY FRIEDBERG  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal requires dealers to keep and retain specific records of (i) gifts and gratuities subject to paragraph (a) of rule G&hyph;20, and (ii) contracts of employment or agreements for compensation for services, referred to in paragraph (c) of rule G&hyph;20, and compensation paid as a result of those agreements. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  Rule G&hyph;20(a) prohibits dealers from, directly or indirectly, giving or permitting to be given any thing or service of value in excess of $100 per year to any person, other than to an employee or partner of the dealer, in relation to municipal securities activities of the person's employer. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule change also clarifies that dealers complying with Rule 17a&hyph;3 of the Act are required to maintain this information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ``Person'' has been interpreted by the Board in the context of rule G&hyph;20 to apply only to natural persons because the intent of the rule is to discourage dealers from inducing individual employees to act in a manner inconsistent with their obligations to, or contrary to the interests of, their employers.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  MSRB Interpretations,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> MSRB Manual <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  (CCH) &para;3596.10 (March 19, 1980). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The $100 limitation applies to gifts and gratuities by a dealer and its associated persons to customers, individuals associated with issuers, and employees of other dealers. Rule G&hyph;20 also prohibits a dealer from indirectly exceeding the $100 limitation. Thus, if a third party ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , a consultant hired by a dealer) gives a gift to any such person at the request of the dealer, the value of the gift would be included in the $100 limitation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rule G&hyph;20(b) exempts certain gifts from the $100 annual limit. These gifts, called ``normal business dealings,'' include occasional gifts of meals or tickets to theatrical, sporting, and other entertainments, as well as the sponsoring of legitimate business functions that are recognized by the IRS as deductible business expenses, and gifts of reminder advertising. The rule, however, also provides that such gifts cannot be so frequent or so expensive as to raise a suggestion of unethical conduct. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rule G&hyph;20(c) provides that contracts of employment with or compensation for services rendered are not considered gifts or gratuities subject to the $100 limitation. Such arrangements, however, must be in writing and must include the nature of the proposed services, the amount of the proposed compensation, and the written consent of such person's employer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act, and specifically, with Sections 15B(b)(2) (C) and (G) of the Act. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  Section 15B(b)(2)(C) authorizes the MSRB to adopt rules designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating transactions in municipal securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market in municipal securities and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. Section 15B(b)(2)(G) authorizes the MSRB to adopt rules that prescribe the records to be made and kept by municipal securities dealers and the periods for which such records shall be preserved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section 15B(b)(2) (C), (G); [15 U.S.C. 78o&hyph;4(b)(2) (C), (G)]. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rule G&hyph;20 is intended to prevent fraud and inappropriate influence in the municipal securities market by limiting the amount of gifts or gratuities from municipal securities dealers to persons not employed by the dealers, including issuer officials and employees of other dealers, in relation to municipal securities activities. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  Concerns have arisen recently that political contributions and gifts, made by municipal securities underwriters to officials of municipal securities issuers, may influence the selection process of an underwriting syndicate. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  The proposal addresses excessive gifts and gratuities by dealers to persons not employed by the dealer, including officials of municipal securities issuers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Rule G&hyph;20, as well as the proposed amendments, are comparable to the National Association of Securities Dealers' (``NASD'') rules governing gifts and gratuities by registered broker-dealers.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  NASD Rules of Fair Practice, Art. III, Sec. 10,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> NASD Manual  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> &para;2160. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> MSRB rule G&hyph;37, approved by the Commission on April 7, 1994, addressed the use of political contributions made by municipal securities dealers to officials of state or local government issuers, where the dealers also are doing business for or seeking business from those issuers. Rule G&hyph;37 became effective April 25, 1994. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33868 (April 7, 1994), 59 FR 17621. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although rule G&hyph;20 prohibits dealers from making certain gifts and gratuities, dealers currently are not required to keep a record of such gifts. Recordkeeping and record retention by dealers of gifts and gratuities will better enable dealers to monitor compliance with rule G&hyph;20. The proposal also will assist enforcement agencies in monitoring dealer compliance with the rule. In addition, the proposal will enable the MSRB to determine whether rule G&hyph;20 should be amended in the future to impose more stringent requirements to prevent influence of the underwriter selection process and to maintain the integrity of the municipal securities market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the foregoing reasons, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act an the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the MSRB and, in particular, Sections 15B(b)(2) (C) and (G). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It Is Therefore Ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change as described above be, and hereby is, approved and shall be effective August 19, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority, 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

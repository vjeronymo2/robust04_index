			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / EC seeks user-friendly single market A NETWORK of officials across each EC country will be given the task of making the single market more user-friendly at next month's European Council in Edinburgh. The officials will be expected to keep in close touch with one another to try to ensure that the single market works properly. Many of the main subjects for discussion at the EC summit are looking increasingly hard to resolve. But the UK government is relieved that in trying to make the single market more user-friendly, it seems to have carried European opinion with it. The move will mean a sharp increase in contacts between officials as they try to resolve issues before they are raised more formally through embassies or in EC committees. One aim is to sort out more readily business difficulties which arise from misunderstandings rather than from breaches of EC law. Mr Richard Needham, the trade minister, said: 'I'm not starry-eyed or euphoric, but I do think that it is the substance of something that will work.' UK ministers and officials are conscious of the belief among British businessmen that there will still be informal barriers to trade after the single market comes into effect on January 1. One minister said: 'There are going to be problems, no question. You only have to look at the outcry here if it looks as if a foreign company is going to get any infrastructure project.' Nonetheless, the Department of Trade and Industry is confident that the plan will make a significant difference in resolving practical difficulties. A system of national co-ordinators has been established to deal with difficulties over the mutual recognition of professional qualifications. The new network of officials may develop similarly over a wider field. There will also be annual discussions on how the market is working and further efforts to agree European standards in areas where national standards still apply.</p>

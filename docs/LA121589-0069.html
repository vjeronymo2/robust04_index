			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH: VIDEO . . . WHAT'S NEW ;  </P> <P> A WEEKEND DESIGNED FOR CRYSTAL GAZING;  </P> <P> THIS WEEK'S MOVIES  </P> <P> Billy Crystal's fans can have a Crystal ball at the video store this weekend.  Not only does Mr. "You Look Marvelous" star in the 1989 hit romantic comedy  "When Harry Met Sally . . . ," but he also appears in "Breaking Up Is Hard to  Do," a 1979 TV drama about four divorced men that has belatedly reached video  this week.  </P> <P> Written by Nora Ephron and directed by Rob Reiner (who last worked with Crystal  in "The Princess Bride"), "When Harry Met Sally . . ." (Nelson, $89.98, R)  teams Crystal with Meg Ryan in a dryly comic, Woody Allen-influenced  examination of friendship vs. romance. Also starring Carrie Fisher and Bruno  Kirby, the film surprised many industry observers by earning more than $80  million at the box office. It should meet with similar success as a cassette.  </P> <P> "Breaking Up Is Hard to Do" (Vidmark, $89.95), while not a comedy and "just" an  old TV movie, may be a satisfactory rental for Crystal's fans, too --  especially those who have been recently divorced. It's overly long at 150  minutes, but a sensitive and intelligent look at how hard the breaking up can  be -- from four men's perspectives. Crystal co-stars with Robert Conrad, Ted  Bessell, Jeff Conaway, Bonnie Franklin, Tony Musante and David Ogden Stiers.  </P> <P> "Dirty Dancing" star Patrick Swayze's fans didn't respond with much enthusiasm  to his last film, "Road House," but maybe the violent 1989 drama about a bar  bouncer will bounce back on video (MGM/UA, $89.98, R).  </P> <P> Want to own all 883 commercial-less minutes of the ABC series "The Winds of  War," starring Robert Mitchum, Ali MacGraw and many others? It'll cost you  $139.95 for the whole set of Paramount cassettes.  </P> <P> The great Roman Polanski-Robert Towne collaboration "Chinatown," starring Jack  Nicholson has been repriced by Paramount to $19.95.  </P> <P> "Shag: The Movie" (HBO, $89.99, PG) is a lighthearted bit of comic nostalgia  about three young women's eventful 1963 Memorial Day weekend at Myrtle Beach.  The bright young cast includes Phoebe Cates, Bridget Fonda, Annabeth Gish, Page  Hannah and Scott Coffey. TERRY ATKINSON  </P></p>

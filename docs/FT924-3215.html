			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / People: Thoms speaks quietly on his move to Verity Peter Thoms, newly appointed finance director at Verity Group, is suddenly much in demand. Ostensibly people want to talk to him about his new job; really they want the inside story on his old one - finance director of Amstrad, the troubled UK electronics company which founder Alan Sugar is trying to take private in one of the most controversial buy-backs the City has seen for years. Thoms left Amstrad suddenly in July giving neither reason nor explanation. He felt hamstrung, he complained at the time, but had been asked to say nothing. Yesterday he was only a little more expansive, saying it had been an 'interesting period' but refusing to comment on either his departure or the present situation at the former high-flying computers-to-video group. A chartered accountant by training, Thomas, 47, spent 15 years with Gillette both in Canada and the UK before joining Amstrad in 1989, tempted by its entrepreneurial image. Verity, formerly Wharfedale Loudspeakers, is noted for high quality and high prices. It is also losing money - Pounds 2.9m last year. It has just acquired Centralforce Holdings which has the Mission and Cyrus loudspeaker brand names. It is, Thoms believes, a classic turnround situation; the company now has critical mass to return to profitability, based on the acknowledged quality of British audio equipment.</p>

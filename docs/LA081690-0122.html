			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> A DAY IN THE PARK;  </P> <P> NORDHOFF RECREATION CENTER, 16244 NORDHOFF ST., SEPULVEDA  </P> <P> Size: 7.5 acres.  </P> <P> Facilities: Multipurpose room for disabled adults only, outdoor basketball  court, soccer field, and children's sandlot and swings.  </P> <P> Hours: Weekdays from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m., weekends from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. (or later  depending on activities).  </P> <P> Information: (818) 893-1931.  </P> <P> To people passing by, Nordhoff Recreation Center looks like any other park in  the San Fernando Valley. It has well-kept green grass, a children's play area  and an outdoor basketball court on a piece of land that once was a walnut  ranch.  </P> <P> But to 200 severely physically disabled adults in the Valley, the center is  their town. Many of them spend their days at the center, where park directors  have allowed them to elect officers and exercise their independence.  </P> <P> "They don't want a bunch of things that we've planned for them," said Polly  Schuster, a recreation therapist who has been park director for nearly nine  years. "The best thing we can give them is their independence, the social  skills and personal skills that will allow them to one day mainstream into  society."  </P> <P> The program, which often includes outside activities chosen by the members, is  extremely popular among disabled adults, and there is a waiting list to join  the program, Schuster said.  </P> <P> "We hate to turn people away," she said. "But this is just one of those places  the city needs more of."  </P> <P> While the ranch house is used exclusively for disabled adults, the outdoor park  area is open to the public.

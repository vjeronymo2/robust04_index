"No final conclusion has yet been reached, so I would point  out that based on our preliminary investigations, it is our  judgement that the shot that killed Corporal Stephane Dubrulle  on March 11 did not come from the Bosnian Serb side," Nerzig  said.    "In fact, we do have indications on a preliminary basis that  the shot does seem to have come from the Bosnian Moslem side."    Dubrulle was the 19th French soldier killed in  Bosnia-Herzegovina since the beginning of the war. A total of  79 UN peacekeepers have died in the 23-month war.</p>

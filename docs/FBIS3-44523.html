Steven Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists  said the full extent of the testing may never be known to the  public.    Aftergood told the REUTERS News Service that the CIA  conducted covert radiation tests from 1953 to 1967 but many  files on the tests were destroyed in 1973.    The revelation came one day after the establishment of a  joint task force that would coordinate the investigation efforts  by about half a dozen of government departments on the tests.    The inter-agency probe would involve the Energy Department,  the Defense Department, the Veterans Affairs Department and the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration.    The White House said it expects that the CIA would cooperate  with the government-wide investigation of the tests, probably  involved some 800 U.S. citizens, some without knowing the nature  of the testings.    Media reports said the testing subjects included retarded  children fed radioactive milk and cereal and inmates received x-  rays.    Aftergood said CIA had also done drug testing and "the drug  testing was part of a larger program which included studies on  the effects of radiation and a number of other things."</p>

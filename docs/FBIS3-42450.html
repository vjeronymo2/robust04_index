			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Colonels P. Khmelyuk and A. Malyshev, senior </F> scientific associate]    [Text] The PP-91 bridge train is designed for erecting  bridge and ferry crossings over water obstacles.    The set includes 32 river, 4 shore, and 8 motor sections, 4  towing launches, 4 flooring sections, and auxiliary equipment  that can be transported on KrAZ-260G bridge-train motor vehicles  and ZIL-4334 launch vehicles.    In the opened position, each river section is a finished  section of floating bridge or ferry 7.2 meters long. To use the  section after unloading it from the vehicle into the water, it  is only necessary to close two deck and four bottom locking  devices. The capacity of one river section is 22.5 tonnes.    A shore section is distinguished from a river section by the  slope of the deck and by the stronger design of the pontoons.  Floating bridges and ferries can be assembled from the river and  shore sections by connecting them using the docking devices on  transoms. The obliquely symmetrical position of these devices  makes it possible to connect the river sections regardless of  how the transoms are positioned relative to one another. Motor  sections are arranged between the river sections. Each river  section is equipped with anchor winches with anchors to secure  the bridges in a current and ramps for making entrances to the  ferries.    Floating bridges and ferries have high floodability, ensured  by the large number of water-displacing sections, each of which  consists of four pontoons divided into two watertight  compartments. The good repairability of the sections makes it  possible to restore them quickly in field conditions.    The PP-91 bridge train makes it possible to bring all troop  equipment across virtually any water obstacle. Based on its  specifications, the bridge train has nothing similar to it in  the world practice of bridge building.    It can be successfully used without design modifications in  various sectors of the national economy, especially when  building and restoring permanent bridges, when erecting  temporary crossings in logging, in agricultural work, and also  when cleaning up after natural disasters in areas of extensive  flooding.    The PP-91 is delivered to consumers in various complete  sets.

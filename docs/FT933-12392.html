			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Cartography of distress redrawn: FT regional writers on results of bids for assisted area status GRINS of relief and groans of disappointment swept through town halls and local economic development offices yesterday when Mr Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister, announced the new assisted areas map. The winners of assistance - those areas which the government says have the worst unemployment problems - could now see companies in their areas applying for subsidy under the Industrial Development Act 1982. The losers - the Department of Trade and Industry received 2,000 submissions - will have to find help from other government programmes. The acknowledgement of employment difficulties in London and the south and the removal of parts of Wales from the map has given a fresh twist to the cartography of distress. Yet the shape of the map has a weary familiarity, two generations after the first attempts to reduce regional economic imbalances. The first four areas designated by the 1934 Special Areas Act were west-central Scotland, west Cumberland, north-east England and south Wales. Many of these areas are still economically disadvantaged. The growth of European Community spending through its structural funds has meant that regional funding from Whitehall is relatively less important now than in the 1930s or 1970s. Earlier this week EC ministers agreed on a regional funds package which would mean Pounds 2bn in assistance for the UK between 1994 and 1999. Mr Sainsbury yesterday sought to separate domestic and EC policy. 'I would emphasise that there is no direct connection between the assisted areas map and the structural funds maps,' he said. Local authorities do see a link. Mr Mark Hume, assistant director of economic planning at Kent County Council, said: 'The DTI might say there is no formal connection between regional assistance and European structural funds, but you would have little chance of getting any money from Europe if your own country does not support you.' Mr Paul Bevan, economic development officer at Brighton District Council, says: 'We regarded regional selective assistance as a necessary first step to gaining help from Europe. Now we've been turned down our chances must be very low.' The criteria for the 1994-99 structural funds map have not yet been drawn up, but in the past EC criteria have been more widely cast than those of the DTI. The former have been concerned with broad issues such as rural regeneration, the latter largely with employment. The EC has used varied statistical material in making its assessments of aid-worthy areas, including local gross domestic product figures. The DTI's basic tool is unemployment figures. There is a wide degree of overlap in the areas chosen for the two maps, but exclusion from assisted areas status does not always mean an automatic bar to the EC map. Birmingham City Council pointed out a disparity in aid. Since 1984, when the area was given intermediate status on the assisted areas map, it has received Pounds 200m - Pounds 145m from the EC and Pounds 56m from UK sources. The disparity is not surprising since EC spending is frequently on costly public infrastructure projects. UK regional spending, by contrast, is demand-led by companies. UK regional policy over the past 10 years has moved towards regenerating areas of urban decline, so that regional spending under the Industrial Development Act has become just another instrument alongside others such as urban development corporations and enterprise zones. Combined with constraints on government spending, a slowdown in inward investment and corporate reluctance to expand during recession, UK regional spending has been kept at modest levels. Expenditure on regional selective assistance, the most important subsidy, in England was Pounds 74m in fiscal 1991-92, an estimated Pounds 72m in 1992-93 and is expected to be about Pounds 89m in 1993-94. The more modest UK spending is, the greater the interest in EC funding.  ----------------------------------------        WINNERS: NEW ASSISTED AREAS  ---------------------------------------- Alfreton and Ashfield Alnwich and Amble Barstaple and Ilfracombe Barrow-in-Furness Bideford Bridlington and Driffield Castleford and Pontefract Chesterfield Clacton Dorchester and Weymouth (Weymouth and Portland part) Dover and Deal Folkestone Great Yarmouth Harwich Hastings Heathrow (Park Royal part) Isle of Wight London (Lea Valley, Park Royal, London end of east Thames corridor) Louth and Mablethorpe Mansfield Retford Sittingbourne and Sheerness Skegness St. Austell Thanet Thurso Torbay Wakefield and Dewsbury Whitehaven Wisbech Worksop  ----------------------------------------     LOSERS: NO LONGER ASSISTED AREAS  ---------------------------------------- Accrington and Rossendale Badenoch Bradford Cardiff Corby Cynderford and Ross-on-Wye Darlington Kidderminster Lampeter and Aberaeron Manchester Newport (eastern part) Scunthorpe Shotton, Flint and Rhyl (part) Stewartry Telford and Bridgnorth Wrexham (part)  ---------------------------------------- Source: DTI  ----------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HARBOR PARK LAKE REOPENED AS 'TOXIN' PROVES TO BE ALGAE  </P> <P> Los Angeles city recreation officials reopened Machado Lake at Harbor Regional  Park on Wednesday, one week after a heavy film of algae was mistakenly believed  to be latex paint or a similarly toxic substance.  </P> <P> "We're relieved," Jean Thaxton of the city Recreation and Parks Department said  Wednesday.  </P> <P> The lake at the 230-acre park was closed July 18 after maintenance crews  reported a heavy film that fire and health officials feared was a toxic  material. That fear continued even after preliminary testing of the lake found  that the water did not contain detectable levels of metals.  </P> <P> After subsequent testing, Los Angeles County health officials determined that  the water was not hazardous because it contained living microorganisms. "Our  conclusion is that it is algae . . . and I am convinced it is not hazardous,"  said Samir Ibrahim, a hazardous materials specialist.  </P> <P> Officials blamed the algae bloom on the recent hot weather.  </P> <P> Despite the finding, city and county officials said they are not red-faced over  closing the lake. "It was something we had to do," Thaxton said. "We would  rather be safe and protect the community than just assume the lake wasn't  hazardous."  </P></p>

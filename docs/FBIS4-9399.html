			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by M. Laketic: "Even Parties on Bank Balance </F> Sheets"]    [Text] Pristina, 5 Apr -- In the opinion of Pristina  bankers, the losses in Beogradska Bank, Pristinska, a  joint-stock company, which POLITIKA has written about, occurred  because of a lack of discipline on the part of certain  executives who had never performed banking operations before  coming to that institution. So, that bank, which never formed an  oversight committee although it has been in existence since 1990  and should have done so under the Law on Banks (Articles 41,  46-48, SLUZBENI LIST, No. 32, 1993) and also under the bank  charter, has been operating according to the lights of the  general director and a few of his associates, who have changed  frequently.    Instead of an oversight committee, Director Dimitrije  Ljiljak  formed a farm committee and a committee for science and  technology, each of which had 15 members, constituting a  "voluntary" advisory body. The members of these committees,  among them Dr. Zoran Gruic; Dr. Zoran Gligorijevic; Zoran  Vasiljevic, director of Famipa in Prizren; Bosko Kotorcevic,  director of the welded pipe factory in Urosevac; Boban Boskovic,  director of Plastika in Pristina; and so on, have been receiving  a monthly appanage incomparably greater than the salaries of  those employed in the bank. Expenditures of this kind were  indicated in the Report on Business Operations under the items  of "intellectual services" and "other nonproduction services."    Judging by that report, most of the expenditures were made,  or costs incurred, by the bank's branch in Urosevac. Thus, that  branch allocated for firewood alone several hundred-fold more  money than in Pristina, while the Gnjilane, Pec, Prizren, and  Zvecani banks had minimal expenditures of this kind. That same  branch in Urosevac last year had several hundred-fold higher PTT  [post, telephone, telegraph] costs than all the branches and  main headquarters, taken together. That branch also had the  highest appropriation to pay net personal incomes arising from  royalties.    However, the personnel in that bank say that the situation  is  altogether different. They say that expenditures of other  branches and the main headquarters were entered on the books of  this branch, and those expenditures even included all kinds of  parties, and last spring's celebration of the Serbian Radical  Party [SRS] is mentioned as a curiosity. That is, the SRS  celebrated its election victory in the Narcis Hotel on  Brezovica. The bank was the general sponsor of the celebration,  since, let us not forget, Director Dimitrije Ljiljak was a  people's deputy in the Serbian Assembly as a member of the SRS.    Another oddity referred to is the example of the purchase of  Misa Kalajdzic's doctoral dissertation "Revitalization of Sar  Mountain." That is, before the sale of that doctoral paper  Kalajdzic was that bank's executive director, and now he is  director of the commercial firm Kosmet, which was established by  that bank. The lawyer of the Pristinska Bank, we have learned,  opposed this unique purchase of a doctoral dissertation at the  time, arguing that this work could be obtained without payment  in any Kosmet library.    The personnel of the Pristinska Bank, among them Zaga  Pavlovic, wrote a report on all of this for all the government  agencies, including the president of the republic. Its petition  referred to the collaboration between Director Ljiljak and a  certain Milorad Dobric of Belgrade, owner of the magazine SELO,  with the entire benefit going to this private publisher. The  deal, our informant says, was that the magazine would write as  much as possible about Director Ljiljak and then "there would be  no problem about money for printing."    The bank's executives do not for the moment want to go  public. The only statement was from Dr. Branko Vasiljevic,  member of the bank's managing board, who said, "It actually  could have been worse."</p>

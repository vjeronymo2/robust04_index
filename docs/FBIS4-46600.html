			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Documents and Commentary: Plans and </F> Resources--The Search for Ways To Achieve a Balance"]    [Text] It is no secret that funding for the Armed  Forces is extremely inadequate today. However, some plans for  military training plans are striking in their abundance and  scope of activities. When are we going to stop dissipating our  resources, when are we going to learn to economize?--Lieutenant  Colonel V. Belousov.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   This question from a letter to the editors is basically  rhetorical. But we decided not to ignore it and asked Colonel S.  Ignatyev, an officer in the Russian Federation Ministry of  Defense central staff, to discuss this topic.    The current situation with regard to funding the Armed  Forces  is very strained. And the defense minister has directed  administrative agencies to search for ways to cut costs and  ensure strict austerity and rational use of the financial  resources appropriated for defense needs. The basis for this  must be laid as we plan the development of the Russian  Federation Armed Forces in 1994-1995.    I would like to identify basic areas of staff work that make  it possible to conserve resources.    Combat- and mobilization-readiness plans and organization  and  methodological directives must be coordinated with amounts of  appropriations and material and technical resources.    In planning command-staff, tactical, specialized tactical,  demonstrative and other exercises, staff training exercises, and  wargames, a careful analysis must be made of their usefulness  and effectiveness. The composition of exercise participants, as  well as the manpower and resources used to support them, must be  the optimum choices.    It is essential to thoroughly reexamine the existing  practice  of holding training and assembly exercises that entail the  consumption of valuable materials and financial resources for  planning and implementation and the reimbursement of travel  expenses and payment of per diems to assembly attendees, as well  as keep assembly sites as close as possible to troops and forces  and limit them to three to five days.    It is also necessary to sharply reduce the number of  training  assemblies and meetings held with commanders of districts,  groups of forces, fleets, armies, and military educational  institutions and that involve summoning a large number of  officers to Moscow, St. Petersburg, and other major cities, and  to arrange to hold clustered training assemblies and meetings  and stop sending several commanding officers of military  administrative agencies (commanding officers and their deputies,  administration, department, and service chiefs, etc.) to them.    Operational, training, training and methodological and other  training assemblies (classes) for commanding officers of large  formations and military units and administrative officers of  formations and military units (ships), military educational  institutions, the military departments of state educational  institutions for higher professional education, and military  missions should be planned on a garrison basis, as a rule. The  minimum necessary number of personnel and military equipment  should be used to prepare and support training assemblies.  Training camps, firing range operations, and field excursions  must be put in proper order.    In planning measures involving physical training and sports,  the main emphasis should be on holding large-scale competitions  and sports festivals directly in military units and at military  educational institutions. We must limit the amount of  appropriations and number of championships among the branches of  the Russian Federation Armed Forces, districts, groups of  forces, fleets, and large formations and units, as well as  competitions among military academies and schools.    In order to more coordinate operational and combat- and  mobilizational-readiness plans with available appropriations and  material and technical resources, plans should be subjected to  comprehensive economic scrutiny and cleared with financial and  economic agencies before being approved. Proposals for  inclusions in the Russian Armed Forces training plan that are  submitted to the Russian Armed Forces General Staff must be  substantiated with necessary calculations of financial  expenditures that have been cleared with the Russian Ministry of  Defense Chief Military Budget and Financing Administration.    Balancing plans for combat training and material, technical,  and financial support for planned activities will make it  possible to maintain the required level of combat and  mobilizational readiness in our Army and Naval Forces.

The government is pushing ahead with proposals for an ombudsman with the power to award compensation to victims of press intrusion.

The commission is paid for by the newspaper industry but now has a majority of independent members. The newspaper industry has said it will neither accept nor pay for such an ombudsman.

It will be opposed by every newspaper in the country.'</p>

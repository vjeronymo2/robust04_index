The  seizure of a shipment of 198 kg of cocaine in the municipality  of Aparecida do Rio Doce (in southwestern Goias) early last  Saturday morning provided the PF [Federal Police] with  confirmation that Goias is part of the international traffic's  network of routes and that it is being used to transport drugs  from Bolivia on their way to destinations abroad. Although the  198 kg of cocaine in question constitute the largest drug  seizure ever in that state, PF Police Chief Leone Oliveira, who  was in charge of the operation, estimates that the amount in  question represents less than 5 percent of the total passing  through the region every month.    The drug, which was found in false bottoms built into two  stake trucks of the kind used to carry cattle, is now at the  Federal Police Superintendency in Goiania, where it will be  incinerated as soon as court authorization is received. The  drivers of the two trucks, Domingos Donizeth Vilani, 37, and  Moises Fernandes Maciel, 33, are now in custody.</p>

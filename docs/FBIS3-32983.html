			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Brasilia--Brazil broke four records in its 1993  foreign trade: total exports, valued at $38.783 billion; exports  of manufactured goods, at $23.613 billion; imports, at $25.711  billion; and trade flow (sum of exports plus imports), which  totalled $64.494 billion. These figures were released yesterday  by acting Minister of Industry, Commerce, and Tourism Ailton  Barcelos Fernandes at an awards ceremony for representatives of  the sectors that figured most prominently in last year's  exports. The balance of trade position stood at $13.072 billion,  lower than in 1992, which was $15.308 billion.    The minister minimized the fact that the goal of $40 billion  in exports set by former Minister Jose Eduardo Andrade Vieira  had not been achieved. "That was a very ambitious goal and we  are happy to have come close to it," he commented.  <H5>  Predictions </H5>   For 1994, Fernandes predicts that even higher levels will be  reached, in an effort to break new records. He wants to see $44  billion in exports (growth of 13.4 percent), $29 billion in  imports (12.8 percent more), a $15 billion trade balance (up  14.6 percent), and a trade flow of $73 billion (plus 13.2  percent). According to the acting minister, these goals were set  in light of the expectation that 1993's pace will be maintained.  In consultations with the sectoral chambers from the most  representative segments of the export economy, he found this to  be feasible.    The minister said the growth in exports, especially of  machinery and raw materials, is a positive development. He  commented that imports of luxury items were minor. "Two thirds  of the 65,000 automobiles imported, for example, came from  Argentina in fulfillment of trade agreements."  <H5>  Highlights </H5>   The minister gave awards to five sectors for 1993  performance: auto parts, with exports of $1.242 billion (a 22.5  percent growth); footwear, at $1.945 billion (rose 32.0  percent); fresh fruit, at $132.2 million (up 27.3 percent);  furniture, at $239.4 million (90.5 percent higher); and wine, at  $15.0 million (increased by 96.6 percent). Exports of industrial  products gained more than one percentage point from last year's  level and accounted for 75 percent of foreign sales.    In December, the trade balance recorded the following  results: exports at $3.413 billion (less than the $3.484 billion  of the same month of 1992); imports of $2.809 billion (more than  the $2.223 billion from the previous year); and a trade balance  of $604 million (less than 1992's $1.261 billion).

He said the  draft of the new constitution has been finalized, although some  politicians in the republic have stated their preference for the  federation idea.    But even federalists insist that the component parts of a  Georgian Federation should not be granted the right of  secession. They believe nonetheless that this would remove  support for separatism and help the republic to get rid of  conflicts on the ethnic grounds.</p>

			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Observer: Face to face Fresh evidence that the division between the Labour party and its formerly loyal toastmaster, Mirror Group Newspapers, is more of a matrimonial tiff than a full scale divorce. One of the better known figures attending last week's party marking the first year of Democracy Now, the parliamentary pressure group for extending Labour party membership to Northern Ireland, was MGN chief executive David Montgomery. Of course, he may just have turned up to chat to fellow Ulster folk. But it suggests that Montgomery may be a little less apolitical than is sometimes portrayed. Meanwhile, the presence of Lord Donoghue, senior policy adviser to two Labour prime ministers, indicates that the party's own internal divisions on Northern Ireland, could be harder to heal than the rift with the Mirror. For a start, Labour cannot even make up its mind on whether or not to allow the people of Northern Ireland to be party members.</p>

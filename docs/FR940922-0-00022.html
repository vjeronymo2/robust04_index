			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although the August 16, 1994, proposed rule included generalized regulations for both early and late season hunting, this rulemaking addresses only the late season proposals. Early season hunting was addressed in the rulemaking published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on September 1, 1994 (59 FR 45235). As a general rule, early seasons begin during September each year and have a primary emphasis on such species as mourning and white-winged dove. Late seasons are ordinarily those that begin in late-September or early-October, or later, each year and have a primary emphasis on waterfowl.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the August 16 proposed rule, and in the early season final rule, the Service pointed out that there was reason for cautious optimism with regard to liberalization of duck hunting regulations in the 1994&hyph;95 season. However, at that time production information was not available and assessments could not be made on which to base final framework decisions. From survey data, it now appears that duck production is up on a continental basis, with a projected fall flight index of about 71 million ducks, and the Service has responded to this by making minor adjustments in regulations. Most notably, bag limit frameworks provide for one more duck than allowed last year, with an additional mallard drake. However, the restriction on mallard hens to one in the daily bag will remain in effect. A season on canvasbacks is optional nationwide. Other species restrictions are still in effect. The Service has eased, somewhat, the more restrictive regulations of past seasons because duck populations have generally rebounded from the lows of last year and several previous years. Duck populations recovery is closely linked to more favorable water conditions throughout most of the better duck production areas of the U.S. and Canada, as well as to more restrictive regulations imposed in the past. However, the Service has been conservative in this liberalization because the potential is there for a more complete recovery of populations in the future, compared to long-term averages, if water conditions stabilize and/or continue to improve. Length of season is considered to be a factor more closely associated with determining magnitude of harvest than is minor adjustment in bag limit so frameworks for season length across all four flyways will remain the same. The fact that some liberalization has occurred in bag limits and season length is considered in these final regulations, many of which were proposed before final decisions were made on late season frameworks for the States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Tribal Proposals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the 1994&hyph;95 migratory bird hunting season, the Service received requests from 14 tribes and/or Indian groups that followed the June 4, 1985, guidelines and are appropriate for rulemaking. Some of the proposals submitted by the tribes have both early and late season elements. However, as noted earlier,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only those with late season proposals are included in this final rulemaking; 13 tribes have proposals with late seasons. Six tribes are represented in the early season regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / (CORRECTED) People: Insurance moves Correction (published 26th May 1992) appended to this article. Graham Ford is leaving Brown Shipley Insurance Brokers to launch a new national insurance broking venture. Ford, now 52, has been closely identified with the growth of the Brown Shipley broking business and had been involved in efforts to lead a management buy-out. After the failure of these, however, Ford has joined forces with Merseyside-based Berkeley Burke and Manson Reed, a broker which specialises in meeting the needs of sport centres, bowling alleys and other leisure installations. Ford will be managing director of the new venture, which is to be known as Burke Ford Reed Insurance Management. The group hopes to obtain a full Lloyd's registration within 18 months. ***** Michael Kier is to become chairman of CE HEATH on the retirement in July of Richard Fielding. John MacKenzie Green, group md, will become chairman of CE Heath (Insurance Broking). ***** Ralph Sneddon has been appointed md of BAIN CLARKSON's continental Europe operations; he joins from Sedgwick. ***** Roger Cooper has been appointed a director of BALLANTYNE, McKEAN &amp; SULLIVAN; Charles Simpson has been appointed a director of its subsidiary BMS LMX. ***** John Clayton has been appointed company secretary of GUARDIAN ROYAL EXCHANGE on the retirement of John Evans. Correction (published 26th May 1992) The FT stated on May 7 that Burke Ford Reed Insurance Management had 'joined forces with Berkeley Burke'. This was incorrect. Burke Ford Reed has linked up with Berkeley Burke Northern Group, a former subsidiary of the Berkeley Burke Group, which also conducts insurance broking business and continues to trade independently.</p>

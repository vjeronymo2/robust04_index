			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: Wait for the good news - The falls in mortgage rates A NUMBER of building societies have reduced their mortgage rates in response to the base rate cut. Lending institutions are always keen to announce such cuts well ahead of their actual implementation for existing borrowers, who will have to wait before they feel the effect on their monthly mortgage payments. The banks and building societies which have announced cuts so far are not passing on the full base rate cut to their borrowers. Take, for example, Abbey National, Britain's second largest lender. It is cutting rates by 0.75 of a percentage point to 8.5 per cent with immediate effect for new borrowers and from December 23 for existing customers. But savings rates will be trimmed by up to one point. Gareth Jones, director of retail operations, said: 'It is difficult to be kind to savers and borrowers and, at the moment, we are being kind to borrowers.' However, borrowers who have not had the full one-point reduction passed on to them and have to wait another six weeks for the new rate, may feel that Abbey is being most kind to itself. Rates on loans over Pounds 60,000 are being reduced to 8.3 per cent and to 8.1 per cent for mortgages over Pounds 100,000. A borrower with a Pounds 50,000 mortgage will save Pounds 26.56 a month on an interest-only mortgage. A Pounds 70,000 loan will be cut by Pounds 39.06 a month. Those with mortgages of Pounds 150,000 will see monthly payments fall by Pounds 89.06. West Bromwich, Newcastle, Yorkshire and National &amp; Provincial building societies are cutting their rates to 8.5 per cent from 9.25 per cent. Yorkshire's rates will be implemented on Monday for new borrowers. Existing customers will benefit on December 1 at West Bromwich but mortgage holders at Yorkshire and Newcastle will have to wait for an announcement. Woolwich and Northern Rock cut rates from 9.25 per cent to 8.55 per cent; existing borrowers benefit in December. Alliance &amp; Leicester cut its basic rate from 9.29 per cent to 8.55 per cent immediately for new borrowers; others will have to wait. Halifax, Nationwide and Leeds will announce cuts next week. Britannia will cut rates 'at least' half a point from 9.29 per cent next week for new borrowers (December 1 for existing customers). A number of competitive fixed-rate mortgages have been launched. John Wriglesworth of UBS Phillips and Drew said: 'A fixed-rate mortgage of 7.75 per cent reflects base rates of 6 per cent. You can't get fixed rates much below this.' Abbey National is launching a 6.99 per cent mortgage from Monday, fixed until January 31 1995. It is available for a fee of Pounds 200, with an early redemption and early capital repayment penalty of 90 days' interest. National &amp; Provincial is offering first-time buyers a fixed rate of 6.25 per cent - its lowest for 30 years - until January 1 1994, arrangement fee Pounds 150. John Charcol, mortgage brokers, has a seven-year rate of 9.29 per cent capped until January 31 2000, with a fee of 0.25 per cent of the advance.</p>

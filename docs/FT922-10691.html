			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Neat deal could be an own goal for Bonn: Kohl may appear calm in the Genscher aftermath, but has little reason to be so SOME would say it was a triumph of German democracy. A neat deal worked out in smoke-filled rooms, to ensure a smooth transition after the sudden resignation of Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the grand old man of German foreign policy, was dramatically unpicked in five hours of stormy debate by a group of elected parliamentarians. They ensured a popular choice to be the new Foreign Minister, not a political one. Others see it as an extraordinary, if all too familiar, demonstration of the incoherence of Bonn's coalition politics, where all dirty linen is washed in public, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl fails to provide firm leadership to keep his partners in line. Inevitably, there is an element of truth in both views. The departure of Mr Genscher from his job, not only as foreign minister but as deputy chancellor, the departure indeed of the most popular single politician in the government, could not happen without an upheaval. It has disturbed the fine balance of the Bonn coalition; indeed, it threatens to shake it to its foundations. It has exposed the weakness and lack of leadership within his own Free Democratic Party (FDP), where a new generation is squabbling over the succession of a party which has always enjoyed an influence far beyond its 10 per cent-odd popularity in the polls. It has exposed the divisions, both political and personal, within the ruling coalition, in which the FDP on one side, and the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), very Catholic and conservative, on the other, have always been close to open warfare. It has exposed Mr Kohl's natural inclination to solve any problems he faces through inaction, or tinkering, not through decisive action. Criticism of the coalition and Mr Kohl came yesterday from unlikely quarters. Mr Martin Schell, editor-in-chief of Die Welt, the conservative newspaper which is normally a staunch supporter of the government, wrote a thundering piece under the headline: 'The Coalition Totters'. He attacked the FDP and Mr Genscher for the timing of his departure. He attacked Mr Kohl for allowing himself to be pushed around over such a key post. He expressed sympathy for the plight of Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister and leader of the CSU, who was so obviously side-lined from the whole debate. He accused Mr Genscher, the arch-manipulator of German domestic politics, of possibly seeking to undermine the entire coalition with his resignation, force Mr Kohl into an unwieldy 'grand coalition' with the Social Democrats, and thus regenerate the forces of his FDP in a brief period of opposition. The FDP certainly needs that regeneration. Mr Otto Lambsdorff, the former economics minister, is leader only until 1994, his popularity even within the party on the slide. He refused to quit yesterday after his own parliamentary group rejected his nomination of Mrs Irmgard Schwaetzer as foreign minister, in favour of Mr Klaus Kinkel, but his authority has been terminally weakened. Mrs Schwaetzer, Mr Kinkel, and Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the current economics minister, have long been jostling for the succession. The FDP party leader is the king-maker in all Bonn coalitions. With his nomination by the party on Tuesday night to become deputy chancellor, Mr Mollemann must be well-placed to achieve the party leadership. Yet the jockeying continues, and the FDP leadership is committed to continual point-scoring off its partners in the coalition. The coalition has been undermined for months by a series of key issues on which Mr Kohl has simply failed to negotiate a consensus. The most important is the question of asylum-seekers. The Christian Democrats (CDU) and the CSU want to change the constitution, which at present allows the automatic right to demand political asylum to anyone who asks for it. They want it limited to countries with known political persecution. The liberal instincts of the FDP are enraged, and the party refuses to comply: no change in the constitution. The second issue is how to finance the care of old people in homes: the CDU wants to introduce a new element in social security payments to finance a public scheme, guaranteeing places in homes where they are needed. The FDP will not step further than a voluntary scheme that does not hit the private sector. On neither of those issues has any progress been made in the year or more since the last election. There is simply a sense of drift. Mr Kohl knows now that he still has 18 months breathing space before an absolute spate of elections, national, regional and European, in 1994. That is why he seems so doggedly, bloody-mindedly relaxed. Yet hanging over his creaking coalition is the greatest challenge faced by any country in western Europe: the challenge of unification, of somehow bringing the collapsed society and economy of east Germany up to the level of the west. He may appear calm, but he has very little reason to be so. And 18 months is a short time in politics.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HOW GERMANY'S COALITION GOVERNMENT WORKS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Key Figures  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Helmut Kohl          CDU, Chancellor Theo Waigel          CSU, Finance minister Jurgen Mollemann     FDP, Deputy Chancellor designate Klaus Kinkel         FDP, Foreign minister designate  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cabinet portfolios  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CDU: Chancellor, Interior, Employment, Defence, Family &amp; Pensions, Women      &amp; Youth, Transport, Environment, Post &amp; Telecommunications,      Research &amp; Technology, Minister in the Chancellor's office FDP: Foreign Affairs, Justice, Economy, Housing &amp; Construction,      Science &amp; Culture CSU: Finance, Agriculture, Health, Economic, Co-operation  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

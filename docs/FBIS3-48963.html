			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Renata Wrobel: "Forty-Four Pilots"] </F>   [Text] In the new year, the pilotage program has formally  been started: the self-government authorities of the largest  Polish cities took over new tasks. Forty-four of the 46  selected cities decided to take part in the program. In line  with the intention of its authors, the program is supposed to  meet two goals: First, which is generally believed to be of  paramount importance, is to make the managing of local affairs  more efficient. The second goal is a test before introducing  self-government powiats [small administrative units].    The change lies in the following: the city -- that is, the  council elected in general elections and the mayor appointed by  it -- will deal with some of the affairs that have so far been  in the domain of the government administration (of ministries,  voivodes, regional offices). It will receive a special subsidy  from the state budget. The subsidy, as Finance Deputy Minister  Wojciech Misiag said in the Sejm, will not be bigger  (self-governments hope that it will not be smaller either) than  the subsidy that would be given to the administration. This  operation is supposed to yield three kinds of benefits:    -- make management more uniform, by concentrating the  powers,  which have so far been scattered, in the hands of  self-government authorities;    -- submit the activities of yet other establishments under  social control. This control is exercised by the council, which  every four years is evaluated by the city's inhabitants in  elections. Control over centrally steered civil servants is far  less efficient;    -- ensure better spending of public money. There are many  examples which show that local authorities spend their money  more thriftily and wisely; they can also pursue a much more  flexible budget policy than centralized structures.  <H5>  The Pilotage Program Has an Eventful History </H5>   On 29 December 1992, Michal Kulesza, the government's  representative for public administration reform, forwarded a  letter to the mayors of selected cities; he asked them whether  they would be interested in taking part in such an undertaking.  At the very beginning it was established that cities would be  free to make this decision independently. Forty-six cities were  selected; each of them has more than 100,000 inhabitants (except  Warsaw, due to a complex system of self-government); there are  also several smaller towns which are part of urban complexes.  As many as 50 percent of Poland's inhabitants live in the  selected cities; their budgets constitute 40 percent of all  self-governments' finances.    In February 1993, the Sejm adopted the budget law. Article  35 empowered the government to issue an order concerning the  pilotage program. In July, Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka met  with the mayors and chairmen of municipal councils of the cities  participating in the program. She stated that "one cannot  change Poland without changing its cities." "We are ready to  make the effort. We have been waiting for this for three years.  We really want the program to be successful," answered Wojciech  Szczesny Kaczmarek, president of the Union of Polish Towns and  Cities and mayor of Poznan. Soon afterward, on 13 July...  <H5>  The Council of Ministers Adopted a "Pilotage" Order </H5>   In line with it, cities were supposed to take over the  following:    -- administrative powers, such as those concerning ground  policy, construction, road traffic (such as registration of  vehicles, issuing or withholding drivers' licenses);    -- such establishments as secondary schools, culture  establishments, health service institutions, houses of social  care, as well as managing national and voivodship roads, except  highways and expressways;    -- administrative police forces, such as protection from  fire.    Among other things, approximately 30 cultural establishments  of "all-national importance," as well as specialized health  service institutions of voivodship or national importance were  supposed to remain under state administration. Along with new  duties, cities were supposed to take over indispensable  buildings for free and receive money from the state budget.  This was supposed to be a purposeful subsidy [a subsidy for a  particular purpose], but gminas [small administrative units]  were supposed to be free to move the money from one area to  another. Self-governments were supposed to be free from the  debts incurred by various establishments before the middle of  1993. The deadline for signing agreements by mayors and  voivodes was set for 30 October.    Just a few days before this day, when 28 cities had already  concluded their agreements, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak sent  a fax ordering a stop to this operation. The decision was  explained by the "intention of obtaining exact information  concerning the course of the pilotage program to date and  carrying out a legal and substantive analysis of it." Cities  and national self-governmental organizations soon protested  violently against the stopping of the program. Soon afterward  the government made a decision: the agreements must not be  signed until 30 November; after that, cities will be allowed to  do it until 20 December.  <H5>  The Scope of the Pilotage Was Restricted </H5>   This also concerned the cities that had signed their  agreements earlier; it encountered accusations of breaking the  rule that the law is not retroactive. Chorzow and Grudziadz  withdrew, being deterred by the "disloyalty of the partner."  They have not given up new powers; they will take them over  from voivodes on the basis of individual agreements.    The number of the culture establishments that will not be  transferred to self-governments has risen five times -- to 150  and comprised such institutions as voivodship public libraries  and houses of culture. It was the result of protests by culture  employees and artists, including the Union of Polish Stage  Artists and "Solidarity." Although even Deputy Minister Michal  Jagiello recalled that self-governments pay for culture (even  though they would not have to) more money than the state budget  via voivodes and that establishments taken care of by the  ministry are not doing better than those financed by  self-governments, Minister Kazimierz Dejmek managed to force the  decision on limiting the pilotage.    Not all cities will take over secondary schools, first of  all  for financial reasons. For a long time it was not clear what  would happen to school debt. The government's decision that the  state budget will be responsible for those debts which should  have been paid off by 30 November, was made on 23 December at  night. There are other problems as well. Only on 29 December,  at the meeting of the team steering the pilotage program, did  representatives of self- governments manage to obtain the most  recent information on the sums to be allocated for the  maintenance of various schools. It turned out that they differ  from those presented earlier by school superintendents. In the  atmosphere of uncertainty, some cities (such as Bialystok,  Koszalin, Lublin, Poznan, Slupsk) decided to give up the idea of  taking over secondary schools.    For the time being in the budget bill...  <H5>  There Is No Trace of Pilotage </H5>   It is still not clear what sums the state budget will  earmark  for cities. The Finance Ministry has committed itself to  calculating everything as soon as it obtains full information on  what the various cities will take over. Then an appendix will  be drawn up which will be forwarded to the Sejm as a  governmental amendment.    What needs to be explained is the matter of debts of the  establishments taken over by cities. It is known that the  budget will deal with the debts of secondary schools that should  have been paid off by 30 November 1993, and the debts of other  establishments -- by 30 June 1993. At the meeting of the team  steering the pilotage it was decided that the finance minister  would propose to the Council of Ministers that health service  institutions and culture establishments be treated the same way  as secondary schools. Self-government activists recall that the  debts have been incurred by budget sphere establishments; they  believe that the government can do one of two things: keep the  establishments that are working inefficiently as well as their  debts, or keep only their debts.    Self-government activists are not satisfied with the way  money is supposed to be transferred. Originally it was assumed  that all the money would pass through the voivodes' budgets.  Now it is planned that the money will be given by voivodes and  the various ministers; however, only voivodes will see to it  that the money comes in time and is sufficient in amount.  Cities believe that this does not guarantee them financial  security.    Despite reservations, the self-governments of most towns  have  not withdrawn from the program (even though some of them add  that after a few months they may consider such a possibility).  They are prepared to add from several to a few hundred billion  zlotys to new establishments. "We risk our posts, but we must  take anything we can from the hands of irresponsible people,"  says Bytom's Janusz Paczocha, "enfant terrible" [preceding two  words in French] among city mayors. Gdynia Mayor Franciszka  Cegielska adds: "We may get into trouble as authorities, but  this is what the inhabitants want us to do." Self-government  activists are disappointed that the prime minister has not even  once made a political declaration that he would like the  pilotage program to be successful.</p>

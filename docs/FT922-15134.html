			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Arts: A letter to Oscar - Cinema DECEIVED (15) Damian Harris KUFFS (15)Bruce E. Evans SCORSESE TIMES 4 Martin Scorsese LA BELLE NOISEUSE DIVERTIMENTO (15) Jacques Rivette Dear Oscar, What a pleasure to see you in action again. Watching you on television the other night, I was glad to see that you are as bronzed and fit as ever, despite so much pawing by the great and famous. One or two points about the 1992 awards. I was intrigued and pleased to see The Silence Of The Lambs sweep five top prizes, although the selection of this idiosyncratic horror film by the normally conservative Academy surprised me. Frankly - I might as well come out with it - I suspect there was an element of homophobic counter-attack here. All those gay demonstrators converging on the Oscars gala to protest about Hollywood's obsession with gay or bisexual killers, as instanced in Silence: here was a chance for the Academy to stand up in full evening wear, stiffen its sinews (under the guise of a 'liberal' choice) and say 'Ya boo' to them. Unfair? Well, Oscar, you were there. But never mind: I am quietly delighted, as every Briton should be, at the same film allowing best actor Anthony Hopkins to make it three in a row for the UK. The Welsh wizard made a meal of Hannibal Lecter, who in turn was so touchingly keen to make a meal of everyone else. The progression of these Oscar-winning British roles, I must note, is becoming somewhat alarming. From the innocence of a handicapped Irish poet (Daniel Day Lewis) to a suspected wife-poisoner (Jeremy Irons) and now to a cannibalistic serial killer. If Britain is to make it four in a row, it is probably time to get Alan Rickman into costume for the Marquis De Sade. I was disappointed in the actress awards. Jodie Foster has won it before, for a more challenging role in The Accused, and I thought Mercedes Ruehl was over-the-top in The Fisher King. But dear Jack Palance] The man with the snake-hiss voice and the face like the back end of a container truck was a delight in City Slickers. And he gave the awards night audience what they wanted: the sight of a 70-year-old actor doing press-ups. More inspiring to most of us than those garish song-and-dance numbers with which you started and intermittently punctuated your show. No, no, Oscar, I am not getting into a quarrel. Nor am I suggesting that you imitate the etiolated dullness of your cousin Bafta. He is not looking at all well. The other evening he was reduced to a haggard mask waved about in the air by Michael Aspel. When handed over for further brandishing to the Best Actor and Actress, he began to look particularly green about the gills. I shall get into trouble for writing this, of course. We take our native screen awards seriously here, although few people sit through an entire evening of them in any comfort. All those prizes given to long-serving TV producers no one has heard of, to ageing actor-knights still ambulant enough to collect them, and to lovable international female stars from an era when we actually had such things. So many speeches, so much crepitation of freshly-opened envelopes. So much clapping of the winners by the telegraphically generous losers. Is there any chance we could end all this, Oscar? That cinema could be return to being an art rather than a horse race? That we could turn our back on all that glitters in pursuit once more of what is truly gold? You do not have to answer immediately. I am arranging a small secret dinner on the Cayman Islands for you and Bafta in which we could discuss this. It will be a quiet affair: just a few hours of good food and entertainment hosted by Billy Crystal, directed by Busby Berkeley and with the menu courses read out by Goldie Hawn and Sir Richard Attenborough. I close the envelope, Best, Nigel Andrews                            *      *      * By a strange coincidence Miss Hawn is on view this week in Deceived (15, Odeon West End). It is often said that there are only four basic plots in the world. If so, this thriller written by Mary Agnes Donoghue and directed by Damian Harris (The Rachel Papers) consists of all of them put into a blender together and sliced into tiny screaming pieces. We begin romantically with Miss Hawn marrying gentle art curator John Heard. We move into mystery with her suspicion that her husband is playing hookey. We shift into grief when he 'dies' in a car accident. Then we gear-crash into Grand Guignol as Hawn and the true villain chase each other through a darkened warehouse. Amazingly the actress's expression never changes. The wide-eyed gosling features peer through the Niagara of hair, the voice tastes the dialogue ruminatively as if it were a suspicious dish (it is), and sometimes a small scream and hop will be managed in deference to a dramatic moment: say, the discovery of a corpse. If this is acting, I think I could have a go myself. Much better is Mr Heard who is an eerie Mr Nice and might be - I am giving nothing away - an equally eerie Mr Nasty. Deceived is entertaining even when it is foolish. Kuffs (15, Cannon Haymarket) is stupefying even when it manages small moments of intelligence. Watching this police thriller written and directed by Bruce E. Evans is the aesthetic equivalent of swallowing a bottle of aspirins and then hitting yourself on the head with a coal shovel to make sure. Across San Francisco swarm the men in dark blue, led by plain-clothes irregular Christian Slater who hopes to avenge his policeman brother's brutal death. A preening Mr Big (George De La Pena) dances across the city saying 'Catch me'. But the equally preening Mr Slater is too busy talking to the camera and perfecting his Jack Nicholson impersonation to devote himself as he might to the chase. It all ends in a warehouse, as things do in action films, and only careful traffic direction probably prevented Slater and company running into Hawn and company At least in an imperfect world there is Martin Scorsese. Scorsese Times 4 (ICA) is a programme of his early short films: the kind of potentially embarrassing work that many film-makers would like to wrap in a sack, weight with a stone and throw into the nearest river. But the director of Taxi Driver and GoodFellas has nothing to be ashamed of in What's A Girl Like You Doing In A Place Like This?, It's Not Just You, Murray], The Big Shave and Italianamerican. The films get longer as the titles get shorter. But longueurs themselves do not exist in Scorsese. Here is rapid cutting and balletic camera movement. Here are visual jokes Woody Allen might covet, like a prisoner's Italian spaghetti through the interview-room grille. And here are the nervy characterisation and crisis-point plotting - a con man running out of luck, a shaving session that becomes a suicide ballet - that have allowed Scorsese to create the closest thing American cinema has to modern tragedy. Finally, for the devout: two hours of La Belle Noiseuse Divertimento (15, Minema) to add to the four hours of La Belle Noiseuse. Painter Michel Piccoli once more sets out to eternalise a nude Emmanuelle Beart while wife Jane Birkin jealously looks on. Director Jacques Rivette here offers a reshuffled version as well as a (contractually obliged) shorter one. It is an offer few Rivette fans could refuse. But if there are any more variations on who does what to whom in this time-devouring, intrigue-ridden French mansion we may have to summon H. Poirot or J. Maigret.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from KBS General Bureau in Pusan] </F>   [Text] In connection with North Korea's nuclear issue, a  ROK-U.S. joint inspection has been conducted of a ROK vessel  that will be mobilized to transport U.S. military supplies in an  emergency.    The inspection was conducted at Point No. 1 of the Central  Pier of Pusan Harbor on 10 June. It has been confirmed that an  inspection was conducted of the facilities of the vessel; of the  procedure to hand over the vessel in an emergency; and of the  status of the fuel storage of No. 9 Donam, a 4,998 tonne-class  cargo vessel belonging to the Hung-A Maritime Company.    An official concerned at Pusan Harbor said: As South-North  relations have recently become tense, I understand an inspection  has been conducted of a vessel that will be mobilized in an  emergency. In an emergency, several vessels, including tankers  and passenger ships--besides the aforementioned vessel--will be  handed over to the U.S. Armed Forces.</p>

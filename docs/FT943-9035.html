			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Unilever surge Strong second quarter results from Unilever stunned the market and sent the shares soaring in the heaviest ever recorded daily turnover. Analysts had been expecting a slight fall in profits, with concerns expressed over the detergents market among other issues, all of which had served to depress the shares in recent sessions. However, Unilever turned in a healthy Pounds 611m profit - strong growth in the US and the rest of the world being compounded by good returns from speciality chemicals. Many brokers were moving their profit forecasts upwards, together with a raft of positive recommendations. Mr Carl Short at SGST, a long-term bull of the stock, said: 'There is now no reason why Unilever should be standing on a p/e discount to the market.' He upgraded his full-year forecast by Pounds 21m to Pounds 2.374bn. However, a less enthusiatic Mr Tim Potter at Smith New Court reiterated his negative stance. 'These are better results, but one quarter does not justify a re-rating.' The shares surged 55 to 1097p in hefty volume of 9.3m. At the same time, the sparkling Unilever results were being interpreted by speculative investors as a bellweather for the entire food manufacturing sector ahead of the half-time results season next month. United Biscuits gained 9 to 339p, Cadbury Schweppes 5 to 467p and Booker 7 to 441p.</p>

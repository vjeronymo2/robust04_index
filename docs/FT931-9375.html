			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Feasibility of coal plans doubted THE GOVERNMENT'S prob-lems in ending the public furore over pit closures deepened yesterday as British Coal said it doubted the feasibility of any plan which did not tackle planned growth in nuclear and gas-fired power. The company's said even the recommendations of a Commons select committee, generally considered to be more favourable to coal than measures the government is contemplating, could result in a nil increase in the market for coal after five years. A draft of the government's white paper on energy proposes slowing the planned run-down of coal stocks, cutting output from opencast mines and using subsidies to halt growth in imports. British Coal would not comment in detail on the proposals, but remarks by Mr Neil Clarke, its chairman, suggest a strong belief that they do not go far enough. He said the company's problems could not be solved simply by using subsidies to deter coal imports while the growth in gas and nuclear power continued. The draft white paper makes little if any provision for capping nuclear and gas power. Mr Clarke said: 'The market for electricity is not elastic.' If a greater role was to be found for coal then it was a question of what fuel would give way, he added. 'We risk storing up problems if we rely too much on maintaining coal stocks to sustain production rather than on switching away from other fuels,' he argued. 'Careful consideration should also be given to the business consequences of any artificial cap on the competitive coal from opencast mines.' Mr Clarke added that ordering power stations using orimulsion - an imported fuel - to fit flue gas desulphurisation equipment was unlikely to stop use of the fuel. The select committee report has been interpreted as seeking to create a market for at least an extra 16m tonnes of coal a year. But, in its response to the committee's findings, British Coal said its proposals would increase the market by 8m tonnes at most, and possibly not at all. British Coal said the report: Overstated the likely level of coal imports in 1997-98 by 16m tonnes. This was important because any subsidy would be directed at replacing imports. Understated gas burn by the equivalent of 3m tonnes. Assumed total fuel used to generate electricity would be equal to 5m more tonnes of coal than was likely. The company wants the government to explore using new gas stations at less than base-load capacity in the electricity system, delay the commissioning of the Sizewell B nuclear station and not extend the lives of magnox nuclear stations.</p>

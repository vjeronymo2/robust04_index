			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / UK Company News: Acorn back to annual profit ACORN COMPUTER Group covered from its first half loss to record a pre-tax profit of Pounds 274,000 for 1991, compared to Pounds 1.58m. The previous year included Pounds 561,000 exceptional credits. Sales in the second half regained the levels of previous years to finish at Pounds 40.9m (Pounds 45.5m), gross margins were improved and operating expenses well controlled. With interest costs falling as the cash position improved, the second half provided a profit of Pounds 694,000. Earnings for the year were 0.4p (2.4p). Over the year the opening overdraft of Pounds 6.5m was turned into a cash balance of Pounds 1.4m by December 31. The group retained its position as the leading supplier in its major market, UK education. However, spending in the consumer market was severely hit by the recession. The Australian and New Zealand companies were making good progress.</p>

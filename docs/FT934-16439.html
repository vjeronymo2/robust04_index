			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: Office products fall hits J Crean A REDUCED contribution from its office products division meant pre-tax profits of James Crean, the Dublin-based industrial holding company, slipped from IPounds 7.78m to IPounds 7.68m (Pounds 7.34m) in the first half of 1993. Sales grew 8.5 per cent to IPounds 120.9m, while earnings per share edged up to 12.8p (12.5p) because of the buy-out in January of the minority in Valley Fresh Foods and a slightly lower tax charge. An interim dividend of 5.635p (7.865p) is declared but a final of not less than 6.865p is forecast for a maintained total of 12.5p. The directors have reiterated their policy of a progressive dividend policy. Crean blamed a Pounds 1.1m fall to Pounds 600,000 in profits from office products on adverse market circumstances. Elsewhere, food and beverages turned in Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 4.8m), Inishtech made Pounds 4m (Pounds 3.7m) and electrical wholesaling Pounds 600,000 (Pounds 700,000). Directors said the trading pattern had not changed materially since the end of June and with the exception of office products, all operating divisions continued to perform satisfactorily. Market conditions are expected to remain difficult for the office products businesses for some time. The US contributed the bulk of profits with Pounds 5m (Pounds 4.4m), helped by a more favourable dollar/punt rate. Irish profits were unchanged at Pounds 1.1m, while the European performance was lower at Pounds 4.7m (Pounds 5.4m). Group borrowings at June 30 were IPounds 86m, against IPounds 72m at the same time last year and IPounds 70m at the year end. This represented gearing of 93 per cent, compared with 77 per cent at the year end. Profits of TRD Group were included up to the date of disposal in June.</p>

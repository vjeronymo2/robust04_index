			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Once More About the Russian-Georgian Treaty: The </F> Duma Committee for CIS Affairs Reaches Conclusions: The  Document"    [Text] Having attentively studied in the course of closed  parliamentary hearings the Russian-Georgian treaty acts that  were signed on 9 October 1993 in Moscow and on 3 February 1994  in Tbilisi, and having heard the opinions of officials, deputies  of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation, experts and  consultants, and representatives of the Georgian, South Ossetian  and Abkhazian sides, the Committee for CIS Affairs and Relations  With Fellow Countrymen came to the following conclusions:    1. ...In recognizing the territorial integrity of the  Republic of Georgia on several occasions in the text of the  treaty and in other agreements, the parties base themselves on  ideas about the territory of the former Georgian Soviet  Socialist Republic. There is no doubt of this, and the hearing  once again confirmed this. Inasmuch as the Georgian side is not  in control of the situation on a significant part of the  territory of the former GSSR, we are unable to count on  Georgia's fulfillment of all of its treaty obligations. It was  noted on several occasions that unless the problems of Georgia's  internal structure are settled, and unless there are guarantees  of full and honorable resolution of the Abkhazian and South  Ossetian problems, which generated bloody conflicts involving  many of our fellow countrymen in the recent past, some articles  of the treaty (chiefly articles 3 and 4) will, in the event of  its ratification, impose a unilateral obligation on Russia to  arm the Georgian side, support its attempts to regain control  over lost regions, and cut off attempts to assist them (the  regions.--NG) from Russian territory in the event of escalation  of the military conflict. We must note that by accepting  obligations before Georgia in the Caucasus that would be  difficult to fulfill even for Russia, we lose the trust of the  other parties to the conflict, and do damage to our intermediary  peacekeeping mission.    ...We reject the capability of the Georgian side to  guarantee  strict fulfillment of the provisions of the treaty regarding  nontransfer of armament and military equipment and technology to  third parties.    ...The members of the committee support the oral statement  by  RF President B. N. Yeltsin regarding postponement of submission  of the treaty, signed on 3 February 1994, for ratification to  the Federal Assembly until the conflicts in Abkhazia and South  Ossetia are settled. What we cannot understand in any way is  this: For what purpose is Russia, as represented by its supreme  official, to sign the new treaty, which the president does not  intend to submit for ratification, before such a settlement is  reached, before Russian demarcation forces are introduced on the  line of confrontation along the Ingura River, and before the  earlier treaty between Russian and Georgia dated 9 October 1993  is submitted for ratification?    ...2. What raises certain concerns in the Committee for CIS  Affairs is not the fact itself that besides the treaty an entire  list of Russian-Georgian agreements have been signed, including  many that are useful and necessary, but that they are not being  examined as supplements to and a consequence of the Treaty on  Friendship, Good-Neighbor Relations and Cooperation that was  concurrently signed and is now subject to ratification. As an  example these agreements also include ones like the "Agreement  on the Status and Conditions of Operation of Russian Border  Troops Located in the Georgian Republic," which foresees  transfer of real and movable military property, assistance in  personnel training and so on. Members of the committee did not  receive an answer in the course of the hearings to the question  as to why Article 33 of this agreement, in contrast to the  analogous article of the concurrently signed treaty, foresees  its enactment "from the day of exchange of written certificates  of fulfillment of internal government procedures by the Parties  necessary for its enactment," rather than making a direct  reference to the need for its ratification.    ...All the committee has in this regard is the "Protocol on  the Meeting of Delegations of the RF and the Georgian Republic,"  signed on 3 February of this year by P. Grachev and O.  Patsatsiya. The protocol, which requires no ratification,  documents only the principle of creating Russian military bases  in the Georgian Republic. It is known from statements made at  the hearings by the RF minister of defense and representatives  of the Defense Ministry that the reference is to the bases in  Vaziani, Akhalkalaki and Batumi, with the latter to have  branches in Gudauty and Sukhumi. The Abkhazian Supreme Council  has already declared that it does not recognize any agreements  of which it is not a participant in regard to territory under  its control (that is, Gudauty and Sukhumi).    ...3. Examining the general problems of the Russian-Georgian  agreements, the Committee for CIS Affairs notes that  speculations regarding a unilateral advantage for Russia in the  signed Russian-Georgian treaty acts do not withstand criticism.  The economic assistance provided to the government of the  Georgian Republic, which is increasing the amount of Russia's  internal government debt, cannot as yet be estimated in absolute  figures because we do not have data by which to appraise the  value of buildings and structures being transferred to the  Georgian Republic, the prices of the military equipment, arms  and technology, the cost of leasing military facilities on  Georgian territory and so on. Implementation of the agreements  will mean reduction of Russian military presence in Georgia. No  matter how some superficial conclusions in the press may try to  make us believe the reverse, replacement of Russian divisions in  Akhalkalaki and Batumi by regiments can in no way be said to be  an expansion of military presence. As for growth of our military  influence as a result of equipment deliveries and personnel  training, the history of Russia and the USSR contains many cases  in which equipment and personnel that we trained were used  against us (German armament in the 1920s-1930s, assistance to  the People's Republic of China after the Second World War, and  so on.</p>

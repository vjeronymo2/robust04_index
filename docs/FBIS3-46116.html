In 1993, the public security, procuratorial and judicial  organs across the province and the broad masses of public  security, procuratorial and judicial cadres and policemen acted  in close connection with the central task of economic  construction under the leadership of the provincial party  committee and governments at all levels, further strengthened  and improved public security work, dealt strict blows to serious  criminal activities, concentrated efforts on investigating and  handling major and appalling criminal cases, strengthened  comprehensive management of public security, actively provided  legal service for reform, opening up and economic construction,  effectively safeguarded political and social stability in the  whole province, and made important contributions to economic and  social development. The provincial party committee has decided  that the general guiding ideology of public security,  procuratorial and judicial work in 1994 is to conscientiously  implement the guidelines of the third plenary session of the  14th CPC Central Committee and of the national public security,  procuratorial and judicial work conference, act in close  connection with the central task of economic construction,  pinpoint the priorities, comprehensively promote this work, give  full play to the functional role of public security,  procuratorial and judicial organs, safeguard political and  social stability, and strive to create a good social environment  for building the socialist market economic system.    Xie Yong pointed out: In the past year, all localities  across the province acted in line with the plans of the  provincial party committee, consistently considered safeguarding  political stability as the task of prime importance, did lots of  painstaking and meticulous work, and succeeded in maintaining  political stability in the whole province. This year we should  realistically safeguard political stability as the task of prime  importance, acted in close connection with the key aspect of  correctly handling the internal contradictions of the people,  strive to deeply and meticulously carry out this work, and try  by all possible means to maintain political stability in the  whole province. Party committees and governments as well as  public security, procuratorial and judicial departments at all  levels should properly handle the relations of stability,  reform, and development, and maintain political stability during  the whole course of reform. When we issue one reform measure,  we should give consideration to the possible influence that may  cause to political stability, purposefully adopt preventive  measures, and strive to reduce social turbulence. It is  necessary to realistically strengthen ideological and political  work, strive to dissolve social contradictions, be good at  hearing the voice of the masses and using the democratic,  persuasive, and educational methods to improve the ideological  feelings of the people. All localities should act in line with  the demand of the provincial party committee, pay great  attention to the living of workers of enterprises with  difficulties, actively raise funds to pay the wages of workers  left in arrears, and help them solve practical difficulties.  Party and government leaders and relevant departments at all  levels should pay full attention to the hot issues which the  masses show strong reactions, adopt effective measures and solve  them one by one in an effort to calm the feelings of the masses  and guarantee social stability.    Xie Yong pointed out: To further successfully carry out the  public security comprehensive management work under the new  situation, this year all localities should conscientiously  implement the central stipulations on implementing the  leadership responsibility system in comprehensive management of  public security, further implement the principle that those who  takes charge of the work should assume full responsibility and  the system of negating everything if one fails to do a good job  in public security work, help the party and government leaders  at all levels grasp the comprehensive improvement of public  security.    Xie Yong emphatically pointed out: This year we should  regard cracking major cases, dealing blows to criminal cliques,  and capturing escaped criminals as the priorities, strengthen  routine work, organize special struggle in a timely manner,  resolutely check the upward trend of major cases, such as  murder, robbery, rape, major theft, and serious crimes on  violence. To do a good job in dealing strict blows to  criminals, we must conscientiously solve the problem of failing  to strictly enforce law and further raise the quality of dealing  blows and social effect. It is necessary to conscientiously  consolidate cultural places, strengthen control over the  criminal trend and fugitive criminals in society, actively  conduct activity on running villages in line with law, and  implement democratic management.</p>

			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD PARK;  </P> <P> GARCIA DOES BETTER THAN OLD FRIEND  </P> <P> Julio Garcia fared a lot better Saturday at Hollywood Park than his old friend  did in Kentucky.  </P> <P> Mister Frisky's rider for 10 of his 13 victories in Puerto Rico, Garcia won the  second race aboard Syrian Winter, a maiden filly trained, ironically by Laz  Barrera, then returned to score a $28.60 victory on Prospectors Gamble in the  $110,200 Triple Bend Handicap.  </P> <P> John Sadler looked to have a stranglehold on the seven-furlong Triple Bend with  his duo of Olympic Prospect and Frost Free. The former, who had won six of his  10 previous starts at Inglewood, was a 7-10 favorite.  </P> <P> A month after the best effort of his life, Olympic Prospect went flat. Although  he had a fast half-mile (21 2/5 and 43 3/5), the Northern Jove gelding appeared  to be going easily under David Flores.  </P> <P> However, he surrendered without a struggle in the final eighth of a mile and  wound up fifth. Frost Free, who is partial to Santa Anita, was fourth.  </P> <P> Fourth down the backside, Prospectors Gamble got the lead in midstretch and  beat Raise A Stanza by nearly two lengths in 1:21 2/5.  </P> <P> Raise A Stanza, the 4-1 second choice, was two lengths better than Hot  Operator.  </P> <P> Trainer Wallace Dollase thought Itsallgreektome might be short for the $111,050  Spotlight Breeders' Cup Handicap, which was run two races before the Triple  Bend.  </P> <P> Jockey Corey Nakatani didn't think the 3-year-old son of Sovereign Dancer had  much chance against Warcraft, Somethingdifferent and six others in the mile  turf race.  </P> <P> Itsallgreektome proved both of them wrong.  </P> <P> Making his grass debut and in his first start as a gelding -- a change not  listed in either the Daily Racing Form or the track's official program,  although it was reported by Dollase to the proper people -- Itsallgreektome, a  31-1 shot, held off Warcraft to win by a nose in 1:34 2/5.  </P> <P> "He ran to his work (48 2/5 on the turf Thursday morning), but actually I  thought he might come up a little short," Dollase said. "He was very studdish  and we castrated him after his last race (March 4). It made a big difference."  </P> <P> Warcraft, the 8-5 favorite, didn't have the best of trips in his first grass  outing.  </P> <P> "He ran well, but he ran spotty," trainer Charlie Whittingham said. "I don't  know about the Preakness. I'll think about it."  </P> <P> If Unbridled was your pick in the Kentucky Derby, Hollywood Park was the place  to be Saturday.  </P> <P> The 10-1 fourth choice at Churchill Downs, Unbridled paid $44 at Inglewood. The  $2 exacta coupling him with Summer Squall paid $145.20 locally, compared to  $65.80 in Kentucky.  </P> <P> The $930,617 handled at Hollywood Park was a record for a $2 exacta pool.  Combined, Hollywood Park and the 10 intertrack locations handled $2,597,453 on  the race and this was also a record for a single race.  </P></p>

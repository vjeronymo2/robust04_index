			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Penalties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Forty-eight commenters suggested that the final rule not reflect the strict liability language of the proposed rule. The majority believed that servicers should not be held liable for clerical errors, inadvertent acts, or acts of nature. They also indicated that servicers should not be liable for expending ``best and reasonable efforts'' in complying with the requirements. The comments advocated that penalties be based on practices and patterns of noncompliance. The MBA concurred and stated that ``*&blank;*&blank;* HUD should determine violations that warrant a monetary penalty based on a pattern or practice of noncompliance. Penalties would be justified in those cases where the servicer made the same error repeatedly.'' Ten comments suggested that the rule include a cure period, in which the servicer could submit a corrective statement to a borrower within 60 days of discovering the error. They pointed out that similar defenses are permitted by other consumer protection statutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Strict liability is a term used in product liability law and HUD misapplied the term in the proposed rule. The final rule removes any reference to a strict liability standard. However, HUD continues the statutory distinction between unintentional and intentional violations. Violations do not require any proof of intent. The statute provides for more serious penalties in cases of a servicer's intentional disregard for the statute's requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a statement of its enforcement policy, the Department is likely to pursue cases involving a pattern and practice of noncompliance more vigorously than solitary or minor transgressions of these provisions. HUD is less likely to enforce penalties in cases where the servicer has taken prompt corrective action on its own initiative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Civil Penalties Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HUD received eight comments concerning the civil penalties procedures provisions. They suggested that HUD lengthen the time for servicers to prepare an adequate defense. The commenters suggested that the time to respond to a notice of intent to impose penalties be extended from 20 to 30 days. They wanted HUD to extend the period in which a servicer presents its evidence from 45 to 60 days. They also recommended extending the period for filing for judicial review of a decision from 20 to 30 days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response, the Department extends from 20 to 30 days the initial response period to HUD's notice of intent to impose penalties. Because the rule permits the servicer to request additional time from the administrative law judge, HUD sees no need to extend the time for presenting evidence. Responding to comments, the final rule provides 30 days for a party to file a petition seeking judicial review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Financial Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Seventeen commenters were concerned about the rule's effect upon the value of mortgage servicing rights. They estimated that servicing rights may be reduced in value by 3 to 20 percent. Three commenters requested that the final rule be applicable only to loans originated after the effective date, thus resulting in less impact on the value of servicing rights. Four stated that capital structures would be negatively affected for institutions with servicing rights regulated by government agencies (e.g., FDIC, OCC, OTS, Federal Reserve Board).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department recognizes that the rule has an adverse effect on the pricing of mortgage servicing. HUD's issuance of the December 3, 1993, proposed rule has already affected the value of mortgage servicing pricing. However, as indicated above, the Department believes that the three-year phase-in period somewhat tempers this effect. The phase-in period allows servicers to recoup the greatest value on their servicing rights in the early years of a mortgage loan, while the rule moves the industry to a simpler system that protects consumers as soon as practicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Legal Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Twenty-three commenters questioned HUD's statutory authority to mandate interest-free loans to borrowers under RESPA. Five stated that the final rule should address compliance issues with individual State requirements. One commenter indicated that HUD left unaddressed how State rules take precedence or supersede the final rule. One respondent requested that the rule clarify whether RESPA establishes an escrow ceiling cushion and does not preempt State law or contracts between lenders and borrowers. A second stated that the final rule should address the impact the regulations will have on contractual relationships related to securitization arrangements. A third requested clarification of loans that are exempt from RESPA provisions pending HUD's final rule. Four commenters believed that the proposed rule could lead to an increase in escrow class action suits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department believes that it has full legal authority and administrative discretion to implement these escrow accounting regulations. Section 19(a) of RESPA empowers the Secretary to prescribe rules and regulations to achieve the purpose of the Act. This final rule reflects HUD's interpretation of the statute and HUD's reaction to public comments on the proposed rule. In issuing this rule, HUD considers the needs of borrowers and servicers and interprets the statute to respond to those needs. For example, in response to comments regarding interest-free loans, HUD recast certain provisions in the final rule. One of HUD's goals here is to promote Section 6's provisions that disbursements from escrow be made timely. At the same time, the final rule responds to servicers' needs for prompt reimbursement of their advances, and is fair to the borrower.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding the possible preemption of State laws, the Department recognizes that many of the States have enacted laws relating to escrow accounts. Section 18 of RESPA provides: ``This Act does not annul, alter, or affect, or exempt any person subject to the provisions of (RESPA) from complying with, the laws of any State with respect to settlement practices, except to the extent that those laws are inconsistent with any provision of (RESPA), and then only to the extent of the inconsistency.'' 12 USC 2616. Given this statutory language, and further statutory instruction that a state statute is not to be preempted if it gives greater protection to the consumer, the Department believes it should make specific preemption decisions on a case-by-case basis. The current RESPA rule (&sect;3500.13(c)) sets forth provisions for requesting preemption determinations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Conforming FHA Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because some provisions in this final rule affect existing FHA regulations, this rule amends 24 CFR parts 203 and 234 to conform with these regulatory changes. HUD therefore amends &sect;203.550(a) to clarify that the FHA mortgagee shall use the procedures contained in &sect;3500.17 to compute the amount of escrow, the methods of collection and accounting, and the disbursement of escrow account items. HUD also amends &sect;234.38 to conform with the final rule, and retains the language of &sect;203.550(c) that permits FHA mortgagees to estimate escrow requirements based on the probable payments required for special assessment items, such as water purification escrow funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Other Matters <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with 40 CFR 1508.4 of the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality and 24 CFR 50.20 of the HUD regulations, the policies and procedures contained in this rule do not affect a physical structure or property and relate only to statutorily required accounting and reporting procedures, and, therefore, are categorically excluded from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule constitutes a ``significant regulatory action'' as that term is defined in section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review issued by the President on September 30, 1993. A preliminary review of the rule indicated that it might, as defined in that Order, have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more. Accordingly, a regulatory impact analysis was prepared and is available for review and inspection in Room 10276, Rules Docket Clerk, Office of the General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20410-0500.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this rule before publication and by approving it certifies that this rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The requirements of the proposed rule are directed toward the accounting procedures used in the mortgage servicing industry and the disclosure to consumers of related information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

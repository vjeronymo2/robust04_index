			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLATFORM;  </P> <P> NO FREE FARES  </P> <P> (I don't think there will) be a lot of free riders. I think the only places  you'll find that will be affected will be the long-distance lines, where you  have the long headways.  </P> <P> But most of the city lines are geared to 6-to-10-minute (trips), and I don't  think you're going to have many (schedule delays) there.  </P> <P> Even if a bus breaks down, you still are going to be within that 12-to-14  minute interval. Most major lines run a very good schedule.  </P> <P> I think the idea is good, and it might make people feel a little better about  (riding the bus), but I think most people -- especially working people -- they  are not concerned with saving money (in this particular area). They're just  concerned with getting where they want to go on time. I don't foresee (free  fares), although I see a bunch of youngsters in certain areas who will try it  for a while just to keep from paying the fare.  </P></p>

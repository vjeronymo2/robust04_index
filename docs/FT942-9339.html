			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Italy has no time to catch breath For Italy's government and opposition parties, the European elections come at an awkward time. The country is still catching its breath after the March general elections which produced a landslide victory for Mr Silvio Berlusconi, sworn in as prime minister last week at the helm of the right-wing Freedom Alliance. By June 12, the Berlusconi government will have been less than a month in office - assuming it remains in place after this week's parliamentary vote of confidence. The opposition parties, for their part, fear they will have too little time to reassess their performance and make a fresh impact on the electorate. The election will be about personalities more than issues. It seems likely to result in a general endorsement of Mr Berlusconi, although not necessarily of his generally sceptical views about the European Union. According to latest opinion polls, his Forza Italia movement will obtain 25 per cent or more of the vote - almost five percentage points more than in March. Mr Berlusconi is heading the Forza Italia list in all five of the electoral colleges into which Italy is divided for the European elections. This practice is being followed by all the main political leaders. Of the 1,331 candidates for the 87 seats, 156 are standing in more than one electoral college. Although his position as prime minister would rule out his attendance at the Strasbourg assembly, Mr Berlusconi hopes his aura of popularity will lend a general glow to Forza Italia. Only five months old, it cannot yet be considered a fully fledged party, and has not even held a constituent congress. Though better funded than any other party, its organisation is confused. The main purpose of Forza Italia's 13,000 supporters' clubs around the country was to get Mr Berlusconi elected prime minister. Their function in the European elections is less clear. Mr Berlusconi will be helped by favourable coverage provided by his own Fininvest television network, as well as by the increasingly obsequious position taken by the state-run RAI networks. Mr Berlusconi's position gives rise to a clear risk of conflict of interest. Fininvest's advertising agency recently sent all parliamentary parties a faxed letter offering advertising spots for the European elections on Fininvest's three channels. In addition to the name of the advertising agency, Publitalita, the paper bearing the message was headed by the name Forza Italia - an oversight which caused a chorus of protest. Forza Italia's gains are likely to be at the expense of the centre - the various fragmented parts of the Christian Democrats which were dissolved in the run-up to the March elections. by Forza Italia, the most closely-watched development will be the vote obtained by the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi. The League emerged from the March polls with the largest number of deputies within the Freedom Alliance, thanks to its alliance with Forza Italia. Aware that it is competing for votes with Forza Italia in the north, the League has chosen to fight these elections alone, fielding its best known local names, including the mayors of such northern cities as Alessandria and Milan. In contrast to other parties, which are often putting up candidates who failed to win seats in the general elections, the League is trying to show its belief in grass-roots democracy. If the League fares badly in the European elections, its position within the Berlusconi government will be weakened. This would in turn make the League a more unreliable ally. In contrast to the League, Mr Berlusconi's other main partner in government, the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance, has benefited from the mantle of respectability offered by Mr Berlusconi. The MSI may thus improve its share of the vote, perhaps at the expense of Forza Italia in southern Italy.</p>

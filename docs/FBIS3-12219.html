			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that the PLO  has sent the Israeli Government a series of questions about  matters of principle. Israel's replies to these queries would  help the organization decide its position regarding the  continuation of the peace negotiations. The list of questions  was handed to Major General Dani Rothschild by Palestinian  delegate Sa'ib 'Urayqat. The questions deal with the  confiscation of the settlers' weapons, the evacuation of the  settlement of Netzarim in the Gaza Strip, and the stationing of  an international force in the territories.    At today's cabinet session, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres  said that Israel could meet the Palestinian demands on certain  issues; however, other demands, such as the stationing of an  international force in the territories, would be rejected.</p>

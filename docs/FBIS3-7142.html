In his report to the committee,  he raved about someone's nonexistent provocation, babbled that  strong retaliatory actions would be taken, and that he has  mapped out a strategy to link this with reunification if  necessary.    This is a clear incitement to achieve reunification through  a  northward invasion which by no accounts can ever be ignored.    The warmonger's blurting out about retaliatory actions  directly means a war. In addition, his remark that this would  be used as the opportunity to realize reunification means that  South Korea will achieve reunification through a northward  invasion by borrowing power from the United States. Rascal Yi  Pyong-tae frankly admitted this time that it is mapping a  strategy to realize the goal of invasion.    This clearly shows what stage the adventurous war  provocative  maneuvers waged against us by the Kim Yong-sam traitorous group  have reached.    On 22 February, traitorous Kim Yong-sam called puppet  military chieftains to Chongwadae [the presidential office] to  plot a war and ordered the entire puppet Armed Forces to assume  an emergency alert posture. Following this, the puppet defense  minister emerged at the National Assembly and made an outburst  agitating a northward invasion. These facts cannot on any  account be incidental.    All of these facts show that the Kim Yong-sam clique, under  the aegis of the U.S. imperialists, are captured with its  ambition to achieve reunification by invading and thus  prevailing over the North. In addition, these clearly expose  the fact that its maneuvers of heightening the tension that they  have perpetrated up to now by finding faults with our  nonexistent nuclear issue, are a premeditated provocation to  open the road for northward invasion.</p>

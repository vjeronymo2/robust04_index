			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HINTS FROM HELOISE: EVERYTHING ALWAYS HAS ANOTHER USE, EVEN RUINED STOVE-BURNER  COVERS  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I love those decorative stove-burner covers, but it never fails:  I burn one a month. For some reason I turn the wrong burner on.  </P> <P> Even though I have about five burned covers, I didn't throw them away. They're  great to use as saucers under potted plants. It's nice to know I didn't waste  anything. There's usually another use for something other than what it was made  for.  </P> <P>  -- TERRI, Miami  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: After mixing most of the ingredients for a recipe, I reached for  the brown sugar only to discover it was as hard as a rock. I came up with a  great idea. I grated the sugar with my cheese grater. I couldn't believe how  well it worked.  </P> <P>  -- JODI, Portland  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: Whenever I gave my children soup for lunch they would burn their  mouths because they were in a hurry to get back out and play.  </P> <P> That doesn't happen any more since I put an ice cube in each bowl of soup. I  tell them to stir it until it melts, then the soup is ready to eat.  </P> <P>  -- CAROL, Reno, Nev.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I'm usually the mom that is elected to make cupcakes for my  child's class. It was always a messy job using the ladle to fill each cup. The  batter dripped all over, but I've solved that problem. I use a pitcher. It  fills the cups without spills and I don't waste a drop.  </P> <P>  -- LAURA, Sarasota, Fla.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I've been married only a few months and everything about cooking  is new to me. I've made a few good meals but there's one thing I desperately  need help with: making gravy.  </P> <P> How do I make brown gravy without lumps? I put flour in hot meat drippings but  it always comes out full of lumps.  </P> <P>  -- CARRIE, Phoenix  </P> <P> DEAR CARRIE: One of the tricks is to use cold water. In a small jar, mix  together flour and enough cold water to make a thin liquid, put the lid on and  shake vigorously to dissolve all lumps. Then all you have to do is add it to  the drippings and mix as you're pouring it.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: Not long ago I read a hint in your column on keeping plastic  grocery bags stored neatly. I have another tip that works great too.  </P> <P> When I grocery shop I ask for plastic bags instead of paper. All I did was bend  the ends of a hanger all the way up and hung it on a nail in my pantry. I slip  the handles of the bags over the ends of the hanger. It holds quite a few bags  and keeps them neat and orderly.  </P> <P>  -- A READER, Seattle  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I recently went to a party a friend had and she had a clever idea  for a condiment holder. She served a dip for vegetables in a bell pepper. She  simply cut off the top of the pepper, removed the seeds, then rinsed it well  and added the dressing.  </P> <P>  -- GLORIA, Cincinnati, Ohio  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: A friend and I are in disagreement over storage of an opened  bottle of catsup.  </P> <P> I say that after opening the bottle, it should be stored in the refrigerator.  My friend says that there are no printed directions anywhere on the bottle  instructing refrigeration after opening so he stores his opened bottle in a  kitchen cabinet.  </P> <P> I always thought it was common knowledge to store an opened catsup bottle in  the refrigerator. Does it hurt if it's not refrigerated? Which way is correct?  </P> <P>  -- MARY, Elizabethtown, Ky.  </P> <P> DEAR MARY: The proper way to store a bottle of catsup after opening it is  solely up to the user unless your particular brand states that it should be  refrigerated after opening (most do not). The vinegar content in catsup acts as  a preservative, which enables most brands to be stored on the pantry shelf  after opening.  </P> <P> If you do not use catsup often, you might want to store an opened bottle in the  refrigerator to help it retain longer-lasting flavor, since storing an opened  bottle at room temperature on a pantry shelf will reduce its shelf life.  </P> <P> The decision mainly involves the label directions, usage and your personal  preference.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: After unsuccessfully searching through several stores that  specialize in kitchen products, I hit upon a wonderful idea for a way to  transfer those chopped vegetables from my cutting board to my wok.  </P> <P> I purchased a brightly colored plastic dustpan. After chopping all my  vegetables, I load them all on the dustpan and add them to the wok all at once,  instead of handfuls at a time.  </P> <P> My "vegetable dustpan" has proven to be very helpful in my kitchen and I have  instructed my family that it does not go on the floor for collecting dirt.  </P> <P>  -- CARROL, Houston  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I found the easiest way to get up the stuff in the oven when  cleaning it.  </P> <P> I use a short-handled window squeegee to scrape all the stuff into the center  of the oven, then onto a piece of paper and into the garbage. I wipe down the  inside of the oven with a wet rag and it's finished.  </P> <P>  -- J. J., Stayton, Ore.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: Here's a hint to keep salt shakeable from the salt shaker even  during the most humid months.  </P> <P> I have heard about putting crushed crackers or rice inside the salt shaker to  keep it free-flowing, but I just upend a small clear jelly glass over the  shaker. This keeps the salt dry as a bone and always ready for a quick shake.  </P> <P>  -- R. J., Gonzales, Tex.  </P></p>

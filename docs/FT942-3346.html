			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Housewives run the economy as husbands chat Sir, Your correspondent, Alexander Nicoll, seems surprised that a 'housewife' could achieve what Mrs Radia Kader has achieved ('Housewife who built empire from nothing', June 9). I would draw his attention to the book of Proverbs, chapter 31, verses 10 to the end. There he will find that housewives have in the past been responsible for the economy. The husbands sat by the gate chatting - the sum total of their contribution. J E Fairweather, 28 Furnival Mansions, Wells Street, London W1P 3FF</p>

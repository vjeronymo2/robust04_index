			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Equity Markets: Other Markets FRANKFURT BHF Bank reports on Wednesday, with analysts looking for a rise in operating profits of around 20 per cent. Hoare Govett expects that further growth in profits this year will not be fully matched at the earnings level after the bank's recent rights issue. Full-year figures come from Deutsche Bank on Thursday. The broker expects a 19 per cent rise in pre-tax profit, after extraordinary items, in spite of the bank's steep increase in allocations to risk provisioning. ZURICH Ciba, which last week launched an application to produce a low-cost version of Glaxo's Zantac ulcer medication in the US, is due to outline full-year sales and profit figures tomorrow. The chemicals and pharmaceuticals reiterated its forecast of an increase in net income for the full year when it unveiled an 8.3 per cent upturn in sales in the third quarter. Jelmoli, the leading department store group, is due to report tomorrow, with analysts expecting net profits up almost 200 per cent. Forbo, the floor and wall coverings group, reports today and Bobst, the packaging machinery group, produces 1993 figures tomorrow, as does Lindt &amp; Sprungli, the fine-chocolate group.

Aegon, the Netherlands' second largest insurance company, reports on Thursday. Consensus estimates are for a 5 per cent fall in net annual profits. MILAN The country will be spending a second day at the polls today.

Rinascente, Italy's largest retailer, reports today. TOKYO Investors are bracing themselves for a volatile week as the business year ends on Thursday. Companies are expected to continue profit-taking to support dwindling profits while the prospect of higher interest rates following the plunge in the bond markets is undermining confidence.</p>

Hu Jintao, member  of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political  Bureau, attended the party. On behalf of the party Central  Committee and the State Council, Li Lanqing, member of the CPC  Central Committee Political Bureau and vice premier of the State  Council, extended festival greetings to comrades who have  returned to China after completion of their studies abroad and  are now industriously working on the various fronts; to the  personnel who are still studying abroad far away from their  relatives; and to their dependents.    Before the start of the performances, Hu Jintao and Li  Lanqing met with more than 20 representatives of returned  personnel who had made outstanding contributions to the country,  having a cordial conversation with them. More than 6,000  returned students from Beijing and Tienjin, as well as personnel  engaged in the work of sending students to study overseas,  gathered in the hall to greet the new year. The evening party  was presided over by the State Education Commission's Zhu  Kaixuan.    In his speech, Li Lanqing thanked the comrades of  departments, localities, and universities and schools who have  always supported and attached importance to the work of sending  students overseas and helping them return home, and who have  given full play to the role of students who have returned from  abroad. He also thanked all educators who have been engaged in  training qualified personnel.    He stated: Going to study overseas is closely related to the  great cause of reform and opening up to the outside world. Over  the past 15 years, China has sent more than 200,000 students to  study overseas, and 70,000 of them have returned to China.  These returned students, as well as those who returned later  on, have played an important role in reform, opening up to the  outside world, and the modernization drive. Many of them have  made outstanding contributions. Your hard work and dedication  have not only won the respect of society but have been affirmed  by it.    Li Lanqing pointed out: The present domestic and  international situations are very conducive to our modernization  drive. Our country is seizing favorable opportunities,  deepening reform, opening up wider to the outside world,  promoting development, safeguarding stability, and making  efforts to establish a socialist market economy and promote the  development of productive forces. To realize our goal, we must  open up wider to the outside world, boldly absorb and learn from  all civilized achievements created by mankind, and make use of  the strong points of foreign countries; we must follow  scientific and technological developments throughout the world,  make continuous innovations in this field, and strive to carve  up a position in the field of high science and technology. Li  Lanqing said: In this respect, the students who are studying  abroad shoulder a heavy but glorious mission as they have  knowledge and experience in international exchanges. The  motherland and the people hope the returned students will work  harder and continue to make new contributions. He said: Those  personnel who are still studying abroad love the motherland,  show concern for the country's construction and development, and  have done great of work in this respect. Comrade Deng Xiaoping  has said: "To make contributions, it is better to return to the  country." We warmly welcome more students studying abroad to  return home to make contributions to the country.    Li Lanqing added: In the days to come, it is hoped all  localities, departments, and universities and schools will  continue to earnestly implement the principle of "supporting  studying overseas, encouraging a return to the country, and  ensuring freedom in coming and going" in order to further  improve the work of helping students studying abroad return home  and to create a good working and living environment for returned  students so as to enable them to play a role and make still  greater contributions in the great cause of reform, opening up  to the outside world, and the modernization drive.    At the evening party, literary and art workers in Beijing,  as  well as representatives of the students who have returned from  abroad, staged colorful performances on the same stage.    Buhe, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the  National  People's Congress, as well as responsible persons of the  Organizational, Propaganda, and United Work Departments of the  CPC Central Committee; the State Science and Technology  Commission; the Ministry of Personnel; the Ministry of Culture;  the Chinese Academy of Sciences; the CYL Central Committee; the  Political Department of the Liberation Army; and relevant  departments of Beijing Municipality attended the party.</p>

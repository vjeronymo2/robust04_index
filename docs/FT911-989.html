			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Letter: Risk cover for export credits Sir, It would appear from your report (Parliament and Politics, May 2) that Mr Peter Lilley, the trade and industry secretary, was suggesting that the EC countries relied on the private market for export credit cover in the short term field. I think it is important that everybody is clear that other EC governments provide the actual cover for Third World risk and have special relationships with the insurers, be they state owned or private sector.

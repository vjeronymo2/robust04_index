			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party at Brighton: Sale of BR unit to be speeded up MR JOHN MACGREGOR yest-erday signalled that the government will press ahead faster than expected with the sale of Red Star, British Rail's lossmaking express parcels service, as part of a six-point transport privatisation programme. In a speech which concluded with a ringing endorsement of the prime minister's stance on Maastricht, the transport secretary also revealed that London's buses would be privatised in 1993 and that the first round of railway passenger franchises would be introduced a year later. He remained tight-lipped on the future of the Jubilee Line, however, commenting only that the government's spending ambitions had to be contained 'at a time when industry itself will suffer if public expenditure is not kept within proper borrowing limits'. Mr MacGregor told representatives that he had 'just' authorised the sale of Red Star, which last year lost Pounds 12m on a turnover of Pounds 60m, and hoped to have completed the disposal of BR's other freight and parcels services before 1994 'once we have the legislative authority.' The government expects to receive the first bids for Red Star at once and anticipates concluding a deal next year. It can proceed to authorise a sale without legislation since the unit is not part of BR's core business. Claiming that the six-point programme resulted from popular demand, he said the privatisation of London Buses would be followed by a deregulation bill. In the year to March, London Buses collected Pounds 376m in fares but cost Pounds 458m to run. Three years ago, it was split into 12 subsidiaries as a prelude to privatisation. Mr MacGregor said a consultation paper on the working of the franchising system for railway passenger services would be published next week, with a BR bill coming in November. He said BR would 'not be able to bid for any franchise.' There had been 'sufficient enthusiasm to show that the first round of passenger franchises will be successful'.</p>

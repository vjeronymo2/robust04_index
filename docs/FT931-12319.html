			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: Daf secures short-term backing from creditors DAF, the troubled Dutch truckmaker, has secured promises from its creditors that they will seek to arrange short-term financial banking for the company, but has yet to reach full and final agreement on long-term restructuring. Mr Cor Baan, Daf's chairman, said a 'minority of the parties' involved in the search for ways to secure the company's future needed more time to study certain 'facets' of Daf's proposed restructuring plan. He said the additional investigations would be completed as soon as possible, but could not say when the Daf rescue plan would be unveiled. Twice this week Daf has called a press conference to announce the plan, only to say that the talks had yet to yield a final result. Mr Baan declined to name the parties or give details of the plan, other than to say that it would involve a 'package of projects' and would represent a 'very thorough-going restructuring'. Some of Daf's banks are thought to want a closer analysis of the restructuring plan before committing more long-term funds. Separately, the economic affairs ministry said in The Hague that the analysis requested by the banks could take weeks. Unions are braced for heavy job losses in the Netherlands and also in Belgium and the UK, where the truckmaker has large industrial operations. The company has posted losses for the past three years</p>

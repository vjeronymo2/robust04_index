			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Seoul city officials charged South Korean prosecutors yesterday questioned six city officials and charged five others with negligence over the Seoul bridge disaster in which 32 died. Mayor Woo Myoung-Kyu ordered inspections of all 17 bridges in the city to avoid a repetition of Friday's tragedy in which a span of the Songsu bridge plunged into the Han River taking with it cars, vans and a bus. Former Mayor Lee Won-jong, sacked hours after the bridge collapse, told parliamentary hearings on the safety of Seoul bridges last week there was no cause for concern. The collapse was the latest in a series of construction disasters in South Korea which engineers blamed on shoddy work, poor quality control and inadequate maintenance.</p>

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Letter: Lloyd's puts outsiders first Sir, In your article, 'The Lloyd's Report' (January 16), Mr Tom Benyon, on behalf of the Association of Lloyd's Names, is quoted as saying: 'For the first time in its 300-year history, it's putting the outsiders first, and not the insiders'. Mr Claud Gurney (Letters, January 16) uses the same conception of outsiders and insiders to make the opposite point. In fact, Lloyd's has always put outsiders first. They are the policy-holders. Those of us who take a serious interest in the running of Lloyd's and our own syndicates in particular are very much insiders and are treated accordingly. N F Parker, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia</p>

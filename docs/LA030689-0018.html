			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THINKING BIG AT TAHOE  </P> <P> Environmental battles rarely are won as most people think of winning -- as the  successful conclusion of a struggle. Thus, the battle to "save" Lake Tahoe  continues, even though impressive progress has been made in the past two years  to manage growth in a way that will do the least damage to the environment of  the once-pristine Sierra Nevada lake.  </P> <P> In 1987, the California-Nevada Tahoe Regional Planning Agency adopted a  sensible new plan for development in the lake basin, but only after years of  litigation by the California attorney general's office and the League to Save  Lake Tahoe. Late last year, another impressive step was taken with the approval  of a 1,500-page plan for correcting environmental problems in the popular  year-round resort area.  </P> <P> The so-called 208 plan, drafted to meet the demands of Section 208 of the  federal Clean Water Act, calls for a $300-million program to control erosion  and to restore damaged wetlands. Significantly, the plan prohibits further  development in stream environment zones. A major source of pollution in the  lake, causing degradation of its famed clarity, has been runoff from erosion in  the flood plains.  </P> <P> But problems at the lake, particularly in the South Shore area of South Lake  Tahoe, Calif., and Stateline, Nev., would get even worse if the regional  planning agency yields to the desire of the giant Nevada casinos at Stateline  to build a sports palace and additional garages holding 10,000 parking spaces.  </P> <P> Other than pollution of the lake itself, the major problems at Tahoe are  traffic congestion and air quality, particularly in the South Shore urban  complex. The sports center and parking proposals are contained in a draft of  the proposed Douglas County (Nev.) 20-year growth plan. But the bi-state  regional plan requires that local-growth measures balance commercial  development with environmental-mitigation measures, and particularly transit  facilities and other actions that will diminish congestion and air pollution.  The Douglas County plan has no such mitigation program.  </P> <P> That is not the way to save Lake Tahoe.  </P></p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: US in Bulgarian investment drive The US has opened an office in Sofia to promote US-Bulgarian investment and trade, writes Theodor Trev in Sofia. US investment has accounted for only 6.5 per cent of the total foreign investment in Bulgaria since 1990, according to Bulgarian government figures. US companies are lagging Germany, the biggest investor with 40.6 per cent of the total foreign investment, the Netherlands (10.2 per cent), Switzerland (9.2 per cent), and Belgium (7.1 per cent). The US office is located at Sofia's World Trade Centre and consists of professional office space, direct telecommunications with the US, support personnel and a range of consulting services. It will try to attract US companies to the Bulgarian market and support their establishment by providing services at a reduced or no-charge basis. The venture has been almost totally funded by contributions from US companies.</p>

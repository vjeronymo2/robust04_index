He is reportedly being influenced by the local  military leadership who has been purportedly left out by the  "Yankees," who fear the Paraguayan military will mistakenly get  the credit for the work. Sources contacted yesterday said that  Wasmosy met with members of the Permanent Commission of  Congress, who were asked to reject the U.S. Government offer  because it will result in a national political-military dispute  that can be avoided by rejecting the offer.    Several deputies held negotiations yesterday to avert the  loss of important aid because of squabbles among national  political sectors.    To get the offer rejected, Wasmosy reportedly met members of  the Permanent Commission of Congress at the presidential  residence to ask them for their "support."    Congressional sources have told NOTICIAS that Wasmosy asked  the legislators to reject U.S. Ambassador Jon Glassman's offer  because of the privileges the Americans want to build these  installations.    The same sources added that Wasmosy is refusing the offer in  view of a political-military problem which arose because the  U.S. Embassy demands that no Paraguayan military be involved in  the project.    According to these sources, Wasmosy already gave his  approval  to Glassman at the beginning of January, but the president  changed his mind after consulting the military commanders. It  has been learned that the president is looking for a dignified  way out. In view of this, he is meeting legislators so that  Congress, not he, will "supposedly" be the one to reject the  offer.    The same sources added that the problem is that the  Paraguayan Army has already promised "to build one school per  year."    It has been learned that legislators are studying the issue  closely because the Paraguayan military law does not allow the  Armed Forces to discredit politicians by committing themselves  to build schools. Moreover, they said, this is not an Armed  Forces task.    The 14-point agreement to be signed by the two governments  establishes that the U.S. contingent will be relieved of some  chores. Moreover, it will be provided with transportation. The  agreement specifies that all privileges will apply only for the  fulfillment of the mission.    Deputy Blas Llano was among those who, led by Congressional  Permanent Commission Chairman Juan Carlos Ramirez Montalbetti,  attended the meeting with Wasmosy on 26 January. Yesterday he  paid a suspicious visit to the U.S. Embassy. Asked if he  discussed the issue of the arrival of the American contingent,  he answered yes. He added that consultations were being  conducted to avoid losing the donation. Llano said: "I am only  obtaining information to see how we can obtain this aid."    The U.S. Government has offered to build one health center,  eight schools in rural areas, eight wells with raised water  tanks, the corresponding plumbing and pumps, and to repair the  roads leading to the construction sites. The United States  wants only the Public Works Ministry involved in the project.    The project -- named "Strong Roads 1994-South" -- will be  carried out by the U.S. Southern Command Task Force unit that is  stationed in Panama. It will be held between 16 May and 15  September.    In exchange for the works, the United States will conduct  long- range deployment exercises. The agreement to be signed  the U.S. Embassy specifies that the soldiers will not use heavy  artillery or armored vehicles but that they will carry pistols.    The installations will be built in Santa Lucia, San  Salvador,  Santa Clara, San Francisco, Libertad and the city of "6 de  Enero" in San Pedro department.    Deputy Euclides Acevedo (National Encounter Alliance), first  vice president of the Chamber of Deputies, said yesterday that  only a joint session of Congress may authorize or reject a U.S.  Government offer. However, he said that Congress is displeased  over the arrival of the U.S. military contingent "because we  have our own Armed Forces."    Acevedo added that he lacks sufficient information on the  U.S. Government offer but stated he is not in favor of Congress  authorizing U.S. military forces to build schools in Paraguay.    He said: "In principle, I do not fully agree with it. This  is a sovereign country with its own Armed Forces. They should  clearly specify the true objective of this trip because I do not  see what the U.S. Armed Forces have to do with building schools  in Paraguay."    Asked if he approves Army Commander Lino Cesar Oviedo's  commitment to build "one school per year," Acevedo merely said  that "the entire issue will be studied" in Congress.</p>

			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / International Company News: South Korea regains past glories  -The return to the rapid expansion of the mid-1980s Net profits of South Korea's listed companies for the first half of 1994 have increased at their fastest rate since 1987, when the economy was achieving almost unprecedented double-digit growth. Average net profits of 518 listed companies jumped by 75 per cent during the first half, which surpassed the 71.4 per cent gain registered during the first half of 1987, according to Dongsuh Economic Research Institute. Sales increased by 16.6 per cent, almost matching the growth in turnover during the boom years of 1986-87. The sharp earnings rise reflects an economic recovery based on increased spending for production expansion, which benefited steel, construction and machinery companies, and higher private consumption. Exports have also surged due to the depreciation of the Korean currency against the strong Japanese yen and increased demand in advanced industrial countries. Growing exports helped boost net earnings for Hyundai Motor, the nation's largest car producer, by 343 per cent to Won68.2bn (Dollars 84m), while foreign demand for memory semiconductor chips was largely responsible for the 408 per cent rise in profits to Won285bn for Samsung Electronics. Even the troubled petrochemical industry, which has suffered a production glut that depressed earnings since 1990, is witnessing a recovery because of increased exports to China and south-east Asia. Lucky, one of Korea's leading petrochemical companies, reported a 61 per cent profit increase to Won41.9bn. Analysts believe the strong earnings performance reflects the economies of scale and improved production efficiency achieved by Korea's big industrial groups. This has produced growing profit margins, which have also been improved by stable raw material costs. The fact that operating profits, which Barings Securities estimates rose by 51.5 per cent, accounted for most of the net earnings growth underscores the industrial strength of Korean business. In contrast, the higher net profits reported in 1987 were largely the result of foreign exchange gains, according to Dongsuh. Moreover, the manufacturing sector recorded the highest net profit increase this year at 107.9 per cent, while service companies had an 82.9 per cent jump in earnings. The overall average for listed companies was pulled down by the relatively poor profit performance of the financial sector, which grew by only 23.5 per cent due to higher bad-loan provisions in the banking industry. Other factors contributed to the impressive corporate earnings. 'Corporate results were relatively poor last year, so this year's results look better because they started from a low base,' said Mr Lee Kuen-mo, an analyst at Barings Securities in Seoul. The absence of labour conflict in most industries also contributed to higher earnings. One reason for the sizeable jump in this year's profits for Hyundai Motor was that a two-month strike depressed earnings a year ago. The few listed companies that suffered labour strife this year reported poor results. Kumho, the country's largest tyre maker, recorded a loss of Won12.6bn against a profit of Won4.1bn a year ago because of a strike in June. Favourable financial factors also boosted net earnings growth above the rise in operating profits. Interest rates remained stable at 12 per cent during the period, which cut financial costs. A change in accounting rules also reduced special depreciation charges that had lowered earnings last year. 'This has proved to be of significant benefit to some companies, such as Korea Electric Power,' said Mr Keith Nam, head of HG Asia Securities in Seoul. The state-owned electricity monopoly had a 62.8 per cent increase in net earnings to Won391.5bn, the highest amount among listed companies. Analysts believe that the strong profit growth will continue through the rest of 1994. Oil prices are stable. Interest rates, although high by international standards, are relatively low for Korea. The Korean won, which is pegged to the US dollar, is expected to remain weak against the Japanese yen.</p>

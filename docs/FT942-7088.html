			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / S Yemen in push to reclaim territory South Yemeni military officers have launched a counter-offensive to reclaim territory lost to northern forces during the past three weeks' fighting, they said yesterday. Caught unprepared for war, they claimed the south was now ready to break out of its defensive posture. The southerners were yesterday clearly in control of the region surrounding the key airbase of al-Anad, some 45 miles north of Aden, as they continued to pound the base. Southern officers said there was no return artillery fire and claimed the northerners were in retreat. Apparently frustrated by the failed advance on Aden, northern leader Gen Ali Abdullah Saleh has opened up a new front in Shabwa Province, 240 miles north-east of Aden. His aim, southern leaders say, is to capture their oil fields at Wadi Masila, about 280 miles to the east. Run by Canadian Occidental Petroleum, the Masila Fields produce 150,000 barrels a day, the south's economic mainstay. Southern leaders were apparently unruffled by the new challenge, saying northern forces are over-extended and vulnerable to a counter-thrust. Mr Ali Salem al-Beidh's southern leadership is starting to fill positions for the new cabinet. Prime minister-designate is Mr Haider Abu-Bakr al-Attas, prime minister of the former united Yemen before the south declared secession at the end of last week. Defence minister is expected to be Gen Haithem Qassem Taha, chief of staff of the southern army. New or confirmed appointments for provincial governors include Mr Ahmed Farid, owner of a Muscat-based contracting company, Desert Line Projects. Members of the presidential council, apart from Mr al-Beidh, include Mr Salem Saleh Mohammed; the head of the Sons of Yemen League, Mr Abdul Rahman Ali al-Jifri; the former head of the Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen, Mr Abdul Kawi Makawi; and Mr Suleiman Nasser Masoud. Mr al-Jifri was an adviser to the former Sultan of Lahej before the British withdrew in 1967. Mr al-Jifri has spent the past 24 years managing a construction company in Saudi Arabia.</p>

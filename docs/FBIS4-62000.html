			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, as proposed by State President Guntis  Ulmanis, there was an extraordinary session of the Saeima  Presidium. The president requested a second debate on the law  on local authorities adopted on 5 May. Ulmanis regards as  unacceptable the provisions of paragraph 93 of the law, which  allows for the dismissal or removal of an elected official from  his post by the sole personal order of a minister. In his  opinion, only the Cabinet of Ministers can dismiss or remove an  elected official from his post.    The Saeima Presidium agreed to a second debate of the law on  local authorities, allowing the Commission on State and Local  Administration and the Judicial Commission to rule that the  Commission of State and Local Administration will assemble the  proposals received and prepare the laws adopted together with  the proposals for a second debate in a plenary session of the  Saeima.</p>

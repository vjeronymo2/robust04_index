			<p>BFN     [Text] At about 1300 the Croatian Assembly's House of  Counties continued its work following three breaks and a meeting  of the chairmen of the deputies clubs. The deputies are still  debating the agenda. Throughout the session the Croatian  Democratic Union [HDZ] club of deputies explicitly demanded that  all issues on the agenda be dropped except for the one relating  to a proposal to recall House of Counties Speaker Josip Manolic.    The opposition representatives held a different view. They  insisted on the original agenda, including the current affairs  hour during which government representatives were to answer  questions raised by deputies. The vice president confirmed that  the government was in agreement with the demand of the HDZ club  of deputies and that it had withdrawn all parts of the draft  legislation included in the agenda.    During the debate the president of the House of Counties  called on Vice President Damir Zoric to preside over the rest of  the session. In conclusion, 12 assembly committees are  preparing tomorrow's session of the Croatian Assembly Chamber of  Representatives.</p>

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / World Trade News: BA cuts business fares in Europe THE business class price war between European airlines' fares intensified yesterday when British Airways cut fares by as much as a quarter from the UK to Paris, Amsterdam and Helsinki. The moves follows similar cuts in recent weeks by British Midland, Air France, Finnair, the Dutch carrier KLM, and Aer Lingus, the Irish airline. The reductions apply only on routes from London and leave a business class return trip to Paris costing Pounds 240, compared with Pounds 318 previously. 'We are trying to persuade people to trade up into business class,' said BA. 'Many companies specify that business travel be in economy.' The fares war is limited to highly competitive routes. A business class return fare on London-Frankfurt, for example, which is only flown by British Airways and Lufthansa fly, remains at more than Pounds 350. Some of the tickets carry restrictions, usually specifying that the return trip must be made within three days of departure. BA's fares do not, but are only available until the end of June. Such cuts in short-haul and in business class are unusual. Airlines are struggling to attract corporate clients which have stayed away as the recession in Europe has deepened. Companies have cut back on travel spending, either by sending staff economy class or switching to telecommunications for business meetings. Economy fares cuts are common on busy long-haul routes. But the fight for the cash-conscious business passenger began in earnest this winter.</p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Great Northern Nekoosa Files Petition: Great Northern Nekoosa said it had filed  a petition with the Interstate Commerce Commission challenging an exemption  granted last week to Georgia-Pacific so that it could take over Great  Northern's railroads as part of a buyout. A Great Northern spokesman said  Georgia-Pacific's exemption had been procedurally defective and contained false  or misleading information. Earlier, Great Northern rejected Atlanta-based  Georgia Pacific's unsolicited $58-a-share offer, calling it too low, possibly  illegal and holding the potential for disastrous debt. Georgia-Pacific,  maintaining that the offer is fair and sound, said it will pursue the  transaction.  </P></p>

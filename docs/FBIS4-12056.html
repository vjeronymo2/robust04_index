			<p>BFN     [Text] President Yeltsin's envoy, Viktor Posuvalyuk, said  he has been warmly received in Israel. In an interview with  Jack Katzenell, Posuvalyuk said Russia is coordinating its  Middle East policy with the United States. He dismissed the  suggestion that Yasir 'Arafat is trying to exploit the  traditional rivalry between the two superpowers to obtain last  minute concessions from Israel.    [Begin recording] [Posuvalyuk] I think that Yasir 'Arafat  adequately and in a right way understands that Russian cosponsor  stands, let us say, in the middle between the two parties as the  American cosponsor does. We are trying to help both parties.  My concept is that the Israeli Government and the leadership of  the PLO are in one boat. So, they are moving ahead with this  peace process. They are helping each other, and they are serving  their own interests. There is no contradiction.    [Katzenell] Have you had a warm welcome here in Israel?    [Posuvalyuk] Yes, yes. And I thank the Israeli Government  for this warm welcome.    [Katzenell] What are you going to do next, sir?    [Posuvalyuk] I suppose in a few days, maybe -- in two or  three days -- I am going to take part in Russian-American  consultations on the Middle East. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "The United States Is Bringing Dark </F> Clouds of Nuclear War"]    [Text] The U.S. policy of strong power [kangkwon  chongchaek] to crush our Republic under the pretext of the  nuclear issue has reached an extreme pitch.    The U.S. hardline conservative forces said if we do not  comprehensively implement the safeguards accord, they would not  exclude a possibility of taking military steps against us.  Thus, they are attempting to ignite the fuse of a nuclear war.    The U.S. military leaders, whenever they found an  opportunity, made violent remarks that with a view to blocking  North Korean nuclear arms development, they would be ready to  make a venture even for starting a war, that the United States  would advance along the road of applying pressure on North  Korea, including taking sanctions, by getting rid of the  diplomatic method, and that they would not exclude the  possibility of a preemptive military attack on North Korea.    Amid such violent remarks, the U.S. warmongers are  attempting  to work out a plot [kyechaegul kkumigo issumnida] to ignite a  fire hazard for the northward war of aggression--the nuclear  war--by frequently visiting South Korea.    U.S. Defense Secretary Perry, who flew to South Korea on 19  April, decided to resume the Team Spirit joint military  exercise--a nuclear war exercise--in November this year with the  South Korean puppets, and to take joint military measures in  order to block the North's so-called nuclear threat. This is a  practical example of such an attempt by the U.S. warmongers.    Today the U.S. armed forces are being constantly reinforced  around the Korean peninsula. As has already been known, the  United States brought numerous military equipment, including  Patriot missiles--mass lethal weapons--together with several  hundred troops, Stinger missiles, and ultramodern offensive  helicopters, Apaches, into South Korea. Besides, the United  States deployed many combat warships including carriers in the  sea zones close to the Korean peninsula.    In addition, the U.S. military authorities are pushing ahead  with a new aggressive war plan to deploy the U.S. mainland-based  600,000 aggressive troops including two Marine Corps divisions,  200-odd warships, and 1,600-odd airplanes on the Korean  peninsula within 80 days in an emergency. Moreover, the U.S.  imperialist aggressors are staging northward aggressive aerial  war exercises each day by mobilizing and deploying numerous  overseas-based fighter planes and lethal weapons in South Korea.  They are constantly committing aerial reconnaissance activities  against the northern half of the Republic. This is indeed an  alarming military move that can be seen only on the eve of war.    By kicking off a row on the pretext of our nuclear issue,  the  U.S. imperialists reinforced armed forces on a large-scale, and  are are straining the situation to an extreme pitch while  staging various northward aggressive war exercises. This is  intended to crush [apsal] our nation militarily and gain  supremacy in the Asia-Pacific region.    Prompted by such intentiions, the U.S. imperialists are  trying to ignite the fuse of war on the Korean peninsula by all  means. Because of the reckless U.S. policy of strong power, the  dark clouds of nuclear war are, in actuality, rushing into the  Korean peninsula, and the U.S. imperialists' military threat to  the Asia-Pacific region is increasing furthermore.    The prevailing situation demands that the people in the  Asia-Pacific region resolutely smash the U.S. arms buildup  maneuvers. The United States must squarely look at the trend of  the time. It should act with discretion.    Those who play with fire are doomed to be burned by the fire  they ignited. The U.S. imperialists should not ignore the  demand of our people and the world's progressive people aspiring  to independence and peace. They must immediately stop arms  buildup and new war provocation maneuvers. If the U.S.  imperialists ignite the flames of nuclear war at last defying  strong protests and denunciation by our people and peaceloving  people of the world, the rascals will not be able to evade a  bitter miserable defeat.    The U.S. imperialists must be keenly aware of this, and must  act with discretion.</p>

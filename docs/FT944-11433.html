			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Commons rooftop protesters try to stay in touch It's good to talk - which is why the five men who scaled the House of Commons yesterday to protest against the Criminal Justice Act took a mobile phone with them. It was lunchtime when they breached the Palace of Westminster's defences, jumping over a wall, shinning up a drainpipe and clambering on to the roof of Westminster Hall, one of London's best-known landmarks. By 1.30pm they were perched astride the roof, just below Big Ben, with banner unfurled. On the ground, equally well equipped, was the group's press liaison officer  -with a lawyer. Press releases were handed out, giving a number on which 'live interviews' could be conducted with the climbers. Mr Patrick Field, the press officer, said they were staging the protest 'as citizens against the criminal justice bill'. He said the men had carried out 'a certain amount of reconnaissance', after which it was just 'jump over the wall and charge'. Scotland Yard said seven men went over the wall but two were arrested before they could make the climb. Both face breach-of-the-peace charges. Three of the climbers came down later and were driven away in a police van. They are believed to have been arrested on suspicion of committing criminal damage. But all did not go entirely as planned for the climbers - repeated attempts to contact them on their mobile phone were unsuccessful.</p>

			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. TRANSIT OFFICIALS SEE BATTLE IN CONGRESS OVER PROPOSED CUTS  </P> <P> Orange County officials predict a pitched battle in Congress over provisions of  the 1991 federal budget that would eliminate $10 million in subsidies for local  bus service and cloud the county's plan to build a network of busways to ease  freeway congestion.  </P> <P> The county's chief transit official said fare increases and service reductions  could be required if the budget unveiled by President Bush this week is enacted  as written, but at least one key Congress member predicted that the  transportation proposals will be rejected.  </P> <P> "I don't think it has a ghost of a chance of clearing Congress," said Rep. Ron  Packard (R-Carlsbad), a member of the powerful House Public Works and  Transportation Committee. Packard's 43rd Congressional District includes  southern Orange County.  </P> <P> James P. Reichert, general manager of the Orange County Transit District, said  the Administration's plan would be a "disaster" for the county.  </P> <P> "The bottom line is we'd lose over $10 million in operating support," Reichert  said.  </P> <P> The federal subsidy provides about 10% of the annual revenue of the district,  which operates a fleet of 600 buses and carries 40 million passengers a year.  </P> <P> In his $1.23-trillion federal budget for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1,  Bush proposes the elimination of Urban Mass Transportation Administration  operating subsidies for transit districts that serve areas with populations of  1 million or more.  </P> <P> By eliminating subsidies for large transit districts, the Administration would  reduce overallUMTA subsidies by $548 million, to $1.08 billion.  </P> <P> "Right off the bat, that seems a little unrealistic to ask transit to take a  33% cut," said James F. McConnell, Orange County's Washington lobbyist.  </P> <P> In addition, the UMTA budget provides no money for new mass transit projects,  which could include a series of planned busways in Orange County.  </P> <P> The county has no pending requests for federal busway aid. However, in future  years, the lack of funding "could have some serious impact on our transitways  program," Reichert said.  </P> <P> Packard and several congressional aides said they expect that the House  Appropriations Committee will restore a substantial amount of the operating  subsidies for large transit districts.  </P> <P> An aide to Rep. Glenn M. Anderson (D-San Pedro) said that the Bush cuts "are an  unacceptable reduction and would lead toward elimination of the federal role in  mass transit." Anderson is chairman of the House Public Works and  Transportation Committee.  </P> <P> In some respects, officials said, the coming battle will be a replay of the  annual tug-of-war that began in 1984 when the Reagan Administration first  proposed heavy cuts in the UMTA account. Each year, Congress has restored most  of the UMTA funds.  </P> <P> However, key committee aides and other officials said that this year, as  Congress devotes more attention to reducing the federal budget deficit, urban  mass transit programs are not likely to receive the highest priority.  </P> <P> Of equal concern to Orange County officials is the UMTA account that pays for  construction of urban rail systems, including the Los Angeles Metrorail  project, and special freeway lanes that are dedicated to bus use and physically  separated from regular freeway traffic.  </P> <P> By eliminating any discretionary funds for new projects, "What they're saying  is, 'No new starts,' " McConnell said. "I think the purpose of this proposal is  not just no new starts in 1991; I think it's no new starts ever. . . .  </P> <P> "That would take the federal government out of any participation in the future  (Orange County) transitway project."  </P> <P> The county has approved construction of 20 miles of bus lanes along local  freeway corridors. The first seven-mile section is to run along the Santa Ana  Freeway in the central part of the county, Reichert said. Funds have been set  aside for construction of the first phase, Reichert said, but the county will  be looking to the federal government to help build additional parts of the  system.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'IN A REBUILDING PERIOD';  </P> <P> RETIRING MACHINISTS CHIEF SAYS UNIONS STILL NEEDED  </P> <P> As he prepares to step down as president of the International Assn. of  Machinists this month, William Winpisinger is confident that organized labor  has a bright future. But he says he's worried that union leaders will revert to  their old ways when the pendulum of power swings back in labor's direction.  </P> <P> "I just don't believe we're seeing the funeral mass being said over us. I can't  even hear the strains of the organ dirge," says the outspoken union leader who  retires after 38 years in the labor movement. "As long as people work, sooner  or later, no matter how benevolent or paternalistic an employer may be, workers  run into problems on their jobs. And when they do, they need some kind of  mechanism to adjudicate those problems."  </P> <P> In the absence of some other mechanism for assuring fairness, Winpisinger says,  workers will turn to unions for help. "As our tarnished image begins to accept  polish again the phone will begin to ring," he predicts.  </P> <P> Right now, he says, organized labor is going through "just another rebuilding  period that we essentially had to go through, partly because of the way we  conducted our own institution." In fact, it is the way that labor conducted  itself in the past that concerns him.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'No Magic to It'  </P> <P> "In my judgment," he says, "the challenge for labor leadership in the future is  one, and one only: When the country does see fit to repose power in the hands  of labor leadership that it has to be used more wisely and judiciously than  ever in our history. It has to be used responsibly, not recklessly, not  wantonly, but very, very responsibly."  </P> <P> As he sees it, organized labor can no longer use power "totally for its own  grand design." He said he did not agree with the philosophy of the late AFL-CIO  President George Meany, who, he says, believed that "the use of unbridled power  was not sinful."  </P> <P> "We've got to be prepared to try to discipline ourselves so as not to indulge  in the excesses that will cause the pendulum to take another violent swing in  the future," he says. "There's no magic to it. It takes a lot of work, a lot of  persuasion. It takes a hell of a leader."  </P> <P> To accomplish this, Winpisinger says, labor leaders must spend less time  worrying about wages and more time worrying about broader social issues that  affect workers. "It's going to require a leader who can lead on the social and  philosophical side as the beacon on which you moderate economic behavior."  </P> <P> Winpisinger says this doesn't mean unions should no longer be militant or  strike. Citing the example of Eastern Air Lines, where the IAM is locked in a  bitter struggle for control of the carrier, Winpisinger says: "Obviously, if  someone wants to fight, you've got to take them on."  </P> <P> But Winpisinger sees no room in the future for wage settlements at one firm  being goals that unions at other companies or in other industries insist on  beating. The result, he says, is "terrible distortions" that "drive the whole  wage totem pole out of kilter." He insists that there must be a recognition  among union leaders that some jobs deserve more pay than others.  </P> <P> Winpisinger, who takes pride in being viewed as a leader of labor's political  left wing, cites the experience of unions in Western Europe as the direction  U.S. labor go. In Europe, he says, trade unions are part of the mainstream of  government policy-making and help set economic goals.  </P> <P> Asked about the future of labor-management cooperation in the United States as  American industries scramble to be competitive in world markets, Winpisinger  insists that problem is related to the need for labor to have a voice in social  and economic policy. And he doesn't see the effort to be competitive going very  far unless business changes its tactics toward labor.  </P> <P> "Cooperation is a two-way street," he says. "And I don't consider it  cooperation if I sit down on behalf of our members and make a deal . . . and we  give up a lot of work rules that may or may not have outlived their usefulness,  we put on a good show in terms of production and the company makes a buck and  we make a buck.  </P></p>

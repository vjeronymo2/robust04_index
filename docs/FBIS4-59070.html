			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the Defense Ministry; place and date </F> not given -- read by announcer]    [Text] For the fourteenth day in a row, the forces of the  bloody gang of the al-Ahmar clan continue perpetrating their  criminal acts against our Yemeni people and their valiant Armed  Forces. Today, these iniquitous, savage acts are being  perpetrated against the areas of al-Dali Province and the  districts of Karish and Mukayris, which are the areas that were  on the borders before Yemeni unity. In the al-Dali area, forces  of the adventurist gang of the al-Ahmar clan continued to shell  al-Dali town and its neighboring villages with heavy artillery,  rockets, and aircraft in the tenth attempt to penetrate the  defenses of our valiant forces which are confronting these  iniquitous forces with total bravery and audacity.    The defenders of this province, in cooperation with the  masses of the people which began to arrive in this province  (?from) various provinces of Lahij Governorate, are displaying a  valiant resistance and splendid heroism, which reflects the  spirit of the original struggle between our forces and the  masses. Despite the intensive random shelling against the  peaceful villages and houses by the forces of the al-Ahmar gang,  our defending forces continued their resolute confrontation,  inflicting on the hostile forces heavy loss of life and  equipment.    In another former border area, the adventurist Sanaa clique  tried to capture (Kathbub) District in the direction of Bab  al-Mandab [word indistinct], but our heroic forces repulsed this  abortive attempt and the attacking forces of the al-Ahmar clan  returned to where they came from, suffering losses.    As for the capital of Abyan Governorate, our forces have  almost imposed their control of this area after units of the  al-'Amaliqah forces retreated and scattered in all directions,  while many of these units, officers and other ranks, surrendered  and joined our forces.    The Defense Ministry appeals to Arab and world public  opinion, particularly the bodies and organizations concerned  with defending human rights, including the Yemeni Red Crescent,  the Arab Red Crescent organizations, and the International Red  Crescent, to condemn the murderous campaigns against captives  who fell into the hands of the gang of the al-Ahmar clan in the  northern governorates, as well as savage acts and random  shelling of villages and houses of citizens, particularly in  al-Dali Province and in Karish and Mukayris districts, and the  forceful detention of these citizens. It calls on these  organizations to intervene to rescue the wounded and provide  first aid to them, particularly among the civilians. While the  Defense Ministry conveys to our people and to the Arab and world  these facts, it expresses full confidence that all the abortive  attempts of the bloody gang of the al-Ahmar clan will fail.  Their deeds will crash on the rock of our armed forces'  steadfastness whose number increases daily by hundreds and  thousands, in addition to the masses of people who increasingly  support our forces, the forces of unity, democracy and  modernization.</p>

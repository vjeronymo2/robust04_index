			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on a telephone interview with Bosnian Prime Minister </F> Haris Silajdzic by MBC correspondent Mu'awiyah Yasin; date not  given; correspondent speaks in Arabic and Silajdzic in English--  recorded]    [Text] The prime minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina told MBC  during a telephone conversation that his country does not have  sufficient influence to resist the Russian efforts aiming to  halt NATO air raids against Bosnian Serbs.    Our correspondent Mu'awiyah Yasin asked Haris Silajdzic  about  his government's reaction to the NATO action against the Serbs.    [Silajdzic] We can get a good action but, in my opinion at  least, they are being too cautious and I am afraid that they  would interpret this hesitation as another green light and that  a different action, a decisive action, would be much more  productive.    [Yasin] If the Serbs continue to shell the city [Gorazde],  what action do you expect to see?    [Silajdzic] They have been hit twice but only two, as I  understood, two tanks or at most three tanks were destroyed, not  enough to send a very strong message. That is a problem. I am  afraid if the Serbs practically make a draw, manage a draw with  the United Nations and NATO, in this case I think they will be  encouraged to do many other things in Bosnia and there will be  only one thing left to ask [words indistinct] to lift the arms  embargo for Bosnia and let us defend our country and that has  been, as you know, denied to us. To tell you the truth, we have  many soldiers that killed [as heard] more than 10 Serbian tanks  there and they are not very impressed with the results.    [Yasin] We know that Russia is earnestly seeking to persuade  the UN Security Council to halt NATO's attacks against the  Serbian positions. Is Bosnia-Herzegovina expected to launch a  campaign to resist these Russian efforts?    [Silajdzic] Well, we do not have that leverage. We actually  expected this action; just like in the case of Sarajevo they  came in at the last minute and actually made a big diplomatic  point here. They will do the same round Gorazde and they will  look like a big and important player there. They are an  important player but it is true that they let Serbs attack  civilian areas, safe areas, and the UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces] for almost 15 days without any action. Now when the  United Nations and NATO have acted, they want to be consulted,  they want to be an equal player. This is what they are going to  achieve, unfortunately.</p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Chris Washburn played basketball games at North Carolina State while high on  cocaine and once used a friend's urine sample to pass a drug test at the  school, according to a new book, "Personal Fouls."  </P> <P> "Wash would play games on coke," a teammate is quoted as saying. "The first  half, he'd play great, and then the coke would wear off, and in the second half  he wouldn't do a thing."  </P> <P> The book, written by Peter Golenbock, also claims that N.C. State Coach Jim  Valvano allowed Washburn to play even though he was flunking most of his  courses.  </P> <P> Washburn left the school after his sophomore year to turn pro. Last month, he  was banned from the National Basketball Assn. for repeated drug violations.  </P></p>

			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Contracting-out fears dismissed MR WILLIAM Waldegrave, public service minister, has sought to head off concern that the government's drive to contract out public services will be derailed by legal uncertainties over the rights of employees involved. He says in a pamphlet published yesterday that the protests are 'simply the usual noise you get when a major new policy begins to affect powerful vested interests'. Mr Waldegrave also says it is 'not unreasonable' to expect market testing in the future to produce savings averaging 25 per cent - even when work is not contracted out but continues to be performed by in-house providers. Mr John Major, the prime minister, will today chair a Downing Street seminar of ministers and senior civil servants on the next stages of the Citizen's Charter. The seminar is likely to cover how competitive tendering and market testing can be extended. Fears about contracting out arise because legal advice suggests that under the 1977 European Acquired Rights Directive, civil servants affected may have to be offered equal employment conditions when transferred to a new employer. If they are not, the government could be liable to damages. In his pamphlet, Public Service and the Future, Mr Waldegrave says market testing has faced 'vociferous criticism' from public-sector unions. 'A final desperate ploy is to allege that the European Acquired Rights Directive will stop the policy: it will not, any more than it has stopped the tens of thousands of private-sector transfers of undertakings since 1977 when it was passed,' he adds. Mr Waldegrave also used his pamphlet to launch a thinly disguised attack on some newspapers' coverage of the royal family. He complained of 'the savagery of the attack on members of the royal family for no reason other than the exploitation of the pain of an unhappy marriage'.</p>

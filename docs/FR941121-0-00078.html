			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The fact that existing regulations do not specifically provide for administrative review of HCPP decisions is an oversight we proposed to correct by amending &sect;417.801 (``Agreements between HCFA and health care prepayment plans'') and adding new &sect;&sect;417.830 through 417.840 to establish administrative review procedures for Medicare enrollees of HCPPs who are dissatisfied with denied services or claims. We proposed to adopt under these sections administrative review procedures for HCPP enrollees that are the same as those for HMO and CMP enrollees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Technical Changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We also proposed to make several clarifying technical changes to the regulations relating to administrative reviews for HMO or CMP enrollees:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Subpart Q, &sect;&sect;417.600, 417.604, 417.606, 417.608, 417.610, 417.612, 417.614, 417.616, 416.618, 416.620, 417.622, and 417.638_We proposed to change the term ``initial determination'' to ``organization determination'' to distinguish between a determination made by the HMO or CMP and one made by us. We also proposed to delete references to carriers and intermediaries making determinations on behalf of HMOs and CMPs. Carriers and intermediaries now make only fee-for-service determinations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Sections 417.604 and 417.610_We proposed to revise &sect;417.604(a)(4) to clarify that physicians and other individuals who furnish items or services under arrangements with an organization do not have a right to appeal under the regulations. We proposed to make a conforming change to &sect;417.610(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Section 417.614_We proposed to clarify the language by making a distinction between an original determination and a revised or reopened determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Section 417.630_We proposed to clarify that the reference to the ``amount in controversy'' as a condition for a party to request a hearing is the amount ``remaining'' in controversy, not the amount of the total bill. We also proposed to add a phrase to clarify that if beneficiaries combine bills to meet the amount in controversy requirements, they can use both Part A and Part B bills.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Analysis of and Response to Public Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We received timely comments from 16 commenters. The commenters included HMOs, a CMP, national and local professional associations, a State department of health, and consumer advocacy groups.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Time Limits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While many of the commenters supported the proposed time limit for issuing reconsideration determinations, two commenters expressed concern about the initial organization determination. The concern is that HMOs and CMPs deny (or delay) referrals and other services without providing a written notice and, because there is no record of a denial or a decision date, it is unclear whether and when a request for reconsideration may be filed. One commenter proposed that written notices be given for all services granted or denied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Regulations at &sect;417.608(c) state that failure by an HMO or CMP to make timely notification of an adverse organization determination constitutes an adverse determination and may be appealed. In addition, no provision of &sect;417.616 (``Request for reconsideration'') prevents or impedes a Medicare enrollee from filing a request for reconsideration if the HMO or CMP failed to provide the enrollee with written notice that a service is denied. Thus, if a Medicare enrollee maintains that he or she is being denied a covered service but is unable to obtain an explicit denial, we believe that the regulations permit the enrollee to move to the next step of the appeals process and file a request for reconsideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Written notices for all decisions to grant or deny services, as proposed by the commenter, would require an inestimable amount of additional paperwork, with marginal benefit. This requirement would also eliminate the current flexibility of the regulations which allows enrollees to file for a reconsideration without a written denial.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters expressed concern that the Medicare appeals process does not recognize the need for expedited determinations in time-sensitive medical situations. One commenter proposed incorporation of an expedited appeals process for denied services, depending on the relative urgency of the perceived need for the service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We recognize that there are medical situations in which outcomes are greatly affected by the promptness of treatment. We also recognize that our regulations do not specifically address these situations. In order to establish an expedited process for organization determinations, however, we would need the benefit of proposed rulemaking and public comment. We will consider the need for regulations in this area in the near future. In the interim, we believe that regulations at &sect;417.608(c), as noted above, permit the Medicare enrollee some flexibility in assuming a service is denied and seeking a timely reconsideration. Medicare enrollees also may obtain denied services outside the plan and use the appeals process to pursue payment, or complain in writing or by telephone to the HCFA regional office for the area. Complaints to the regional office are not intended to, and usually will not, circumvent the appeals process, but introduce Federal followup and tracking of HMO/CMP responses in these situations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

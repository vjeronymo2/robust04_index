			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Unreasonable guarantee Sir, Mr Whitelam and Miss Webster have missed the point (Letters, November 20). No one is denying that there exist very many pension schemes that are well funded and could easily pass the solvency test proposed in the Goode committee report. However, that is not the point; the point is that the employer has to guarantee that this will always be the case: even at the expense of all of the shareholders' funds if that's what it takes. How can company directors guarantee an inflation-related benefit at the expense of shareholders without calling into question their own duties to those shareholders and to their company? If this proposal finds itself on to the statute books, then very many employees are going to find themselves in pension schemes that are being wound up to be replaced by something that does not require the guarantee of solvency. This will be to the detriment of employees' expectations. By all means have a solvency test and disclose to employees the result, but it is unreasonable to expect someone to guarantee the future level of benefits at the expense of somebody else.

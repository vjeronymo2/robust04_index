			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: FOR THE YOUNG, A VIETNAM WAR HISTORY  </P> <P> American combat troops had already left Vietnam by the time Joseph Anzenberger  Jr. entered the Marine Corps right out of high school in 1974, but the Rancho  Santa Margarita resident is now hip deep in the quagmire of the Vietnam War.  </P> <P> Figuratively speaking, that is.  </P> <P> Anzenberger signed a contract with Facts on File in January to write a history  of the war. Due to be published in 1990, Anzenberger's tentatively titled "The  Vietnam War" will be part of the New York publisher's Library in a Book series.  </P> <P> "The whole idea is really aimed at high school and college students who are  researching the war or want to learn more about it," said Anzenberger, 34, a  systems analyst for Northrop Corp. in Pico Rivera, who writes in his spare  time.  </P> <P> The book will be broken into two sections -- the first a concise overview of  the Vietnam War, from 1945 to 1975, the second an annotated reference section  that will direct researchers to further information about the war.  </P> <P> "Most people would go to libraries or dig up the periodicals," Anzenberger  said. "I list all the other organizations where they can find information about  the war, the lesser-known research places. There is, for example, a theses  center in Ann Arbor, Mich. -- University Microfilm International -- which is a  clearinghouse for masters' and doctoral theses throughout the country. It has a  big collection on the Vietnam War. All the organizations that were in Vietnam,  such as the Red Cross and USO, also have official histories."  </P> <P> Anzenberger's current project, for which he received a $4,000 advance, is  actually his second book dealing with the Vietnam War.  </P> <P> The first, published in 1986, is "Combat Art of the Vietnam War" (McFarland), a  collection of drawings and paintings done during the war with accompanying text  that relates several of the combat artists' stories.  </P> <P> Anzenberger got the idea for the book in the early '80s while majoring in  literature at Pace University in Pleasantville, N.Y. He read James Jones' "WW  II" (a nonfiction book in which the novelist provided a soldier's-eye view of  World War II accompanied by combat art), and checked to see if a similar book  had been done on the Vietnam War. He found that no such book had been done.  </P> <P> "For the most part, a lot of people viewed the Vietnam War through photographs  and this artwork was a way of looking at a different aspect," he said. "An  artist has more time to think the picture out and can take a little more  license with the scene" than a combat photographer.  </P> <P> In beginning his research, Anzenberger discovered that the different branches  of the military had collected 10,000 pieces of art rendered during the Vietnam  War. About 95% of the artwork had been officially commissioned by the military,  he said, while "the other 5% was done by standard military people who donated  their work" during and after the war.  </P> <P> In doing the combat art book, he also wanted to learn more about a war to which  he had not paid much attention while growing up. "It was a learning experience  for myself," he said.  </P> <P> His upcoming book, he said, is aimed at the college and high school students of  today "whose parents may have fought in the war but who may be turned off by  some of the more in-depth books that are out about the Vietnam War. This book  is meant to bring it down to a more readable level."  </P> <P> In selling his idea for a Vietnam history book to Facts On File in January,  Anzenberger did the same thing he did with the first book: He wrote a detailed  outline, with sample writing.  </P> <P> "I haven't used an agent on either" book, he said, adding that he is learning  all the "ins and outs" of the publishing world on his own. "My first contract  was three pages long. The Facts on File contract is 15 pages, so I kind of  learned to get through that."  </P> <P> Anzenberger, who began doing research for the new book last August, must  deliver his completed manuscript next January.  </P> <P> He spends an average of six or seven hours a week writing at night after his  two children are in bed and spends three or four hours on Saturdays doing  research at the UC Irvine library which, he said, has "a tremendous amount of  information" on Southeast Asia and the Vietnam War.  </P> <P> For someone holding down a full-time job, Anzenberger said, writing a book "is  a matter of time management, really."  </P> <P> "As far as finding time, one of the tricks I have is I bought a laptop  computer," he said. "It saves a lot of time. I just take it directly to the  library with me," thus eliminating taking notes by hand and then having to  transfer the notes to a computer.  </P> <P> He said he also sets "milestones" for himself.  </P> <P> "The first thing I did was develop a database of the war -- all the dates  between 1945 and 1975 -- anything I thought was substantial or significant. I'm  using that as a checklist and guide to see how much further I've got to go and  what I've covered. I've broken it up into various eras and set myself dates of  when I should really be at what point, so I'll finish this on time."  </P> <P> "I think the hardest thing is staying motivated," he added. "It's so easy to  say, 'I'll do it tomorrow.' "  </P> <P> A former reporter for a weekly newspaper in Haverstraw, N.Y., and a stringer  for Gannett Newspapers, Anzenberger has also worked as a technical writer. And  he has tried his hand at fiction: He submitted a script he wrote on speculation  for television's "Tour of Duty" ("it didn't go anywhere") and has written a  children's book which, he says, "has been rejected 10 times."  </P> <P> Despite his nonfiction background, he sees fiction as something he would like  to eventually focus on.  </P> <P> "At this point, I guess I just don't have the confidence factor to approach  fiction," he said. "I'd feel more confident having a few nonfiction books under  my belt. I personally need to feel the confidence that I can be published,  which I'm gaining through the nonfiction."  </P> <P> Round Table: Maureen Reagan ("First Father, First Daughter"), Grace Kelly  biographer Judith Quine ("The Bridesmaids") and Phyllis Quinn ("Star Mothers")  will speak at the Round Table West book and author luncheon at noon Thursday at  the Balboa Bay Club, 1221 W. Pacific Coast Highway, Newport Beach. Tickets are  $25. For reservations, call (714) 548-1447.  </P> <P> Mystery Talk: Mission Viejo mystery writer Maxine O'Callaghan, whose latest  Orange County-based Delilah West mystery is "Hit and Run," will talk about  mystery writing at 7:30 p.m. Thursday at the Laguna Beach Public Library, 363  Glenneyre St. Free admission.  </P></p>

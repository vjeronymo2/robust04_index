			<p>BFN     [Text] Yerevan ("LRAGIR" daily), 05/31/94 -- A meeting  between the RA [Republic of Armenia] governmental delegation and  the Crimean authorities has been carried out in Crimea recently,  and a corresponding protocol was signed.    According to the protocol, Armenia should encourage the  return of Crimean Armenians, who have been departed to  Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and elsewhere by Stalin, back to Crimea.    According to the second topic of the protocol, the Armenian  authorities will participate in restoring more than 15 churches  in the territory of Crimea.    Historically, together with Genoans, Armenians owned an 18  hectares fortress in Fedosya, with a port and a customs office.  According to the protocol, the Crimean authorities allocated  this territory to the Armenian community and Armenia. 70  inhabitants, who currently live on this territory, will be  moved, and Armenia is going to build a house for these people.  The territory will belong to Armenia. According to the next  topic of the protocol, specialists from Armenia are to  participate in the construction of this building.    A trade-economic link between Armenia and Crimea will be  established according to another topic. Among other activities,  this includes relations between the people of Armenia and Crimea.    A huge territory has been dedicated in the central part of  Simferopol, which will be used as a trade house. A similar  territory will be dedicated to Crimea in Yerevan.    The protocol also concerns the use of Crimean air  territories, particularly the Simferopol airport, by Armenia.  Simferopol's authorities agreed to this. On the other side,  Crimea will be using the Yerevan airport for their flights to  Teheran and other Eastern countries. Five Crimean ports will be  used for creating economic links between Armenia and Crimea, as  well as for transferring cargoes to third countries.</p>

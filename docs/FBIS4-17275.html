			<p>BFN     [Text] If the opposition forces refuse to sign the treaty  on Civil Accord, this will be a "political victory" for the  democrats since society will see who is seeking accord and who  confrontation. This statement was made by deputy chairman of the  Russia's Choice faction, Boris Zolotukhin, at the faction's  meeting. Russia's Choice leader Yegor Gaydar stated on behalf  of the faction in the State Duma today that the faction was  prepared to sign the document.    Russia's Choice member Yuliy Rybakov suggested that the  State  Duma would not give State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin a mandate for  signing the agreement proposed by the president. Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) leader, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, has  insisted that the State Duma take a vote on whether Rybkin be  granted the right to sign the document on its behalf.  Zolotukhin was certain that if the State Duma did not give the  appropriate authority to Rybkin this would expose the Duma's  majority as a force not seeking stabilization of the situation  in society.    Deputy Bella Denisenko said the draft agreement provided for  nothing except the idea of accord itself and the faction would  have to sign just the title since there were no real moves  towards accord mentioned in the document. She said that the  document had already worsened the situation and brought  different political forces into confrontation.    Former social security minister, Ella Pamfilova, recommended  that the faction seriously speak to the president in the  presence of all members of Russia's Choice. She said it was not  clear what the president sought and in what the faction should  back him and whether Boris Yeltsin needed this support.</p>

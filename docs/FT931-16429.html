			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Milosevic backs Bosnia peace plan MR Cyrus Vance, one of the two international mediators on the former Yugoslavia, met Mr Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia's hardline president, in Belgrade yesterday to persuade him to press Bosnia's Serbs to drop their opposition to peace proposals. Mr Milosevic, whose co-operation is considered vital for any peace initiative to succeed, said before meeting Mr Vance that he would 'support any plan that would bring peace' to Bosnia-Herceg-ovina. A spokesman for Mr Vance and Lord Owen, the other co-chairman of the Geneva peace conference, said that, during the meeting, the Serbian president again expressed his willingness to support the peace effort. Mr Vance, asked later if he believed Mr Milosevic would persevere with the peace plan, replied: 'That is what he said. I am reporting what he said.' Lord Owen was due to join Mr Vance in Belgrade before flying to Zagreb for talks with Mr Franjo Tudjman, Croatia's president. It is not clear, however, whether Mr Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs, and his military colleagues would accept a number of crucial constitutional measures in the Vance-Owen plan, even if Mr Milosevic applied pressure on them. Mr Karadzic, who had talks with Mr Milosevic on Tuesday, was quoted as saying: 'We would appreciate any suggestion of Mr Milosevic's, but only if it is acceptable to us.' At the Geneva negotiations between the warring factions Mr Karadzic rejected the co-chairmen's proposals for an independent, sovereign state of Bosnia-Hercegovina divided into 10 largely autonomous provinces. Mr Karadzic made it clear that the Bosnian Serbs wanted to create their own independent state within Bosnia, while the co-chairmen have specified that the 10 proposed provinces would have no international legal identity of their own. Mr Vance and Lord Owen have stressed that the international community would not countenance an independent Bosnian Serb state, which would aim to become part of a Greater Serbia. In Belgrade Mr Dobrica Cosic, the president of Yugoslavia, comprising Serbia and Montenegro, urged Bosnian Serbs to compromise or risk western military intervention. Meanwhile, Mr Roland Dumas, the French foreign minister, told the cabinet in Paris that the three warring factions in Bosnia had agreed in principle to declare Sarajevo an open city and that forces besieging the capital would withdraw 30km from the city after a ceasefire. The city has been calm recently but last night Bosnian radio said fierce fighting had broken out in many districts.</p>

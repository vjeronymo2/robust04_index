			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by IEC Chairman Johann Kriegler in </F> Johannesburg with foreign and domestic correspondents at IEC  headquarters at the Gallagher Estate, Midrand; introduction by  IEC spokesperson Pieter Cronje -- live]    [Text] [Cronje] Let me start off by saying that we're  unfortunately on a tight schedule. Judge Kriegler has some  other commitments tonight. Thus we have to wind up in 30  minutes. I'm going to hand over to Judge Kriegler for an  opening statement, and then I will take your questions. Please  to facilitate it, introduce yourself and your organization.  Let's limit it to one question per person, no supplementaries,  no two double-barreled questions so we give everyone a chance.  We need to be out by 30 minutes. Judge Kriegler, let me hand  over to you.    [Kriegler] Good evening, Pieter, good evening ladies and  gentlemen in the auditorium there and to viewers elsewhere. In  view of the limited time at our disposal I'll be very brief so  as to allow the maximum time for questions and answers. General  view of the day -- excellent in parts, good in others, fair in  others, and downright poor in others. The poor areas, the East  Rand, some parts of Soweto, some parts of the Eastern Cape, some  parts of the northern [Orange] Free State, some parts of the  Northern Transvaal. A breakdown in detail at this stage I have  in front of me. I'll deal with it if questions are asked about  it.    Generally people stood very, very patiently for very long in  queues. Some of them fruitlessly. To them the IEC wants to  extend its apologies and its gratitude for forbearance and their  patience. In respect of the problem areas, the major constraints  were shortages of ballot papers, shortages of the marking ink,  and in some areas shortages of ballot boxes which got  overstuffed much quicker than we had anticipated because of the  unusually high turnout.    With respect to those three problems, 5.6 million ballot  papers are being printed tonight and being distributed to the  problem areas. As I speak to you the first packages -- made up  packages of ballot papers, both national and provincial are  being dispatched from our central warehouse here to the East  Rand and to Soweto, from pour Durban offices particularly up to  Empangeni to service Northern Natal.    With regard to the marking ink, we have ordered and we have  introduced overnight -- in fact I can't tell you how many  thousand liters of the fluid, but an ample supply for all voting  stations that run out. With regard to ballot boxes, we have  made an arrangement with the political parties and with the post  office, postal bags lacked and sealed and tagged will be used to  empty ballot boxes in voting stations so that the ballot boxes  can be reused.    That's as far as the measures being taken at the moment. If  you ask me will all voting stations be opening tomorrow on time,  the answer is no. If you ask me will they largely be opening,  will the majority be opening, the answer is yes. Perhaps not  sharp at seven, some will be later, it's a question of getting  the supplies to the voting stations.    With regard to the third main issue of the day, Chief  Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi's public intimation earlier this  evening that he and his central committee of the Inkatha Freedom  Party were considering their position, I have not only been in  communication telephonically with the chief minister, so has my  vice chair, I have written him a lengthy letter tonight, I have  no reason to think that the Inkatha Freedom Party will indeed  withdraw from the race. I should add that I would regard that  as a tragedy in the light of the effort that has been put in by  so many tens of thousands of people. Not only of the IEC and not  even particularly of the IEC, but of the millions of people who  stood patiently and waited for this election which they all look  forward to. It would be a great pity for us to spoil it now.  That is as far as the opening statement is concerned, if there  are questions, please.    [Cronje] Your questions for the judge. Over there please.    [Correspondent Shaun Battersby] Shaun Battersby from the  CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR. Judge, I would like to ask you a  question about two categories of ballot papers -- those that did  not bear the sticker of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and yet  people voted for another party, and secondly, those that did not  bear the sticker of the IFP and people trying to indicate their  preference for the IFP by making some kind of a mark on the  ballot paper. My question in relation to these ballots is, as I  understand, they will be considered as a special category in  terms of Section 47 of the Electoral Act, which implies there  has been some kind of irregularity. My question is that why  should voters who have gone out, bona fide voters, and voters in  good faith, for a party -- why should their votes be under any  question at all - selections for the voters as I understand?    [Kriegler] I fully agree with you. They shouldn't be under  any doubt. In terms of the letter of the Electoral Act those  ballots have to be regarded as invalid. That's because of the  letter of the law and it's precisely because the real purpose of  the election is to test the view of the people, that we will be  taking the way via Section 47, to take those ballots into  account in any event.    [Cronje] Karen?    [Correspondent Karen Rijnaardt] Karen Rijnaardt, RAPPORT.  Judge, yesterday there was a high turnout. Could you quantify  that? How high was it?    [Kriegler] I can't give it to you in numbers. I am sorry.    [Correspondent Paulo Barnard] Paulo Barnard from Italy.  Judge, what will happen to the electoral process if Inkatha,  indeed, pulls out?    [Kriegler] The electoral process will proceed. There is in  any event no way to pull out. They're in the race. They may  pull out the horse but the race will continue and they'll still  be in the race. They may come last.    [Unidentified correspondent] Judge, I'm a little confused as  to why so many more vote papers have to be printed. I  understood that 90 ...around about 90 million vote papers were  printed originally. You're printing now an extra 9.3 million.  That means that -- it seems an extraordinary high number of  ballot papers, even if every polling station had twice as many  ballot...[changes thought] expected people, there ought to have  been enough polling...ballot papers. Can you explain this?    [Kriegler] There are a number of inferences to be drawn from  the known data at the moment. The first and most probable is  that the large-scale redistribution of population since the  census figures entailed that we sent too many ballot papers to  areas where the population is no longer as dense, and not enough  to the areas where the population has since increased  tremendously in density, more particularly in the major  metropolitan areas. Now you can ... you may well then ask why  don't you get the ballot papers from where there are too many to  where there are too few. That's easier said than done. There  are over 10,000 votings stations, many of them out in the bundu  [isolated areas], in very, very inaccessible areas, very  difficult to get to and believe you me, it's not so easy to get  a presiding officer voluntarily to surrender ballot papers once  they have been delivered to his voting station. He or she fears  that there may be a shortage there and they hang on to them.  That's the most probable. The second most probable inference  to be drawn from the facts is that we, and everybody else,  grossly under-calculated or underestimated the population of the  country. It seems to me a less likely inference. The third  inference is that there was some major hitch in the distribution  pattern. That is a less likely probability. There is also a  possibility that there was a deliberate attempt to upset the  electoral process by disrupting the distribution process. I  think that was the least likely of the possibilities but we  have, in any event, as a precaution and to ensure that our  activities are examined by an outside agency, invited the  Commissioner of Police to appoint investigators to check the  whole of our train of distribution of ballot papers.    [Cronje] Linda.    [SABC correspondent Linda van Tilburgh] Linda van Tilburgh,  SABC. Judge Kriegler, people are worried about the fact that IFP  leader is threatening to withdraw from the process. Can you  divulge to us some of the details -- the letter you've written,  the conversations you've had with him and his people, just to  get some indication of what is the IEC doing to try to placate  the chief minister.    [Kriegler] I would very much like to take you into my  confidence but that would be breaching another one. I can't do  that.    [Cronje] THE STAR please, over there.    [Correspondent] Justice Kriegler, I'm from THE STAR  newspaper. This afternoon when you had (?press) briefing --  that there was no need for an extension in the number of voting  days, and there was no need for voting to continue on Friday,  but you have said just a few minutes ago that there is a  possibility again that polls might open later tomorrow than they  should be opening. Do you still hold the view that there is no  need at all for the number of voting days to be extended to  Friday?    [Kriegler] I still hold the view that at this stage it is  not  necessary to take a decision on that point. However, I want to  make it perfectly clear that if toward noon tomorrow it is  apparent that substantial numbers of people will not be able to  exercise their democratic right, we will most certainly make the  necessary recommendation to the authorities, but it is only if  it transpires to be necessary.    [Cronje] WEEKLY MAIL AND GUARDIAN.    [Correspondent Steven Harbor] I'm from WEEKLY MAIL AND  GUARDIAN. Judge Kriegler, I wonder whether you could tell us  something about the contingency planning that the IEC had in  place for the possibility that there were going to be situations  like the ones you encountered this morning, for example, on the  East Rand, and perhaps as part of that whether you could explain  to us why it was not possible, with in just a few minutes a  presiding officer discovering in Katlehong, for example, that he  didn't have what he needed, to jump in a car and drive over to  IEC headquarters and get the necessary supply?    [Kriegler] Because the necessary supplies were not at IEC  headquarters. Once we had to provision an extra 600-odd voting  stations in the Transkei, and approximately an equal number -- I  think a little more in KwaZulu -- we simply had no reserves at  head office. We had to provision those voting stations and that  depleted our reserves.    [Cronje] Over there, SOWETAN please.    [Correspondent Lola Maluti] Judge Kriegler, I'm Lola Maluti  from SOWETAN. It would seem that despite your repeated  utterances that, you know, this is not the IEC's election, you  know, and that people would have to be patient -- at the end of  the day people are putting the blame for what is happening at  the moment squarely on the shoulders of the IEC. Now, with  regard to the particular program of IFP stickers. Wouldn't it  have been logical for provisions to be made to service areas  such as KwaZulu-Natal and the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand,  Vereeniging] region, where there is a concentration of IFP  people, in priority, you know, in terms of the other regions.    [Kriegler] Madam, let's get one thing quite clear. If we're  looking for a place to put the blame, I'm not looking for  anybody else. What went wrong today is the IEC's fault, but  what I'm saying is the solution does not lie in our hands alone.  With regard to the stickers, of course you're right and that's  precisely what we did. That the logistics went wrong at the last  moment, because of the urgent addition of a number of additional  packs, in fact 10,000 extra packs of stickers to go to each  voting station in the country, is unfortunate, but we most  certainly did look to the provisioning of the voting stations  where the logistics would be most difficult, communication would  be most difficult, and of course we couldn't put stickers by  preference in areas of presumed Inkatha support because that  would not have been politically impartial. All ballot papers  throughout the country must have those stickers.    [Cronje] Over there please.    [Correspondent Dale Lautenbach] Judge Kriegler, Dale  Lautenbach from the PRETORIA NEWS. Reading media reports that  are coming in hourly and listening to radio stations taking  calls from people out there, some of whom have had a great  experience voting, others not, you ran a very upbeat ad at the  weekend: You're Ready, We're Ready -- Let's Do It. It was an  encouraging motivation from the IEC. Given the position today a  lot of frustration out there, a lot of people confused by  explanations regarding Section 49, and 47, etcetera. Would you  have to revise the content of that ad, and say actually, in  retrospect, we weren't ready?    [Kriegler] You're quite right, and the appeal at this stage  is be patient with us, it's your election that we are doing our  level best to offer you.    [Correspondent Mary Hammond] Earlier today you said that  most  of the problems had been in the rural areas, and this is because  you didn't have good communication systems, or transport was  difficult to those areas. Will the voting in rural areas be  better tomorrow and have you yet found out ways to sort out  these problems of communication and transport?    [Kriegler] Voting will be better tomorrow. We have not  resolved all of the problems in communication and transport. We  never hope to resolve all of them, there are voting stations in  which we do not have telecommunications. It's just that kind of  election.    [Harbor] Judge Kriegler, simple arithmetic tells us that  even  if all the expected voters voted today, there are some 30-35  million ballot forms unaccounted for. It seems to me the reason,  the five possible reasons you have given for the missing ballot  forms cannot explain that many missing forms. It's an  extraordinary quantity, 30 or 35 million. Surely that can't be  just misplaced in the wrong station?    [Kriegler] No, Mr. Harbor, your arithmetic is not simple,  it's simplistic. If you take 10,000 voting stations for which  we have estimated a 3,000 per voting station turnout, plus 1,200  for safety, you see already that we are well over the figure  that you seem to have taken as a subtractive in your arithmetic.    [Harbor] But those forms are missing. They are not there.    [Kriegler] Not missing. You don't know they are missing, and  I don't think they are missing. I think that they are up there  in the sticks in 10,000 little voting stations, and I'm  virtually prepared to put my head on a block that that is the  ultimate answer. But I can't say that categorically because I  don't know the facts. But I do not think it advances the public  interest to make simplistic arithmetic and cast doubt on an  electoral process that all of us sincerely hope will prove to  have been a legitimate one.    [Correspondent Pierre Claasen] Judge, you have already said  that you expect things to go better tomorrow, but can you tell  us whether you think that tomorrow will be sufficient to finish  off this election?    [Kriegler] I think that it should be clear from what I said  earlier that I can't tell you now what the conclusion will be.  There was an abnormally high turnout in the whole of the  country. In some parts of the country which I have identified,  we have not been able to meet that demand. In many, many other  areas we did, and at this stage to speak of thinking about a  general extension in those circumstances would be grossly  irresponsible.    [Correspondent Patrick Ellery] Judge, apart from Chief  Gatsha  Buthelezi, have any other political party leaders expressed  dissatisfaction to you directly for any procedure? If so, who,  and what have they expressed to you? If not, does that imply  that the rest of the political parties are quite satisfied with  the way things are going?    [Kriegler] I don't know of a single leader of a political  party that didn't have a complaint. I would be surprised if it  were otherwise in the game of politics. There were complaints  ranging for the trivial to the substantive, namely that a voting  station did not open in a particular place whereas it should, or  that the supply of stickers in a particular voting station area  had not arrived. The gravity of your question as I really  understand it, has anybody else adopted as firm a stance as  Chief Minister Buthelezi? The answer is no. In fact the very  reason why I have to be brief with this interview is that I want  to go and meet with the representatives of the parties so that  we can between us see how best to resolve the problems still  facing the country as a whole.    [Correspondent Peet Kruger] Judge, would it be irresponsible  to talk of a general extension, would it be responsible to talk  of extensions in specific areas, and if so, what kind of  extension are you looking at? Simply voting till say 12 o'clock  tomorrow night or voting on Friday as well?    [Kriegler] Obviously both alternatives will have to be  looked  at if it proves to be necessary by approximately noon tomorrow.  They are alternatives.    [Correspondent] Judge, you gave us figures earlier for the  success rates at different polling stations. One of those  success rates was a 70 percent success rate in the PWV  [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region. If I said to you  that if on the first day of voting there's a 70 percent success  rate in the most populous region of the country, and on the  second day of voting this improves to an 80 percent success  rate, but that is not a free and fair election, would you agree  with me?    [Kriegler] No.    [Correspondent Dale Lautenbach] We understand that to a  degree you have to appear confident, but to what extent is the  entire process under threat, to what extent are you besieged  right now?    [Kriegler] We are certainly facing problems. I am not under  threat, and I'm not besieged. We have decided problems, we are  addressing those problems. If we do not resolve them  satisfactorily, then we may have a crisis. But at the moment,  certainly not.    [Correspondent] These elections -- and I'm looking at this  from the point of view of somebody who looks at South African  politics from miles and miles away. If at the end of these  elections, say 15 percent of the population of South Africa  could not vote, will that be free and fair?    [Kriegler] It would not in itself render it unfree and  unfair. If that 15 percent were distributed across the whole of  the country, across all of the constituencies, more or less  evenly, that would not per se, render the election unfree and  unfair. However, if it were a selective disadvantaging of  certain members of the overall electorate, particular sectors  thereof, it may well result in such a finding being made.    [Cronje] Linda.    [Van Tilburgh] Linda van Tilburgh again. Linked to the whole  issue of possible missing votes, there's a rumor floating around  that there's 22 million ballot papers missing. What would you  say to that rumor?    [Kriegler] Madam, have you been present this evening. I  thought I've addressed that as fully as it could conceivably be.  There are not 22 million ballot papers missing. If you want to  float that rumor some more, do it without my assistance.    [Cronje] Harbor?    [Harbor] Steven Harbor from the WEEKLY MAIL AND GUARDIAN  again. We were given a figure a little earlier in a press  briefing here, of 70 percent functioning rate of polling  stations in the PWV region. Turning that around that means that  30 percent didn't function today. If that remains that way  tomorrow, are you going to declare the PWV region not free and  not fair, and if you are required to do that, what then?    [Kriegler] First of all I don't accept that it will remain  the same tomorrow. Secondly, the fact that 30 percent of the  electorate in a particular area did not manage to vote, if  spread evenly across that society would not per se render it  unfree and unfair. If it remains selective as it is at the  moment, that would be a very serious consideration in the  evaluation of the PWV election. That is not a disaster. It's  not a national disaster. The Electoral Act makes express  provision for what we do then as does the constitution. There  will have to be a rerun in this particular province within 12  weeks.    [Cronje] Ladies and gentlemen, if there are no further  questions could we wind this up by thanking you all for your  attendance. From the IEC media center at Gallagher Estate,  thank you. Goodnight.</p>

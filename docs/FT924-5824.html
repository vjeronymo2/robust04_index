			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Japan's money supply drops further JAPAN is in the midst of an unprecedentedly severe monetary contraction, according to figures published yesterday which show the broad money supply fell last month for the second month in a row. The 0.6 per cent contraction in the broad money supply in October, the largest drop on record, is a sign that the economic slowdown is tightening its grip upon Japan. The fall follows a 0.5 per cent drop in September, the first annual fall ever recorded. The sharp contraction in the broad money supply measure, which was growing at more than 2 per cent a year at this time last year, is a reflection of how swiftly the downturn has accelerated in the autumn. Concerns that the decline in the broad money supply may herald a further fall in economic activity were reinforced by declines in several other indicators of monetary growth. Previously the Bank of Japan, the central bank, had argued that the slowing growth rate of broad money was caused by savers switching their funds into the postal savings system. However, the figures issued by the Bank of Japan show the growth rate of narrow money fell to 2.5 per cent a year from 2.9 per cent in September, while the growth of broad liquidity, which includes deposits in the postal savings system, has fallen to about 2.8 per cent from about 4.4 per cent in the first half of the year. The money supply contraction is largely a reflection of depressed demand for funds from consumers and companies. The Bank of Japan says there is no evidence that Japanese companies are facing a credit crunch because the banks are cutting back on lending. However, small business leaders have become increasingly vociferous in their complaints that the commercial banks are pursuing excessively restrictive lending policies. The depth of the downturn was confirmed by a survey by the Economic Planning Agency based on consultations with 10 trade associations suggesting the economy may not show signs of a recovery until late next year. Most official forecasters believe recovery should start in the spring.</p>

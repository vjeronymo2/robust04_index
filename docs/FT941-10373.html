			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Tax rise will not harm recovery, says CBI Tax increases in April will not harm the recovery, Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, claimed yesterday, as figures showed the economy strengthening throughout the regions. In a speech to business leaders and academics at London's City University last night, Mr Davies said: 'Those who argue that tax increases will stop the recovery are making a political, not an economic, point.' The speech coincided with the release of the CBI's latest survey of regional industrial trends showing that UK manufacturing orders rose in every region except Northern Ireland in the four months to January. However, Mr Davies warned that investment intentions were 'worryingly weak' because companies were looking for too high a rate of return. He added: 'Quite typically, corporations look for returns of 17 or 20 per cent before they will grant new investment plans board approval. In a world of very low inflation . . . these hurdle rates are high and imposing them may choke off many good project opportunities.' He said that while the tax increases were bound to have an effect on the economy, past rises suggested that a slowdown in consumer spending was not inevitable. Consumers might simply reduce their level of savings to offset the tax impact. 'The government will be advised to reduce interest rates a little further as the year proceeds, particularly if the exchange rate strengthens and/or there is seen to be some adverse effect on confidence from the tax increases,' Mr Davies said. According to the regional survey, produced in conjunction with Business Strategies, an economic consultancy, the largest increases in manufacturing orders were in Yorkshire and Humberside, the south-east, Scotland and Wales. Output has risen in most regions against a background of weak cost and price pressures. The survey shows business optimism increasing, with companies expecting overall demand and output to rise further in all mainland regions over the next four months. Export optimism about the year ahead has also strengthened, suggesting that the recovery is not wholly dependent on domestic demand. Manufacturing employment is still falling but the rate of job losses has eased. The survey shows that companies in most regions, especially the West Midlands and south-west, expect to increase investment in plant and machinery in the next 12 months, mainly to raise efficiency. The survey says companies cite inadequate net returns, rather than demand uncertainty, as the main reason for limiting capital spending.</p>

Given that [Prime  Minister Nicolae] Sangheli and [Agrarian Democratic Party of  Moldova Chairman Dimitru] Motpan have encouraged the elections  in the South, the Democratic Agrarian Party of Moldova [PDAM]  now has to pay some electoral bills. A last week appeal of  Comrat [capital of the Gagauz region] to the Chisinau Parliament  says that 85.4 percent of the electors in Gagauz regions "have  pleaded for the development of the Gaguz Republic as a  national-territorial formation within the Republic of Moldova."  Comrat hopes that "representatives of the PDAM and of the Block  of the Socialist Party and the Unitate-Edinstvo Movement, which  has the majority in the new parliament, as well as the 17 March  official declarations made by [Moldovan President] Mircea Snegur  and Andrei Sangheli will ease the solution of the problem of the  self-determination of regions mostly inhabited by the Gagauz."  The session of the Gagauz Parliament adopted on 14 March a  declaration that opts for the "recognition of the Gagauz  Republic as a national-territorial formation as compound of  Moldova, and the legalization in the new [Moldovan] Constitution  of the principle of the republic's federalization." Snegur had  repeatedly opposed this principle. One of the PDAM leaders,  Aurel Talmaci, declared that the agrarians will only support the  idea of a special status for the southern regions. Petru  Lucinschi [speaker of Moldova's Parliament] declared before the  elections that "we should not be afraid of the word  `federalization,' as it does not mean yet the republic's  dismemberment." The opposition does not feel responsible for  the solution of the Gaguz problem. It considers  anti-constitutional the inclusion of the supplementary question  about the Gagauz' statehood into the bulletins of the 6 March  poll.</p>

			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / India ready to defend reform plan INDIA is prepared to take tough decisions in order to keep its economic reform programme on course, Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, said yesterday. In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Singh said the government wanted to reduce inflation and the fiscal deficit further before agreeing with the International Monetary Fund on an Extended Fund Facility borrowing which would replace its current standby borrowing. 'I would like the quality of our adjustment to be improved, to be seen to be improving, so that whatever we promise, we can deliver,' the minister said. To do this, the government has to take highly political decisions in the next few months, including a reduction of fertiliser and petroleum subsidies. 'Farmers are 70 per cent of the population and last year we raised prices of fertiliser by 30 per cent in one go,' Mr Singh said. 'These are difficult decisions but we have to grapple with them.' He rejected suggestions that the impetus for reform had been weakened by the Rs35bn (Pounds 636m) financial markets scandal and said that 'the economy is at long last showing distinct signs of improvement'. Year-on-year inflation dipped below 10 per cent this week as the effects of the July 1991 devaluation of the rupee dropped out of the calculations, although economists remain to be convinced that the drop is durable. Exports recorded a 0.4 per cent year-on-year increase in dollar terms in the second quarter. Industrial production is also showing faint signs of improvement. But there are fears that the slowdown in the banking system resulting from the financial scandal - with banks embroiled in a series of investigations of their books - is limiting the flow of finance to industry. The scandal, in which several foreign banks are heavily involved, would not deter India from allowing in foreign banks, provided that they acted within the law, Mr Singh said. Separately, a senior finance ministry official said India expects to unveil rules for direct foreign institutional investment in the stock market within two or three weeks.

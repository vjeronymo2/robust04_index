			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: DOWNEY;  </P> <P> STUDENTS SKIP CLASS, MARCH AGAINST STRICTER DRESS CODE  </P> <P> About 150 students opposed to a new anti-gang dress code skipped class and  demonstrated Monday at Downey High School, leaving one window broken and  several trash cans overturned, officials said.  </P> <P> The demonstration was mostly peaceful and orderly, but one student threw a rock  and broke a window in a vacant school building, Assistant Principal Allen Layne  said.  </P> <P> School officials have identified the student, who will be suspended, Layne  said.  </P> <P> Eight other students already have been suspended for one to three days for  carrying signs with profanity and for exhibitionism -- two girls lifted their  blouses in protest during the demonstration, Layne said. The rest of the  students, who missed their fifth period classes, will receive detention.  </P> <P> The new anti-gang element of Downey High's existing dress code took effect  Monday. It bans hats, except for those with the school logo, a certain type of  baggy pants and web belts. It also prohibits students from wearing shirts that  are buttoned only at the top.  </P> <P> The student protesters complained that the new rules were overly broad,  covering non-gang attire as well. School officials met Monday and Tuesday with  student leaders. As a result, most web belts will be permitted, Layne said. The  students were assured that the dress code would be enforced on a case-by-case  basis, strictly against gang-related attire.  </P></p>

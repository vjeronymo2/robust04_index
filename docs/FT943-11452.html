			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Warning on Rwanda refugees The United Nations' top aid official said yesterday Rwanda could see yet another 'world record' refugee exodus when French troops pull out of their south-western security zone next month. Mr Peter Hansen, under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, issued the warning on his return from the region, where the UN is already struggling to look after more than 2m refugees. About 1.6m Rwandan Hutus have taken refuge in the safe area set up by France, which says it will withdraw its 2,500 troops by the time its UN mandate expires on August 22. The first French troops left yesterday. 'If we have a vacuum and that vacuum would lead to instability, we could see an exodus from that zone into Zaire, where there are already 500,000 to 600,000 refugees in Bukavu and Uvira,' Mr Hansen said. In Washington, President Clinton asked Congress to approve Dollars 320m of extra aid. He said the US was 'urgently reviewing' whether to open a new airfield in the Rwandan capital, Kigali, to speed aid deliveries.</p>

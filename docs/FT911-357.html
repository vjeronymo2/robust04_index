			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Italy's discount rate cut after budget agreed ITALY yesterday cut its discount rate by one point to 11.5 per cent. This followed agreement by the cabinet on Saturday to a budget package worth L14,200bn (Pounds 6.5bn) to bring the deficit back into line with this year's L132,000bn target. The moves marked the end of a tense week for Mr Giulio Andreotti's new government, in which it appeared to be in danger of a renewed crisis and possibly early elections. Saturday's mini-budget, which represents a compromise between calls for tough spending curbs and demands to protect public expenditure, has put off that risk, at least for the time being. The new measures will partly satisfy the treasury minister, Mr Guido Carli, who reportedly threatened to resign if his spending cuts were not accepted. Mr Carli has also won agreement on preparing for the part-privatisation of various state enterprises. The cabinet agreed small rises in employee pension contributions, and tensions between the coalition parties could return in days given the decision to prepare a draft pensions reform law by June 15. Both trade unions and the Democratic Party of the Left (the former Communists) criticised the increases in pension contribution. The Socialists, who had argued that changes to the pension system were not part of the policy package agreed by the coalition parties last month, will have been pleased with the discount rate cut. Some L7,100bn is to be saved this year by reducing turnover among public-sector employees and spending freezes. Meanwhile, a similar amount will be raised by additional indirect taxes and levies, including charges on portable telephones and credit cards. Italy's leading businessmen have criticised the budgetary measures as being insufficient and weighted too heavily towards revenue raising rather than spending cuts. However, the discount rate cut, which will help reduce inflation and lower the government's borrowing costs, has met with approval.</p>

			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Swiss bank sacks two London staff Two London staff of UBS, the Swiss bank, have been dismissed and two others have resigned following breaches of internal procedure, the bank said yesterday. Market sources said they believed the resignations and dismissals related to an overstatement of profits on one of the bank's proprietary trading positions. There is not believed to have been any collusion between the individuals. The bank said no losses were incurred by it or clients and the rule breaches were not a criminal matter.</p>

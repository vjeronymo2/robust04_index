Cardoso's advisers denied he made such a request, but they  admitted he had conferred with the team on the status of the  economic stabilization plan and the various alternatives for the  new currency's implementation. Dismissing the possibility that  the meeting could convey the idea of a parallel government, the  advisers said the economists called on Cardoso to convey to him  their condolences over the death of his younger brother and  ended up engaging in a long discussion on political and economic  issues.    The meeting, which was held at Cardoso's home from 1630 --  when he arrived in Brasilia -- to 1800, was attended by Central  Bank [BC] President Pedro Malan, who gave a briefing on the debt  agreement signed on 15 April; Gustavo Franco, director of the BC  International Department; Winston Fritsch, secretary for  economic policy; Persio Arida, president of the National Bank  for Economic and Social Development; special adviser Edmar  Bacha; Finance Ministry executive secretary Clovis Carvalho; and  diplomat Sergio Amaral, chief of Finance Minister Ricupero's  staff.    After the meeting, Cardoso went to Planalto Palace to meet  President Itamar Franco. He was scheduled to meet at night with  Ricupero. According to his advisers, in his talks with Franco  and Ricupero, Cardoso was to discuss a definition of a minimum  agenda for the constitutional revision.    One economist described their meeting with Cardoso as a  meeting among friends at which they discussed the formation of a  comprehensive front to back the presidential candidacy of the  former finance minister.    PSDB campaign coordinator Euclides Scalco confirmed  Cardoso's  interest in reducing the transition period toward creating the  real. In remarks by telephone from Curitiba, he said: "With the  implementation of the real, we will bring inflation down  faster." Despite the arguments that it would be better to wait  until August or even September to implement the new currency,  Scalco deems it more important to obtain economic results as  soon as possible.</p>

			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Southern Pacific May Leave San Francisco: Southern Pacific Transportation Co.  may sell its downtown headquarters and transfer some or all of its 1,800  workers out of San Francisco, spokesman Jim Loveland said.  </P> <P> The sale could help relieve the company's burden of about $500 million in  acquisition debt. But Loveland said offers for the building triggered the  company's review of a possible sale. "We're going to analyze the process by  which we might sell the building and move to less expensive headquarters --  possibly in the Bay Area or possibly outside," Loveland said.  </P></p>

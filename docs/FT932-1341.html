			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Telecoms infant rides on the back of Grid's pylons: Energis will launch a strong attack on established operators COMPETITION breeds competition, nowhere more than in today's telecommunications industry. Between them, British Telecommunications, Mercury and the electricity distributors have spawned Energis, potentially the UK's most formidable telecoms infant since the launch of Mercury a decade ago. Energis, a wholly owned subsidiary of National Grid, last month gained a government licence to erect a telecommunications network on National Grid pylons across England and Wales. It is staffed by experts from its main competitors. Mr Gordon Owen, Energis's chairman, is the man who built up Mercury. Its chief executive is Mr David Dey, a former BT director who helped spearhead its assault on new markets in the late 1980s. Mr Owen said: 'Between us, there isn't much we don't know about running a first-class telecoms business.' Energis is erecting a fibre-optic network at the rate of 50 miles a week - mainly by wrapping the fibre round the earth wire on the National Grid pylons. It plans a nationwide launch next April. It says by then it will have invested Pounds 100m, setting up nearly 1,500 miles of cable linking 17 of the 23 largest conurbations in England and Wales. Mr Owen said: 'At launch Energis will be within local call distance of 70 per cent of households in England and Wales. We will be marketing to domestic customers, not just companies. We don't intend to be a niche player, but the third force in UK telecoms.' Energis intends to compete strongly on price. It is considering discounts of between 10 per cent and 15 per cent on BT and Mercury tariffs depending partly on what it will need to pay its competitors for connecting calls locally and over trunk routes that its network does not serve. Given the scale of profits in the industry, Energis is not short of opportunities. In spite of the recession Mercury this week announced pre-tax profits for the year to March 31 of Pounds 192m on turnover of Pounds 1.2bn  -up 24 per cent on last year. Nonetheless, BT and Mercury prices are falling fast. BT has agreed with Oftel, the industry regulator, to reduce call charges over the next year, using a formula that limits price changes to no more than the retail price index minus 7.5 percentage points. The former state monopoly is also cutting costs and sharpening its marketing edge, with a massive redundancy programme, large price discounts for heavy-user businesses, and a growing range of special offers for domestic customers. Mr Owen insisted that lower overheads would enable him to sustain competition. 'We intend to outsource almost everything besides key strategic operations,' he said. Northern Telecom, the Canadian telecommunications equipment supplier, has been appointed prime contractor. It has installed a team at Energis's headquarters to design its network, which will use Nortel's advanced public switching system to offer a range of new services. Energis also intends to exploit growing competition in the local telephone market. It is talking to cable TV companies, whose fast-growing subscriber list - presently at 160,000 - could allow Energis to by-pass BT in much of the country. Energis has other assets. The electricity companies serve almost every address in the UK, giving ample marketing opportunities, and Energis will be fully integrated with their billing, servicing and retail outlets. The company says its philosophy is to provide new services on existing infrastructures. That also applies to its communications with customers. British business is well attuned to telecoms competition - more than half the City's outgoing traffic is routed via Mercury - and its determination to flex its collective muscle is increasing. Banks and credit card companies are demanding large discounts in return for the increasing volume of traffic generated by 'on-line' verification of credit card transactions. Mr Owen will have few scruples in attacking the established operators. Cable and Wireless, Mercury's parent, is Mr Owen's alma mater. He joined the company straight from school, was sent around the world to its various outposts, including a spell in charge of the network on Ascension Island, and eventually became group managing director and chairman of Mercury. A power struggle with Lord Young led to his abrupt departure in 1991. But Energis will not be the only new entrant seeking to break the duopoly. Ionica, a private Cambridge-based company, is building a national radio network, due to start operation in early 1995. Several companies re-selling leased lines are also on the scene, offering cut-price services to businesses with minimal overheads.</p>

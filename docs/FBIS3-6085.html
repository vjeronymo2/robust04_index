			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In a 11 March Japan-U.S. Committee for  Consultations on Security meeting, Defense Agency Director  General Kazuo Aichi expressed his desire to somehow adopt the  concept of the Theater Missile Defense [TMD] system in the new  defense program, which will replace the existing "defense  program outline." However, now views in the government and  coalition parties are emerging questioning his TMD position,  citing the (1969) Diet resolution on peaceful use of space and  the doubtful performance of interceptor missiles. It is  apparent that the matter will have to undergo further  adjustments of views.    In the meeting, Director General Aichi said: "As far as I am  concerned, I would like to present a concept (on TMD) in the  revised program for defense."    Even if this concept comes to be adopted, the expression for  "TMD" is expected to be changed to something like "missile  defense improvement" in the new defense program. It is likely  that the United States has taken "the remark (of Aichi) as  Japan's pledge for cooperation in the TMD program."    Within the ruling coalition parties, the Social Democratic  Party of Japan [SDPJ] thinks the TMD concept goes against the  Diet resolution on the peaceful use of space. On the other  hand, from other parties there are strong voices asking: "Can  the system cope with the Nodong-1 missiles of the DPRK (North  Korea)?" because of the recent reports that data show the  Patriot missiles that came into the limelight in the Gulf war in  fact had poor accuracy.</p>

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / International Company News: Profits ahead by 21% at Mayne Nickless Mayne Nickless, the Australian transport and security services group, saw profits after tax and abnormals rise by 21 per cent in the year to July 3. The company made ADollars 69.5m (Dollars 52m), compared with ADollars 57.4m previously. The results, however, were muddied by a significantly increased abnormal item, but a sharply-lower tax charge. Abnormals took ADollars 70.8m before tax, compared with ADollars 51m last time, largely as a result of a restructuring in the Australian transport oper-ations and a mixture of closures and retrenchments in Europe. The total tax charge fell to ADollars 41.6m from ADollars 56.3m. At the operating level, Mayne made a pre-tax profit of ADollars 181.9m, compared with ADollars 164.8m in the previous year. Revenues were up by 2.6 per cent at ADollars 2.84bn. Earnings per share before abnormals were up by 13 per cent at 41 cents. The final dividend is 17 cents a share (against 15 cents), after an interim of 16 cents (15 cents). The company reported encouraging progress from its core Australian transport services business, and earnings from the Health Care of Australia business also nudged ahead. In Europe, operating earnings overall were up by 23 per cent, in spite of competitive price pressures faced by the UK express freight subsidiaries and continued losses and the Spanish Transportes Helguera business. Operating profits in the US rose by 9.4 per cent.</p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Incompetent trainees 'being let loose in the workplace' ELECTRICAL contractors have warned that trainees are being 'let loose' in the workplace although they are not competent to be employed as electricians. Mr Martin Pollard, chief executive of JIB, a joint council between employers and unions in the electrical contracting industry, has written to Training and Enterprise Councils warning them that not all are instructing to the high levels of safety and skill required by the industry. Mr Pollard said that some Tecs were funding two-year courses and releasing trainees to find jobs as electricians although they had not reached the required standards. He added: 'In fact the only position in which they could be employed is that of a labourer - surely a waste of two years' training.' Employer-led Tecs administer publicly funded training programmes, including Youth Training, which is a main avenue for young people gaining vocational qualifications. According to the training arm of the industry, most responsible employers would insist that their electrical employees were trained to an equivalent of the new level three National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs). A two-year course, like the majority of those funded by Tecs, would generally only offer a level two NVQ. The UK is one of the few countries in the EC where there is no legislation to ensure individuals are trained to a specific level before they can claim to be an electrician. A new training package for qualified electricians working in potentially explosive situations, such as oil platforms, is currently being marketed. It is likely that employers in sectors like the oil industry will increasingly demand the qualification.</p>

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Arts: Jeff Buckley moves out of the shadows - Pop concert It is Jeff Buckley's misfortune that this, his first major European tour, will be the one in which his work is repeatedly compared with that of his late father, Tim. He had better just get used to it and move on. As his debut album, Grace, shows, he has the talent and confidence to move out of the shadow of one of the brightest stars in the fragile firmament of 1960s singer-songwriters. Where Buckley pere tended towards jazz-tinged melancholy and introspection, Jeff prefers a more muscular approach, happy to blast away at his guitar when the occasion demands, but using his similarly soaring voice to ride over the crashing chords as he demonstrated on Friday night in the dark, dingy atmosphere of The Garage in Highbury. More successful are the songs which portray a keen intelligence and willingness to experiment of which his father would have been proud: 'Mojo Pin', all angles, floating vocals and unexpected key changes; the rhythmically buoyant and exuberant 'Grace'; the rockier, slide guitar-led 'Last Goodbye'. The trouble with both album and live performance is that these stand-out tracks come rather too early; they establish a standard of excellence which proves difficult to maintain. While one can understand Buckley's desire to slow things right down and show off the range and rich tone of his voice, his cover versions of 'Lilac Wine' and Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah' are a wasted self-indulgence, especially when his own material is so strong. It took the Jim Morrison-like 'Dream Brother' and the heavy metal 'Eternal Life' to zap some energy back into the proceedings, although by this time the level of chatter among the audience was getting disturbingly loud. What remains unequivocally true is that Buckley is a star in the making, from his self-deprecating way with his good looks (pointing out to the audience a 'pimple which Sony couldn't pop') and his hip put-downs to the startling ambition of his song-writing. By the end of this tour, Tim will begin to be respectfully forgotten, and Jeff will pick up a privileged mantle indeed. Jeff Buckley's European tour ends in Paris on September 22.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (5) Linkages (10%): Connections to existing or planned national and international programs; partnerships with other agency or NOAA participants, where appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Costs (10%): Adequacy of proposed resources; appropriate share of total available resources; prospects for joint funding; identification of long-term commitments. (Matching funding is encouraged, but is not required.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Selection Procedures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All proposals will be evaluated and ranked in accordance with the assigned weights of the above evaluation criteria by: (1) Independent peer mail review, and/or (2) independent peer panel review of both NOAA and non-NOAA experts in the field may be used in this process. Their recommendations and evaluations are considered by the program Manager/Officer in final selections. Those ranked by the panel and program as not recommended for funding are not given further consideration and are notified of non-selection. For the proposals rated either Excellent, Very Good or Good, the Program manager will: (a) Ascertain which proposals meet the objectives, fit the criteria posted, and do not substantially duplicate other projects that are currently funded by NOAA or are approved for funding by other federal agencies, (b) select the proposals to be funded, (c) determine the total duration of funding for each proposal, and (d) determine the amount of funds available for each proposal. Awards are not necessarily made to the highest-scored proposals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Unsatisfactory performance by a recipient under prior Federal awards may result in an application not being considered for funding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposal Submission <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The guidelines for proposal Preparation provided below are mandatory. Failure to heed these guidelines may result in proposals being returned without review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Letters of Intent: (1) Letters should be no more than two pages in length and include the name and institution of principal investigator(s); a statement of the problem; brief summary of work to be completed; and approximate cost of project and program element(s) to which the proposal should be directed. (2) Evaluation will be by program management, according to the selection criteria for full proposals described below as well as relevance to Climate and Global Change program elements. (3) It is in the best interest of applicants and their institutions to submit letters of intent, however it is not a requirement. (4) Facsimile and electronic mail are acceptable for letters of intent only. (5) Projects deemed unsuitable during program review should not be submitted as full proposals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Full Proposals: (1) Applicants are not required to submit more than an original and two copies of applications. Investigators who wish all reviewers to receive color, unusually sized (not 8.5&times;11 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;), or otherwise unusual materials submitted as part of the proposal are encouraged to submit sufficient proposal copies for the full review process. (2) Proposals must be limited to 30 pages (numbered), including budget, investigators vitae, and all appendices, and should be limited to funding requests for one to three years duration. (3) Proposals should be sent to the NOAA Office of Global Programs at the above address. (4) Facsimile transmissions and electronic mail submission of full proposals will not be accepted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Required Elements: All proposals should include the following elements: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Signed title page: The title page should be signed by the Principal Investigator (PI) and the institutional representative and should clearly indicate which project area is being addressed. The PI and institutional representative should be identified by full name, title, organization, telephone number and address. The total amount of Federal funds being requested should be listed for each budget period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Abstract: An abstract must be included and should contain an introduction of the problem, rationale and a brief summary of work to be completed. The abstract should appear on a separate page, headed with the proposal title, institution(s) investigator(s), total proposed cost and budget period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Statement of work: The proposed project must be completely described, including identification of the problem, scientific objectives, proposed methodology, relevance to the goal of the Climate and Global Change Program, and the program priorities listed above. Benefits of proposed project to the general public and the scientific community should be discussed. Results from related projects supported by NOAA and other agencies should be included. The statement of work, excluding figures and other visual materials, must not exceed 15 pages of text. Appended information may not be used to circumvent the page length limit. Investigators wishing to submit group proposals that may exceed the 15 page limit should discuss this possibility with the appropriate Program Officer prior to submission. In general, proposals from 3 or more investigators may include a statement of work containing up to 10 pages of overall project description plus up to 5 pages per person of individual project descriptions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prior to tomorrow's meeting of seven presidents in  Litomysl, Polish President Lech Walesa has granted an exclusive  interview to Czech Radio. The interview is presented by our  Warsaw correspondent Miroslav Karas.    [Begin recording] [Karas] Mr. President, recently you have  called several times on Western Europe, and above all on the  United States, to be more active and take speedier steps and  more courageous decisions. You have also expressed your alarm  over the situation in Europe following the fall of communism and  the disbanding of the Warsaw Pact. You have described the  countries of this part of the continent as a no-man's-land.  Will you explain your words in more detail?    [Walesa, in Polish fading to Czech translation] Everything I  have done and I am doing is being done with a view to greater  security in Europe; in one Europe -- not central Europe or  eastern Europe or whatever Europe. It is clear that for such a  Europe to emerge it is necessary to change its geography. The  Warsaw Pact and the CEMA have disappeared and we have not formed  anything new. The West has understandably stopped fearing  communism and the Warsaw Pact, and is keeping us in a state of  uncertainty.    As you know, I am not scared by any difficulties and dangers  -- I do not fear them if I know them. At present I do not know  them. I do not know what can happen -- whether somebody will  form a military pact here or whether we will begin to dispute  our borders. This is why I found myself in uncertainty and this  is the source of my objections to the West. Following the  disappearance of the old structures the West has not attempted  to change the continent's geography to include us -- I mean the  countries which need it -- into the security zone. And this  applies also to the economc sphere. The present period is not a  period of confrontation, and therefore there is no need for the  chain's individual links to be of the same strength. It is  possible to create conditions for them and they themselves will  take care of gaining the necessary strength.    However, this is not the only reason for my objections. When  I hear that we are forming the Partnership for Peace, and that  one of the partners is to be bigger and that the other is given  a chance to keep its nuclear weapons -- I have to say, sorry.  For me this is something similar to the Yalta Agreement. With  the help of the United States let's build one Partnership for  Peace in Europe! Let's include Russia, with its nuclear weapons!    And subsequently, let's push America out of Europe! -- and  we  will thus create the United States of Russia.    However, what I want is a United States of Europe and thus  observing all this I want to warn and call on all those who bear  responsibility to pay attention to the fact that we have found  ourselves at a crossroads, and if we make a mistake now it will  be my grandchildren who pay for it. I simply do not want to  commit any mistake. [end recording]</p>

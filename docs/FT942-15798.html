			<p>940413 FT  13 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: Dax volatility index planned The Deutsche Terminborse (DTB), Germany's futures and options exchange, plans to publish a volatility index, which will measure implied volatility in the Dax (German stock) index options market. The index 'will make the complexities of price calculation in the derivative markets even more transparent,' according to the exchange. The new index will show, for example, that DTB market participants expect a 200-point rise or fall in the index within the next four months. Option prices are based on market participants' estimation of assumed future volatility.</p>

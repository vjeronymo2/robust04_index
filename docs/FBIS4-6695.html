			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Akio Tamesada; from NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 21 April </F> Morning Edition]    [Text] Vienna, 20 Apr -- An International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) source revealed on 20 April that the DPRK (North  Korea) sent a letter to IAEA on 20 April indicating a positive  attitude toward inspections of nuclear facilities at Yongbyon.  While details are not available, the DPRK seems to have  attached certain conditions. The IAEA started considering on 20  April whether or not to accept the North Korean proposal. A  conclusion is expected to be reached in a few days.    The IAEA inspected seven nuclear facilities in North Korea  in  early March. However, it was not able to inspect a nuclear fuel  recycling facility, the "Institute of Radiation Chemistry,"  although the inspection had been previously agreed upon.  Therefore, the IAEA has been demanding that the unfinished  activities obstructed by North Korea during the March inspection  be carried out fully.    To sustain the reliability of data obtained during the last  inspection, films and batteries of monitor cameras have to be  replaced in early May. The IAEA will probably take this into  consideration in its deliberation on the letter from the DPRK.    The March inspections consisted of limited inspections to  ascertain whether there had been any conversion of nuclear  substances to military use since February 1993, after the IAEA's  regular inspections were suspended. Therefore, even if  additional inspections are carried out fully this time, they  will merely mean the completion of the March inspections. The  possibility of resuming special inspections and of implementing  special inspections of two undeclared facilities suspected of  being involved in nuclear weapons development remains uncertain.</p>

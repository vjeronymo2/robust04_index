The loan, through the International Development Association,  will support the Songliao Plain agricultural development  project, which will cost a total of 382.3 million dollars, the  World Bank said.    Most families in the project area have an annual income of  about 140 dollars. "They are constrained by single crop  production, low productivity, and an uncertain market for the  crop," said project manager Rapeepun Jaisaard.    The project, the official said, will increase the amount of  available farmland and overall productivity by reclaiming  currently unarable land and expanding irrigation on already  farmed land.    About 6,200 hectares of saline-alkaline wasteland in  Liaoning  Province will be reclaimed under the project.</p>

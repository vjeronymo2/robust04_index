			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Check for the best deal on charges Pension providers do not have to reveal how much they deduct from your contributions to cover the cost of sales commission and their own administration expenses. Instead they use a meaningless 'standard charges' formula devised by the Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation (Lautro) - the self-regulating body for the life industry - which enables high-charging life offices to disguise their true costs. Life offices can use this confusing formula up to January 1 1995 but advisers can tell you what the real charges are now. Jolyon Minchin, managing director of independent adviser Pensionline, said: 'Investors should ensure that their adviser has the technology to show real charges rather than the meaningless Lautro formula. If you are offered a Lautro-style quote, be suspicious and ask why.' Behind the scenes, life offices are in turmoil as providers gear up for the end of year deadline. The ten largest providers said that they will be 'more flexible' on charges after this date. This means that you will be able to negotiate with your adviser on the amount of commission, if any, he receives from the life office on the sale of a product. Further, the adviser will have more scope to negotiate with the provider on the proportion of your premiums that are actually invested. To take advantage of the expected reduction in charges, make sure that your adviser is independent so that he can compare what is on offer and select the best deal. Some two-thirds of regular premium life and pensions contracts are sold through company representatives - that is direct sales forces and 'tied agents' which are authorised under the Financial Services Act to sell the products of only one life office. Even if a salesman knows that better terms are available elsewhere, he cannot tell the client.</p>

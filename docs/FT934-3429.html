			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Vietnamese worried by corruption The Vietnamese government has admitted that a year-long campaign against corruption among state employees is having little impact and that corruption is costing the country tens of millions of dollars. Mr Bui Thien Ngo, interior minister, told the National Assembly that measures to fight corruption had brought about no significant changes and the situation remained serious. He said efforts to curb smuggling were failing although more than 17,000 cases of smuggling have been uncovered so far this year. Officials say goods smuggled in from China and Cambodia are damaging domestic industry and losing the government revenue. The fight against corruption and smuggling has been a recurring theme for the past year and Mr Vo Van Kiet, prime minister, has made curbing corruption among officials a personal crusade. Appeals for more vigilance and more efforts to curb corruption are part of a political battle now being waged in Hanoi over the pace of economic reforms. The more conservative members of the assembly and Communist party officials say corruption and other social ills are a result of rapid economic reforms.</p>

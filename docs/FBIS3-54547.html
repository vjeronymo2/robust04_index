In this meeting, which was also attended by Foreign Minister  Velayati, Tajikistan's foreign minister conveyed the very  sincere greetings of Tajik President Rakhmanov and handed his  written message to the president. Submitting a report about the  latest developments in Tajikistan, the Tajik foreign minister  informed the president of the decision of the Tajik Government  about the holding of general elections and the establishment of  peace and stability in that country.    Olimov stressed that the Tajik nation and government have  enormous respect and affection for the Islamic Republic of Iran  and hope that, with the help of the friends of  Tajikistan--especially Iran--they will witness national  reconciliation and peace and security in Tajikistan in the near  future.    President Hashemi-Rafsanjani then expressed his thanks for  the kind message of the Tajik president and welcomed the  decision of that government to bring about national  reconciliation and an end to internal clashes. He said: The  only solution for the well-being of the people of Tajikistan is  in cooperation, national reconciliation, and solidarity.  Clashes, fighting, and ignoring a section of the society will  produce no benefits and will result in the destruction of  national capabilities. No one will benefit from it. We hope  that we will be able to witness the return of calm and stability  to Tajikistan as soon as possible, and we are prepared to help  you achieve this goal.</p>

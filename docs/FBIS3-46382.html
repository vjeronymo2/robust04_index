			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Zhongyu, Minister of the State Economic and Trade </F> Commission: "Vigorously Introduce the New Taxation System To  Pave the Way for Equal Market Competition"]    [Text] The decision adopted at the Third Plenary Session  of the 14th CPC Central Committee clearly stated the need to  reform and perfect the taxation system in keeping with the  principle of unifying tax laws, sharing tax in a fair way,  simplifying the taxation system, and rationally distributing  powers. The promulgation of such tax regulations as the PRC  Interim Regulations on Value Added Tax is a mark that China's  tax reform has already entered a new stage. An important task  before leaders at all levels on the economic front is to  correctly understand the great significance of tax reform at  this time, smoothen the changeover and transition from the old  taxation system to the new, and enable enterprises to meet the  needs of the new situation as soon as possible, enter the  market, and participate in fair competition.  <H3>  I. It is Necessary To Fully Understand the Great  Significance of Tax Reform </H3>   A. Putting into practice the tax division system whereby tax  revenues are shared by central and local authorities is  conducive to breaking regional barriers and forming a unified  market.    Developing a socialist market economy demands a unified and  open market. The various systems currently practiced in all  localities whereby local governments are responsible for their  own finances have played a great role in changing the  traditional planned system of centralizing control over revenues  and expenditures and in developing their economies. But as  reform is deepening and the socialist market economy is  developing, this type of system -- which delineates financial  revenues in keeping with the administrative subordination of  enterprises -- has to some extent strengthened the government's  administrative interference in enterprises and weakened the  tax-revenue regulating function, and easily causes unequal  distribution and enlarges the gap of economic and social  development between regions. Practicing the tax division system  is conducive to breaking the man-made boundaries, establishing  fair exchanges of commodities between different regions, and  promoting the formation of a nationwide unified market.    B. By unifying the income taxes of home enterprises, we have  changed the practice of setting tax categories according to the  nature of ownership, and this is conducive to fair tax sharing  and to promoting fair competition.    There are now four categories of income tax for enterprises  in China. For large and medium enterprises, we levy a  proportional tax which is 55 percent of their revenues. We also  levy the regulatory tax on some of these enterprises. For small  enterprises and collective enterprises, we use the eight-step  progressive rates levied on income in excess of specific  amounts, with the highest tax rate being 55 percent. For  private enterprises, we levy a proportional rate which is 35  percent. The income tax rate for foreign-invested enterprises  is 30 percent plus 3 percent of local additional tax. The  income tax rate for enterprises in special economic zones and  economic and technological development districts is 15 percent.  The income tax for productive enterprises in the old urban  areas of coastal open cities is 24 percent, plus 3 percent of  local additional tax. In this way, different tax categories  have been set in accordance with different forms of ownership in  a way that tax rates and preferential treatment differ, causing  enterprises to shoulder unfair tax burdens. The tax reform this  time has unified the income taxes levied on home enterprises and  standardized the before-tax deductions and expenditure criteria  [lie zhi biao zhun 0441 2388 2871 3294]. On the basis of  preventing the tax bases from being eroded, it has lowered the  nominal tax rates for state-owned enterprises; canceled the fund  for key energy and transportation construction projects, the  budget readjustment fund, and the regulatory tax levied solely  on large and medium state-owned enterprises; and standardized  the distribution relationships between the state and  enterprises, thus creating conditions for enterprises with  different forms of ownership to share taxes fairly and to  participate in fair competition.    C. We have adopted the circulating-tax system which is  comparatively standard internationally and which takes the  value-added tax as the main body, thus reducing the repeated  levying of taxes and encouraging the optimum allocation of  resources and specialized coordination.    At present, China's circulating taxes for home enterprises  and foreign enterprises are inconsistent. They are very much  graded and their tax rates vary greatly. For instance, the  value-added tax rates for home enterprises range from 8 percent  to 45 percent and are divided into 13 grades, product tax rates  range from 3 percent to 60 percent and are divided into 21  grades, business tax rates range from 3 percent to 15 percent  and are divided into four grades, and the industrial and  commercial consolidated tax rates for foreign enterprises range  from 1.5 percent to 69 percent and are divided into 40 grades.  Many of these tax rates were set for regulating the irrational  price differences under the planned economy. Following the  gradual lifting of price restrictions and the development of the  market economy, the current taxation system must be reformed. In  keeping with the practice of most countries, China's new  taxation system has adopted the circulating tax system whose  main body is the value-added tax. It embodies the principle of  fairness, neutrality, universality, and simplicity. "Fairness"  means it standardizes the circulating taxes on home and foreign  enterprises and specifically regulates a small number of  commodities by levying the consumption tax. "Neutrality" means  that we take the amount of value added as the taxable object and  that in calculating taxes, we deduct the transfer value of the  means of production in the course of commodity production,  deduct the amount of collected taxes on the goods purchased and  already put to use, thus avoiding the repeated levying of taxes  so that the same product will not shoulder different taxes as a  result of the different organizational modes of enterprises and  of the difference in the number of transactions made.  "Universality" means that the value-added tax covers the entire  process of commodity production and circulation and forms a tax  system which exists ubiquitously whether in production and  circulation. "Simplicity" means thoroughly simplifying the tax  rates and setting only one basic tax rate and one low-grade tax  rate. These principles meet the objective demands of socialized  large-scale production and of developing market economy and are  conducive to the optimum allocation of resources and to  converging with the international market.    The direction of the tax reform this time is completely  correct. Following the deepening of reform and the increasing  degree of marketization, the significance of the tax system  reform will become more and more fully manifested.  <H3>  II. Strengthen the Study, Understanding, and Grasping of the  Basic Spirit and Main Contents of Tax Reform </H3>   Many contents of the current tax reform are totally new.  Many enterprises do not have much understanding of the specific  contents or a basic knowledge of tax reform. They are  comparatively unfamiliar with how the new taxation system  operates; for example, the calculation method for the new  value-added system, the new ways of tax collection and  management, and the management of receipts. Therefore, the most  important thing at the present time is to study and really  understand the basic spirit of tax reform and make great efforts  to grasp its specific contents. Moreover, it is necessary to  enable vast numbers of staff and workers to understand and grasp  the following points:    -- On the whole, the current tax reform does not increase  the  tax burden on enterprises. Tax reform has a direct bearing on  the interests of vast numbers of enterprises and staff and  workers. The tax reform plan embodies the principle of not  increasing the tax burden on enterprises, as has been repeatedly  stressed by leading comrades of the State Council. According to  the data of a general survey by the Ministry of Finance, the  average tax-sharing rate of industrial enterprises is basically  the same before and after reform. The results of a preliminary  survey of 282 industrial products across the country show that  73 of them have their taxes increased, or 26 percent, and 209 of  them have their taxes lowered, or 74 percent. This shows that  most trades' and enterprises' tax burdens will not be increased  following tax reform. Of course, enterprises and their products  differ greatly, the current tax categories and tax rates are  numerous, and deductions and preferential policies differ.  After a change to the new tax system, the increase or decrease  of taxes on every enterprise differs completely. But the tax  increases in some areas can be alleviated through mutual  regulation. For example, in the case of commodity circulation,  it is predicted from the data of a general survey by the  Ministry of Finance that after the tax reform, wholesale  enterprises will have their taxes increased by a 0.44 percentage  points, while retail enterprises will have their taxes lowered  by 2.5 percentage points. Although wholesale enterprises' taxes  have been increased, due to the retail trade's tax decreases,  the final retail prices which are directly shouldered by  consumers should not fluctuate greatly as a result of tax  reform. Moreover, it can promote the integration of production,  wholesaling, and retailing. All in all, since the circulating  tax burden has not increased, retail enterprises should not thus  increase prices. Industrial and commercial enterprises should  look back at themselves, make the best use of the policies  adopted for them as well as the measures intended to lighten  their burdens, strengthen management, and lower costs. They  should never increase prices in such a way as to increase  consumers' burdens as a result of tax reform.    -- To smoothly put into practice the tax reform plan, the  state has also adopted some policies to lighten the tax burden  on enterprises. It has simplified and merged the enterprise  income taxes, lowered the rate rates, and lowered the nominal  income tax rates for state-owned large and medium enterprises  from 55 percent to 33 percent, and canceled state-owned  enterprises' regulatory tax; exempted the fund for energy,  communications, and key construction projects and the budget  readjustment fund (called the "two funds" for short), which  account for 25 percent of the after-tax profits retained by  enterprises, which has had to be turned over to the state  previously, and which is now retained by enterprises. The  after-tax profits of old state-owned enterprises are not to be  turned over to the state in the near future and are retained by  enterprises for their use. For enterprises making low profits,  we adopt such measures as levying for two years two grades of  transition tax ranging from 27 percent and 18 percent. All  these measures are intended to lighten enterprises' tax burdens.  Enterprises should make the best of the above policies, enhance  their stamina for future development, and improve their  competitiveness on the market.    -- We will use the method of differentiating new and old  loans and measures to lighten enterprises' burdens and enhance  their ability to repay the loans. At present, most enterprises  are worried about the question of how they are going to repay  loans after tax reform. We should say that through measures of  lightening enterprises' burden, enterprises' ability to repay  loans will be enhanced. However, considering the present  situation of enterprises, the state has formulated two different  repayment methods for old and new loans. Enterprises making good  profits can have their ability to repay loans enhanced by  counting depreciation and long-term interest as costs. As for  enterprises shouldering a comparatively heavy debt burden which  has been left over from the past, the state is studying and  formulating some transitional measures to gradually clear the  irrational debts incurred for external reasons.  <H3>  III. Smooth the Transition and Changeover From the New  Taxation System to the New One and Ensure the Smooth  Implementation of the New Taxation System </H3>   A. It is necessary to smooth the transition from the  contracted responsibility system to a unified tax system.    Of our industrial enterprises, 80 percent practice the  contract management responsibility system. This form of  management was a invention by vast numbers of enterprises and  staff and workers in the course of implementing reform. It has  played an important role in bringing into play the initiative of  enterprises and staff and workers and in developing productive  forces. The introduction of the new tax reform has radically  changed the foundation on which the contract responsibility  rests, because after the taxation system is reformed and after  the tax division system is practiced, the value-added tax, which  will become the largest tax category and which is shared both by  the central and local authorities, is collected by the State  General Administration of Taxation. Therefore, it will no  longer be practical to continue with the contract responsibility  system on a large scale. Moreover, since the cost structure has  changed following the implementation of the "two sets of  regulations," the book profits of enterprises have decreased by  a comparatively large margin and many enterprises have no profit  target to overfulfill or to contract on. All this reflects that  the nonstandardized distribution relationships cannot meet the  needs of the market economy. Faced with this situation, we must  further explore ideas for reform and should not merely find the  way out by readjusting the distribution relationships between  the state and enterprises, but should actively explore new ways  of invigorating enterprises. We should change from the  contracted responsibility system to a unified tax system on our  own initiative.    To guarantee the transition from the contracted  responsibility system to a unified taxation system, the state  has adopted a special policy for those contracting enterprises  that have obtained the approval of the State Council or the  provincial people's government to contract on overall input and  output before the "No. Six Document of 1993" was issued.  According to the policy, for a transitional period of two  years, localities will be assigned taxes first and then  reimbursed. These enterprises should make the best use of the  policies in the last two years of the Eighth Five-Year Plan,  attach great importance to technological transformation,  conscientiously strengthen their stamina, greatly replenish  their own circulating funds, and enhance their rejuvenating  functions. Enterprises should cherish this transition period and  remove the burden on their own initiative.    B. Adopt flexible transitional methods in keeping with  different situations.    Although regional preferential taxation policies do not  fully  conform with the fair tax-sharing principle, considering the  fact that coastal regions are the windows on China's reform and  opening up, if we cancel the regional preferential taxation  treatment it will affect the investment environment and will be  nonconducive to their further reform and opening up. For this  reason, the state has adopted transitional measures. For  example, we can adopt the transitional measure of tax  reimbursement [shui shou fan huan 4451 2392 6604 6703] for  taxpayers in special economic zones and in coastal areas which  are enjoying preferential taxation treatment. After the  value-added tax is universally levied on home and foreign  enterprises, we can use the method of reimbursing  foreign-invested enterprises for their actual increased taxes at  the end of each year, or many times in different years so as to  guarantee the stability and continuity of the foreign-related  taxation policy. Moreover, the State Council will use  transitional methods for some special enterprises that were  originally exempt from taxation. All these measures are  conducive to the smooth transition from the old taxation system  to the new.    C. We will pay good attention to publicizing tax regulations  and formulate and introduce policies related to the changeover  from the old taxation system to the new so that enterprises are  prepared and will dispel unnecessary misunderstandings.    Practicing the new taxation system is an overall reform of  the old taxation system and is an important step toward the  market economy. But putting into practice the new taxation  system involves many specific questions. As for the question of  how to deduct taxes this year from the stocks of enterprises'  raw materials and finished products that were already taxed last  year, the State General Administration of Taxation has already  made specific regulations regarding this and has fully  considered the actual situation of enterprises, and it will not  happen that enterprises bear an abnormally heavy or abnormally  light tax burden. For some specific questions in some special  trades, we still need to formulate specific methods.  <H3>  IV. Enterprises Should Adapt to the New Situation As Soon As  Possible and Should Enter the Market and Participate in Fair  Competition </H3>   A. Change concepts and make efforts to meet the new needs of  the market economy.    The great reforms in finance and taxation, banking,  investment, and foreign trade will cause a profound change in  enterprises' external environment. Enterprises should further  emancipate the mind and change concepts in the following aspects:    First, it is necessary to change the idea that state-owned  enterprises are units for state budgeting and are directly under  governmental supervisory departments and foster the new idea  that they are "taxpayers" that possess independent corporate  property rights. Like all other enterprises, state-owned  enterprises should operate independently, assume sole  responsibility for losses and profits, be levied taxes according  to the law, enter the market, and participate in fair  competition.    Second, it is necessary to change the traditional practice  whereby the state has had too much control over state-owned  enterprises, foster the new idea that the survival of the  fittest is the objective law of market competition, and the idea  that enterprises that make losses for a long time and that are  unable to repay debts should go bankrupt according to the law.  This will strengthen the sense of urgency and the sense of  crisis of enterprises in striving for survival and development  in the face of market competition.    Third, it is necessary to change the thinking that  enterprises merely demand tax reductions and profit concessions  during enterprise reform and focus on changing the mechanism and  bringing innovations in the enterprise system. It is necessary  to strengthen enterprises' competitiveness through establishing  a new enterprise system.    B. Conscientiously implement the "two sets of regulations"  and properly reappraise the stocks and assets of enterprises,  laying the groundwork for enterprises to enter the market and  compete fairly.    From 1 July 1993 onward, all enterprises must implement the  "two sets of regulations." In reappraising the stocks and  assets of enterprises next year, we should continue to increase  experimentation. These two jobs are to support the new tax  reform to be introduced soon. They are, as we can say, the  foundation for the new taxation system. If properly used, the  10-point policy laid down in the Ministry of Finance's "Circular  on the Question of Convergence Regarding the Implementation of  Enterprises' New Financial System" (Financial Work Document  Number 199 of 1993) and the 10-point policy laid down in the  State Council General Office's "Circular on Relevant Policies  for Increasing Experimentation With the Reappraisal of the  Stocks and Assets of Enterprises" (Number 29 issued by the State  Council General Office in 1993), in particular, will be  conducive to reappraising the property being used by legal  entities and digest part of the hidden losses, laying a  foundation for state-owned enterprises to lighten their  historical burdens, enter the market, and participate in fair  competition.    C. Quicken the readjustment of the product mix and the  organizational structure of enterprises.    After the financial and taxation systems have been reformed,  enterprises with good performance will probably have a better  financing environment, while those with bad performance,  especially those that have made operational losses, rather than  those that incurred losses as a result of policy, can no longer  survive on subsidies. We will probably make substantial  progress in the structural readjustment, which we have stressed  for many years, under the conditions of market economy.    At present, we are preparing to call the National Work  Conference on Structural Readjustment in the first quarter of  1994 and plan to take a larger step in the following three  areas: First, support state-owned large and medium enterprises  that are really strong in developing large, transregional, and  intertrade enterprise groups whose major link is property  rights, and bring into play their role in promoting structural  readjustment, improving the scale merit, quickening the  development of new technologies and new products, and  strengthening international competitiveness. Second, vigorously  promote reform of the property rights of medium and small  enterprises, invigorate the stocks of state-owned assets, and  shift them to profit-making industries through a variety of  forms including contracting, leasing, selling, and mergers.  Enterprises that are making great losses and are insolvent at  the due date should resolutely be forced to go bankrupt. Third,  gradually settle the question that enterprises look after almost  all matters in society. Large and medium state-owned  enterprises should gradually withdraw from the function of doing  social service, change to tertiary industry, and gradually sever  relations with their original enterprises.    D. Change the management mechanism of state-owned  enterprises and positively and steadily introduce a modern  enterprise system:    Establishing a modern enterprise system is the direction for  the reform of China's state-owned enterprises. We must change  the administrative subordination of state-owned enterprises to  the state to the relationship whereby they are linked by assets,  establish a mechanism within enterprises by which the owners,  managers, and staff and workers check and restrict one other,  settling the question of the inseparable functions of government  and the enterprise once and for all. At present, we should  mainly implement the Regulations on Changing the Management  Mechanism and the Regulation on Supervision which is to be  introduced soon, and quicken the change of the management  mechanism of state-owned enterprises. The Regulations on  Changing the Management Mechanism are the cornerstone for  establishing socialist market economy. We must ensure that the  powers and responsibilities conferred by the Regulations on  Changing the Management Mechanism are 100 percent delegated,  laying the groundwork for establishing a modern enterprise  system. The Fifth Session of the Eighth NPC approved China's  first Company Law, which is a big event in China's economic  life. It is the legal basis for us to establish a modern  enterprise system in a planned way and systematically and to  reorganize state-owned enterprises to the corporate system. We  must quicken the change of the management mechanism and the  establishment of the corporate system in line with the spirit of  the decision and the provisions of the Company Law so as to  enable enterprises to become the main body in market competition  and to bring out their new vitality and vigor in a competitive  environment where tax is shared fairly.</p>

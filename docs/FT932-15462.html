			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / UK Company News: Vinten pays Dollars 17.5m for its US distributor VINTEN, the Suffolk-based camera mountings and systems, surveillance and electro-optics company, is buying Bogen Photo Corporation, its long-established American distributor, from Victor Hasselblad, an affiliate of Incentive, the Swedish industrial group. A maximum cash consideration of Dollars 17.5m (Pounds 11.6m) is agreed, but will be reduced if Bogen's net assets at completion are less than Dollars 10m. Bogen currently sells 30 per cent of the photographic equipment manufactured by Gruppo Manfrotto, which was acquired by Vinten in 1989. Existing management will continue to operate the company which showed a profit before tax of Dollars 3.4m for 1992. Gearing - 27 per cent at the year end - will increase after the acquisition. Mr Malcolm Baggott, chief executive, said this was not worrying as interest was covered 10.5 times last year. 'This vertical integration secures our distribution in the US, our largest export market,' explained Mr Baggott, adding that the group was already self-distributed in Italy and France.</p>

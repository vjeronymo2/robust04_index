			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> TENNIS;  </P> <P> ATP TOUGHENS RULES, DRUG TESTS  </P> <P> The Assn. of Tennis Professionals today toughened its code of conduct and drug  tests. The group, which takes over control of the men's tour in 1990, also  announced a new ranking system and changes to speed up play while allowing  breaks between sets.  </P> <P> Instead of the four-step penalty system -- warning, point, game, default -- ATP  Tour-sanctioned events will have a three-step system -- warning, point, default  -- and the group will add testing for steroids and other possible  performance-enhancing drugs to the tests already done to detect cocaine, heroin  and amphetamines.  </P> <P> The association also said it will change its computer rankings to reflect the  player's best 14 results, and players with 10 or more years on the circuit will  be allowed to play fewer tournaments.  </P> <P> The association will also speed up play by reducing the maximum time between  points from 30 seconds to 25 and mandating tie-breakers for all sets, including  final sets, in tour events. There will be a 90-second break at the end of each  set.  </P></p>

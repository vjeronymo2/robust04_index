			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / Survey of Sri Lanka (1): Strife must be resolved - Given a brief respite from political instability, Sri Lanka has shown its economic potential with a surge of business activity - a feat which underlines just how great a tragedy the country's recent past has been SRI Lanka has high aspirations. The talk within government and business circles is of the island joining Malaysia as one of Asia's emerging industrialised nations, with Colombo, the capital, modelling itself on the city-state of Singapore. For a country which remains racked by a separatist war in its north and east, and which is recovering from a Marxist insurgency in the south, such economic pretensions might seem misplaced. President Ranasinghe Premadasa, however, has pursued a vigorous economic reform policy since his 1988 election. State corporations are being sold off or returned to private management, and Sri Lanka has adopted a generous tax regime to attract foreign investment. The economic response to the state's withdrawal has been encouraging. In 1989 the government quelled a four-year civil insurgency in the south, instigated by the People's Liberation Front (JVP) - a banned Marxist political party. And with the resumption of normal business activity, GDP grew by 6.2 per cent in 1990. Growth this year is unlikely to exceed 4.5 per cent, but would be higher except for a severe drought in the first quarter. This surge in economic activity has mostly come from the south-west of the country, around Colombo. Given a respite from political instability, Sri Lanka has given notice of its economic potential, a fact which underlines how great a tragedy the country's recent past has been. The country entered the 1980s with its population, currently 17m, enjoying a 90 per cent literacy rate, and social indicators the envy of other developing nations. Located off the south-east tip of India, Sri Lanka is well-positioned as a trade and shipping hub, linking the sub-region with the Middle East, Europe and Asia. Simmering ethnic tensions, however, between the minority Tamils and the majority Sinhalese, erupted into civil war in 1983. As the scale of the conflict escalated, economic policy received a low priority. In the past 10 years, at least 30,000 government soldiers, Tamil Tiger separatists and civilians have died in the conflict. The two-year intervention of an Indian peace-keeping force from 1987 failed to broker an accord and the prospects for peace have again deteriorated. Nearly 900 government soldiers have been killed this year, including Maj-Gen Denzil Kobbekaduwa, military commander of the north, killed by a landmine in August. Between 1986-1989, the government had also to confront the JVP insurgency which brought the economy, and business of state, to a virtual halt. By 1988, when the government began its counter-offensive in earnest, about 1,000 members of the ruling UNP party had been assassinated. In 1989 the three main leaders of the JVP were killed by security forces and the insurgency was effectively quelled. An estimated 25,000 civilians died in the struggle. The horrors of the period make the subsequent economic upturn all the more remarkable, but building the confidence of the international business community in Sri Lanka will be a slow process. A steady start has been made. Direct foreign investment inflows have increased from Dollars 32m in 1990 to an expected Dollars 70m-Dollars 120m this year. Donors expect the flow to increase to Dollars 300m-Dollars 400m a year by mid-decade. Tourists have returned, with at least 380,000 expected this year, more than double the arrivals in 1987. The Colombo stock market has opened to foreign investors and is providing an important new source of corporate funding. Market capitalisation has grown from SLRs18bn in 1989 to SLRs75bn this year. Although the country is running a large trade deficit, the value of industrial exports has more than doubled in the last four years to SLRs50bn in 1991. The government has begun to market its reforms to international investors, but it is too early to label Sri Lanka a success story. Much remains to be done on the economic front, including the need to rationalise and lower tariffs, and make the rupee freely convertible. Foreign investment is a fraction of what the country needs to provide employment for those entering the labour market. Textile and garments dominate the growth of new industry, with little investment in higher value sectors such as electronics. More important, politics may yet bar the way to further economic progress. While supporters of Mr Premadasa attribute recent economic growth to his strong leadership, his critics describe him as authoritarian, with a low regard for the country's democratic traditions. The president's position has recently been bolstered by the collapse of a parliamentary move to impeach him alleged abuse of power and the refusal by the supreme court to annul the result of the 1988 election on the grounds of electoral misconduct. Continuing dissent within the Bandaranaike family, which leads the main opposition Sri Lanka Freedom Party, has also improved Mr Premadasa's prospects of winning a second presidential term in an election he must call by December 1994. His overriding problem, however, remains the continuing war with the Tamil Tigers, who have been firm in their demand for an independent state. Aside from the loss of life, the government has to care for more than 1m displaced people, while in the Tamil-held Jaffna peninsula a generation of children have been schooled in warfare. All Mr Premadasa's options carry the possibility of failure, given the deep animosity between the Tamil Tigers and the government. Opposition parties are liable to use any peace proposal to accuse Mr Premadasa of capitulation. The government could opt for an all-out effort to crush the Tigers, but the army has been severely weakened by the loss of senior officers and success cannot be guaranteed. An attempt to re-open negotiations might be made, but the separatist leaders have shown little inclination for a compromise settlement. The move would also risk a backlash from the Sinhalese majority in the south. An all-party parliamentary committee - in which Tamil parties, but not the Tigers, are represented - has been created to find a resolution to the conflict. However, agreement is far from assured and any resolution could still be rejected by the Tamil Tigers. The final option for Mr Premadasa is to continue with the current stalemate, at least until elections are complete, with the constant flow of casualties that this entails. However, this course means maintaining a defence budget, running at 4 per cent of GDP a year. It would mean further cuts in public investment to meet donor targets for government expenditure - and would undermine the long-term prospects for economic growth. The progress made in the past three years is a cause for optimism. The success of the enclave economy in the south west shows what can be done. But if Sri Lanka is to realise its full potential it must resolve its civil conflict.</p>

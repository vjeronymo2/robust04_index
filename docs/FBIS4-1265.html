			<p>BFN     [Text] The newly inducted internal affairs minister, the  Honorable Samuel Dhokie, has said the Liberian people are tired  of war and will join forces to subdue any group or individual  intending to wage war on the nation through any attempt to take  power by force. Minister Dhokie said Liberians should all be  prepared to (?find solutions at the) conference table, noting  that the gun can only continue to bring untold suffering to our  people instead of helping to heal the wounds inflicted as result  of the four-year civil war.    Speaking yesterday when he officially took over at the  Internal Affairs Ministry, Mr. Dhokie appealed to all warring  factions, including the National Patriotic Front of Liberia,  NPFL, to effectively implement the disarmament aspect of the  Cotonou Accord so as to give participatory democracy a chance in  Liberia. Minister Dhokie emphasized that what has happened to  Liberia has equally happened to most of the great and developed  nations of the world and said what Liberians need now is a  demonstration of the virtue of reconciliation, love for one  another, and forgiveness in order to rebuild the country.    Minister Dhokie said that his ministry is one of the  bedrocks  upon which the achievement of lasting peace, reconciliation, and  reunification rests and assured that he would work tirelessly to  bring the people together under the Liberia National  Transitional Government [LNTG]. He reminded the Internal  Affairs Ministry family of the important role the ministry must  play at this crucial time and urged them to remain dedicated,  committed, and responsible for the mandate of the LNTG.    Minister Dhokie then apologized to the traditional leaders  in  the country, especially those who left their various counties  and got stranded in Monrovia for the suffering the war has  caused them and appealed to them to fully contribute to the  success of the LNTG.    The newly commissioned defense minister, retired Major  General Sande Ware, has called on officials of the Defense  Ministry to work in unison for the enhancement of policies and  programs of the LNTG. He said that it is only through a united  front that people of one goal can withstand the test of time in  the service of their community and nation. Minister Ware, who  retained his position as defense minister, maintained that the  hallmark of his administration will be division of land, labor,  and hard work at the Defense Ministry. [sentence as heard] The  LNTG defense minister made the remark yesterday during his first  meeting with officials of the Defense Ministry and members of  the general and special staff of the Armed Forces of Liberia.    On the crisis in ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for  Democracy in Liberia], Minister Ware asked the Defense Ministry  family to assist in bringing the parties together for the  peaceful resolution of the conflict. He described the ULIMO  crisis as the most dangerous conflict in the country and  appealed to peace-loving Liberians and friends of Liberia to get  involved to quickly bring the ULIMO internal crisis (?to a  speedy end).</p>

			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / The Markets: Chaos in economics - Economic Eye "It will rain on Southwark Bridge at 11.05am on July 13 1995, for precisely 9 minutes and 5 seconds'. Imagine that perfectly accurate forecasts of this kind could be provided for any place and time. Living would become unbearable. Fortunately, it is not merely difficult to achieve such accuracy, it is inconceivable. As David Parker and Ralph Stacey note in their brave attempt to explain the implications of chaos theory to the mathematically illiterate: 'Non-linear feedback systems are highly sensitive to initial conditions, which means that some imperceptible noise in the system can escalate into major qualitative changes in the behaviour of that system. In such systems we cannot safely assume that small errors are unimportant . . . In fact, the links between cause and effect disappear in the complexity of interactions. In consequence, the long-term future of the system is inherently unpredictable'.* Even though weather is chaotic, it is not random. We will never know when precisely it will rain (until it has happened), but we do know that London's temperature in July will be neither minus 20 degrees centigrade, nor plus 50. 'Non-linear systems generate forms of behaviour that are neither stable nor unstable. They are continuously new and creative.' They operate in a state of 'bounded instability', which is qualitatively different from either stability or instability. The chart, which comes from a book by the mathematical physicist, Professor Roger Penrose, illustrates what this means for a simple, non-linear mathematical relationship. The patterns are recognisable, but irregular. Tiny differences in initial sets of numbers lead to different, 'yet recognisably similar patterns to the original shape'. Such patterns are no mere mathematical curiosity. They can be seen in many natural systems: not just in the weather, but also in turbulent liquids and gases. What does this mean for human affairs, particularly for economics? A great deal, argue the authors, who note that 'all human systems are feedback systems. Furthermore, these systems always involve non-linear relationships'. Consider the way proud businesses like IBM and General Motors seem suddenly unable to control their fate. Consider the apparent failures of Keynesian demand management in the 1970s and technical monetarism in the 1980s. Consider, more astoundingly, the collapse of Soviet Communism after seven decades of expansion. These all seem excellent examples of what chaos theorists call a 'phase transition' - a sudden qualitative change in a system's behaviour. But the last is the most symbolic. This is not just because this empire collapsed, but also because of what it stood for. It was grounded on the conviction that societies could be planned. The goal was a rich society in which happy comrades would lose their capacity for self-interested behaviour. The result, millions of corpses later, is impoverished countries in which dispirited people act quite as selfishly as anywhere else. So much for the construction of socialism, ignis fatuus of our century. The failure of socialist planning was most clearly foretold, in the 1920s and 1930s, by economists of the Austrian school, notably Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich von Hayek. This is not an accident. For the authors of the IEA pamphlet suggest that the Austrian vision of the economic process is both more in accord with reality and more justifiably critical of planning than standard neoclassical orthodoxy. Both schools agree on the value of markets. But neoclassical theorists tend to see a market economy as a sort of giant calculator, with equilibrium outcomes pre-determined by maximising behaviour, subject to given resources, knowledge and tastes. Economics, for them, is just the logic of choice. Austrians, by contrast, see the economy as an evolutionary system, propelled onwards by creative entrepreneurship. To work, such an economy must be based on private property, they would argue. Moreover, it cannot be planned, even in principle. The difference between these visions is profound. Neo-classical general equilibrium theorists argue that the market outcome is optimal only if all spot and future markets clear simultaneously. But the vast majority of such markets do not even exist, an 'imperfection' used to justify government interventions. To Austrians, this so-called imperfection is not merely unavoidable, but precisely what justifies reliance on the market. For them, markets are the only way to secure adaptation to the inherently unforeseeable future. Fortunately, orthodox economics does not need to be thrown overboard, argue Mr Parker and Mr Stacey. It remains invaluable in thinking about the effects of particular economic processes, such as exchange rate over-valuation or monetisation of budget deficits. But in a chaotic system, accurate quantitative prediction is impossible. If chaos theory does provide a mathematically sophisticated justification for the Austrian vision, that is good news, largely because professional economists can be persuaded only by arguments of that kind. But that vision has long seemed compelling. As with the rain, we will never know precisely what the economy will look like 10 years hence. But we do know what kind of economic system will adapt best to the changes we cannot predict. *David Parker and Ralph Stacey, Chaos, Management and Economics: the Implications of Non-Linear Thinking, Hobart Paper 125 (London: Institute of Economic Affairs, 1994).</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> New Jersey has met the first PROGRAM component by locating the SBAP within DEPE's Office of Permit Information and Assistance and by committing in its SIP to meet the six requirements set forth in section 507(a) of the CAA. New Jersey has met the second PROGRAM component and the seventh requirement of section 507(a) of the CAA by designating the New Jersey Department of Commerce and Economic Development, Office of Business Advocacy, to be the Small Business Ombudsman's Office. To meet the third PROGRAM component and section 507(e) of the CAA, New Jersey will enact legislation in order to authorize the establishment of a CAP, and members to the CAP will be appointed no later than November 15, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA finds that New Jersey presently lacks the requisite authority to establish a CAP. Therefore, EPA is conditionally approving New Jersey's section 507 program. Full approval will be granted once authority to establish a CAP has been enacted and submitted as a SIP revision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. New York  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> New York has met all of the requirements of section 507 of the CAA by submitting a SIP revision on January 11, 1993 that implements all required PROGRAM elements or delineates milestone dates for when any remaining PROGRAM elements will be enacted by November 15, 1994. A copy of New York's adopted legislation authorizing the PROGRAM was sent as a supplement to the SIP on August 26, 1993. The final plan was adopted by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) on January 11, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New York has met the first PROGRAM component by locating the SBAP within the New York State Environmental Facilities Corporation (EFC) with oversight provided by DEC's Small Business Section. New York has also committed in its SIP to meet the six requirements set forth in section 507(a) of the CAA for the Small Business Assistance Program. New York has met the second PROGRAM component and the seventh requirement of section 507(a) of the CAA by designating the New York State Department of Economic Development, Division of Small Business, to be the Small Business Ombudsman's Office. To meet the third PROGRAM component and section 507(e) of the CAA, New York has enacted legislation which authorizes the duties of the CAP and the appointment of members. Because New York has met all requisite requirements and has the authority to implement all PROGRAM elements, EPA is approving New York's section 507 program. However, New York still needs to appoint members to the CAP, which must occur no later than November 15, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA received two comments on New York's revised SIP during the 30 day public comment period. The comments have been evaluated by EPA, and a summary of the comments and EPA's responses are set forth below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Environmental Facilities Corporation (EFC), New York's SBAP Office, commented that New York's PROGRAM could be strengthened if the following changes were made to the SIP: (1) The SBAP is evaluated by the CAP only and not by the state Ombudsman; and (2) the SBAP is able to address the CAP directly as its own representative instead of the Ombudsman acting as the representative of the SBAP before the CAP. EFC believes that in order for the PROGRAM to function most effectively, the Ombudsman and SBAP must be partners with a mutually beneficial relationship. However, this equal partnership is disturbed under New York's PROGRAM because: the Ombudsman has evaluative power over the SBAP; and the SBAP does not have the power to represent itself, its program and its efforts directly to the CAP, but is indirectly represented by a third voice, the Ombudsman.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The two suggestions raised by EFC have been carefully considered by EPA and DEC, and EPA is providing the following specific responses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regards to the first suggestion, EPA disagrees with the concept of a state Ombudsman not evaluating the SBAP. In EPA's Final Guidelines, EPA delineates several suggested duties of an Ombudsman's office. Two of the duties include: conducting independent evaluations of all aspects of the SBAP; and periodically reviewing the work and services provided by the SBAP with trade associations and small business representatives. One of EPA's criteria in determining whether the state office chosen as Ombudsman can adequately serve in its duties is whether the Ombudsman's office has been granted sufficient independent authority to identify problems and make recommendations as they relate to the implementation of the SBAP. New York has met EPA's criteria by granting the Ombudsman the above evaluative roles. Furthermore, the Ombudsman's office, in its role as the representative of small businesses, is the place where small businesses go if they have grievances regarding the SBAP or are not getting the necessary technical assistance. The Ombudsman must, therefore, have the authority to make recommendations on how the SBAP can be more effective. Thus, EPA believes New York's SIP should not be revised to remove the Ombudsman's ability to evaluate the SBAP as such an evaluative role is imperative for the Ombudsman's Office to be a true representative of the small business community.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regards to the second suggestion, New York had always intended that the SBAP could present itself, its program and its efforts directly to the CAP. The SIP also allows for each small business office (including the SBAP, Ombudsman, and DEC) to provide input to the CAP in the form of progress reports, pending issues and proposed actions for the CAP to use during its quarterly or semiannual meetings. Nevertheless, in order to alleviate any confusion, New York submitted a supplement to its SIP which clarifies what New York meant when stating that the ``Ombudsman will serve as the representative of the SBAP to the Compliance Advisory Panel.'' The word ``representative'' in this phrase means ``overall evaluator''. In other words, the Ombudsman will provide the CAP with an overall evaluation of the SBAP. The word ``representative'' is not meant to infer that the Ombudsman will act as the agent of the SBAP before the CAP. The supplement further clarifies that the SBAP can present itself before the CAP to explain its accomplishments, make recommendations, and express any program needs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

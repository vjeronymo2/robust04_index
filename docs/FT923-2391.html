			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Beijing gives assurance on Mideast arms sales CHINA gave Israel an assurance yesterday that it would not well weapons to Middle East countries, Reuter reports from Jerusalem. The visiting Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen gave the assurance to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, according to the premier's office. Qian emphasised that China would do nothing to harm the Middle East peace process, said a statement from Mr Rabin's office. 'He said China will not sell weapons to the region,' the statement added. Qian, on a three-day visit to Israel, assured Israel on Wednesday that a nuclear reactor that China sold to Iran was solely for peaceful purposes. Israel has in the past voiced concern at Chinese arms sales to countries in the Middle East. China this week confirmed it would boycott Middle East arms control talks between the permanent members of the UN Security Council in protest at planned sales of US warplanes sales to Taiwan.</p>

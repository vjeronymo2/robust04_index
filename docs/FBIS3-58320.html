The Bosnian horror throws a stain on the  Western alliance. On Tuesday evening, when everyone returns to  their day-to-day affairs of state, NATO would very much like to  project the image of a united and satisfied alliance to the  outside world. Former Yugoslavia in general and  Bosnia-Herzegovina in particular have, however, revealed the  considerable disunity which reigns within NATO, tensions which  have gone as far as raising the question of whether NATO still  serves any purpose.    After the fall of the Soviet empire, President Ronald Reagan  declared that America had won the cold war and that the United  States was the world's sole remaining superpower. The allies  promptly gave Washington the honour. And waited to see how the  "leader of the free world" would indicate the path to be  followed.    People are looking for the present U.S. President Bill  Clinton to give clear signals on his first official visit to  Europe. The question is whether Clinton can. The American  President's foreign policy to date has not shone out for its  resoluteness or for having a straight line.    On many points, Clinton has done just the opposite of his  election promises. During his election campaign, Clinton  denounced George Bush's policy on Haiti, Bosnia, and human  rights in China. But once in power, Clinton did exactly the  same as his predecessor: the Haitian boat refugees were sent  back just as before, the Haitian generals remain in power, and  democratically elected President Aristide has still not been  able to return.    Clinton attacked Bush hard for his conciliatory attitude  toward China. Clinton said that, as President, he would defend  the principle of human rights in China. The opposite is the  case. At the recent Vancouver conference of Pacific rim  nations, where the Chinese were the most welcome of guests,  Clinton did not upset the Chinese with the question of human  rights.    In the same way, America's handling of the North Koreans'  unwillingness to subject their nuclear installations to  inspection by the Vienna International Atomic Energy Agency  shows that Clinton will back off in a tough confrontation.  Clinton is seeking to placate North Korea with promises of  lifting North Korea's international isolation and of economic  aid. But Kim Il-sung has still not permitted any inspection.    Clinton promised a tough approach to the aggressors in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Ultimately, all he was ready to do was to  carry out humanitarian food drops and order control flights to  see whether the Serbians were holding to the flight ban above  Bosnia.    The American unwillingness to intervene actively in  Bosnia-Herzegovina is naturally not due only to Clinton.  Indeed, the Americans must have observed with a certain amount  of bewilderment the rivalry between the various West European  NATO allies -- primarily between France, Germany, and Great  Britain, each of whom was running its own separate Balkan  policy. Under American impetus, NATO decided in August 1993 to  bombard Serbian positions if the Serbs continued to besiege  Sarajevo or to hinder food convoys. Clinton even suggested  lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia in order to enable the  Muslims to defend themselves. None of these came to anything,  because of total French and British opposition. Clinton just  swallowed his hard words.    But in any event, it is high time for the West to try to  correct its now bankrupt policy toward former Yugoslavia.  Whether a breakthrough will be achieved will ultimately depend  on the "one surviving superpower."</p>

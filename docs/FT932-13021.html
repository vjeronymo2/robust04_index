			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Gays rights march The Aids memorial quilt stretches along the Mall in Washington where, according to police, 300,000 people marched yesterday for equal rights for homosexuals in the US. President Bill Clinton sent a message to the gathering: 'I stand with you in the struggle for equality for all Americans.' But he was in Boston yesterday to speak to newspaper editors. The president's decision not to attend angered some homosexual rights activists, who claim he has backed away from some of his electoral campaign promises to them, but others said it was better that Mr Clinton had stayed away in that right-wingers would have less to use against him.</p>

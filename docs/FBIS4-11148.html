			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by journalist Roberto Cavada at the Convention </F> Center in Havana on 22 April -- live or recorded]    [Text] The deliberations at the conference, "The Nation and  the Emigre Community," which began this morning at the  Convention Center, are still under way. During a recess just a  few moments ago, conference spokesman Miguel Alfonso held a  briefing [preceding word in English] on the first day's work.    During this first day, the conference heard a speech by  Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, president of Cuba's parliament, on  Cuba's current political institutions. Later, Abel Prieto,  president of the National Union of Cuban Writers and Artists,  made a speech. Prieto commented on the culture, on being Cuban,  and on things Cuban [la cultura, cubanidad, y cubania], a topic  that is at this very moment being discussed behind closed doors.    About the discussions that took place following the  lecturers' speeches, spokesman Alfonso stressed to the press:    [Begin Alfonso recording] I would like to point out here  something I think is important for you to know about: the tone  of respect and high-mindedness of that discussion. I think that  discussion was really -- and I have a certain amount of  parliamentary experience on which to base what I am going to say  -- exemplary as to civility and depth of ideas. It could best be  described as a discussion characterized by mutual respect, with  everyone who spoke there expressing his opinion freely. A number  of questions that are for the first time -- at least as far as I  know -- being discussed, were spoken about in a totally open and  frank manner. The climate was extremely relaxed, respectful, and  of high quality regarding both the level of ideas and the  nobility of aims.    As far as I am concerned, in my opinion, it is an excellent  beginning to this conference. [end recording]    Miguel Alfonso confirmed that nine Cubans spoke during the  morning -- Cubans who, among other topics, brought up the  possibility of maintaining a Cuban identity despite the fact  that one lives outside Cuba and who expressed concern over  certain problems of corruption that might be brought about by  the economic changes being made in Cuba.    According to Alfonso, the speakers said that the U.S.  blockade is the key element for understanding the current  situation on the island and the need to eradicate that blockade.  Lastly, they urged the Cubans inside Cuba to understand the  emigres; and the emigres, in turn, advocated not forgetting the  Cubans on the island.    Last, Miguel Alfonso brought the list of participants up to  date. There are already 210 emigres on that list, among them 156  who live in the United States, who approved drawing up an  official directory of the conference, but with a private  character, to be circulated only among the participants and the  secretariat [not further identified].    That is all we have right now, Cesar. In just a few moments,  journalist Maria Elena Alonso will make a collage of the  participants' impressions during this first day of work, and  Zenaida Costales will present an exclusive interview with one of  those exiled in the United States.    Roberto Cavada wishes you a good evening, Cubans.</p>

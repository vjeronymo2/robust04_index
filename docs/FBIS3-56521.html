			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Mayak Radio Network in Russian  at 1100 GMT on 14 January, during its regular newscast,  broadcasts a report by an unidentified Mayak commentator on the  Russian-Latvian talks on the Skrunda radar station.    Beginning his report, the commentator says another round in  the Latvian-Russian talks has ended in Riga. The talks were  held against the background of the recent provocation against  two Russian generals. The commentator then switches to a report  by Sergey Zotov, head of the Russian delegation at the talks.    Zotov begins by saying: "I think we have witnessed the  starting point of a new policy by the president, of a new  Russian policy. The whole package of measures that were adopted,  first and foremost in the military and foreign policy sphere,  shows clearly that from now on our concern for our compatriots,  for human rights, no longer stop at declarations, though these  are also important. Now, this concern and these slogans about  defending human rights and our people are underpinned by a real  mechanism for defending them. But in this case, we are talking  about the protection of servicemen, direct symbols of the state.  That is why I think it is very significant that throughout  these events, we demonstrated our political will and made it  clear what a repeat of such events would entail."    Zotov continues: "In the short term, these dramatic events  have definitely had a negative effect on the talks, on bilateral  relations. At the same time, they appear to have lanced the  boil that has been swelling: It is no secret that, for a long  time, Latvia has been pursuing the line that the withdrawal of  Russian troops is to take place without any prior treaty. These  events have yet again forced many in this country to realize  that there will be no Lithuanian variant in this case, that for  the Latvian people, for the Latvian politicians who want to keep  their posts, it is important that the withdrawal of our troops  takes place on the basis of a treaty and, accordingly, that all  issues connected with this be agreed. From this point of view,  it could be said that these events [the recent arrest of two  Russian generals] have, to some extent, been a stimulus  prompting Latvian politicians to adopt a more realistic stand.    "This was reflected in the discussion of an agreement  between  the two states on the legal status of the radar station Skrunda.  We have always insisted that for Russia, this strategic  installation is seen as having a military purpose. The Latvian  side said it should be civilian. These events have again shown  that ours was the correct line. This formula was established --  Skrunda will now be a military installation.    "The second point is the coming together of the two sides on  the issue of when this installation will function."    The commentator ends the report by saying that Zotov said  agreements on all issues, including Skrunda, are to be finalized  at a meeting of the sides in two weeks.</p>

			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Arts: Open all hours - Exhibitions The best news for 1994 is that the new Italian Minister of Culture, Alberto Ronchey, has decreed that all monuments, museums and galleries should be open from 9am to 7pm. No more apologies pinned to firmly closed doors. No more closures at two. Hurrah] Otherwise some of the most enjoyable exhibitions of the year have shown us collections - public and private - that are not otherwise easily accessible. The most spectacular was - and still is - When Books Were Painted: Illuminated Manuscripts in France 1440-1520 at the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris (until January 16). Only rarely can such light-sensitive material be displayed. Over 230 manuscripts demonstrate the genius of French Renaissance painting. The richness of the manuscripts' unfaded colours is a revelation. Most controversial was the highly lucrative whirlwind world tour of the great Post Impressionists from the Barnes Foundation (currently at the Musee D'Orsay until January 16). The trustees' flagrant breach of Dr Barnes' indenture expressly forbidding the loan or sale of his works of art (the courts quashed an earlier attempt to de-accession up to 15 paintings) is enough to make any would-be philanthropist think twice about benefitting the public good. Fears were also expressed that many of the pictures, Suerat's seminal 'Poseuses' among them, were in no condition to travel. In London, the anticipated publication of the first complete catalogue of the Italian drawings in the Chatsworth Collection prompted the display of a choice selection at the British Museum (until January 9). Coincidentally, some of the sheets that got away - sold at auction in 1984 and 1987 - took a bow simultaneously in Drawings from the J. Paul Getty Museum at the RA (until January 23). However glorious the individual exhibits, the '100 best tunes' approach makes for the least ambitious and the least demanding of shows. It was far more heartening to discover that the multi-disciplinary blockbuster is still with us, feeding the mind as well as feasting the eye. At the Martin-Gropius-Bau in Berlin the massive Japan and Europe 1543-1929 brought together books and manuscripts, scientific instruments and treatises, maps, prints and screens, export lacquer and porcelain, painting and sculpture to document the unexpectedly rich cultural cross-fertilisation. Versailles and the Royal Tables of Europe at the palace of Versailles repatriated the finest surviving French gold and silver plate and porcelain  -housed as far afield as St Petersburg and Lisbon - plus paintings, table-plans, menus and the like, to present the fruits of the recent research of art, court and food historians (until February 27). Delectable. Thanks to the restoration project of its sponsors, LVMC, Versailles is now able to stage regular exhibitions and bring some life back into the empty chambers of Louis XIV's magnificent palace.</p>

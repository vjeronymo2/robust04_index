			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At the 1992 London meetings, the Parties agreed that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Parties may produce fifteen percent of baseline production  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowances of all class I controlled substances (except methyl  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bromide and HBFCs) to meet the basic domestic needs of Article 5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> countries starting from the phaseout date (January 1, 1994, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> halons, and January 1, 1996, for CFCs, methyl chloroform and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carbon tetrachloride). CAA section 604(e)(2) authorizes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production of a class I substance at the production percentage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified for a given year (see phaseout schedule in Table I of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section A.2. Post-Phaseout Requirements for Essential-Use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Production), plus an amount equal to 10 percent of the baseline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production allowances for export to developing countries. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the year in which the CAA phases out production of class I  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substances, section 604(e)(2)(B) authorizes production  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a class I controlled substance for export to developing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> countries up to 15 percent of baseline allowances. Under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CAA, production of listed class I controlled substances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminates on January 1, 2000, except for methyl bromide on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 1, 2001, and methyl chloroform on January 1, 2002.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CAA section 604(e)(2) permits production based on limits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposed under section 604(a) plus 10 percent of the baseline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowance. Thus, in the example cited above for 1996, the CAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorizes 40 percent of baseline production for CFC&hyph;12 as listed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Table I in this preamble, plus an additional 10 percent for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> export to Article 5 countries, for a total production of 50  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of total baseline production for that year. Under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> today's proposal, because the Protocol phases out production of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFCs in 1996, up to 50 percent of baseline could be produced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through a combination of destruction credits, transformation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credits, essential use allowances and Article 5 allowances. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> person's total production in 1996 could not exceed 50 percent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> baseline allowances. Of this total production, production for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> export to Article 5 countries could not exceed 15 percent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> baseline allowances as authorized under the Protocol. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, any amount of production in excess of 40 percent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> baseline allowances would have to be for export to Article 5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> countries. This same scenario would pertain to the production of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> halons for export to Article 5 countries from 1994. EPA invites  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment on this interpretation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In proposing today's changes to the procedures for Article  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5 allowances, EPA considered the following changes to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions for transfers and conversions in &sect;82.12. Inter-pollutant transfers of Article 5 allowances, as currently defined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in &sect;82.12, will continue to be permitted within the Groups of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> class I substances listed in Appendix A and F of Subpart A.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Inter-pollutant transfers of Article 5 allowances will continue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to require a one percent offset, as required by section 607 of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the CAA and stipulated in the current regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency is also proposing that inter-company transfers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Article 5 allowances be permitted as currently defined in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;82.12 and inter-Party trades of Article 5 allowances be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permitted as currently described in &sect;82.9. However, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement that the controlled substance in an inter-Party trade  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> return to the country from whom the allowances were traded will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not apply in the case of Article 5 allowances as stipulated in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;82.9(a)(b)(1)(vi). As an example, if one Party to the Protocol  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wants to trade Article 5 allowances to another Party to achieve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improved economies of scale, the controlled substance produced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the allowances would not need to be returned to the Party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from whom the allowances were traded; instead, the substance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could be sold directly to an Article 5 country. The Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposes maintaining the requirement that the contract contain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the statement that the controlled substance exported to an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Article 5 country will only be used to meet basic domestic needs,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as defined by the Montreal Protocol, and will not be reshipped.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, EPA understands that the Parties to the Protocol are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considering, for future discussion, that reports be sent from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exporter to Article 5 countries indicating that they should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expect to receive a shipment of a specific quantity of controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substance. The Parties may discuss requirements that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exporting company send a copy of the sales contract for an export  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the head of the Montreal Protocol delegation of the Article 5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> country or to the stratospheric ozone unit in the Article 5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> country.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA seeks comments on the proposed changes to the system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for controlling and monitoring exports of controlled substances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to Article 5 countries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.

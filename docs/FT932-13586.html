			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Three-month COPPER attempted to consolidate around Dollars 1,870 a tonne on the LME after an early fall to a fresh 5 1/2 -year low of Dollars 1,820 and subsequent sharp rally back towards Dollars 1,880. However, sentiment remains shattered after the hefty battering prices have taken over the last two weeks, and selling was starting to build up by the close. Other metals ended mixed after mostly trading routinely throughout the day. Three-month NICKEL built on an early break above Dollars 6,000 a tonne. London's robusta COFFEE market continued its downward path. Dealers said the mood remained very gloomy, depressed by rising stocks in the US, sluggish demand and the prospect of a slightly larger Brazilian crop being shipped soon. 'Coffee hasn't got a friend in the world,' one dealer said. GOLD, PLATINUM and SILVER weakened on the London bullion market, but PALLADIUM held its early gains, and was fixed in the afternoon at Dollars 115 a troy ounce. Palladium's rise - after trading at around Dollars 111 for most of last week and this - came from a combination of factors, dealers said. 'It is in very short supply, although not as badly as a month ago,' one dealer said. Compiled from Reuters</p>

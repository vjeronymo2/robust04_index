			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Election 1992: One million missing voters - Ballot Box Here are the figures that everyone has been waiting for - not yet the general election result, but at least the definitive number of those eligible to vote. Proportionately, the figure is going down, in spite of an increase in the population. According to the Office of Population, Censuses and Statistics, the numbers on the electoral register fell by about 2 1/2 per cent - or just under 1m - between 1984 and last year, compared with the numbers that would have been expected if people had gone on registering in their old conscientious way. The decline became more marked after 1987. The OPCS is much too shy - and perhaps it cannot be proved - to attribute the post-1987 fall to the community charge, as the poll tax was officially called. However, it must have been a factor. Between 1990 and last year alone, the percentage of the estimated population on the register decreased from 96 per cent to 95.5 per cent. In Scotland, where the poll tax started earlier, the decline was even sharper. It was mainly the young who opted out. Registrations by 'attainers' - people about to be old enough to vote in the coming year - fell by 11 per cent in 1990. Nevertheless, there may have been a sudden rush to register ahead of the election. The OPCS's latest data puts eligible voters on April 9 at 43,725,003 - up from 43,556,783 last year.</p>

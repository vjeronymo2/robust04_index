			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Vision that will build information services Sir, Mr Nick Moore (Letters, December 16) argues against himself in his support for Mr Delors' proposals on 'info-highways'. Yes, the UK already has the strongest European telecommunications and information services sectors, precisely because of its relatively laissez faire approach to the industry. Certainly Britain's 19th century investments in railways were handsomely repaid in growth across the economy. However, this did not occur because 'Britain had the vision to invest', but because individual entrepreneurs had that vision. Any regular reader of your paper could easily determine that the information services already available (and widely taken up) in the US far outstrip those available in Europe. Further, provision of the software which makes it all happen is an industry dominated by US companies, most of which didn't exist 15 years ago. None of this happened because of an all-encompassing government plan, but because of the vision and boldness of thousands of ordinary engineers and businessmen. If a largely dirigiste (and still protectionist) Europe competes with a largely free enterprise US in information services, then all Europeans will be the losers.

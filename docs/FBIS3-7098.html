			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 24 (YONHAP) -- South Korean President  Kim Yong-sam's state visit to Japan on Thursday will spur  bilateral military cooperation, with Defense Minister Yi  Pyong-tae traveling to Tokyo late next month and South Korea's  Navy calling at a Japanese port within the year, the SANKEI  SHIMBUN reported in a Seoul-datelined story on Thursday.    Quoting military sources in Seoul, the Japanese newspaper  said the two countries would shortly agree to exchange flight  information to prevent accidents involving military planes as  the first step of cooperation.    South Korea is interested in defense exchanges and  cooperation with Japan because its plans to promote military  links with China and Russia have not met expectations since the  establishment of diplomatic ties under former President No  Tae-u, it observed.    Influenced by President Kim's Japan policy calling for  future-oriented relations, the South Korean military has begun  showing a keen interest in that country, it added.    Defense Minister Yi was to accompany President Kim to Japan  in late March but has decided to go late next month for in-depth  talks with Japanese defense leaders on military cooperation, the  report said.    It is highly likely that a South Korean naval fleet will  call  at a Japanese port this year, entailing a return call by the  Japanese at a South Korean port, it quoted a Seoul military  source as saying.    At present, the two countries conduct two military personnel  exchange programs a year covering mutual visits by army, navy,  air force and joint chiefs of staff personnel.</p>

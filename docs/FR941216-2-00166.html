			<p><!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Following is a more detailed description of the attached graphs and tables and the analytical process Nasdaq used to reach its conclusion that significant order queuing likely will not occur with NPROVE.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To analyze potential order queuing in NPROVE, the staff examined SOES activity on two trading days_February 4, 1994 and July 13, 1994 <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Exhibit 1  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> contains charts that provide aggregate data on the extent to which order queuing would have occurred in NPROVE on these days. Specifically, the charts identify all NASD members that transmitted more than 50 orders into SOES on these days, with a breakdown of how many of these orders would have been executed within 30 seconds, between 30 and 45 seconds, between 45 seconds and one minute, and longer than a minute if NPROVE were in operation. On February 4, 93 percent of these orders would have been executed with 30 seconds, and on July 13, 77 percent of the orders would have been executed within 30 seconds. The staff also used these charts to identify firms that are considered to be SOES activists. Specifically, if a firm's ``OLIM'' percentage was greater than 75 percent it was identified as a SOES activist. <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>  By differentiating between SOES activists and non-activists, the staff was able to produce the summary statistics at the bottom of the charts in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Exhibit 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . These statistics demonstrate that orders entered by SOES activists would have experienced greater delays in execution than orders entered by non-activists. Specifically, on February 4, 99.3 percent of all orders entered by non-activists would have been executed within 30 seconds, while 80.7 percent of all orders entered by SOES activists would have been executed within 30 seconds. Similarly, on July 13, 98.4 percent of all orders entered by non-activists would have been executed with 30 seconds, and 63.7 percent of all SOES activists' orders would have been executed within 30 seconds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> On February 4, 1994, total Nasdaq share volume was 376,034,700 shares and on July 13, 1994, total Nasdaq share volume was 342,162,600 shares. Both of these days were identified in your August 16, 1994 letter as high volume days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ``OLIM'' indicates the percentage of the firm's SOES order that were entered at the maximum order size.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the finding illustrated in the charts in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Exhibit 1  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> that orders entered by SOES activists constitute the vast majority of orders that would experience queues, the staff then identified those stocks that received the highest number of orders from SOES activists that would have been queued. Specifically, the tables in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Exhibit 2  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> identify those stocks that received more than 20 orders from SOES activists that would have been queued. The staff then conducted a more detailed, stock-by-stock analysis of the four ``top'' stocks on each of these days. <FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>  This analysis, as reflected in the NPROVE Order Traffic &amp; NPROVE Order Queues'' graphs contained in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Exhibit 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , reveals that the queues in these stocks would have occurred in discreet, short-term clusters throughout the day, not in a random fashion. The multi-colored bars in these graphs also illustrate that orders entered by non-activists would only experience queuing when they are tangled up in a queue created by a SOES activist. With the exception of these isolated queues, the graphs also clearly illustrate that orders entered by non-activists and activists would not have experienced queuing throughout the remainder of the day. In addition, as would be expected, the ``NPROVE Order Traffic'' graphs in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Exhibit 3  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> illustrate that these queues would have coincided with spikes in transaction volume.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Specifically, the four stocks identified on February 4, 1994 were: (1) Lotus Development (LOTS); (2) DSC Communications Corp. (DIGI); (3) 3COM Corp. (COMS); and (4) Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO). The four days identified on July 13, 1994 were: (1) COMS; (2) Altera Corp. (ALTR); (3) Adobe Systems, Inc. (ADBE); and (4) Microsoft Corp. (MSFT). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, Nasdaq believes this information, along with the NASD's proposed revisions to NPROVE to collapse the three rounds of NPROVE order processing into one, illustrate that queuing in NPROVE will not occur for sustained periods of time in any one security and that only a very small percentage of retail customer orders will be exposed to the risk that the market could move against them while they are pending in NPROVE. In sum Nasdaq believes the benefits that will be afforded small retail investors through the price improvement and limit order protection features of NPROVE, as well as the improvements to the integrity, liquidity, and stability of Nasdaq that NPROVE likely will produce, far outweight the potential costs to investors that may arise from sporadic, short-lived order queues in NPROVE. <FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Letter from Robert E.

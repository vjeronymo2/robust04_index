			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow loses early gains on easier bond prices Wall Street AFTER opening brightly on good news from the housing sector, US share prices fell back yesterday in the wake of fresh declines in bond prices and some program selling, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.43 at 3,186.02, compared to its morning peak when the index had been up more than 20 points. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished up 0.51 at 415.49, while the Amex composite ended up 2.86 at 371.40 and the Nasdaq composite 2.03 higher at 592.70. Turnover on the NYSE was heavy for the second consecutive day at 256m shares. Prices gained early strength from overnight gains in Tokyo and Europe, where equities had firmed in anticipation of an interest rate cut by the Bundesbank. Wall Street was also cheered by an unexpectedly large 1.4 per cent rise in September housing starts, a welcome piece of good news from the residential property market. Sentiment was also helped by the fact that investors are becoming used to the idea of a Clinton presidency. Monday night's final presidential debate did little to change the dynamics of the election race, and the market is increasingly convinced that Mr Bill Clinton will win in November. The same confidence in a Democratic victory, however, depressed bond prices, sending the yield on the 30-year Treasury issue up above 7.6 per cent for the first time since July. That, together with some program selling, prompted the gradual decline in stock prices. The dominant influence on trading was third quarter figures. Chrysler rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 25 1/2 in turnover of 5m shares after reporting a quarterly profit of Dollars 202m, up from a Dollars 82m loss a year ago and inclusive of a special Dollars 101m charge to cover the restructuring of its car rental operations. The figures boosted Ford, up Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 38 1/8 and General Motors, up Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 29 7/8 , both in heavy trading. Bank stocks were in the limelight. Citicorp firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 15 1/8 in turnover of 1.6m shares after the banking group announced third quarter profits of Dollars 116m after a restructur ing charge. Wells Fargo rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 64 1/8 in spite of a 72 per cent decline in quarterly income to Dollars 24m and a big increase in loan loss provisions to Dollars 400m. Banc One rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 46 1/4 after reporting net income of Dollars 186.2m in the third quarter, up sharply from Dollars 140.4m in the year-ago period. Compaq rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 39 5/8 in turnover of 3m shares after the broking house Alex Brown upgraded the stock to 'buy' from 'neutral' in the wake of the announcement from the company that it had made a profit of Dollars 49.4m in the third quarter, a turnround from last year's Dollars 70.2m loss. Canada TORONTO stocks ended broadly higher in active dealings. The TSE 300 composite index gained 16.36 points, or 0.51 per cent, to end at 3,241.84. Advancing issues topped declines 297 to 235. Volume was 30.7m shares worth CDollars 283 against the previous 25.7m worth CDollars 208m. Eleven of 14 sub-groups made gains.</p>

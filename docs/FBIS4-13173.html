			<p>BFN     [Text] London -- Quds Press -- Hamas in the occupied  territory has rejected threats made by senior Israeli officials  against Jordan for allowing Hamas activists to carry out  political and media activities within its territory.    In a telephone contact with the Quds Press, an authoritative  source in Hamas said that his movement strongly disapproves of  the arrogant threats made by Israeli rulers against the brothers  in Jordan, adding that Hamas believes that such threats are  desperate attempts to drive a wedge in the strong and close  relations among the sons of the same people in Jordan and  Palestine.    The source said Israelis' failure to arrest those who carry  out the attacks forced them to move the confrontation outside  the occupied territory, to claim that armed operations are not  launched from within the occupied territory, and to make  frivolous threats against Arab brothers.    Asked if he believes that his movement will face a secret  war  by the Israeli Intelligence Department similar to that campaign  launched against the PLO two decades ago, the source said: We  warn against any hostile acts, including terrorist  assassinations, which Israeli officials would carry out --  motivated by their bloody background and feelings of frustration  and despair -- against any of our brothers or against Hamas  symbols and spokesmen. The source noted that his movement has  preliminary information on an Israeli scheme to kill figures  from Hamas. The source, however, did not give further details.    Commenting on the accusations made at the joint news  conference held by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres that the military operations are  being planned outside the occupied territory, the spokesman [as  published] said that the movement carries out no activities of a  military nature in any Arab or non-Arab state, adding that the  military activities' planning, command, and announcements are  made inside the occupied territory.    The source stressed that his movement is concerned about  Jordan's security and stability, adding that the movement does  not want to give the Israelis any excuse to infringe upon the  country's unity and security. The source said: We condemn any  Israeli attempt in this regard. The source added that Hamas has  no organizational structure outside the occupied territory,  noting that the Arab brothers are aware of this fact and  understand the movement's great concern about their countries'  security and stability.    The source strongly criticized U.S. sympathy with the  Israeli  threats, saying that this is all aimed at widening the gap and  preventing dialogue between the forces of the Palestinian people  and official U.S. quarters. The source called on Washington to  reassess its political positions and to show more understanding  and realization of the nature of the political structure of the  Palestinian people. The source warned that certain officials in  charge of U.S. foreign policy are attempting to demolish the  bases of peaceful relations. He added that this would create  further hotbeds of tension and increase anger, resentment, and  hostility toward everything related to the U.S. course.</p>

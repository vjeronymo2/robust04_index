			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: So you're thinking of going offshore . . . - Scheherazade Daneshkhu and Bethan Hutton explain what it involves The word 'offshore' conjures images of white sand, palm trees and discreet financial dealings. But offshore investment these days can be as close to home as Dublin and Luxembourg, and is open to ordinary investors as well as millionaires. Offshore, just as onshore, there are big differences between unit and investment trust-type investment funds, although they may not bear the same names. The distinction made is between open-ended funds (like unit trusts) and closed-end funds (like investment trusts). There is a huge variety of offshore open-ended funds aimed at private investors but, so far, they have not had much involvement in closed-end funds. INVESTMENT TRUSTS Offshore closed-end funds, just like investment trusts, are registered as companies, and listed on a stock exchange. This often involves two separate places: for example, a trust could be registered in Jersey but listed on the Dublin stock exchange. Some trusts are registered offshore but have London listings; this makes them more accessible to UK investors. Why offshore? Funds tend to be launched this way because it is quicker and cheaper than setting up a new investment trust in London. Regulation is lighter and the tax treatment is more favourable. Also, managers have greater freedom to invest in the newest, riskiest emerging markets than they would with a London-based fund. Recent offshore launches have included trusts concentrating on Russia, eastern Europe, North Africa, the Indian sub-continent and other markets which are only just emerging. A large number are single-country funds, which are riskier than broader-based regional or international ones, and most are aimed at institutional investors. Offshore closed-end funds are only for the wealthy and the brave. These funds plunge into emerging markets at a very early stage. They can give private investors the chance to get in at the same time as the really big players; but although there is the possibility of sometimes spectacular gains, you are also running much bigger risks by investing in untried markets (see Russia on page V). A few offshore investment trusts have crept back onshore recently because the markets in which they invest, and the investors at whom they are aiming, have changed over time. The trend to move onshore can present an opportunity to alert investors, as discounts on offshore funds are considerably wider than onshore funds. According to Rupert Lea, of Baring Securities, a London-listed Far Eastern investment trust might have a discount of less than 10 per cent, while its offshore equivalent might be at 20 per cent or more. So, when a fund moves onshore, existing investors stand to gain simply by the likely narrowing of the discount. Most offshore funds have a limited life span of five to 10 years, so another approach is to look for a fund at a wide discount with two or three years to run. If you hold until wind-up, you will receive the value of your share of its assets, rather than the discounted share price. Tax. The treatment of closed-end offshore funds depends on whether the fund has a limited life and, if so, how long it has to go until wind-up. If the fund has an unlimited life, or more than seven years left when you invest, income and gains will be treated in the same way as from UK investment trusts, including the use of the annual capital gains tax allowance and indexation. But if the fund has less than seven years to run, and unless it has distributor status (see below), both income and capital gains are taxed as income. Buying and selling. There are no legal barriers to buying offshore investment trusts - only practical ones. Information on them is hard to find: some funds are listed in the FT (under managed funds or investment companies), particularly those with a London listing, but by no means all. Otherwise, you might have to look to specialist brokers and analysts for information. Finding a private client stockbroker willing to deal in offshore closed-end funds is the biggest hurdle for private investors; very few are able to advise on them. Once you have found a suitable broker, you also face higher dealing costs than for London-listed investment trusts. Fidelity Brokerage, for example, charges Pounds 100 commission on transactions up to Pounds 2,500 of non-UK or US shares, compared with Pounds 25 on UK transactions up to Pounds 2,500. It is probably cost-effective only if you are dealing in relatively large amounts - say, Pounds 5,000 or Pounds 10,000. Most offshore funds are dollar-denominated, so you could also have to set up a foreign currency account. Then, you have to consider other dealing problems. The main markets for these funds, such as Dublin and Luxembourg, are much smaller and less liquid than the London stock exchange. It can be difficult to get the size of order you want, and the bid-offer spreads may be wide. Most markets do not have market-makers: deals go through on a matched-bargain basis. If turnover in a particular fund's shares is low, you could have to wait for a counter-party to surface. Likewise, it might be difficult to sell precisely when you want. Mudi Onoberhie, an analyst at specialist country fund broker Olliff &amp; Partners, says this is because many of the offshore funds do not expect to have an active after-market in their shares. The funds have a limited life, and the majority of investors are expected to stay in from launch to wind-up. David Bowen, a director of Jersey-based stockbroker Jefferson Seal, says he is wary of investing in offshore closed-end funds which often publish asset values only once a month. Investors may have to buy shares without knowing the real current asset value, and this can be particularly worrying in the more volatile emerging markets which can fall 30 per cent from one month to the next. If you do decide to invest in such a fund, Bowen recommends ensuring peace of mind by picking one run by a big, reputable fund manager which also manages onshore funds. UNIT TRUSTS There are a very large number of open-ended offshore funds. Looking at the list of offshore funds which the FT publishes on its Managed Funds pages gives an idea of their number and variety. Why offshore? Investment freedom has been a major reason although this will soon become largely redundant when a change in the rules of the Securities and Investments Board - the chief City regulator - will give fund managers greater scope. Onshore unit trusts have not been allowed to invest more than 10 per cent of the fund in a market not on SIB's 'approved' list. The list will disappear from the beginning of November when the onus will shift - as it does in other countries - to the fund managers. Tax advantages. Onshore unit trusts have to pay income net of basic-rate tax to UK residents, but offshore funds pay income gross. The funds are, for UK tax purposes, divided into distributor and accumulator funds. Distributors must pay out 85 per cent of income as dividends and must not have more than 5 per cent of their assets in any one company. UK investors pay income tax on the dividends, but any other profits are taxed as capital gains. Accumulators, mainly cash and bond funds, do not pay out income but 'roll it up' within the fund. The gains are taxed as income, not capital gains, but only when investors sell their holding. So, roll-up funds are often used to postpone a tax liability. Since tax is postponed, investors can compound their investment gross rather than net, which improves performance. Marketing to the EU. In 1989, the European Community issued its UCITS Directive (Undertaking for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities) to allow funds regulated in their home state to be marketed to other member states. But because the structure of unit trusts in the UK is still very different from open-ended funds abroad - the rest of Europe, for example, has single pricing instead of the dual 'bid-offer' charging structure in the UK - many companies set up offshore subsidiaries to take advantage of the cross-border marketing opportunity. Moves towards single pricing in the UK should result in its introduction next year. Regulation. SIB can either 'authorise' or 'recognise' collective investment schemes - the generic term for open-ended investment funds. The only type of collective investment fund authorised by SIB in the UK is the unit trust, but it will recognise some offshore funds based in EU member states insofar as their marketing to the UK public is concerned. Only SIB-recognised offshore funds can be retailed in Britain. SIB can also recognise funds based in Guernsey, Jersey, the Isle of Man and Bermuda - known as 'designated' territories. About 80 per cent of offshore SIB-recognised funds are well-known UK names and include Fidelity, Guinness Flight, GT, Rothschild and Gartmore. The funds can be bought either through a UK-based intermediary or through the UK-based offices of the operator. The Investors Compensation Scheme, which offers protection of up to Pounds 48,000 to UK investors, applies only to authorised schemes. But it can be triggered if an investor, who bought an offshore fund through an authorised intermediary which went bust, can show he lost his money as a result of bad advice. Some countries have a compensation fund covering the schemes which they authorise. To find out, contact the regulatory body in that country. Cost. Charges on offshore funds can compare favourably with those onshore - particularly since, because of single pricing, there is no 'spread' - the difference between the bid and offer price on onshore unit trusts. The initial charge on offshore funds run by Singer &amp; Friedlander, the merchant banking group, is 4.5 per cent with annual charges of between 1 to 1.5 per cent, depending on the type of fund. Some surveys, however, have criticised the charging structure of some offshore funds. London-based management consultant Timberlake &amp; Co. found that, in some cases, total expenses - which include the cost of administration and marketing - can be twice as high (and sometimes even higher) than that indicated by the annual charge. Further information. Performance tables for open-ended funds are listed in Money Management and Resident Abroad, both monthly FT publications. Money Management is available at many newsagents for Pounds 4.50. For more details about Resident Abroad, contact Greystoke Place, Fetter Lane, London EC4A 1ND (tel: 071-405 6969).</p>

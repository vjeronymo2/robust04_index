Yield determined by assuming J exercises its call  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option is 10.75 percent, compounded semiannually. Thus, under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (c)(5) of this section, it is assumed that J will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exercise the call option because exercise of the option would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase the yield of the debt instrument. Thus, for purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculating OID, the debt instrument is assumed to be a 5-year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt instrument with a single principal payment at maturity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $100,000, and a yield of 9.27 percent, compounded semiannually.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Consequences if the call option is, in fact,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exercised.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> If the call option is, in fact, exercised, then under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (c)(6) of this section, the debt instrument is treated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as if the issuer made a pro rata prepayment of $55,000 that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to &sect;1.1275&hyph;2(f). Consequently, under &sect;1.1275&hyph;2(f)(1),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the instrument is treated as consisting of two debt instruments,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one that is retired on the call date and one that remains  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outstanding after the call date. The adjusted issue price,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjusted basis in the hands of the holder, and accrued OID of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> original debt instrument is allocated between the two instruments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on the portion of the original instrument treated as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retired. Since each payment remaining to be made after the call  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date is reduced by one-half, one-half of the adjusted issue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price, adjusted basis, and accrued OID is allocated to the debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument that is treated as retired. The adjusted issue price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the original debt instrument immediately prior to the call  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date is $97,725.12, which equals the issue price of the original  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt instrument ($95,000) increased by the OID previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includible in gross income ($2,725.12). One-half of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjusted issue price is allocated to the debt instrument treated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as retired, and the other half is allocated to the debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument that is treated as remaining outstanding. Thus, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt instrument treated as remaining outstanding has an adjusted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue price immediately after the call date of $97,725.12/2, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $48,862.56. The yield of this debt instrument continues to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9.27 percent, compounded semiannually. In addition, the portion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of H's adjusted basis allocated to the debt instrument treated as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retired is $97,725.12/2 or $48,862.56. Accordingly, under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 1271, H realizes a gain on the deemed retirement equal to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $6,137.44 ($55,000 ^ $48,862.56).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 7. Debt instrument issued at par that provides for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment of interest in kind_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Facts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> On January 1, 1995, A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchases at original issue, for $100,000, X corporation's debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument maturing on January 1, 2000, at a stated principal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of $100,000, payable on that date. The debt instrument  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides for annual payments of interest of $6,000 on January 1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of each year, beginning on January 1, 1996. The debt instrument  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gives X the unconditional right to issue, in lieu of the first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest payment, a second debt instrument (PIK instrument)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maturing on January 1, 2000, with a stated principal amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $6,000. The PIK instrument, if issued, would provide for annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments of interest of $360 on January 1 of each year, beginning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on January 1, 1997.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Aggregation of PIK instrument with original debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Under &sect;1.1275&hyph;2(c)(3), the issuance of the PIK  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument is not considered a payment made on the original debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument, and the PIK instrument is aggregated with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> original debt instrument. The issue date of the PIK instrument  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is the same as the original debt instrument.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Determination of yield and maturity.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The right to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue the PIK instrument is treated as an option to defer the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial interest payment until maturity. Yield determined without regard to the option is 6 percent, compounded annually, Yield determined by assuming X exercises the option is 6 percent,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compounded annually. Thus, under paragraph (c)(5) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section, it is assumed that X will not exercise the option by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issuing the PIK instrument because exercise of the option would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not decrease the yield of the debt instrument. For purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculating OID, the debt instrument is assumed to be a 5-year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt instrument with a single principal payment at maturity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $100,000 and ten semiannual interest payments of $6,000,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beginning on January 1, 1996. As a result, the debt instrument's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> yield is 6 percent, compounded annually.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Determination of OID.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Under the payment schedule that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would result if the option was exercised, none of the interest on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the debt instrument would be qualified stated interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, under &sect;1.1273&hyph;1(c)(2), no payments on the debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument are qualified stated interest payments. Thus, $6,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of OID accrues during the first annual accrual period. If the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PIK instrument is not issued, $6,000 of OID accrues during each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annual accrual period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Consequences if the PIK instrument is issued.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (c)(6) of this section, if X issues the PIK instrument  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on January 1, 1996, the issuance of the PIK instrument is not a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment on the debt instrument. Solely for purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining yield and maturity, the debt instrument is deemed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reissued on January 1, 1996, for an issue price of $106,000. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recomputed yield is 6 percent, compounded annually. The OID for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the first annual accrual period after the deemed reissuance is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $6,360. The adjusted issue price of the debt instrument at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beginning of the next annual accrual period is $106,000 ($106,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> + $6,360 ^ $6,360). The OID for each of the four remaining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annual accrual periods is $6,360.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 8. Debt instrument issued at a discount that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides for payment of interest in kind_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Facts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> On January  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1, 1995, T purchases at original issue, for $75,500, U  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corporation's debt instrument maturing on January 1, 2000, at a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated principal amount of $100,000, payable on that date. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt instrument provides for annual payments of interest of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $4,000 on January 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The debt instrument gives U the unconditional right to issue, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lieu of the first interest payment, a second debt instrument (PIK  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument) maturing on January 1, 2000, with a stated principal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of $4,000. The PIK instrument, if issued, would provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for annual payments of interest of $160 on January 1 of each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year, beginning on January 1, 1997.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

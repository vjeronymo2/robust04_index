The afternoon session began with the speech of Thorvald  Stoltenberg. [passage omitted]    The floor was also taken by Dumitru Buzatu, Romanian Chamber  of Deputies member [and Vaslui deputy on behalf of the Social  Democracy Party of Romania], who pointed out that, currently,  further losses are registered in Romania's economy, which so far  amount to over $7 billion. Senator Adrian Paunescu also took  the floor to discuss that issue. He asserted that the embargo  should be lifted and the principle of dialogue should be  introduced. Romania is suffering, the PSM [Socialist Party of  Labor] senator said, merely because of the wish to make Serbia  suffer. [passage omitted]</p>

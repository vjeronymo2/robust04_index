			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 13 (XINHUA) -- Chinese economist Su  Xing said that economic levers rather than forceful  administrative means should be used to regulate, or  "macro-control," the Chinese economy.    Su, vice-president of China's top party school, said  governments of all countries exercise macroeconomic controls in  varying degrees and with varying intensity for different fields,  and so should the Chinese Government.    After commenting that the Chinese Government's macro-control  measures of last year have been successful, Su briefly analysed  problems that prompted the government to act.    in their drive for economic growth, he said, localities  spent  huge sums of loans that came in the form of inter-bank lending.  As a result, capital construction went out of control.    Spending on real estate development, stock speculation and  unrestrained investment in "development zones" gobbled huge sums  of money, most from banks. As a result, the government had to  pay farmers "IOU" slips instead of cash for their produce, and a  shortage of funds hobbled the construction of many key state  projects.    In the second half of last year, the central government  began  putting banking activities to order.    "But a lot of loans could not be retrieved since the money  had been turned into reinforced concrete in real estate," he  said.    Banks, ordered to get back their loans, cut back operating  funds of enterprises, which then appealed legitimately for a  loosening of credit. To avoid a major setback in economic  growth, the central bank had to grant loans selectively for  specific enterprises and relax control on credit.    Still, he said, banks retrieved tens of billions of yuan and  ensured funding for more than 90 percent of key construction  projects. It also used the money to pay farmers.    "But the rectifying measures are not a fundamental cure for  the root problem," he said, referring to excessive fixed assets  investment.    In his view, the fundamental cure is to establish a system  of  comprehensive macro-economic controls that rely mainly on  economic levers to be supplemented with some administrative  means.    "In exercising macro-controls, financial, taxation, pricing  and banking departments should have coordination among  themselves," he said.    The economics professor expressed concern over the  government's budget deficit of 130 billion yuan for 1994.  "However," he said, "the real danger is for fixed assets  investment to go out of control."</p>

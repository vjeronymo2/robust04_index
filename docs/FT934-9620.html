			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Courteous Christopher shows a glint of steel: US secretary of state forces his deputy out MR WARREN Christopher, the US secretary of state, is a man with the blandest of demeanours who normally moves with all deliberate speed. Only last week he was telling angry members of congress critical of his stewardship of foreign policy that they should not mistake his courtesy for a lack of resolve. On Monday night, culminating weeks of deliberation, he acted out of his public character by forcing the resignation of Mr Clifton Wharton as his deputy in the state department. Mr Wharton, as his bitter resignation statement made clear, did not go willingly. The glib interpretation of Mr Christopher's action, taken with the full, if reluctant, approval of President Bill Clinton, is that the administration needed a scapegoat for its foreign policy difficulties. This hardly holds water, for Mr Wharton, previously a university president and pension fund manager, was never a key player in the foreign policy team. Apart from minding the fort while Mr Christopher was away, his main duties were bureaucratic and not exactly central to the continuing problems in Bosnia, Somalia and Haiti that have brought the administration so much grief. Closer to the truth is the recognition that the 'team' is not functioning optimally. With the president expressing confidence in its leading lights - Mr Christopher, Mr Les Aspin, secretary of defence, and Mr Anthony Lake, national security adviser - changes had to be made lower down. The relationship between Mr Christopher and Mr Wharton had apparently become personally difficult, or, as the State Department spokesman put it, 'had everything to do with his view of the job and the secretary's view of the job.' According to this view, Mr Wharton, lacked the diplomatic experience to become a heavy hitter on the team. Mr Christopher places great emphasis on team play, both within the State Department and in its relationships with other key departments. He has reportedly been concerned that though inter-agency co-operation has not been bad (Haiti excepted) it had not always succeeded in presenting Mr Clinton with agreed and coherent policy options. He also thought access to the president was not what it should be. Whether a new deputy secretary of state can contribute to improved internal systems remains to be seen. Much will depend on who gets the job and how soon a successor can be in place. Extensive background checks and congressional approval can both take time. Two prominent victims of these agonisingly slow processes are Mr Stephen Solarz, former congressman still waiting FBI approval before being nominated as ambassador to India, and Mr Morton Halperin, targeted by right-wing Republicans opposed to his defence department appointment. Still, Washington was buzzing yesterday with likely names for the Wharton position. Internal candidates, some difficult to move from their present jobs, include Mr Thomas Pickering, ambassador in Moscow, Mr Strobe Talbott, ambassador-at-large to the former Soviet states, and Mr Winston Lord, undersecretary for Asian affairs. Mr Peter Tarnoff, in charge of political affairs and ranking third in the department, does not figure on most putative short lists, mostly because he was rebuked earlier this year for a speech he had given pointing to the limitations on US foreign involvement. In the private sector wings, but with clear qualifications, are Mr Michael Armacost, ambassador to Japan until earlier this year, Mr Don McHenry, former ambassador at the UN and Ms Rozanne Ridgeway, previously in charge of European affairs at the state department. Mr Clinton has emphasised the need for diversity in his appointments. Of the above only Mr McHenry, who is black, and Ms Ridgeway meet the criteria, which may, however, be waived in the pursuit of the right candidate.</p>

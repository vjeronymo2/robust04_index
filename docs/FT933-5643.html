			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Technology: Coke and chips - of the silicon kind - Malcolm Wheatley looks at the brand valuation of Intel, the semiconductor group This year's league table of brand valuations, published last month by the US magazine Financial World, contained a relatively unremarked upon surprise. Ahead of all but two of the world's leading brands was semiconductor giant Intel - straight in at number three, with a brand valuation of Dollars 17.8bn (Pounds 12bn). This places it behind the magazine's estimated value of the world's biggest brand, Marlboro, worth Dollars 39bn and second-place Coca-Cola, worth Dollars 33.4bn - but in front of long-standing leaders such as Nestle, Kelloggs and Kodak. The company is only the second electronics company to make the list of 111 brands, the other being chip competitor Motorola, placed 14th with a value of Dollars 4.1bn. The result reflects several years of hard work by the company to promote its brand. Although given a big boost by being selected as the chip to power the first IBM PCs - and therefore most of those that followed - users generally remained ignorant of the company and its products. That changed when competitors, such as Cyrix and AMD, arrived on the scene. A blitz of law suits demonstrated Intel's determination to keep its lucrative patch to itself. Intel also launched a multi-media advertising campaign, 'Intel Inside', to persuade PC buyers and specifiers to stipulate PCs powered by Intel chips. But other companies advertise just as much - if not more. What has Intel got that brands such as Nestle, Kelloggs and Kodak have not? The answer emerges from a look at how the figures are calculated. Financial World says it follows an approach similar to that employed by London-based Interbrand, a branding consultancy. First, gross operating profits are determined. Then an amount equivalent to what an unbranded, generic producer of the same product would have achieved is deducted, based on a net return on capital employed of 5 per cent. After a provision for taxes, the balance is assumed to be brand-related profits, to which are applied a 'brand strength' multiple. This reflects seven factors, including the brand's leadership, its communication effectiveness and the degree of legal protection it has. Quite apart from growing scepticism about brand values generally, last year's valuation would have caught several of these on a high. After years of wrangling in the California courts, Intel's patent infringement suits still rumble on - but are fast becoming an argument over yesterday's technology. Competitors will in future design from the ground up, to avoid the very legal protection that has boosted this year's brand valuation. The communication effectiveness factor was also strong this year, thanks to the 'Intel Inside' campaign's bolstering of the brand. The strength of the leadership factor may not remain at its present level either: Motorola is working closely with IBM and Apple to launch the PowerPC chip range, hoping to bring about wholesale defections from the Intel camp. This threat was reinforced last week when rumours circulated that IBM was to clone, under 'patent beating' clean room conditions, its own version of the 'microcode' software that drives chips. This would mean that the PowerPC range would emulate Intel chips so closely that users would not know nor care what type of chip was in their computers. Publicly, Intel remains sanguine. 'Consistency over time is a brand strength too,' argues worldwide marketing vice-president Dennis L Carter. Carter denies the company is seeking to lobby Washington to allow brand valuations to be reflected on balance sheets, as they can in the UK. In launching its low-power range of microprocessors last month, the company had trumpeted its influence with the Clinton administration in getting Energy Star-compliant computers mandated in government procurement policy. Indeed, what is surprising is Intel's apparent indifference to the opportunities to exploit brand value. Carter claims the new Pentium chip is identified closely enough with the Intel name and says it is 'too soon' to decide whether the name of the sixth-generation chip should attempt to capitalise on the the company's brand strength. Likewise, he adds, there are no plans to extend radically the relatively small range of consumer-oriented retail products, such as add-on cards, modems and plug-in 'Overdrive' chips, in order to win more business from consumers who are more likely than PC manufacturers to be influenced by brand-strength factors.</p>

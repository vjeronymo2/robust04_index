			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROCCO READY TO TAKE GAME TO NEXT LEVEL;  </P> <P> L.A. OPEN: MEDIATE TIES FOR THIRD, BUT HE IS CONVINCED HE CAN WIN AFTER SECOND  CONSECUTIVE TIME IN CONTENTION.  </P> <P> Rocco Mediate finally believes that he can play with the Big Guys -- the  golfing greats, the name players.  </P> <P> In two consecutive tournaments Mediate has been paired with the leaders in the  final round. That's because he has been one of them.  </P> <P> He has been sought by the media, beloved by fans and followed by galleries that  cheer or bemoan his every move.  </P> <P> He's Rocco, and Sunday he left his mark at the Riviera Country Club, where he  shot a 71 in the final round of the L.A. Open to tie for third place with Peter  Jacobsen.  </P> <P> "I played well today, and it showed me I can do it," Mediate said. "I got there  this time and I played a lot better than the last time and hopefully next time  I'll do one or two things better.  </P> <P> Mediate, 27, said his performance at Riviera was the best he has ever played  and the best he has ever scored. "Ever," Mediate repeated. "If you would have  told me when this tournament started that I would shoot 14 under, I would have  laughed."  </P> <P> Mediate is not laughing anymore. He believes he can win now, and that seemingly  was a missing ingredient in his mind.  </P> <P> "I was nervous, but it was great," he said, "It's what you want to feel. All  the years you put into it, this is what it's all about."  </P> <P> Mediate, who is in his fifth year on the tour, had a chance to win a few weeks  ago when he led the AT &amp;T at Pebble Beach but faltered in the final round  to finish eighth.  </P> <P> That final day Mediate shot a 77, but says he left feeling positive. He says he  learned he needed to play consistent golf and, more so, that he could play with  the leaders.  </P> <P> At the L.A. Open, Mediate played four days of solid golf, shooting a tournament  total of 270, four strokes behind winner Fred Couples. He entered the final  round at 14 under, two strokes off the lead, and stayed in contention until he  bogeyed the 15th hole to fall two strokes behind. He never threatened for the  lead again.  </P> <P> "After the 11th hole I knew I had a good chance to win," Mediate said. "I  played well, I brought it back and I was one over all day. I figured if I could  just keep hitting good shots I'd be fine, but I kept just missing the putts,  and that's what happened."  </P> <P> "Then once Freddy birdied the 11th hole he played perfect from then on."  </P> <P> Mediate appeared a little shaky at first Sunday. On hole No. 1, he stubbed a  chip shot on the fringe that went about one foot. He managed to save par, but  hit his next drive on No. 2 into the trees and eventually bogeyed the hole.  </P> <P> That dropped him to 13 under, two strokes behind Gil Morgan and four behind  Couples. His birdies on No. 8 and No. 11 left him trailing by a stroke.  </P> <P> "On fifteen, I tried too hard and pulled it," Mediate said. "Then I hit a good  shot, but it caught a tree branch. I was close on 17 and 18, I almost made it."  </P> <P> Mediate's bogey on No. 15 put him at two strokes behind Couples. He parred the  remaining holes-with his putt on No. 17 stopping a fingertip from the cup-to  finish in third place.  </P> <P> "When Doc (Morgan) and I were walking up on 18, the crowd was going crazy  cheering," Mediate said. "I have never seen anything like it. Doc and I were  talking and we couldn't hear each other, we were just shaking our heads.  </P> <P> "I love that they scream and holler, and then, right before you're going to hit  it, it's immediately quiet.  </P> <P> "It was fun, and I enjoyed you all."  </P> <P> The feeling appears to be mutual.  </P></p>

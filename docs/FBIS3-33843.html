			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pakistan has categorically rejected the allegation  which appeared in the Indian press that a rocket attack by  Pakistani troops took place in a border township of Punch. An  official press release issued in Islamabad today says there has  been no violation of the cease-fire from the Pakistani side.  The reports played up in the Indian press are obviously part of  the propaganda war being currently waged by New Delhi to divert  world attention from the atrocities and human rights violations  by Indian forces in occupied Kashmir.</p>

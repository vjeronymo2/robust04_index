			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC CLAIMS L-SHAPED BUILDING IN STUDIO CITY MAY COLLAPSE  </P> <P> A political battle over a controversial office building under construction in a  Studio City residential area is turning scientific.  </P> <P> Opponents of the three-story commercial project in the 4100 block of Sunswept  Drive said Thursday that they have scientific evidence that the hill beneath  the new building "will give way within a year."  </P> <P> That contention was immediately disputed by the building's designer and Los  Angeles city officials. Earlier this week they dismissed allegations that the  structure is being illegally constructed and should be ordered torn down or  turned into residential condominiums.  </P> <P> The $500,000 L-shaped office building partially wraps around an apartment house  and blocks the view of a house in a hillside neighborhood south of Ventura  Boulevard.  </P> <P> Mort Allen, who owns the apartment house and a row of retail shops down the  hill from the office building site, has led the attack on the new building.  </P> <P> Allen said he was told this week "by one of the finest geologists in  California" that the hill below the new office and above his shops is in danger  of collapsing because of the new building's construction.  </P> <P> "The hillside between Sunswept and Ventura is critical soil," Allen said.  Unless the new building has "40-foot caissons to bedrock, the entire hill . . .  will give way within a year," he said.  </P> <P> Allen said the geologist told him that his shops at the bottom of the hill are  "almost worthless and possibly unsafe to have tenants occupy." The shops house  his real estate office, a boutique, a seat-cover shop and a restaurant.  </P> <P> Allen's geologist, Arthur R. Brown of Seal Beach, could not be contacted  Thursday.  </P> <P> But city safety experts and the building's architect denied that the hill and  the new office building are unsafe.  </P> <P> "There's no danger of collapse. The building's safe. It's built to code," said  Robert Kline, a principal commercial property inspector for the city Department  of Building and Safety. "There is no indication the hill is going to collapse."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Inspection Requested  </P> <P> Kline said he inspected the Sunswept Drive building at the request of City  Councilman Mike Woo's office after Allen complained that it was illegally  constructed and lacked proper drainage and parking.  </P> <P> In a Jan. 26 letter to Woo, Allen demanded that the councilman use his  influence to block occupancy of the building until 11 alleged shortcomings at  the project were corrected.  </P> <P> In his report to Woo, Kline refuted each of Allen's allegations, said Julie  Jaskol, a spokeswoman for Woo.  </P> <P> Allen said a geologic report prepared for the office project differs from  previous ground studies done in the area.  </P> <P> A 1972 geologic report discussed a slope failure on the hill below the office  site. It noted that the failure occurred when a retaining wall collapsed and  "saturated clay soils liquefied and flowed against" Allen's shops.  </P> <P> That landslide "extinguished the flame of a water heater and a gas explosion  further damaged the structure," it noted. The collapse left a "failure scar  some 20 feet in length and about 5 feet in height" across the slope, the report  stated.  </P> <P> But a 1987 slope stability report done by a different geologist for the office  project concluded that the hillside areas are "well-established and show no  indication of past slope failures."  </P> <P> The report noted that the slopes "have a higher than minimum safety factor . .  . and should be considered safe."  </P> <P> A companion report, prepared by the project's geologists, called for a  foundation for the building that would contain footings extending two feet into  the ground.  </P> <P> Albert Mikaelian, whose architectural firm designed the building and plans to  move into it when it is finished, said there is no need for 40-foot caissons  extending down to bedrock, as Allen's geologist recommended.  </P> <P> "The soils engineers found good soil, absolutely outstanding soil," Mikaelian  said Thursday. "Our footings are to city standards.  </P> <P> "I can't believe this man," he said of Allen. "He will try anything."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Association Ally  </P> <P> But Allen appeared to have an ally Thursday in Polly Ward, president of the  Studio City Residents Assn. Ward was asked by Allen to use her group's clout to  persuade the city to take a closer look at the hillside's stability.  </P> <P> "If Mort has a geology report that says something different from what the city  has concluded, we'll go back to the councilman's office and ask them to look at  it," Ward said.  </P> <P> "It is my concern that what he says about the slope may be true and it could  give way. That whole hillside is geologically unstable. When they tamper with  that hill, it bothers me a lot."  </P> <P> Jaskol said Woo's office will dispatch city inspectors to the site to take  another look if that is what the association wants.  </P> <P> "We respond to all reasonable concerns," Jaskol said. "Polly Ward and her group  are reasonable."  </P></p>

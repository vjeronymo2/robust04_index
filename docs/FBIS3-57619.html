			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Zakharchenko] </F>   [Text] Seoul January 27 TASS -- The South Korean Defence  Ministry is discussing the possibility of using some Russian  armaments exclusively for training and in experimental  programmes. This was stated on Wednesday to South Korean  journalists by Major-General Han Sung-Ui, a representative of  the South Korean military establishment, in connection with  press reports that Russia had recently offered to pay back South  Korean credits by deliveries of the latest military  technologies, the South Korean press reported today.    Han Sung-Ui said it was difficult to include Russian  military  hardware in the arsenal of the South Korean Armed Forces,  because the latter were organised and equipped according to the  American system. However, limited amounts of Russian armaments  could be used to study the Russian tactics and military  doctrine, and also to polish off operations to beat off a  possible attack from North Korea, whose troops are armed with  Soviet-type weaponry.    The representative of the Defence Ministry stressed that the  Seoul government would go on adhering to the priority  development of military cooperation with its closest ally -- the  United States. At the same time, it will promote relations with  the neighbouring countries, such as Russia and Japan, including  in the sphere of defence. "I am referring primarily to  exchanges of cadets and servicemen," Han Sung-Ui stated.    Director of the second Asia department of the Russian  Foreign  Ministry Nikolay Solovyov stated in Moscow that the Russian  Foreign Ministry did not forward to the South Korean side any  official documents on the sale or joint production of armaments,  as well as of up-to-date technologies, in payment for Russia's  debts. South Korean representatives have received a package of  proposals on military-technical cooperation during Russian  Vice-Premier Aleksandr Shokhin's visit to Seoul last August.  Confirming this fact, Solovyov noted that no official reply was  received from the South Korean side so far.</p>

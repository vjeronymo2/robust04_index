			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / World Trade News: PowerGen may quit E German mine deal THE Anglo-American consortium which is poised to break into eastern Germany's energy industry must decide by today if it will accept the deal to buy the country's second largest brown coal field. The Treuhand privatisation agency has set this deadline amid concerns that Britain's PowerGen, a big partner in the consortium, is reconsidering its stake in the mining operation. PowerGen's board agreed to the contract on Wednesday to acquire a 40 per cent stake in a power generating plant at Schkopau, near Leipzig. This will give the consortium access to the high-voltage grid run by Veag, eastern Germany's main utility company, and a strategic foothold in eastern Germany's lucrative energy sector. Schkopau will be fuelled by Mitteldeutsche Braunkohle (Mibrag), the giant lignite fields which the consortium is supposed to be buying from the Treuhand, and over which PowerGen is reported to be having second thoughts. 'It would be madness for any side to pull out at this stage,' a banker involved in the negotiations said. 'If PowerGen is worried that energy demand will not be sufficient to consume the amount of coal it mines, they should think again. Mibrag has secured long-term coal contracts.' NRG of Minneapolis and Morrison Knudsen of Idaho, the two other consortium partners, want to wrap up the 18 months of talks on Mibrag. 'We are anxious to conclude the negotiations,' an official from Morrison Knudsen said yesterday. A spokesman for PowerGen refused to comment beyond saying that the 'negotiations are at an advanced stage'. Mr Jurgen Stotz, a board member of Veag, said: 'If the Anglo-Americans have any doubts, it is probably about making a quick return on their investment. But in the energy sector, you have to look to the long term in terms of profits.' The alternative buyer for Mibrag was Rheinbraun, the lignite mining subsidiary of RWE Energie, western Germany's largest utility. The federal Finance Ministry and the Treuhand are anxious to open up the energy sector to outside competition, despite strong pressure from RWE and the other west German utilities. RWE argues that Mibrag should be combined with the Laubag, the other lignite fields, if the two are to be economic. PowerGen has good personal relations at the highest level with RWE. Mr Ed Wallace, its chairman, is a member of RWE's international advisory board.</p>

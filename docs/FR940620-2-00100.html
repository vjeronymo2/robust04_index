			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 8. The quality of educational and employment opportunities is often uneven among high poverty area youth, thus requiring that careful consideration be given to enhancing both the access and availability of opportunities to all area youth. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under this competition, awards will be made to local partnerships serving youth who reside or attend school in high poverty areas to address their special needs and implement local School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives, as defined in this notice. Approximately $10 million are available for awards under this notice. The Departments expect to award 15 to 25 12-month grants. The amount of the awards will be based on a number of factors, including the scope, quality, and comprehensiveness of the proposed initiative and the size of the population to be served. While there are no limitations on the size of a high poverty area, the Departments expect that the resources available for individual grants will effectively serve areas of no more than 50,000 in population. The Departments are not bound by the estimates in this notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Departments intend to conduct subsequent competitions for Urban/Rural Opportunities Grants, on an annual basis, under the recently enacted ``School-to-Work Opportunities Act of 1994.'' A local partnership shall be eligible to receive only one (1) grant under this notice, with grant renewals to be awarded depending upon fund availability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Section B.

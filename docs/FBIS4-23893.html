			<p>BFN     [Text] The leaders of political forces of change,  Republican Democratic Movement [MDR], Liberal Party [PL], Social  Democratic Party [PSD] and Christian Democratic Party [PDC] have  sent an open letter to the French president, Francois  Mitterrand, condemning the decision of sending French troops to  Rwanda.    In the letter, the political leaders said they were  surprised  by President Mitterand's decision of sending French troops in  Rwanda at a time when the United Nations has been trying to  expand its force in the country. The president was reminded that  when French troops were sent in Rwanda in 1990 when the war  between the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] and government forces  had just begun, they did not stop the imprisonment of over  10,000 innocent people and that at that time, killings of Tutsi  were sanctioned in almost all prefectures especially Ruhengeri,  Gisenyi and Kibuye, and the French troops did nothing to stop  the killings.    The letter goes on to say that since 1973, the French  Government has supported the dictatorial regime in Rwanda which  is responsible for the killing of hundreds of thousands of  Rwandan people, including opposition leaders. France is the  only country supporting the illegitimate government which  assumed power on 9 April this year, and the French Government  has refused to accept that the leaders of this illegitimate  government are the ones responsible for the killings, when human  rights organizations have already condemned these killers, the  politicians told President Mitterrand.    The letter goes on requesting the French president to  abandon  sending troops to Rwanda on the note that the French troops  presence will be aimed at supporting the killer government and  that France will have shown betrayal to the Rwandan people and  the international community. France should instead help in  setting up an international tribunal to bring to justice the  criminals and should also avail the black box of the late  President Habyarimana's plane to help in carrying out  investigations.    The letter to the French president was signed, on behalf of  the PSD by the party president, Rugenera Marc and Rwangabo  Pierre-Claver, for PDC Nayinzira Jean-Nepomucene, first vice  president, for PL Joseph Nsengimana, and for MDR by Sixbert  Musangamfura.</p>

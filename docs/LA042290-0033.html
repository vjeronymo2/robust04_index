			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOOD AND CRA PATRONAGE  </P> <P> Jim Wood has an obvious, king-sized conflict-of-interest problem, as your  columnist Bill Boyarsky so aptly pointed out in his commentary on political  patronage ("The Power of Patronage and the CRA," Metro, April 14). Wood should  not have been confirmed for another term as a member of the Los Angeles  Community Redevelopment Agency, in control of a $500-million annual budget,  while he continues to serve as one of the top officers in the Los Angeles  County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO.  </P> <P> If Wood wishes to promote the full employment and economic well-being of the  thousands of members of the AFL-CIO, fine, let him do so full-time, and not  while he continues to hand out multimillion-dollar construction contracts while  wearing his CRA hat.  </P> <P> There is another blatant case of conflict of interest involving Wood and the  City Council. Wood, because of his high position, has a key voice on a special  committee to determine AFL-CIO political endorsements. If it is perceived as  improper for a council member's vote to appear to be influenced by a campaign  contribution, how is a vote influenced by a campaign endorsement any different?  An endorsement can prove even more critical to a campaign than a contribution.  </P> <P> After all these months of talk about a higher level of ethics and integrity  being needed in local government, Wood's easy confirmation for another term on  the CRA board indicates that the buddy-buddy political patronage train is still  chugging along, right on track in City Hall, conflict-of-interest issues  notwithstanding.  </P> <P> ERNANI BERNARDI  </P> <P> Councilman, 7th District  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

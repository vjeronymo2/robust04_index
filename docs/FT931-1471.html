			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Amec deficit accelerates to Pounds 88m - Provisions mar 'fine performance' by UK construction side AMEC, the UK construction, engineering and property group, announced provisions of Pounds 114.6m resulting in a Pounds 87.5m pre-tax loss for the 12 months to December 31. That compared with a Pounds 13.1m deficit last time. The 1991 results, which included provisions of Pounds 69.4m, were recalculated in line with the FRS 3 accounting standard. The final dividend is cut from 6.25p to just 1p, making a total of 3p (10.25p) for the year. The latest provisions included almost Pounds 34m of write-downs caused by problems with cladding on a Brighton office development block and the receivership of the Trocadero redevelopment in central London. The group also reported a Pounds 14.3m loss, mainly in Australia, where it has previously reported write-downs on hotel, shopping and office developments in Sydney and Melbourne. Sir Alan Cockshaw, chairman, said the provisions had marred an otherwise fine performance by the UK construction division. Senior management involved in the Brighton and Australian developments had been changed, he pointed out. 'We are not happy about this situation but have taken the appropriate action to put things right,' he said. Amec has written down by Pounds 18m its one fifth stake in Power Corporation, the Irish property group which took over full responsibility for redeveloping the Trocadero site after its joint venture partner, Brent Walker, ran into trouble. Receivers were appointed earlier this year to the five Power subsidiaries responsible for the Trocadero redevelopment. The write-down on the Brighton development totalled Pounds 15.9m. Amec in addition has written down by Pounds 63m the value of land and work in progress of its housing and commercial property operations. These produced an operating loss of Pounds 17.1m (Pounds 10.1m loss) before provisions. Overseas operations, following setbacks in Australia and the US, incurred a Pounds 13.7m loss compared with a Pounds 1.1m prof-it. UK contracting profits by comparison were only 10.7 per cent lower at Pounds 55.1m (Pounds 61.7m). Sir Alan said this was an excellent performance in a difficult market. COMMENT There was no surprise at the size of the provisions which had been widely forecast and Amec's share price rose 5p to 81p despite the scale of the loss. The company has been honest about its mistakes and the market appears to have accepted that these have been caused by isolated management aberrations rather than by a general corporate malaise. The UK contracting business has performed well and mechanical and electrical margins, excluding the Australian problems, remain good. The lack of a quality housing operation detracts from what otherwise is an excellent range of businesses. Profits of Pounds 25m would put the company on about 10 times earnings which does not do justice to the quality of the construction business but reflects the lack of housing recovery potential.</p>

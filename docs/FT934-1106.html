			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Lower interest charges help GGT to Pounds 2.24m A reduction in interest charges from Pounds 794,000 to Pounds 620,000 after February's Pounds 14.7m rights issue enabled Gold Greenlees Trott, the advertising and marketing services group, to show a pre-tax profits advance from Pounds 2.17m to Pounds 2.24m in the six months to October 31. Profits at the operating level slipped to Pounds 2.86m (Pounds 2.96m). Turnover grew 22 per cent to Pounds 127.8m (Pounds 105m). Group revenue was up 18 per cent at Pounds 25.8m (Pounds 21.9m): though at constant exchange rates the rise was 6.6 per cent, with the US accounting for all of the advance. In the UK, revenues from media advertising declined 15 per cent, though Mr Matthew Allen, finance director, ascribed that partly to last time's loss of the Daily Mirror account. However, across the group's UK businesses the fall was reduced to 5 per cent by below-the-line activities, where revenues rose by 8 per cent. Mr Allen said that of the Pounds 14.7m rights money, some Pounds 4.5m had gone into the joint venture with GGK, the private European agency network, and that Pounds 3m of medium-term borrowings had been paid down. The balance was earmarked for acquisition possibilities, probably in the UK. Earnings per share declined to 6.2p (7.82p) on the increased share capital, but the interim dividend is held at 3.3p, though last time's has been adjusted to 3.15p for the scrip element of the rights.</p>

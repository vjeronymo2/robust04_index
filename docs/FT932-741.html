			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Is scrip trustworthy? ENHANCED scrip dividends are worth so much more than normal cash dividends that it is desirable to take them up. In the case of a trust that has to pay income during the income beneficiary's life and after his death the capital to the remaindermen, what should the trustees do about this? Would the trustees be meeting the interests of the life tenant and the remaindermen if they took the enhanced scrip dividends, sold the scrip shares and paid the proceeds to the life tenant (less any capital gains tax attributable to the sale of scrip shares)? Subject to the precise wording of the trust deed, the trustees will be duty bound to elect for the scrip dividends. They would have a complaint of negligence to face if they failed to do so. They should also ask the life tenant whether he or she wishes the scrip to be sold. If they cannot obtain the life tenant's instructions before the deadline for accepting the offer-to-purchase, they will probably be acting in the best interests of all concerned if they go ahead and accept it. Subject to wording of the deed, it is likely that the scrip vests in the life tenant at the moment of issue. That being so, the trustees would not have any CGT liability in respect of the sale of the scrip, because their CGT position (and the life tenant's) will be governed by section 142 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992: Before delivering the scrip or the proceeds of its sale to the life tenant, the trustees may consider it prudent to seek the advice of the trust's solicitor on the effect of the precise wording of the deed. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

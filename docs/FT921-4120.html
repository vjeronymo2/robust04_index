			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome under pressure PHARMACEUTICALS group Wellcome declined on reports from Tokyo that a new drug manufactured by Fujisawa Pharmaceutical could have applications in the treatment of Aids, encroaching into Wellcome's lucrative market share. Wellcome closed 9 lower at 1004p, having been sold down to 983p during early exchanges. Turnover of 1.7m shares was slightly above average. The relatively small fall was an indication that the development process was still at a very early stage. Mr Didier Cowling at Nomura said: 'It may be a significant development, but it is very long term. In addition there is a good chance that it will eventually be a combination of drugs - most likely including Wellcome's Retrovir - which will be used to treat HIV and Aids.' Fujisawa jumped more than 5 per cent in Tokyo on Monday on the news that its FK-506 drug, developed to suppress the immune system in transplant patients, had been used in tests to stop the replication of human cells infected with HIV, the Aids virus. Car sales boost The motors sector was cheered by the chancellor's halving of new car tax to 5 per cent. The market was looking for such a move and the Budget statement lifted the motor distributors, although several had already moved ahead in anticipation. Among the main moves recorded were Thomas Cowie, up 8 at 148p, Lex Service, ahead 10 at 244p, Pendragon, 8 higher at 196p, and Perry Group, 7 firmer at 159p. Mr Peter Deighton at Smith New Court said: 'The market was looking for some help for the motor industry. This will do enough to help stimulate demand for new cars without seriously impacting on residual values.' Meanwhile, bid speculation lifted BSG by 1 1/2 to 66p. Allied-Lyons rallies Brewing shares gained ground on news that the chancellor intends to increase excise duties only in line with inflation, putting just over a penny on a typical pint of beer. Allied-Lyons closed just a penny down at 649p, recovering from a day's low of 631p touched on the referral of a joint venture to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Turnover came to 2.6m shares. The proposed venture between Allied-Lyons and the lager producer Carlsberg would give the Anglo-Danish group 20 per cent of the UK beer market, putting it in third place behind Bass with 23 per cent and Foster's, brewers of Courage beers, with about 21 per cent. According to the Department of Trade and Industry, the joint venture raises competition issues in the UK beer market which deserve investigation. The commission will make its recommendation by June 12. Generators weak A call by the House of Commons' Energy Select Committee for a monopolies inquiry into the dominance of National Power and PowerGen in the UK electricity industry caused a flurry of selling pressure in the two stocks, which underperformed the rest of the utilities areas of the market. Criticism of the two companies, coming hard on the heels of sell notes from some of the market's most influential broking houses, including BZW, left both stocks floundering against a fundamentally strong market. National Power retreated 5 to 218p on relatively high turnover of 8.6m shares, while PowerGen dipped 6 to 227p on 7.7m traded. A sharp rise in Redland of 18 to 476p substantially increased the value of its offer for Steetley to some 414p and helped to drive the latter up 15 to 402p. The market is now quietly confident that Redland will win the day with its bid, which closes on March 26. There was nothing in the Budget proposals for the oil sector, which tended to lag behind the rest of the equity market. BP, still in the middle of a tug-of-war between UK brokers, largely bears of the stock, and those in the US, mainly bullish of the shares, began to creep higher, with dealers suspecting that one of the leading UK integrated houses may be about to give the shares a strong upward push. At the close BP were 4 firmer at 268 1/2 p. The saga of speciality chemicals concern MTM continued yesterday as the chief executive and finance director resigned after two profit warnings in as many weeks and contradictory statements from the board over the state of the company's finances. The shares slipped 14 to 105p, making a total fall of 181.5p since February 28. Most analysts are on a hold, Mr Martin Evans at Hoare Govett commenting: 'At this price it is too late to sell, but equally too early to buy for speculative recovery.' Courtaulds regained further ground after its recent poor form, the shares adding 11 at 544p. A shortage of stock in Laporte helped to lift the shares 14 to 613p. Healthcare group Fisons continued its volatile run, sentiment being affected by the weekend news that British scientists had made a significant breakthrough in the fight against asthma. Fisons manufactures and markets Intal, an anti-asthma drug, which had sales of Pounds 186m in 1991. The shares fell 11 to 371p in exceptionally heavy trading of 7.3m, described by one trader as 'very speculative'. Medeva put on 4 to 286p as it revealed that it would be marketing a new oral anti-typhoid medication in the UK, Eire and Spain. The Budget was generally seen as favourable for brewers, distillers and the cider industry, as duty rose in line with inflation and Mr Lamont said he would not accept a deal that would allow members of the European Community to levy no excise duty on wine they make but forces them to put up duties on spirits which we make. Bass climbed 23 to 573p, Grand Metropolitan 25 to 933p, Guinness 17 to 625p and Whitbread 'A' 10 to 444p. HP Bulmer firmed 3 to 273p after the chancellor added that he would not allow Brussels to ride roughshod over the interests of the British cider industry. Cable and Wireless followed Monday's good performance with another strong showing. Yesterday's rise was helped by a positive note issued by Girozentrale Gilbert Eliott, the stockbroker, whose telecoms specialist, Mr Marshall Whiting, described the shares as undervalued. Mr Whiting said he expected a major contribution to come from UK mobile phones, along with high growth from Mercury, C and W's telecoms subsidiary, all underpinned by Hong Kong and China. 'A possible flotation of Mercury is not in the price,' said the analyst. C and W shares climbed 7 to 619p on good volume of 1.9m. The maintained dividend at Glynwed International was welcomed by the market in spite of a 64 per cent profits setback. The shares moved ahead 14 to 239p. Several stocks in the engineering sector were targeted for their recovery potential. Among those to benefit were APV, up 2 at 118p, IMI, 5 firmer at 254p, and FKI, where turnover reached 3.5m as the shares moved a penny forward to 61p. Also lifted by the same sentiment was Smiths Industries, which gained 13 to 299p. Among transport stocks, P &amp; O continued to benefit from a UBS Phillips &amp; Drew buy recommendation, rising 13 to 412p. Stocks likely to star in a consumer-led recovery were favourites in the leisure sector. Forte led a strong showing among hotel groups, moving up 3 1/2 to 230 1/2 p in busy turnover of 3.5m. Ladbroke Group, buoyed by the Budget cut in betting tax, advanced 7 1/2 to 246 1/2 p, while Rank Organisation jumped 24 to 718p in thin volume. The absence of the much-rumoured rights issue from Hongkong and Shanghai Banking, which announced preliminary figures yesterday, triggered a minor flurry of selling in Midland Bank, which ended 4 off at 265p. There had been suggestions on Monday that any cash call by Hongkong Bank would be used to increase its 14.7 per cent stake in Midland. Standard Chartered rose 4 to 463p in front of today's preliminary figures. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991/92 NEW HIGHS (78).

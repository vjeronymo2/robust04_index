			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ii.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Gas Absorbers.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Gas absorbers (water scrubbers),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, differ in that there is no parameter that can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measured and used to establish a limit of HAP concentration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Often, the streams routed to scrubbers are more dilute, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the control device functions in not only changing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions of the gas temperature like a condenser would do,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but in employing concentration gradients to remove materials  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from gas streams. In order to predict the performance of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gas absorber, information must be known about the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate mass transfer coefficients for the specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system. Most often, the mass transfer coefficients are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experimentally derived for specific applications and are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> usually functions of the mass velocities and contacting path  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variables. While it is possible to calculate the scrubber  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outlet compositions without mass transfer information by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assuming that the amount of material transferred to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liquid is limited by the equilibrium-defined composition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this information is not indicative of the physical scrubber  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because it does not provide for the evaluation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contacting path. Therefore, a direct measurement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> composition is required during the initial performance test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Evaluation of continuous compliance need not be done by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continuous direct measurement of HAP concentration from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scrubber effluent, however. Another parameter, the liquid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to gas molar ratio through the scrubber, could be monitored  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to ensure required removal. The L/G ratio, which often  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduces to the measurement of L, the liquid molar flow rate,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because G, the gas molar flow rate is often constant, could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be measured during the initial performance test to evaluate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the sensitivity of the ratio with removal efficiency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thereafter, the L/G ratio could be used to verify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate removal if the ratio remained within the limits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established during the initial compliance test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iii.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Carbon Adsorbers.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Streams controlled by carbon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adsorption will usually be diluted, compared to those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled by condensers and scrubbers. No surrogate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parameters have been identified as measures of HAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration or removal efficiencies. Therefore, a direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measurement of concentration will be required during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial performance test as well as in continuous compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iv.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Flares.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Compliance testing for flares can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complicated by the formation of undesired products of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combustion (including HAP) and the inability to further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capture and control these byproducts. Nevertheless, if a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility chooses to use a flare as a control device, EPA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established flare combustion efficiency criteria that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specify that 98 percent or greater combustion efficiency can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be achieved provided that certain operating conditions are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> met. If a HAP is formed from combustion, the quantity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formed must be considered when calculating control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency. These conditions prescribe that the flare must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be operated with no visible emissions and with a flame  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present and that the heating value and exit velocity of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gas routed to the flare must be within certain ranges,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depending upon whether the flares are steam-assisted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the NESHAP general provisions provide for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an initial performance test to determine whether the net  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heating value will fall within the applicable ranges for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control at 98 percent. The performance test involves  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measuring the incoming gas flowrate and the concentration of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combustible compounds (40 CFR 63.11) to determine net  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heating value. However, it appears that as the number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compounds in the stream increases, the determination of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> net heating value becomes increasingly difficult. Also, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> light of the fact that flares are often used to control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discontinuous or upset conditions, the net heating value at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any one time is subject to change. Continuously measuring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the concentration of combustible compounds to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heating value on a continuous basis is probably not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feasible. Therefore, the enhanced monitoring method chosen  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for these standards is to require that the presence of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pilot flame be monitored continuously. Also, an initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measurement and characterization of the inlet mass emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the flare is required for two reasons:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUYING TIME IN EAST GERMANY  </P> <P> A few months ago East Germans paraded in the thousands, petitioning their  government to adopt a less intrusive, less oppressive role in their lives. Now  they are demonstrating in the hundreds of thousands, demanding a free press,  free elections, an end to the "leading" -- i.e., near-exclusive -- role of the  Communist Party in the political and social life of the country. It is worth  remembering that for the last two generations the part of divided Germany now  clamoring for sweeping reform has known only totalitarian rule and  indoctrination, first under the Nazis, then the Communists. What those who have  taken to the streets in ever greater numbers are saying is that even after 56  years of oppression, they remember the language of freedom and what it means.  </P> <P> Until a few months ago, the East German regime felt confident that it could  resist the wave of change rolling over other Soviet bloc countries. The  political embarrassment produced by the highly visible flight of tens of  thousands of East Germans through Hungary and Czechoslovakia -- with the  cooperation of the Communist governments of those countries -- clearly shook  that confidence. Some presumed words of warning from Soviet leader Mikhail S.  Gorbachev no doubt shook it even more.  </P> <P> Ultimately, the regime tried reform at the most primitive level. The Stalinst  die-hard Erich Honecker was dumped, replaced by Egon Krenz, his protege but  also someone who at least was prepared to murmur, however vaguely, about the  need for change. The new tone, however, has done nothing to calm the agitation.  </P> <P> If Krenz has anything more specific in mind than buying time, he has yet to  reveal it. He has shoved other septuagenarian members of the Politburo  overboard, and allowed subordinates to talk about the desirability of revamping  the entire government. As an earnest of his intention to permit freer foreign  travel, he has reopened the border with Czechoslovakia, but rather than  reassuring restive East Germans, that gesture has only prompted tens of  thousands more to decamp to the West. Krenz is now reduced to pleading with  East Germans not to run away. Suddenly some officials in West Germany, made  nervous at the prospect of absorbing perhaps hundreds of thousands of  additional refugees, are starting to echo that plea.  </P> <P> Will people listen? Perhaps, if evidence of genuine change were quickly to  appear. But the kind of fundamental changes now being demanded -- political  pluralism, human rights, an end to the Communist Party's exclusive hold on  power -- is change that by its very nature, as events in Poland and Hungary  have shown, would spell the beginning of the end for the regime. So far, no one  in power has suggested that this would be an acceptable course. In the end  there may be no choice.  </P></p>

			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / International Bonds: Abbey National returns with FFr1bn Eurobond offering POLITICAL instability in Russia failed to slow the recent heavy flow of new issues in the international bond market yesterday, with several borrowers raising funds in a variety of currencies. Abbey National, the UK bank, returned to the French franc sector for the first time since 1988, raising FFr1bn through an offering of five-year Eurobonds. Abbey's offering formed one side of a 'back-to-back deal' with CCCI, the French central financing entity for a network of mortgage lenders. In the meantime, CCCI made its debut in the Eurosterling sector, raising an equivalent amount, Pounds 116m, through an issue of five-year floating-rate notes (FRNs). The two borrowers then swapped the proceeds of their offerings, so that Abbey ended up with sterling and CCCI with French francs. This represents the first public 'back-to-back' deal in the Euromarket since mid-August, when the Province of Ontario and the European Investment Bank swapped the proceeds of two seven-year Eurobond offerings which raised Pounds 255m and CDollars 500m respectively. Mr Jonathan Nicholls, Abbey's director of corporate finance and capital markets, said the swap provided Abbey with a cost-effective means of raising funds. The all-in cost of yesterday's deal was around the London interbank offered rate (Libor), he said. By contrast, CCCI paid around 35 basis points over Libor for its funds. Mr Jean-Noel Destremau, CCCI's managing director, said this reflected the fact that CCCI had paid an 'entry fee' of 4-5 basis points for its first Eurosterling issue. 'But the back-to-back swap compensated for this premium,' he said. He said CCCI aimed to improve its funding target to 25-30 basis points over Libor in future Eurobond offerings, as well as to seek longer maturities. Lead manager Samuel Montague said CCCI's notes would be kept in syndicate overnight to enable investors who were buying CCCI debt for the first time to obtain the necessary credit lines. He said a large amount of the notes had been pre-placed with UK and continental accounts. Abbey's bonds were also kept in syndicate overnight. Joint lead manager CCF said there had been surprisingly strong demand for the bonds from Spain. The bonds were also bought by investors throughout Europe. Elsewhere, Sudwestdeutsche Landesbank, the triple A-rated central bank for the savings banks in the German state of Baden-Wurttemberg, raised DM1bn through an issue of 10-year Eurobonds. Lead manager Goldman Sachs said the offering was designed to raise the borrower's profile with international investors. There is a growing trend among borrowers to reduce dependence on their domestic market. By tapping the Euromarket, they are able to reach a much wider range of investors and can often achieve better pricing than at home.</p>

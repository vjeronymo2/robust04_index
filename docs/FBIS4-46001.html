			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Idea" column by Mustafa Amin] </F>   [Text] Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has said that  the Middle Eastern countries have spent a trillion dollars on  arms purchases. He said: We took the food out of our  children's mouths to pay for arms and half this sum would have  changed the Middle East.    It is not the Arab countries that started the arms race, but  Israel. If we reviewed the military budgets of the Arab  countries before the establishment of Israel, we would find that  they were modest. We used to spend far more on health and  education than on arms.    Israel purchased arms from Communist Czechoslovakia and  Israeli committees roamed the world to buy arms. Egypt then  moved and concluded arms contracts with communist countries.  Thus was the feverish race triggered.    Israel not only began the arms race but also introduced  political assassinations into the region with the assassination  of British Minister of State Moyne and assassinations followed.    President Mubarak called for removing atomic bombs from the  Middle Eastern countries and all these countries responded  positively except Israel, which insisted on continuing to make  atomic bombs. If Israel really wants peace, the first thing it  must do is to join the Arab countries' consensus and get rid of  its atomic bombs.    Israel is mistaken if it imagines that it can have a  monopoly  on the atomic bomb in the region. Certain regional countries  have indeed reached the stage of making atomic bombs and, in a  few years, most regional countries will reach this stage. These  countries will lavish funds on catching up with Israel.  Israel's interests lie in stopping this danger that threatens  it and us. The Israeli foreign minister told the truth when he  said: The world will not pay us the price of our folly.</p>

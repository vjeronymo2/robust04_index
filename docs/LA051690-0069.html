			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CHEVALIER TO PLAY FOR NORTHRIDGE;  </P> <P> SIGNINGS: BASKETBALL TEAM LANDS CLEVELAND HIGH POINT GUARD, SKYLINE COLLEGE  FORWARD; VENTURA COLLEGE'S EGGERT TO JOIN BASEBALL TEAM.  </P> <P> Andre Chevalier, the spark plug who ignited the high-octane offense of the  Cleveland High basketball team, was among three athletes who recently signed  letters of intent to attend Cal State Northridge, the school announced Tuesday.  </P> <P> Troy leBlanc, a 6-foot-6, 205-pound forward from Skyline College in Oakland,  also signed to play basketball at Northridge. David Eggert, a pitcher and  outfielder from Ventura College, committed to play baseball for the Matadors.  </P> <P> Chevalier, a 5-foot-11, 155-pound point guard, averaged 8.5 points and seven  assists a game last season in guiding Cleveland to a 21-6 record.  </P> <P> "He's very aggressive and a tenacious defender who sees the court well," said  Pete Cassidy, Northridge's basketball coach. "And he knows how to win."  </P> <P> To that end, Chevalier could be invaluable to the Matadors, who finished 12-15  in their last season in NCAA Division II.  </P> <P> "Starting up, it's hard for everybody," Chevalier said. "We're just going to  have to work that much harder."  </P> <P> The addition of Chevalier gives Northridge a trio of point guards. Senior  Eugene Humphrey and junior Andre Henry split time at the position last season.  </P> <P> "We felt in need of a point guard at the freshman level and we think Andre  Chevalier is good enough and mentally tough enough to come in and get some  quality playing time his first year," Cassidy said.  </P> <P> Chevalier said the chance to contribute as a freshman weighed heavily in his  choice of Northridge over UC Davis and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, both Division  II schools.  </P> <P> "It's got to be an exciting time to be involved with that program as it enters  its first year in Division I," said Marc Paez, Chevalier's coach at Cleveland.  "I think it's a good opportunity for him."  </P> <P> Chevalier is the third Cavalier basketball player to accept a Division I  scholarship this season. Trent Cornelius (Washington) and Eddie Hill  (Washington State) are both bound for the Pacific 10 Conference. Bobby McRae  signed earlier this month with Division II Cal Poly Pomona.  </P> <P> Northridge has signed 10 basketball players -- six from junior colleges and  four out of high school.  </P> <P> LeBlanc's role will be to rebound.  </P> <P> He was second in the Coast Conference in rebounding with an average of 11 a  game. He also averaged 14 points, scoring most often from inside the key.  </P> <P> Eggert is the second player signed by Northridge baseball Coach Bill Kernen.  </P> <P> The former Ventura High standout batted .313 with five home runs and 26 runs  batted in this season.  </P> <P> At Northridge, Eggert is expected to pitch and play in the outfield. At Ventura  this season, he appeared in 22 games and won three of eight decisions.  </P> <P> In 43 1/3 innings, Eggert, a left-hander, struck out 44, but he also allowed 49  hits and 24 walks.  </P></p>

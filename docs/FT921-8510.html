			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Boost seen for liability insurance DIRECTORS and senior managers of UK companies are becoming more aware of their potential personal legal liabilities when their businesses go wrong, according to a survey published today by Wyatt Company, management consultants. The survey shows a sharp increase in the use of directors and officers (D&amp;O) insurance, policies which cover directors and officers or senior managers for the cost of legal awards made against them. Wyatt, on the basis of a questionnaire sent to 109 companies, found that 62 per cent of industrial companies have D&amp;O cover compared with 26 per cent in 1989. One in four financial-sector companies also have coverage, against 17 per cent in 1989. Mr Pierre Laurin, a director of Wyatt, said awareness had been assisted by recent high-profile cases, including a number in which directors had been found liable under the Insolvency Act 1986 for breach of fiduciary duties.</p>

			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / International Company News: Mitsubishi Materials buys German company MITSUBISHI Materials, the Japanese metals refiner and manufacturer, has announced the acquisition of Lefo-Formenbau, a German maker of dies for injection moulding. Lefo is to be wholly acquired for DM8.4m (Dollars 5.60m). It supplies equipment to the European power tool, electrical components, and audio and visual cassette industries. Mr Takehiko Mizugai, managing director, said the acquisition 'will permit Mitsubishi Materials to respond to European demand with greater efficiency'. Investment by Japanese manufacturers in European operations slowed last year, but there remains strong interest among larger companies in strategic acquisitions of smaller manufacturers.</p>

			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Rosyth naval base wins reprieve as MoD saves Pounds 1.2bn: Cuts in R&amp;D secure majority of 1,300 jobs The Rosyth naval base in Fife has been saved and the majority of its 1,300 civilian workers will keep their jobs, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, will announce tomorrow. Mr Rifkind will disclose that he has met the Treasury's demands for substantial expenditure cuts by finding savings in other areas of the defence budget, particularly research and development. The number of redundancies at Rosyth is yet to be finalised. But MPs have been told that most of the civilian personnel will keep their jobs, and the number of redundances could be as low as 300. The base has been saved in large part because the Ministry of Defence has found it is spending about Pounds 500m more on research and development than it had originally thought. Defence chiefs are thought to have blamed accounting errors for the over-estimate of R&amp;D spending, which government accountants had initially put at Pounds 800m a year. Much of the extra Pounds 500m of spending has been judged to be unnecessary. Mr Rifkind will also announce substantial savings have been reaped through changes in the procurement of spare parts and ammunition. Instead of stockpiling weapons and ammunition the armed forces will purchase more on a 'just-in-time' basis as they are required. Taken together the savings over the next three years will help the MoD to cut its Pounds 23.49bn a year budget by at least Pounds 1.2bn, the figure set by the Treasury in the last budget. There had been strong expectations that the expenditure cuts would lead to job losses in the armed forces of between 20,000 and 25,000 - but MPs have been told this week that the redundancies will be 'at the low end of expectations'. According to Downing Street, the MoD's plans for defence expenditure - set out in a defence spending white paper dubbed 'Front Line First' - are certain to be approved by the cabinet at its weekly meeting tomorrow. However, MPs have been told that the white paper's plans will not be set in concrete and will leave open the opportunity for further refinement over the next three months. The proposal that Rosyth should be saved follows intense last-minute lobbying by Scottish Tory MPs, the Labour leadership and workers at the yard. However, Mr Rifkind is expected to announce that Rosyth will have a different role from the one it has had in the past. According to one MoD source, the base will concentrate on its role in minesweeping support and fisheries protection. The base will also remain available for military emergencies. On Monday, Mr Rifkind appeared to give slight hope to Rosyth when he attacked Labour's 'hysterical outpourings' about the future of the Fife base. He said the decision on Rosyth would be made 'in a sensitive, thoughtful fashion'. However, Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, has kept up a campaign to maintain the base, which is in his constituency. Earlier this week, he revealed that he had received a confidential Royal Navy study which described Rosyth as 'ideal' with 'excellent facilities' and 'the only area that can fully meet the the requirements and demands' of minesweepers.

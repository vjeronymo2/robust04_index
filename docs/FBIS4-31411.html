			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lise Tajik: "Denmark Among Biggest Investors in </F> Poland"]    [Text] Danish investments in Poland have exploded. Denmark  is among Poland's largest foreign investors.    Since the collapse of the communist system, the largest  Danish firms have invested over $60 million--about 400 million  kroner--in Poland, meaning that Denmark is in 11th place in the  ranking list of investing countries in that country, according  to the newsletter POLAND.    Denmark now accounts for 1.7 percent of total foreign  investments in Poland, and, at the same time, moved up five  places on the list since last August, when Danish investments  were registered at only just over 50 million kroner.    The actual amount is presumably much greater because many  small and medium-size business investments are not included in  the calculation.    The survey covers only those foreign firms that have  invested  at least $1 million in the country. Ranked according to the  number of firms with investments amounting to over $1 million,  Denmark is in seventh place.    The United States, Italy, and Germany top the list, while  Sweden, with $71 million, and Norway, with $44 million, occupy  the 10th and 13th places, respectively.    Over 130 Danish firms either have subsidiaries, production  activities, or sales offices, or have gone into joint ventures  in Poland.    Fifty Danish companies are going to take part two weeks from  now in the European Union's company contact fairs,  Europartenariat Polska, in Gdansk.</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Unitech disposes of payphone maker Unitech, the electronic components group, has sold Rathdown Industries, the payphone manufacturer, for Pounds 10.8m. The buyer is GN Investments, a subsidiary of Great Nordic, the Danish telecommunications company. Mr Peter Curry, chairman of Unitech, said Rathdown did not fit into Unitech's strategy of focusing on three areas: power supplies, connectors and control products. He said the cash from the disposal would be used to strengthen the balance sheet, bringing gearing to below 50 per cent. It would also free resources to put into the other three areas, possibly through acquisitions. Rathdown made pre-tax profits of Pounds 843,000 in the year to end-May 1991 and had net assets of Pounds 2.5m. Unitech acquired the company in 1973.</p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Survey of Korean Financial Markets (2): Over the first hurdle - The nation's banks must adapt or face extinction THE NEXT five years promise to be a period of upheaval for South Korea's highly-protected and regulated banking industry as it becomes buffetted by the winds of financial liberalisation. Inefficiently overmanned and saddled with a large amount of non-performing loans, some of the nation's 23 city and regional commercial banks are threatened with extinction unless they adapt swiftly to the demands of a deregulated market. Bu confidence, has risen that the banks may prove equal to the task after they successfully passed the first test of financial liberalisation: a ban on anonymous bank accounts ordered by President Kim Young-sam in August. Despite widespread predictions that tax dodgers would withdraw large amounts of funds and deplete the banks' deposit base, the reform barely caused a ripple. A requirement that false-name account holders show identification before withdrawing their funds robbed them of their anonymity and discouraged them from emptying their accounts. Another advantage was that funds held in fictitious-name accounts represented only 1.9 per cent of the Won154,100bn deposited in banks. But the banks are still worried about a bigger potential problem resulting from the real-name financial system. The government wants nominee accounts, which use borrowed names, to be registered under their owners' true identity by 1996, when a comprehensive tax system is to be introduced. At least Won30,000bn, or a fifth of bank deposits, are estimated to be in borrowed-name accounts. Banks fear a steady outflow of deposits over the next two years as account owners try to beat the tax man. Moreover, the identification process that halted withdrawals from false-name accounts is useless in the case of nominee accounts. The threat of an erosion of the banks' deposit base may force the government to accelerate the deregulation of interest rates and improve the banks' ability to gain new funds. Regulated interest rates have proved to be both a blessing and curse for Korean banks. The healthy interest rate spread guaranteed under the system contributed to the 28.4 per cent rise in the 1992 operating profit for commercial banks, which amounted to Won2,596bn, although operating income growth slowed to 12.3 per cent in the first half of 1993 as bad economic conditions depressed credit demand. The bank deposit rates set by the government, however, also represent a problem since they are lower than those offered by short-term finance companies, making it difficult for banks to attract funds. Banks account for 45 per cent of all funds deposited in financial institutions. Moreover, asset formation is slowing down as the economy stumbles. The liberalisation of both lending and deposit rates, which is now scheduled to be completed by 1996, could enable banks to retain their deposit base and sustain their margin spreads through higher loan rates. The government freed almost all lending rates at the beginning of this month and it has hinted that it will complete the liberalisation of deposit rates, 40 per cent of which are now unrestricted, ahead of its 1996 deadline. The ministry of finance also says it will phase out the credit allocation policies that have burdened the banks with a large amount of non-performing loans, totalling Won10,200bn or almost 7 per cent of all bank credits. The bad loan problem is particularly acute for some of the older banks, which have been regulated the longest. Non-performing loans held by the Commercial Bank of Korea, the country's largest bank, amount to 13.2 per cent of total loans. The government has required banks to provide as much as half of their loans at below market rates to designated strategic industries. In addition, the banks have also been forced to set aside 45 per cent of their loans for small and medium-sized businesses. These credit control policies have severely limited the banks' autonomy and prevented them from operating efficiently. 'Interest rate deregulation and the abolition of credit controls will allow the banks to operate in a regular manner instead as a financial tool of the government,' said John Wadle, an banking analyst for BZW in Seoul. But not all of the Korean banks are likely to survive in a deregulated market and the industry is expected to witness an extensive restructuring. The government may encourage bank mergers by easing ownership rules that limit shareholding stakes. The result could be the emergence of two or three Korean mega-banks by the end of the decade. The merger of strong banks with weaker ones would help solve the bad loan problem and encourage rationalisation of operations. Banks might also be permitted to engage in other financial sectors, such as brokerage and investment consultation, to increase turnover and profits. However, these proposals alone may not be able to remove the serious threat posed by the large amount of non-performing loans. Instead of the government bailing out the troubled banks, there are suggestions that so-called 'bad banks' should be created to manage dodgy assets or that banks should be permitted to transform bad loans into equity stakes in creditor companies.</p>

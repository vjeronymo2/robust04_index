			<p><P> April 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHENEY PREDICTS GORBACHEV WILL FAIL, BE OUSTED  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, in a striking departure from official U.S.  policy, predicted Friday that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will fail  in his reform efforts and be replaced by a hard-liner who will be "far more  hostile" to the West.  </P> <P> The Pentagon chief said Gorbachev faces an entrenched, conservative Soviet  bureaucracy that ultimately will thwart his policies and drive him from office.  </P> <P> "My personal view is that the task that he set for himself of trying to  fundamentally reform the Soviet system is incapable of occurring," Cheney said  in an interview taped Friday and to be aired today on CNN's "Evans &amp; Novak"  program.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Far More Hostile'  </P> <P> "If I had to guess today, I would guess that he would ultimately fail," Cheney  said. "That is to say that he will not be able to reform the Soviet economy to  turn it into an efficient, modern society. And that when that happens, he's  likely to be replaced by somebody who will be far more hostile than he's been  in terms of his attitude towards the West."  </P> <P> Official Administration policy is that Gorbachev is firmly in control of the  Soviet government despite some internal opposition and will continue to be the  nation's leader for the foreseeable future.  </P> <P> Gorbachev's purge of 110 members of the policy-making Central Committee and the  Central Auditing Commission this week was interpreted by American analysts as  further evidence of his consolidating power by removing hard-line elements in  the Soviet bureaucracy.  </P> <P> No senior U.S. official had predicted publicly that Gorbachev would be forced  from office by conservative opponents.  </P> <P> A Cheney aide explained that the defense secretary's comments were "personal  opinions" and not U.S. government policy. The State Department referred  questions on the incident to the Pentagon, where a spokesman said that Cheney's  responses were "guesswork, not a considered statement of policy."  </P> <P> "It's not inconsistent with what Cheney has been saying," chief Pentagon  spokesman Dan Howard said. "He was asked his personal opinion. This is not a  completely unfounded notion. It's a guess based on 70 years of experience with  Soviet leadership and the almost intractable economic problems and the  intransigent bureaucracy Mr. Gorbachev has to deal with."  </P> <P> Cheney used the prediction to justify his position that U.S. troop levels in  Europe should not be cut in response to promised reductions in Soviet military  forces.  </P> <P> "I think that would be a big mistake," he said. "I think it would undo basic  commitments to the (Western) alliance, and until we know that Gorbachev is for  real and that the changes he wants to bring about are irreversible, it'd be a  terrible mistake for us to withdraw from Europe."  </P> <P> He said, however, that he believes that the Western European nations should pay  a greater share of the costs of defending Europe.  </P> <P> "We've got to work to try to get the Europeans to do more," he said.  </P> <P> On a related matter, Cheney said that a widening German-American rift over  whether to negotiate the removal of short-range nuclear weapons from West  Germany might not be resolved by the time of the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization summit conference at the end of May.  </P> <P> "We've been through this kind of thing before . . .," Cheney said. "Clearly the  political situation in Germany today is a delicate one from (West German  Chancellor Helmut) Kohl's standpoint. Will it be resolved before the NATO  summit? I don't know. It may be. On the other hand, it may not get resolved for  a while."  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV DEBATE URGED IN YUGOSLAV RACE  </P> <P> National television, apparently inspired by the U.S. presidential campaign,  suggested Saturday that the two front-runners for the country's vacant post of  prime minister take part in a televised public debate.  </P> <P> Ante Markovic, a member of the collective presidency in the republic of  Croatia, and Borisav Jovic, Parliament president in Serbia, should appear  together in a live broadcast, a Yugoslav television commentator said on the  evening news program.  </P> <P> They would each have a limited time to describe their economic and political  views and would then answer telephone questions from viewers and make any  further comments on their records, the commentator suggested.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Branko Mikulic resigned Dec. 30. Yugoslavia is in the midst of a  political and economic crisis with inflation of over 250%, a foreign debt of  $22 billion and growing ethnic unrest.  </P> <P> The country's state presidency on Thursday named six candidates to replace  Mikulic, but political analysts described Markovic and Jovic as the  front-runners.  </P></p>

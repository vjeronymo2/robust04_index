			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Maggie Ford in Jakarta] </F>   [Excerpts] When Megawati Sukarno, daughter of Indonesia's  first president and now leader of the Indonesia Democratic  Party, arrived in the troubled Indonesian province of East Timor  last month, she was met with enthusiasm.    The visit came as part of a nationwide tour to introduce the  party's new leader not only to the public, but also to the  military commanders who hold such sway in Indonesia's  underdeveloped eastern regions.    It may also have given the East Timorese people hope that  their problems with the Indonesian Government will be better  understood. But if Ms. Sukarno's tour does not produce results,  East Timor can also look for help from another female source --  Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana, daughter of Indonesia's current  president. [passage omitted]    The first sign that some thing new was in prospect came late  last year when Ms. Sukarno took afternoon tea at Mrs. Rukmana's  home. The two ladies, while not estranged, had never before been  particularly friendly. But a few days before the meeting, Mrs.  Rukmana had paid a personal visit to the grave of Ms Sukarno's  father, former president Sukarno, in Blitar, East Java.    That visit made it perfectly clear to the political pundits  that Mrs. Rukmana's father, President Suharto, who took over  from the late Mr. Sukarno, had no objection to the newly  announced political plans of his predecessor's daughter. A few  days later, Ms. Sukarno was installed as elected leader of the  Indonesia Democratic Party (PDI), the small opposition party  which had been riven by factionalism, rivalry, and government  interference for over a year.    Ms. Sukarno's rise to the chairmanship signals a potential  shift in Indonesian politics where power has been concentrated  in the hands of the Army-backed ruling group Golkar [Functional  Group], which is also supported by the bureaucracy.    It followed the establishment for the first time of a  civilian leadership in Golkar. At its party conference in  October, Minister of Information Harmoko took over what had  previously been a military post. Ms. Sukarno and Mr. Harmoko  have already clashed, with a preliminary skirmish over Golkar's  "single majority," under which the ruling group dominates all  decisionmaking and excludes others from power in the country.  Ms. Sukarno called for policies which took all public views into  account, while Mr. Harmoko declared that Golkar's large election  victories gave it the right to exercise power as the people's  choice.    Meanwhile, the other presidential daughter was displaying  her  own intentions to become a political player. Mrs. Rukmana had  already joined the leadership of Golkar last October when she  was chosen as a vice chairman of the executive board. Her  involvement in East Timor diplomacy started late last year when  she took part in a secret meeting in London to discuss ways to  seek recognition and reconciliation with Portugal, the former  colonial power. Mrs. Rukmana has now been installed as chairman  of the Indonesia-Portugal Friendship Society following the visit  to Indonesia of retired Portuguese General Carlos Galvao de  Melo, who will be her cochairman in Portugal. She will return  the visit shortly.    Nor has Mrs. Rukmana restricted her activities to trying to  help resolve the East Timor problem. Best known as a  businesswoman in the past, her highway construction company is  involved in major projects in Indonesia and Malaysia. A  subsidiary has been set up to manage trade and manufacturing of  Malaysian cars and Indonesian aircraft. [passage omitted]    Political analysts believe it is too early to say precisely  what Mrs. Rukmana's long-range plans may be. They are also  unsure of the effect of the rise to prominence of two women in a  country which has little history of women in public office. But  they believe that it is hardly surprising given the numerous  examples of female leaders in other Asian and Muslim countries.  Especially where a woman politician has a political family  background, sex need be no bar to successful leadership they  say. Ms. Sukarno's popularity in her own party and with the  general public is not in doubt although she is politically  untested. [passage omitted]</p>

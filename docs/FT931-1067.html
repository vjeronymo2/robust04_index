			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Russia in Turmoil: Fyodorov proposes another dose of shock therapy unveiled under presidential rule - represent a new round of 'shock therapy' after a long period during which many financial stabilisation measures have been blocked. The measures, put forward by Mr Boris Fyodorov, deputy prime minister for economy and finance, include: A six month moratorium on the payment of all foreign debt as long as the measures in the draft programme are in force. Russia has paid neither interest nor principal on its Dollars 80bn foreign debt for several months. It was not clear last night if the proposal superseded an earlier offer to repay Dollars 3.5bn this year. Rigid limits on credit advanced by the central bank, seen by the government as the main engine of inflation. The Russian information agency said credit would grow by no more than 40 per cent in the first quarter, 30 per cent in the second and 15 per cent in the third and fourth quarters. Raising bank interest rates to 8 per cent a month from 80 per cent a year (though much credit is advanced at lower rates). The creation of a Dollars 3bn fund to stabilise the rouble - drawn from the tiny stock of foreign currency and from international credits. This suggests that Mr Fyodorov wants to move swiftly to attempt to stabilise the rouble without the assistance of the International Monetary Fund, whose Dollars 6bn fund has never been granted because conditions were not judged to be right. Simplification of the system under which land can be sold to citizens. An increase in the minimum state wage to Rbs4,500 a month (about Dollars 7) and indexing savings in the state savings bank. The current minimum wage is around Rbs3,000. According to the Interfax news agency, Mr Fyodorov told the cabinet it must blend 'popular and unpopular measures', with its eyes fixed firmly in the proposed referendum on April 25. He was quoted as saying that it was important not to upset the vote on April 25, since the national plebiscite was the key to reforms.</p>

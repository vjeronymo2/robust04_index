			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The EC's Directive on Satellite </F> Communications"]    [Text] The EC has issued its draft directive on the mutual  recognition of satellite licenses. The draft directive is aimed  at the markets for such activities as provision of FSAT  services, MSS services and SNG.    A major change from previous proposals from the EC is the  addition of a one stop shopping procedure in the directive,  replacing the concept of a single community license issued by  the Commission. This reflects what has actually happened at  national level over the last two years. Whilst the Commission  clearly wants a mechanism which provides licenses that are  harmonised and fully recognised by all member states, the  transitional one stop shopping procedure reflects the reality  that this will be slow and difficult to implement. It also  appears to reflect a shift of power away from DG XIII to CEPT  and national level.    The Commission hopes that the transitional concept of one  stop shopping will be replaced over time by "appropriate  harmonisation conditions".    The document is largely silent on the issue of direct access  to Eutelsat and Intesat -- "As concerns the discussions in the  International Satellite Organisations... on improvements to the  access conditions to the space segment capacity of their  respective intergovernmental satellite systems, this proposal  builds on the progress of these discussions and in particular  the recent decision by the Eutelsat Assembly of Parties to  propose the Member States options for improved and broadened  access either through the installation of a national Signatory  Affaire Office and/or through the so called multiple access  option in which access to the capacity can also be sought via  Signatories other than the national one. The proposal foresees  that both options shall be implemented and recognised."    The position is a significant shift from the 1990 Green  Paper  which explicitly called for EC action to ensure direct access to  Eutelsat and Intelsat. However, the EC says that the draft  directive now "further builds on the discussions and decisions  taking place within the International Satellite Organisations  and in particular those within the Eutelsat framework."    An indication of just how slow the Commission has been in  this sector is that the Green paper was issued (after much  delay) in November 1990. The final directive is planned for  implementation no later than 1 October 1995. Trade sources  suggest that this is a tight timetable given that European  Radiocommunications Office (see later) has other greater  priorities than satellite communications; it is unlikely that  the Commission will have its act together until well into 1995.  <H5>  Power to CEPT </H5>   The draft directive calls for a major CEPT role in  implementing the harmonisation of licensing conditions for  satellite services as distinct from the interim one stop  shopping set up. CEPT represents all European countries, not  just the 12 members of the European Union. The draft calls for  two CEPT bodies to have a role, the European Committee for  Telecommunications Regulatory Affairs (ECTRA) and the European  Radiocommunications Committee/Office (ERC).    "As a first step, ECTRA may be mandated by the Commission to  elaborate the technical basis for harmonised licensing  conditions, based on the expertise of ECTRA and ERC, in the  wider European context, and as such appropriate to satellite  communications. The technical basis could include matters such  as arrangements for the coordination of frequencies or for site  approval, verification of space segment access arrangements,  issuing of network numbering schemes, practical arrangements  which facilitiate contacts with prospective licensed satellite  network operators in case of an emergency, practical adherence  to specific national conditions in conformance with Community  law etc."    "As a second step, the Commission will test the provided  technical basis against Community law and policies, in  particular telecommunications policy; after which common  licensing conditions will be adopted. In accordance with the  responsibilities conferred on the Commission by the Directive."  <H5>  One Stop Shopping Timetable </H5>   Fairly tight timetables are set down for the issue of  licenses under the one stop shopping arrangements. When a  service or network provider files with a national organisation  for a license, that organisation must notify national regulatory  authorities involved within seven days.    The national regulatory authority responsible for issuing  the  license must take a decision and inform the applicant within six  weeks of receipt of application.  <H5>  LEO's </H5>   The draft also addresses the issue of new service categories  for which harmonised Community licensing conditions have not yet  been agreed, such as services from non-geostationary satellites  and in cases where certain satellite services might not be  covered by any of the established service categories due to the  uniqueness of the service for which a license is sought. Under  such circumstances, applications for mutual recognition can be  dealt with under transitional one stop shopping until harmonised  conditions for the service category in question have been  elaborated.  <H5>  The Community Telecommunications Committee (CTC) </H5>   The EC intends to use the CTC as the vehicle to implement  the  directive at Community level. The CTC is composed of  representatives of national regulatory authorities of EU member  states. However, most of the major tasks of implementation of  the directive will be taken at national level. The CTC will  also be used as a conciliation body when appeals are made to the  Commission.  <H5>  Bad News for the USA </H5>   The Directive will give rights to satellite service  providers  or network operators only if they are owned through a three  quarters majority ownership by member states and/or national of  member states. "That means that a US owned SNG operation, for  example, could be forced to continue to obtain licenses at  national level and have a separate license for each of the 12  member states. In practice it looks to be more of a vehicle to  keep U.S. common carriers out of the European marketplace.  Indeed, European organisations are currently specifically  prevented from obtaining common carrier licenses in the USA.    The draft directive states that the protectionist measures  "will remain to be applied until satisfactory completion of  bilateral or multilateral agreements which allow a more balanced  developments, or until the developments of the satellite sector  requires a review of these provisions...."    Essentially this is a GATT services issue covered in last  month's final meeting or the Uruguay round.    It appears that the clauses are likely to lead to a lot of  lobbying by US interests.</p>

			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / LWT staff seek share of windfall profits MORE than 500 staff at London Weekend Television have signed a petition calling for a share of the Pounds 65m-plus in 'windfall profits' that could go to the ITV company's management later this year. The petition is being completed as Granada's purchase of about 15 per cent of LWT has further pushed up its share price. Under a management share scheme more than 40 LWT managers will be able to convert each management share they hold into four ordinary shares. Last month, at a share price of 385p, the managers were set to receive shares worth Pounds 55m, creating 15 LWT millionaires, with Pounds 7m for chairman Sir Christopher Bland and Pounds 5.3m for chief executive Mr Greg Dyke. The Granada deal had by yesterday pushed the share price up to 466p. Sir Christopher's shares are now likely to be worth about Pounds 8.5m and Mr Dyke's about Pounds 6.4m. The staff petition calls for a 'significant proportion of the windfall profits' to be distributed to staff in the form of shares, and seeks the reinstatement of this year's cut for staff in profit-related pay. A staff committee will decide on Tuesday what to do with the petition amid some suggestions from management that it will be easier to do something to meet staff concerns if the petition is not formally submitted. LWT staff have been angry at the contrast between the millions going to the company's managers and the fact that staff received no specific reward for helping to retain the London weekend franchise.</p>

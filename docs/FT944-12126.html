			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / French jobless reaches record high: Balladur suffers political setback but underlying employment trend is good French unemployment levels for September jumped to a record high of 3.35m, 12.7 per cent of the labour force, according to government statistics released yesterday. The figures were disappointing news for the conservative government of the prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, whose undeclared presidential ambitions rest on his ability to prove he can bring down unemployment, the main concern of French voters. However, economists noted that the poor figures disguised an improving underlying trend, and said there was no question but that unemployment would be on an overall downward path in the run-up to next April's presidential election. The government did its best to play down the significance of the rise, although some commentators expressed concern at the high rate at a time of economic recovery within the country. The seasonally-adjusted number of people seeking work rose by 13,900 people or 0.4 per cent to 3,351,900 during the month, following an increase of 0.5 per cent in the August. Mr Michel Graud, the minister of labour, said the increase reflected a number of people joining the workforce for the first time who were inspired to apply for jobs because they perceived the economy to be recovering. He said that much of the rise was because of women entering the workforce. Mr Giraud said the government was sticking to its forecast that unemployment would stabilise at the end of the 1994 and fall in 1995, a view that economists said they still believed. However, the rise was criticised in the French parliament by Mr Martin Malvy, the leader of the socialist group, who said it showed 'the bankruptcy of the solutions put in place by the government'. Mr Malvy said the jobless figures cast doubt on Mr Balladur's ability to deliver on a target of cutting 1m from the jobless roll in the next few years and 200,000 in 1995 alone. 'How can one, in these conditions have the slightest faith in the promises of Mr Balladur as a candidate (for president),' he said. Reactions to the figures from analysts were mixed yesterday. Mr Gwinn Hacche, a European economist for James Capel, said: 'This is a bit disappointing. We had expected unemployment to remain unchanged but this is a new record.' He said it was surprising to see the increase at a time when there was strong economic recovery in France above the levels in much of the rest of Europe, and reflected an underlying high level of structural unemployment in the country. Mr Hacche said there was a 'worrying trend' of structural unemployment 'ratcheting up' after each recession in France, aided by a minimum wage and a generous social security system. 'The government must be finding it increasingly difficult to find new schemes especially for the young unemployed,' he said. 'The budget deficit means they cannot embark on general reflation and it may favour Mr Jacques Chirac who has called for more domestic action to tackle joblessness.' However, Ms Esther Baroudy, senior economist at Credit Lyonnais, said: 'It looks like things are going the government's way. 'The trend is really improving. We are seeing a stabilisation rather than any dramatic increase. What influences consumer confidence is the rate of change, not the absolute numbers.'</p>

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Travel: Out-of-season Nice, a smart place to be - Nicholas Woodsworth strolls in the footsteps of the 19th century English aristocrats who made the French Riviera fashionable Friday: I have just read the day's European weather forecast. Paris lies under thick fog. There are gales off the Irish coast, snow in Hamburg and arctic fronts over Moscow. Although occasional brighter spells are hinted at, it is raining in London. Can I be on the same continent? I am in Nice, where it is balmier than a July day in Blackpool and the sun is blazing in a deep blue sky. If well-heeled women are wearing furs, it is because this is the only season they can justify showing them off. Down by the water on the palm-tree-lined Promenade des Anglais, people more sensibly dressed are strolling in short sleeves. The English aristocrats who made Nice famous as a winter resort last century had the right idea. In this season the Riviera is a world away from the rest of drab, rain-sodden Europe. Summer on the Cote d'Azur I find too crowded to be tolerable, but for an out-of-season break without stress or crowds, Nice is just the ticket. Not that from time to time Nice is not chilly or overcast. In the 19th century extraordinary measures were taken to maintain the city's reputation as a winter watering-hole. On occasions it snowed. Night crews were dispatched to the promenade. Tree boughs were shaken, shrubbery dusted off, and the evidence dumped into the sea. When visitors rose to take their morning constitutional, not a snowflake was to be seen. But such weather on this coast is rare, as the courtyard garden of the Hotel La Perouse proves. The yellow lemons that hang below my balcony are genuine, and smell heavenly. Up the hillside, on which the hotel sits, there are pink and purple cyclamen, cactus plants covered in small white blooms, bay laurels, thyme and rosemary in flower. From my balcony there are glorious views in two directions - in one, the warm ochre walls and red roofs of the old part of the city, in the other the sunny blue Mediterranean disappearing southwards over the horizon. There is a bright, light-filled pointillist painting by Henri Matisse, called Luxe, Calme et Volupte, of three bathers in isolated and happy repose by the sea. It is a title that always makes me think of winter-time Nice. Saturday: It is the wonderfully clear and translucent Mediterranean light that makes this city work. It is the light that brought Matisse, Dufy, Signac, Renoir and a score of other post-impressionist artists to paint here. It is the light that, in touching even the most banal objects, gives them a lustre and life of their own. How do I know? As pleasurable as they are, I do not need the works of the post-impressionists to tell me. I have been studying eggplants and tomatoes at the old Nice market. Weekends on the Cours Salaya in the centre of old Nice are as rich and sensual in colour and texture as any tableau. The buildings on either side of the broad pedestrian Cours are ornate and Italianate in style, built last century when Nice was not French but a possession of the House of Savoy. Their facades range in tone from creamy yellow to sun-faded ochre and sienna to deep magenta. The louvred shutters on their windows - protection against fierce summers - are always a pleasant contrast: greeny-grey, olive, faded blue or turquoise. When, in summer or winter, the sunlight hits these buildings, they glow. The produce on sale under the cotton awnings on the Cours is more colourful still. The eggplants are a deeper purple, the tomatoes redder, the green peppers greener than they are elsewhere. I love the contrast of the Nice market. In front of the highly dignified and decorated Prefecture building there are squawking geese and clucking hens for sale, heaps of potatoes and strings of garlic. Another contrast: one woman standing by a pile of broccoli drips with jewels and has the taut, parchment skin of the repeat visitor to the cosmetic surgeon; beside her, in all humility, is a woman in the black, old-fashioned widow's weeds of the Mediterranean peasant. Nice is a sophisticated city which, like other resorts along this coast, attracts large amounts of money. It has a reputation for jet-set decadence, mobsterism and corrupt politics. There are casinos, yacht clubs, high-society events, social and financial scandals galore. What is nice about Nice, and makes it quite unlike Cannes, Monaco or St Tropez, is that at the same time it retains a good deal of the older, simpler Mediterranean life as well. After the bright, open Cours Salaya, walking through old Nice's streets and alleys is like plunging into deep submarine canyons. In odd nooks and crannies there are obscure shops full of old-fashioned equipment and merchandise - wood-fired bread ovens, ancient coffee-roasting machines, jumbles of rope and sailor's sweaters, walking sticks, bird cages. Five floors up through the gloom, above potted plants on balconies and lines festooned with drying laundry, is a thin, hard blue crack, the sky. Lunch. I am trying to discover what a genuine salade Nicoise is. Today's - sampled in Acchiardo, a simple back-street restaurant better than most on the glitzy waterfront - bears no resemblance to yesterday's. The only two constants seem to be anchovies and tiny black olives; after that it is a free-for-all of tuna, string beans, boiled eggs, tomatoes, lettuce and - almost - anything else. There is a delicious tiramisu for desert. It is fattening, but I shall stroll it off this afternoon in the corridors of the Matisse Museum. Sunday: Surveying the calm water from my balcony early this morning, I was surprised to see a dozen or so septagenarian swimmers launch themselves from the pebbly beach straight out to sea. They began a vigorous crawl that would have had them in Algiers for lunch, and I was relieved to watch them, at what seemed a dangerous distance from the shore, finally turn round and head back. I had no cause for worry, according to the chambermaid who brought me cafe-au-lait and buttery croissants for breakfast. Because of its climate, Nice is full of retired people leading year-round outdoor lives. They are healthier than I. I am not sure how good all that sun is - their skin looks like tanned leather - but I determined to take a leaf out of their book. I decided to lay off Sunday morning socca, and enrich myself spiritually instead. Socca is a Nice speciality, a large thin pancake made of chick-pea flower and olive oil; sprinkled with pepper, it is an addictive snack. The best place to buy it is from Theresa at the Sunday morning flower market in front of the Prefecture. With her jet-black hair, crimson lipstick, dangling gipsy earrings, tight red jumper and dark, flame-throwing eyes, Theresa is a formidable woman. She also makes formidable socca. Half the men in Nice line up to buy socca at her stall. But I wanted spiritual nourishment instead. I began by popping into one or two of Nice's sumptuous Baroque churches. There is nothing dull about them; they are so full of intricate plasterwork, marble and gilt that northern sensibilities might even find them gaudy. Nor is there anything dull about Marc Chagall's Biblical Message, the 17-canvas chef-d'oeuvre of religious symbolism I toured at the Chagall Museum. Whimsical images of levitating goats, flying violins and floating brides are just the thing for a Sunday morning. But now, at noon, my resolve has weakened. I think a quick hop up to St Paul-de-Vence in the hills behind Nice would do me no harm. St Paul has a well-known restaurant, the Colombe d'Or, made famous by Yves Montand and Simone Signoret. St Paul has become a summer-time tourist trap. None the less, it is one of the loveliest medieval stone villages on this coast, and in winter well worth visiting. I will not dawdle, though. After lunch I plan to take everyone's favourite Sunday afternoon walk, a long stroll down the Promenade des Anglais, beside the roller-skaters and joggers, the Rolls' and mink coats, the palm trees and the sea. Then, tomorrow, back to London. It is still raining there. But there is a chance of occasional bright spells.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, February 17 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Foreign  Ministry Spokesman Wu Jianmin said here this afternoon that it  is a basic policy of the Chinese Government to develop friendly  relations and co-operation with Japan in a sustained and stable  manner on the basis of the five principles of peaceful  co-existence.    He said this at the weekly press conference when asked to  comment on an article of a Japanese magazine which asserted that  China views Japan as a major enemy in 20 years.    He said this assertion is untenable and is designed by a  very  small number of people to sow discord. He pointed out that it  is the common aspiration of the two peoples to carry on  Sino-Japanese friendship from generation to generation, and it  is a basic policy of the Chinese Government to develop friendly  relations and co- operation with Japan in a sustained and stable  manner on the basis of the five principles of peaceful  co-existence.    He noted that long-standing friendship and co-operation  between China and Japan will not only benefit the two countries,  but also contribute to the stability and prosperity of the  region and the world at large.</p>

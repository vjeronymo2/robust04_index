			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Markets Report: Focus stays on futures Foreign exchanges yesterday again played second fiddle to interest rate markets, where prices fell across the yield curve, writes Philip Gawith. Trade in Euromark and short sterling futures was robust and prices very volatile. The December sterling contract closed at 93.49 from 93.59, while the equivalent Euromark future fell by six basis points to 94.81. Movements in the back month contracts were even more dramatic. Bond market weakness spilled over into some of the Scandinavian currencies, with both the Danish and Swedish crowns declining, apparently on the back of bond sales by foreigners. Elsewhere, the dollar continued its recent pattern of range-bound trading, paying little attention to economic data released. It ended in London at DM1.6428 from DM1.6435 and against the yen at Y104.650 from Y104.655. The US currency finished New York trading at DM1.6463 and Y104.50. Strong first-quarter GDP figures boosted the Australian dollar, which climbed to a 21-month high against the US dollar, closing at Dollars 0.7407 from Dollars 0.7383. Sterling finished the day firmer at DM2.4922 from DM2.4846. Against the dollar it ended at Dollars 1.5171 from Dollars 1.5118. The Belgian central bank cut its key central rate to 5.2 per cent from 5.25 per cent. The mood in the interest rate futures markets was again very gloomy. One analyst said the market seemed 'determined to creep towards some sort of financial Armageddon'. The pattern was again set at the long end of the market, with bunds feeding into gilts, which then spilled over into short sterling. Some of the back month (longer) contracts have now lost a full percentage point in the past week. The market actually started firmer, but began to lose ground once the German repo announcement - the rate was cut by 5 basis points to 5.15 per cent - came through. Expectations of a reduction as large as 10 basis points had built up in advance of the announcement, so there was some dis-appointment in the market. Analysts said there appeared to be tremendous value at current levels, but there was no buying interest. It was difficult to persuade clients to buy when prices seemed, inexorably, cheaper the following day. Volumes were fairly large, with December short sterling trading 40,000 lots, and the December Euromark nearly 51,000 lots. The dollar was unaffected by the release of the May purchasing managers' index, which was steady at 57.7, although the price component rose to 71.5, from 63.2 in April. Analysts said the US currency would stay in its recent narrow trading range of DM1.6390 to DM1.6480 until the release tomorrow of the non-farm payroll figures. Mr Ian Gunner, international economist at Chase Manhattan in London, said 'expectations about the US economy are so solidly in place that it is difficult for a set of figures to make much impact'. The dollar managed to resist some potentially negative comments from two Bundesbank council members. Although Mr Guntram Palm said there was still room for movement on the repo rate, he also added: 'At the current time it would appear that a stopping point, if not a turning point, is in sight for interest rate policy.' Mr Olaf Sievert, meanwhile, head of the regional central bank for Saxony and Thuringia, effectively discounted the prospect of imminent Bundesbank intervention to support the dollar. 'The Bundesbank is not at the ready, waiting to intervene in the market at a dollar rate of DM1.64 . . . all rates in the region of DM1.70 or DM1.65 are not a problem for us . . . ,' he said. In Europe the Danish krone closed at DKr3.929 against the D-Mark, down from DM3.9160 on May 30. The Swedish krona also fell, ending at SKr4.78, from SKr4.68 on May 30. Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan (Europe), said the weakening of these currencies was driven by foreign investors selling bonds. One possible explanation for the trend is that markets are suffering from greater competition for banks' funds, with more money diverted, for example, into corporate lending. The JP Morgan analyst said the reason the Scandinavian currencies had been particularly affected was that both were fairly exposed to international investors, and less liquid than some other markets. Mr Persaud said international investors were also concerned that governments faced with elections would not be able to administer the sort of fiscal medicine their economies required. He predicted that other countries such as Spain and France, faced with a similar confluence of events, might also experience currency weakness in future. The Bank of England provided late assistance of Pounds 35m to UK money markets after forecasting a Pounds 350m shortage. Overnight money moved between 4 per cent and 6 per cent. German call money fell back to 5.15/5.25 per cent, from 5.75/5.95 per cent on Tuesday.</p>

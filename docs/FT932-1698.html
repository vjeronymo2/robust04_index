			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / French seen as more protectionist Gloomy about prospects for an end to the recession, most French people favour protectionism on imports and a tough line with the US on world trade negotiations, according to an opinion poll released yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris. Some 67 per cent thought France and Europe should limit non-French or non-European imports and 62 per cent thought Europe should be tougher with Washington in the Gatt world trade talks, even if this meant upsetting relations with the US. The poll by CSA for Le Parisien newspaper also said 79 per cent of those asked thought the recession would go on for at least a year or two.</p>

			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> The Athletics Congress' national board of review, which was to have conducted a  hearing into allegations that Southland track and field coach Chuck DeBus  supplied performance-enhancing drugs to his athletes, announced that it will  review on Oct. 13 an agreement reached last month between TAC and DeBus that  apparently rendered the hearing unnecessary.  </P> <P> The agreement, reached without the support of the three-person panel, allowed  DeBus to resign from the sport for two years, without admitting guilt. However,  TAC may not have had the authority to make such an agreement without the  panel's approval.  </P></p>

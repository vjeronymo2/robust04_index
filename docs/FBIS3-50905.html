These statements were made by a spokesman of the Ministry of  Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation after Washington  announced its decision to reduce its purchases from China in the  specified area by 35 percent. This would include sweaters,  clothing, cotton products, and elements used in the maintenance  of machinery: a reduction that exceeds $1 billion, which is  considered to be a severe blow to bilateral trade transactions  in the textile sphere.</p>

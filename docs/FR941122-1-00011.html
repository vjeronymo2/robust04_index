			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In March 1994, the Department approved enhanced funding extension  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests from four State agencies using this policy. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department acted on these requests prior to the rulemaking so the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State agencies affected would know their Federal funding status  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior to the April 1, 1994 effective date mandated in the law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a decision by FNS to grant a delay is made after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> April 1, 1994, an adjustment will be made so an affected State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency can receive enhanced Federal funding retroactive to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> April 1, 1994 for eligible costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If approval is granted to delay the effective date, Section 13971  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Leland Act provides that the delayed effective date would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be the first day of the first calendar quarter which begins after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the close of the State's regular legislative session. In such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case, State agencies would be required to promptly advise FNS in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> writing as to the actual date the next regular session of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State legislature is completed once such session is completed so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the delayed effective date can be determined.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Enhanced Funding for Low Payment Error Rates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Section 16(c) of the Food Stamp Act and the current rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at &sect;277.4(b), the Federal share of administrative costs specified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in section 16(a) of the Food Stamp Act may be enhanced from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regular 50 percent rate to a maximum of 60 percent after the end  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Federal fiscal year if the State agency qualifies by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieving a low payment error rate. Costs which were eligible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for greater enhanced funding rates under section 16 (a), (g), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j) of the Act (fraud control costs, ADP development, and SAVE)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were ineligible for the 60 percent enhancement. With the drop in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the funding rate to 50 percent, these three activities now become  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible along with other costs funded at the 50 percent rate for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the increased Federal reimbursement rate of up to 60 percent if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State agency meets the low payment error rate specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;277.4. The enhanced funding may only be paid on costs shared at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 50 percent level to State agencies who qualify. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department proposes to amend &sect;277.4, to allow these three new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities to become eligible for the 60 percent enhanced funding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by removing &sect;277.4 (b)(1), (b)(10), (b)(11) and (b)(12),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> redesignating the remaining provisions, and by revising newly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designated paragraph (b)(7).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Deadline for Filing Claims for Retroactive Funding_Section 277.11  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current rules at &sect;277.11 do not limit State agencies from making  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claims for prior year administrative costs. The one exception is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the provision at &sect;277.15(b) limits 75 percent funding for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fraud control activities to prior year costs incurred in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal fiscal year during which a State agency initially applied  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for 75 percent funding. However, State agencies may make claims  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for prior year fraud control activities at the 50 percent Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reimbursement rate with no time limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State agencies are currently required at &sect;277.11 to submit a Form  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SF&hyph;269, Financial Status Report, on a quarterly basis to report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program costs and to support the claims made for Federal funding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Final reports are due December 30 for the preceeding Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fiscal year which runs from October 1 through September 30. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, after the fiscal year is over, State agencies may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> request retroactive funding for past years or pay back FNS for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inadvertent overclaims by submitting an SF&hyph;270, Request for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Advance or Reimbursement. It is the SF&hyph;270 adjustments which,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under current rules potentially may go on without end. In Fiscal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Years (FY) 1991 through 1993, FNS received SF&hyph;270 requests for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retroactive funding from State agencies going back as far as FY  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1981 and SF&hyph;270 payments from State agencies to FNS going back to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FY 1979 and prior years for the Food Stamp Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

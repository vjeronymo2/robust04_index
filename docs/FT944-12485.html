			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / International Company News: CRA blocks copper plant upgrade The Southern Copper refinery and smelter at Port Kembla in New South Wales may be closed permanently. This follows the announcement by CRA, the Australian resources group controlled by Britain's RTZ, that it was refusing to support a ADollars 230m (USDollars 170m) upgrade of the facility unless a new partner was brought into the project to 'substantially' reduce CRA's stake. CRA currently holds a 60 per cent interest in the project, alongside two Japanese investors - Furukawa with 30 per cent and Nissho Iwai Corporation with 10 per cent. Just over half the investment relates to environmental upgrading and the rest to expansion 'to achieve a viable scale of operation', and would have taken place over the next two years. CRA's move follows four weeks of strike action at the plant. Over 300 employees walked out on October 4 in protest at management plans to cut 40 jobs from the workforce of around 440. There has been minimal production since then. A decision on the plant's future is to be made by the Southern Copper board this month.</p>

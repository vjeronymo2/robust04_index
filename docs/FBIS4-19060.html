			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Patrick Sabatier: "Algerian Regime Should Be </F> Helped, French Diplomats Argue"]    [Text] Aware of the risk of a civil war in Algeria, French  officials are preparing to face a massive influx of refugees,  and would like to convince creditors to help that country.    Algeria is "France's biggest foreign policy problem, which  the government must face in the coming weeks and months,"  according to a senior French official. "And let us face it,  France is not equipped to deal with it." Paris was not  surprised by the resignation of Prime Minister Redha Malek.  Government circles in Paris consider that "Redha Malek's  resignation does not change the nature of the problem." French  officials in charge of the issue acknowledge that "the regime's  odds for survival are now very low." However, they still cling  to the hope that the crisis may be defused through dialogue with  some fundamentalist leaders and the unlikely improvement of a  disastrous economic situation which favors "holy war" mongers.    The devaluation of the dinar has paved the way for renewed  international financial aid. Other emergency measures are  expected, allowing for a rescheduling of the country's  $26-billion debt. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe is  determined to urge Algeria's creditors to help the country. He  already did so in Tokyo during his recent trip to Japan, which  is Algeria's second biggest creditor. He will address his  European Union counterparts this week as well.    In Paris, the feeling is that other nations remain  tragically  indifferent to a highly hazardous situation. "Nobody is helping  us to help them," complained the aforementioned senior official.  While readily acknowledging that the blame for the current  tragedy falls squarely on the shoulders of Algerian leaders, he  said they should be helped all the same as "they remain the  lesser evil." "Should fundamentalists gain power in Algiers,"  he added, "we would be left with a regime hostile to the West  and to France, perhaps even a terrorist one. Contagion in  Morocco and Tunisia will be unavoidable, and even in Egypt."    The United States does not want to have anything to do with  the current regime. French diplomats even charge Washington  with "talking to fundamentalists," because it thinks their  victory is unavoidable. "They have not learned the lessons of  Iran," says a fuming French official. The French concede,  however, that there cannot be a political solution that does not  include the fundamentalists. France did persuade Algiers to  negotiate with fundamentalists over the last few months. But  Paris admits that [President] Zeroual's attempts to do so have  so far failed.    In fact, aware both of their powerlessness in influencing  the  way things are going in Algeria and of the country's apparently  irreversible slide into civil war, French officials seem to be  mostly concerned with planning the measures that must be taken  to face the exodus that has already started. While repatriating  the 2,500 French nationals still in the country will not be a  problem, integrating the 50,000 or 60,000 with dual citizenship  that are registered in Algeria will be more difficult. Senior  officials reject the notion of throwing the doors open for the  100,000 or so individuals that may try to take advantage of  their ties with France, not to mention the 400,000 or 500,000  Algerians who might cross the Mediterranean as "boat people."    "French society cannot cope with such an influx of people,"  say parliamentary representatives of the [governing] majority.  Associations of "pieds-noirs" [Algerian-born French nationals]  have already voiced their opposition to an "open-door" policy.  Thus far, the French Office for the Protection of Refugees and  Stateless People has approved very few refugee status  applications from Algerian nationals. There are no plans to  extend "temporary" refugee status to Algerian expatriates, as  was done for war victims from Lebanon or the former Yugoslavia.  "This would trigger a tidal wave of immigrants to our shores,"  says an official, who gives the same explanation with respect to  the government's reluctance to open a debate on ways to  reconcile France's asylum tradition, its historical ties with  Algeria, and the fear of political destabilization.</p>

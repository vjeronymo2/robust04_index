The order followed the yen's surge on the Tokyo foreign  exchange market Tuesday to the 101 yen to 102 yen range against  the dollar, stemming in part from the failure of Hosokawa and  U.S. President Bill Clinton last week to reach accord on a  bilateral trade framework.    Hosokawa issued the order at an informal meeting of cabinet  ministers.    Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata told the meeting that Japan  should take the initiative in reducing the surplus, regardless  of the progress in the framework talks. Other cabinet ministers  supported Hata's view, the officials said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Untitled Stanislaw Cwik commentary from the "Hundred Words" </F> series]    [Text] The Prague summit has turned out to be a proper  school of realistic thinking for the new Polish Government. We  failed to achieve success there. We were firmly shown where our  place lies and what we can expect from our contacts with the  powers. And the most we can expect is sympathy. Strategic  decisions about the demarcation of influence are going to be  made without our direct participation. That is how things used  to be, and that is how they remain.    This initial cold shower will be useful for the Pawlak  government. It will enable the government to dispense with the  "messianic" delusions of previous governments and might even  help it establish a realistic program of cooperation with the  West for the next four years, a program based on the strength of  our exports and on military economic diplomacy, and capable of  defending our industry and our commercial rights. Such a program  has been called for by the coalition.    Prime Minister Pawlak seems to understand this. Instead of  being seized with a fit of despair about the Prague summit and  shedding tears over the flimsy condition of the Visegrad Group,  he is seeking new paths of cooperation. On the other hand,  President Walesa clearly cannot come to terms with reality and  is not hiding his profound disappointment with the West. But let  us hope he recovers quickly and draws practical conclusions from  this successive harsh lesson.</p>

			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Hunt for a smoking gun: The political battle against US tobacco groups Mr Thomas Sandefur, chairman of cigarette manufacturer Brown and Williamson, was the very picture of the tobacco executive at bay this week. Several times his lawyer advised him not to answer as he defended his company before a hostile congressional committee against charges that it manipulated the levels of nicotine in its cigarettes to keep smokers addicted. Repeatedly in recent weeks the chairman and chief executives of leading US cigarette manufacturers have been hauled before a panel of disbelieving members of congress, chaired by Congressman Henry Waxman, to repeat that they do not believe nicotine to be addictive, and do not believe their cigarettes cause lung cancer. The congressional hounds drew closer to their quarry this week when Dr David Kessler, commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, an agency of the health department, denounced Brown and Williamson for developing a strain of tobacco plant with twice the normal levels of nicotine. 'These findings lay to rest any notion that there is no manipulation and control of nicotine (in the manufacture of cigarettes)', Dr Kessler said. Mr Sandefur was the immediate target in a quest - he calls it a 'crusade' - by the FDA for evidence that might justify it defining nicotine as a drug, allowing it to assert its regulatory authority. Brown and Williamson, owned by the UK conglomerate BAT industries, has faced particularly close scrutiny because a cache of internal documents about its research and marketing operations, which the company alleges were stolen by a disgruntled employee, has made its way into the hands of Mr Waxman. But research papers and internal memoranda from other companies are also turning up which have added piece by piece to the picture of an industry that has not just ignored, but actually concealed, the evidence about the addictive and carcinogenic properties of its products. Amid all these disclosures, Ms Janet Reno, the attorney general, this week announced that the justice department was examining an array of allegations against the tobacco industry that could lead to criminal, civil and antitrust investigations. Dr Kessler's strategy for taking on the tobacco industry is unclear. The bearded and bespectacled paediatrician came late to the anti-smoking crusade, which he declined to pursue during his first two years as commissioner. In the past, the FDA limited itself to regulating nicotine in chewing gum or patches to help people stop smoking, and to preventing cigarette makers advertising their products' benefits, such as weight loss. Dr Kessler now speaks with all the fervour of the convert. The logic of his quest, if he finds more compelling evidence than the FDA yet possesses that nicotine is addictive, would lead him to a complete ban on nicotine-bearing cigarettes, or at least to strict limits on nicotine content. But Dr Kessler has warned of the dangers of prohibition. 'One must consider the possible effects of the loss of this source of nicotine on the health of some people who are addicted. It is also important to consider the potential for a black market in nicotine-containing cigarettes,' he told Mr Waxman's committee. Congressional opponents of smoking also shy away from talk of prohibition. Legislation being considered in Congress to give the FDA explicit power to regulate tobacco (currently defined as neither a food or a drug), sponsored by Congressmen Richard Durbin of Illinois and Mike Synar of Oklahoma, would specifically bar the agency from banning cigarettes. Mr Synar acknowledges that his bill would not pass if it included the threat of prohibition. But the tactics he has adopted highlights how hard it will be to win approval for even the less draconian proposals he is making: he has tried to attach the measure to the agriculture spending bill, which many legislators from tobacco growing states will in the end feel compelled to vote for, rather than presenting it on its own. 'If the bill could stand on its own they wouldn't resort to this backdoor tactic,' said Mr Tom Lauria, a spokesman for the Tobacco Institute, the industry lobbying group. Mr Lauria's confidence reflects the realities of congressional politics: despite the bashing the tobacco industry has received over the past year, its political muscle is still considerable. Political action committees run by the Tobacco Institute and individual manufacturers gave more than Dollars 1m to federal candidates last year. In addition, the industry is developing a grassroots lobbying strength. The National Smokers Alliance, run by Burson Marsteller, a public relations firm with close ties to cigarette manufacturers, now boasts hundreds of thousands of members and was active, along with cigarette maker Philip Morris, in collecting signatures to place a pro-smoking measure on the November ballot in California. If approved, the measure would overturn hundreds of local anti-smoking ordinances and replace them with a less stringent state law. Congress, however, may turn out to be something of a sideshow in a much broader onslaught on the tobacco industry. Anti-smoking campaigners are pressing the attack with new vigour on two other fronts. First, they are calling for more companies and employers to ban smoking in public places. A 1993 study by the Environmental Protection Agency classifying secondhand smoke as carcinogenic has led to companies such as McDonalds and employers such as the Pentagon to ban smoking on their premises. Second, legal action is being taken to force the tobacco industry to pay for the health costs of its products. Instead of lawsuits brought by individual smokers or their bereaved relatives against the company to whose products they attribute their lung cancer - a type of case the cigarette makers have almost always won - a new wave of claims is being filed by state governments against the tobacco industry in general. For tobacco executives such as Mr Sandefur, however, the immediate problem is the prospect of FDA regulation of nicotine. Congressman Ron Wyden of Oregon, another foe of smokers, urged Mr Sandefur to work with Congress to develop regulations his industry could accept, or risk becoming an 'outcast' in the debate over smoking policy. 'Congressman, it's hard for me to envision becoming more of an outcast than I am,' Mr Sandefur replied.</p>

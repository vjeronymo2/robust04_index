Madhavan Kutty] </F>   [Text] Whenever a change takes place in the American  Administration, especially from Republicans to Democrats, it is  common practice in the media in India and also to some extent in  government circles and among politicians to interpret it as a  change for the good, particularly for Indo-U.S. relations. But  the experience so far has been to the contrary, the simple  reason being that the U.S. national interests and their  perspectives have remained the same. In other words, the U.S.  Administration never changed its attitudes and perspectives on  world affairs. It has remained consistent, a fact we can  overlook only at our own cost.    America fashioned its policies, tailored its approaches and  upheld its values on democracy, human rights and whatever its  founding fathers prescribed for them to suit their `national  interests' as Americans perceived them, whether it was Grenada,  Panama, the Bay of Pigs, Iran and host of other things and even  on Kashmir. To expect that America will play its role according  to the rule book is too much. America will even extend a Most  Favoured Nation treatment even if it is convinced that the  recipient country violates and defies the basic principles  America upholds and wants all others to adhere strictly.    America never stood by India or anybody else for that  matter.  If India drew inspiration from it during our independence  struggle it was because it suited America's national interest to  support us at that time. It makes one even to think  retrospectively that it was in their national interest they  wanted Britain to withdraw from India so that one day in the  future they can be the replacement! The subsequent U.S. attitude  particularly in recent years, more so after the end of cold war  towards India on Kashmir, our economic development, scientific  programmes, NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty] etc. proves  this. Perhaps America was in a happier situation when in the  late 60s one Central Minister with proclaimed socialist leanings  spoke of `dove-tailing the plan', `India's womb opening up',  'backseat driving' etc.    The doves have turned to hawks and planning is now at the  dictates of World Bank and IMF. At that time there were  warnings of the empire trying to come back by the back door.  Now the suspicion has once again started growing among many  Indians, thanks to Clinton's pronouncements, Robin Raphel's  observations and John Mallot's comments. Opening up and  liberalisation may be necessary in today's global situation but  it should be in keeping with our national interests and not  according to imported prescriptions.    One score and ten years ago, John Kennedy in his inaugural  address said that American will "pay any price, bear any burden,  meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure  the survival and success of liberty". Thirty years later Bill  Clinton in his inaugural address proclaimed to protect America's  "vital interests" and pledged American action when "the will and  conscience of international community defied" that is to say  that there will be interventions for reasons of American  national interests and for reasons of American conscience.  Recently an American commentator wrote: "It has been a long  road (for Clinton) from Vietnam: the conscientious objector has  become the conscientious warrior." He added that it was a  "breakthrough" but a dangerous one. Even nations like India  have to pay a "heavy price", bear the burden, meet hardships and  is forced to support America, oppose their enemies for the  survival and success of liberty and tolerate interventions  anywhere if America thinks that their national interests and  their conscience are affected.    The Americans always suffered from some sort of  psychological  obsession. During the 50s and 60s especially, it was their  obsession that they have been entrusted with the responsibility  to contain communism. In Vietnam and elsewhere they learnt  bitter lessons. In later years their obsession was to uphold  human rights and liberty in all parts of the globe and they will  be the prosecutor and judge at the same time. Assuming this  role, America serves their national interests today in many  parts of the world with scant regard for other nations. The  standard for fundamental values like democracy, human rights are  set by them, administered by them, judged by them and if they  find any nation guilty they appropriate the right to themselves  to punish such nations by interventions and sanctions.    In 1971, Indira Gandhi in an article in Foreign Affairs  wrote  "....successive U.S. administrations have ignored the fact that  India must see her problems and her relationship in a different  perspective. India was regarded with disapproval and resentment  because of her independent policy. This could not but affect  relations between India and America. Despite fluctuations of  mood, our relationship as a whole has been uneasy over long  period".    Today, we are deliberating whether the Prime Minister should  visit America now or later, whether a minor functionary of the  American administration should be advised to postpone her visit  to India or not. What is important is to tell America in the  language it understands, as Mrs Gandhi did during the Bangladesh  liberation. Prime Minister Narasimha Rao told the UN Security  Council Summit last year that countries like India express their  views but they are seldom heard. Even the UN is hijacked to  serve the national interests of a particular country. This  situation has to be, and must be, changed.    If the Indo-U.S. relations are to improve, American national  interests and India's self-respect should go together. "Nations  are not individuals, nations live in a state of nature. If they  do not protect themselves they die. Ignoring one's interests,  squandering one's resources in fits of altruism, is the fast  road to national destruction", This warning given to America by  an American equally applies to India.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Armando Villanueva] </F>   [Text] The Armed Forces on 28 February said that they would  not oppose the virtual privatization of the Honduran  Telecommunications Enterprise (Hondutel) should the government  reach a political decision to do so, but their Commander in  Chief General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir pointed out that this  must be a "well made" decision, because it involves an  institution that is profitable to the State.    The Armed Forces have managed Hondutel since its inception  under the pretext that telecommunications is a national security  matter; and therefore, they must not be in private hands.    Discua Elvir discussed the thorny issue at a meeting with  high-ranking officers and President Carlos Roberto Reina. At a  news conference at the Government House, the number one man in  the military institution said that the sale of Hondutel depends  on a governmental political decision, because the State owns the  enterprise. He said: "There must be national awareness, and  there must be a political decision to do it. Hondutel is very  profitable to the State. I think that the government will have  the last word through a political decision."    The military chief pointed out that the Armed Forces "do not  have a positive or negative opinion" on the sale of Hondutel.  Discua added that personally, however, he has always believed  that the State must control telecommunications in any country,  "because it is a State duty." He added that "the State always  has the responsibility of controlling a country's  telecommunications," regardless of who manages or owns them.  However, "if the government makes a decision and has political  willingness, I believe that such a decision will be the wisest  decision," he added.    Discua Elvir recalled that President Reina said that if this  transaction materialized, it will be done in the clearest manner  possible. The Armed Forces chief stressed that there would be  "absolute honesty in this privatization process," but it must be  a "well made" decision, because the enterprise is profitable.    He added that the military does not control Hondutel,  because  its board of directors is made up of several governmental  sectors, including the Ministries of Communications, Public  Works and Transportation; Government and Justice; Defense; and  Finance, and even the Comptroller General's Office.    Discua said that Hondutel's manager, a career military  official, only follows the board's decisions. The military  chief added that no national economic group is able to buy  Hondutel. However, he maintained that the Military Welfare  Institute (IPM) is willing to "participate" in the purchase of  Hondutel, in case it is privatized. He added that the sale will  require an "immediate payment" so that the State will benefit  from the transaction.    Meanwhile, Gen. Discua Elvir denied that the Armed Forces  are  negotiating with President Reina a budget increase in exchange  for their approval of voluntary military service. He said: "As  commander in chief, I would be ashamed to make such a proposal  to President Reina."</p>

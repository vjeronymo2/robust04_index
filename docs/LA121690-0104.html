			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MATURE TRAVELER: CLUB HAS REDUCED RATES FOR B&amp;BS  </P> <P> Mature travelers who enjoy an old-fashioned bed and breakfast at old-fashioned  rates of $18 per night single or $24 double might want to check out a  relatively new group, TravelClub Bed and Breakfast.  </P> <P> TravelClub is a kid sister of the older Evergreen Club, which was started nine  years ago by Pat Wilson in Maryland for singles or couples over age 50.  </P> <P> Evergreen Club requires all bed and breakfast owners/members to have guest  rooms available to other club members for $10 a night single or $15 double. In  other words, members must host as well as be hosted.  </P> <P> Evergreen is still going strong and has moved its headquarters to Redondo  Beach. Today, it has more than 500 members, mostly in the United States and  Canada.  </P> <P> Over the years, Evergreen Club found many mature travelers who wanted to join  and stay in private bed and breakfast rooms but could not themselves host other  members.  </P> <P> So TravelClub Bed and Breakfast was born. Like Evergreen, it's for mature  travelers age 50 and older. But TravelClub does not require that members host  other member guests.  </P> <P> At $18 a night single, $24 double, including breakfast, TravelClub's overnight  rates are higher than Evergreen's but still moderate compared with many other  bed and breakfast inns.  </P> <P> And TravelClub currently has bed and breakfast accommodations in about 180  homes, according to Linda Mardi, daughter of Evergreen founder Pat Wilson. Most  are in the Sun Belt.  </P> <P> Annual TravelClub dues are $40 for singles, $50 per couple. That includes a bed  and breakfast host directory, a midyear newsletter and a later update on new  hosts. Members use the directory to make their own reservations.  </P> <P> "Despite the modest rates, TravelClub members could find themselves staying in  a waterfront home or along a golf course," said Mardi.  </P> <P> "Most of the hosts are retired and happy to help with travel and sightseeing  advice about their area. There's always a warm welcome for mature travelers . .  . just don't expect someone to carry your bags or spend the day with you."  </P> <P> Mardi also serves as director of her mother's original Evergreen Club.  </P> <P> Evergreen membership rates are the same -- $40 single, $50 double. But in  addition to getting lower rates, Evergreen members also have more locations to  choose from.  </P> <P> For more information on TravelClub or Evergreen, send a self-addressed stamped,  business-size envelope to: TravelClub, 1926 S. Pacific Coast Highway, Suite  217, Redondo Beach 90277.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> During rulemaking on the proposed air quality standard, NIOSH recommended a 0.5 percent TWA and a 3.0 percent STEL. NIOSH made a similar recommendation to OSHA during that Agency's permissible exposure limit (PEL) rulemaking. Given the work environment in bleeder entries and worked-out areas, as described earlier, the Agency believes that the dual regulatory approach proposed is appropriate. In addition to examiners, other miners may be required to work in the bleeder entries and worked-out areas, performing duties such as installing roof support, pumping water, recovering materials or adjusting ventilation. The levels proposed would provide them with the necessary protection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, MSHA is concerned with the synergistic effects that carbon dioxide has on the body when combined with low oxygen levels, especially at levels higher than 0.5 percent TWA. Carbon dioxide affects the blood pH, which is critical to the proper metabolism of oxygen. Because of the nature of the hazardous work environment in bleeder entries and worked-out areas, the Agency believes that it must be careful to establish levels which would not impact on the body's ability to deal with the conditions encountered. The Agency solicits comments on the appropriateness of these, or other concentration levels for carbon dioxide in areas where the examiner works or travels in bleeder entries and worked-out areas, along with the rationale for determining the appropriate level for bleeder entries and worked-out areas. However, as stated previously, it is not the intent of the Agency that the levels established in paragraph (2) of the proposed standard be applied to areas other than those areas within the bleeder entries and worked-out areas where persons work or travel. In light of this, it is not anticipated that many of the nation's coal mines would be required to increase the volume of air currently being used to ventilate bleeders and worked-out areas as a result of this proposed standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 75.323&blank;Actions for Excessive Methane <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MSHA is proposing to revise paragraphs (b)(1)(ii), (c)(1), and (d)(2)(i) of the existing standard in response to comments made during informational meetings and subsequent discussions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Methane poses a significant hazard to miners when it is permitted to accumulate without corrective action being taken quickly. The Agency received comments at its informational meetings asking MSHA to clarify when ventilation changes must be made to reduce methane concentrations to acceptable levels. MSHA has always intended that these changes be made at once. In response to these comments, the Agency is proposing to revise paragraphs (b)(1)(ii), (c)(1) and (d)(2)(i) to require that these changes be made ``at once,'' the phrase used in former &sect;&sect;75.308 and 75.309.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the Agency believes that the promulgation of paragraph (b) of this standard was done appropriately, it is being reproposed with the addition of the phrase ``at once'' for the purposes of receiving and giving consideration to all pertinent comments. When 1.0 percent or more methane is present in a working place, an intake air course, or an area where mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed, paragraph (b)(1) would require all electrical, diesel, and battery-powered equipment in the affected working place, intake air course or other area, except for intrinsically safe AMS, to be deenergized or shut off. Deenergizing or shutting off this equipment would protect miners by preventing this equipment from providing ignition sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If 1.5 percent methane or more is present in a working place, an intake air course, or an area where mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed, paragraph (b)(2) would require persons to be withdrawn from the affected area. The basic requirement for withdrawal of persons is retained from the previous standard and the reproposal would expand this basic requirement to include areas where mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed. The presence of methane in these areas can pose a significant risk to miners and therefore their withdrawal from the affected area is essential to their safety. Paragraph (b)(2) would also require that all electric power to equipment in affected areas be disconnected at the power source. This prevents accidental reenergization of equipment and removes power from cables and circuits which may also be ignition sources. No other work is permitted in the affected area until the concentration of methane is less than 1.0 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b)(2) would be amended by adding ``mechanized'' before mining equipment for consistency with other provisions of the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 75.324&blank;Intentional Changes in the Ventilation System <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MSHA is not proposing any changes to the wording of &sect;75.324 at this time. The following discussion clarifies MSHA's interpretation of what the Agency considers to be an intentional change that could materially affect the safety or health of persons in the mine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a) of the existing rule requires that a ventilation change be supervised by a person designated by the mine operator when a change in section ventilation is in excess of a specified quantity or when a ventilation change alters the main air current of the mine or any split of the main air current in a manner that could materially affect the safety or health of miners underground. Paragraph (b) of the existing rule specifies additional requirements that apply only to the ventilation changes described in paragraph (a) of this section. That is, before such an intentional air change is made, electric power must be removed from areas that may be affected by the change and mechanized equipment in those areas must be shut off. Also, only persons making the ventilation change are permitted in the mine while the change is being made. Afterward, certified persons must examine the areas affected by the change to determine whether methane accumulations or oxygen deficiencies have resulted. Electric power is not permitted to be restored to affected areas nor is mechanized equipment to be restarted until these tests have been made and the areas are determined to be safe.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

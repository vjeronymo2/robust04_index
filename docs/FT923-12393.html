			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Commission hails freer financial markets THE European Commission yesterday rejected for the time being the use of aggressive counter-measures to open up non-EC markets to Community banks and financial institutions. The Commission praised its biggest partners - the US and Japan - for the progress they have made in treating Community institutions in the same way as their own banks and insurance companies, although it said European Community groups were still hampered by some 'non-discriminatory regulatory requirements'. It believes the EC is leading by example in the effort to liberalise global financial markets. Brussels officials claimed the moral high ground again yesterday by pointing out that the Community was about to install 'the most liberal financial services market in the world'. In its first report to member states on the treatment of EC financial institutions by third countries, the Commission says it considers that existing world trade talks are the correct forum for improving market access. Under European Community banking legislation which comes into force in 1993, the Commission can deny access to banks and insurance companies from third countries which have not opened their markets. But a European Community official said yesterday: 'The Commission does not need to start negotiations with the big stick behind them because all our objectives are currently being considered in the Uruguay Round talks on financial services.' The report does, however, issue a veiled warning to a number of countries - including, for example, South Korea - which it says 'fall considerably short of granting national treatment to Community firms'.</p>

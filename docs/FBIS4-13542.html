			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 20, IRNA -- Thousands of university  students demonstrated in front of the UN office in Tehran today,  protesting the silence of the organization, its Security Council  and other international bodies on the massacre of Muslims in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, especially in Gorazde.    The demonstrators carried placards and banners and chanted  slogans in condemnation of Serbian crimes and UN policies  towards them during their march towards the UN office.    Some of the banners carried by the students read "Serbs are  committing crimes, Butrus-Ghali and the West are supporting  them".    The marchers expressed their hatred of the UN's negligence  towards the fate of Bosnian Muslims and of the shameful silence  of Western countries on the massacre of defenceless women and  children in an area declared by the UN as a safe haven.    In a resolution issued at the end of the rally, the students  voiced their readiness to be despatched to Bosnia-Herzegovina to  fight the aggressor Serbs.    Denouncing biased stance of the UN and its Security Council  on the issue, the students called for lifting of the arms  embargo against Bosnian Muslims.    Stressing that a proper response to aggressor Serbs could be  given through unity of Muslims, the resolution urged all Muslim  countries to mobilize their forces and resources for this  purpose.    Meanwhile, the ulema of the theological school of Qom staged  similar demonstration in the streets of the holy city in protest  at the silence of international circles on the crimes being  committed by the Serbs in Gorazde.    Also today, the Shahid (Martyr) Foundation issued a  statement, condemning the silence of the UN and its Security  Council on Serbian crimes in Gorazde.    The statement described the carnage of Muslims in Gorazde as  a proof of the "prejudiced attitudes" of the UN and its Security  Council.</p>

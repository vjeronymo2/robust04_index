			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Minding Your Own Business: My own little shop of horrors - Jane Whitehead dreamt of running her own business: it was a nightmare I dreamt about owning my own business for years. Every December 31 it would be top of my resolutions list. But like losing weight and becoming a better person, nothing ever came of it. Then suddenly I was 35. Mid life crisis. If I did not do it now, I never would. I knew exactly what it would be like, I had pictured it so often. On one side the pretty, cosy, bustling tea shop, on the other, exquisite crafts at affordable prices. Somewhere in there, me, swanning around, the amiable hostess. The decision was made. I counted my life savings - Pounds 6,000; amazingly I persuaded three friends to chip in another Pounds 18,000; went to see a very generous man at Barclays Bank who opened a sack of money and told me to help myself. I relieved him of Pounds 25,000; took small business advice from all sides; thanked my employers for 18 fairly mediocre years and set off in search of my dream. Somewhere along the way during the discussions, planning and more discussions, the tea shop idea was ditched in favour of an upmarket children's boutique. Armed with the knowledge that the three most important requirements for a retail outlet are - location, location and location, I searched for two months. There was nothing. This was early 1989. Boom time. The punters were spending. Shopkeepers had never been so happy. Not a 'To Let' sign in sight. And so it was, after a month of protracted negotiations I handed over an Pounds 8,000 premium for the three-year lease on a grubby, insect infected, disused sweet shop just off the main parade in a monied area of Cheshire. Rent: Pounds 100 per week. No expensive, bland shopfitters for me, three months of hard graft, assisted by willing volunteers, transformed the hovel into a whitewashed, pine-clad, coir-matted oasis. With Pounds 15,000 of stock tastefully displayed, I was ready. The delay, costs and knocks along the way had not dented my enthusiasm. I was raring to go. I took Pounds 750 that first week. No, not a fortune, but above my expectations. This was my 'break even' figure. I had assumed it would take an age to work up to that amount. I had cracked it. It was going to be a success. My three financial backers and I anticipated the profits to come. Barclays wrote pleasant encouraging letters. Life was rosy. It did not last. Initial enthusiasm for a new shop died down. Takings averaged Pounds 500 a week. Nigel Lawson raised interest rates and the first acorns of the recession began to take root. I was in the fashion business. Stocks had to be ordered six months in advance - a lottery. Who could say what trading conditions were going to be so far in the future? I certainly could not. Even children do not want last year's styles. Whatever had not been sold each season had to be got rid of whatever the price. Outgoings and overheads were horrific. It was one long round of paying out. The begging from local schools and charities for donations and raffle prizes was one large expense I had not budgeted for. How could I turn them down? They were a source of potential customers. The original investment of Pounds 49,000 had gone. I needed more to survive. I did not have any. I was not earning anything. It was up to my three friends. They came up with the goods. I tried everything to bring the punters in. I advertised, put 'money off' vouchers in the local press, organised charity fashion shows, distributed expensive glossy leaflets, participated in local events, injected humour into my window displays and installed Father Christmas and a photographer for a week. I could not have asked for more from family and friends. But it was all going wrong. I began to hate it. The constant worry. I could not switch off; the sleepless nights, the boredom, condescending mothers and badly behaved brats. I missed the inane chatter of the office, the companionship, the salary at the end of the month. Barclays began to get frosty. Letters were no longer addressed Dear Jane. I had been trading 22 months when that man who had so easily handed over Pounds 25,000 demanded it back. Why? It was fully guaranteed, backed by the business assets and a wad of share certificates handed over by my three partners in crime. But it had suddenly become a different climate and the banks were getting itchy. It happened to a lot of people. That was the beginning of the end. Two years to the day after I opened my lovely shop, I closed it. I had tried, without success, to sell. No one in their right mind was taking on a retail business. Or if they wanted to there were so many to choose from. Everywhere you looked there were the same signs: 'business for sale', 'to let', 'closing down'. Perversely, those signs made me feel a little better. They meant it was not just I who had failed. But I had awakened from my dream. Do I feel guilty about the money my friends lost? Yes. Very much. Thankfully they are still friends. Do I regret doing it? No. If I had not I would still be dreaming about it. At least now it is behind me. It was an experience and I learnt a lot of lessons. Now I can move on to my new dream.</p>

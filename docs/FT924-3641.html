			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Argentina in deal on debt reduction THE Argentine government and its leading bank creditors began signing a bank debt reduction agreement yesterday at a televised ceremony in Buenos Aires. The agreement covers Dollars 23bn of medium- and long-term bank debt and Dollars 8bn of arrears on interest payments. The signing, at which representatives from the 13 banks on Argentina's bank advisory committee were present, is the second last stage of the Brady-style agreement. The signing is expected to take several weeks, as hundreds of creditors  - including individuals who have bought the debt at a discount from face value to make speculative gains - put their signature to the accord. The agreement, negotiations over which were started in January, will be completed by an exchange of concessional bonds for bank debt, probably next April. In a speech at the ceremony, President Carlos Menem underlined the importance of an accord which would restore the country's creditworthiness. Argentine officials see it as the latest step in the government's aim to normalise the country's international relations. Mr William Rhodes, vice chairman of Citibank, Argentina's leading bank creditor, said the agreement 'regularised' the country's relations with commercial banks and underlined the government's commitment to sound economic policies. After the ceremony, economy minister Mr Domingo Cavallo left for Japan on a trip aimed at encouraging Japanese finance for the agreement. The accord is the latest in a series of debt reduction agreements under the Brady plan which have also benefited countries such as Mexico and Costa Rica. The plan is named after US Treasury Secretary, Mr Nicholas Brady. The agreement, bankers say, should improve the country's access to international financial markets and reduce its cost of borrowing, at present at least two percentage points above the costs of funds for Mexico. Under the accord, some 65 per cent of the debt will be shielded from future rises in interest rates through bonds carrying pre-set interest rates.</p>

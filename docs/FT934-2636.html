			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Arts: You Can't Take It With You - Theatre The 1930s were the golden age of American comedy, on both stage and screen. And numerous plays and films from that decade remain, not only classic comedies but also classic expressions of the American spirit. You Can't Take It With You, the most popular of the eight comedies co-written by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart, comes to us from 1936. Inasmuch as it is about an eccentric family who carry on being eccentric when they are entertaining polite guests, it is an American counterpart of Noel Coward's well-known Hay Fever (1925). The differences between the two plays tell us much about America and England. In both Hay Fever and You Can't Take It With You, the eccentric family submits its guests to party games with embarrassing results. But Coward's play, for all its brilliance, is merely about bad social manners. The Kaufman-Hart comedy goes far further, for it is about the complexity of society itself. The Sycamore family may have its crazy sides, but it is also a paradigm of the great American melting-pot. Gradually it exposes the primness of the polite guests as a form of repression; whereas the sometimes offensive hosts become a model of generous toleration. If you, like me, are in love with the American dream, the values that underpin this play will move you even as you laugh at its farcical absurdities. Certainly the Sycamore family is absurd. Mrs Sycamore (who began to write plays one day eight years ago when a typewriter was delivered to the house by mistake) is given to declaim lines from her scripts in mid-conversation - for example, 'Kenneth, my virginity is a priceless thing to me]' She keeps nibbles in a skull. Mr Sycamore, a scientific experimenter, keeps causing explosions in the cellar. Their daughter, Essie, practises ballet in the living-room, and her husband, Ed, shoves anarchist/Trotskyist slogans in his candy-deliveries because they amuse him. Grandpa has been avoiding paying income tax by claiming to be dead. Visitors include an alcoholic actress, a Russian ballet teacher and one of those White Russian aristocrats who are currently earning their livings by serving in restaurants. ('Who was that?' 'The Grand Duchess Olga Katrina. She's just fixing the dinner.') Amid all these crazies, Alice, the Sycamores' other daughter, is a jewel of graceful normality. (In this context, she is as odd as the niece in The Munsters.) And the polite/prim guests are her in-laws - who no sooner come to call than they find themselves carted off, with everyone else, to jail by the cops. At the King's Head, Islington, the play is delectable - both funny and touching. Nothing about Martin Connor's staging is perfect; the members of the large cast are either miscast or limited or weak in American accents; and, of course, the tiny stage is so cramped that the actors have to shift a table before they can line up to take curtain-calls at the end. But so what? The play is simply honey; and everyone performs it with such perfectly good intentions that audience and players are caught up together in a conspiracy of mirth and affection.</p>

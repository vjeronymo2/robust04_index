			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Aiming to follow a new seam - Michael Smith and Robert Peston consider plans to give Geevor, the former tin mining company now a shell, a new lease of life SHAREHOLDERS in Geevor, one of the UK's oldest mining companies, are a long-suffering group. They have provided money several times in recent years with little to show for it, the last when they took up Pounds 1.25m of loan notes to launch an unresolved court case against a bank which withdrew banking facilities. But holders of the equity and loan notes can celebrate yesterday's disclosure of plans to turn the company from the shell it has become into an ambitious coal mining company with the assistance of Mr Malcolm Edwards, the former British Coal commercial director who is to become Geevor's chairman. From the middle of next month they should be able to trade their shares on the stock market for the first time since they were suspended 18 months ago. There is a reasonable chance that the shares will rise from the 4.75p suspension price if some of Mr Edwards' bids for five British Coal pits prove successful and he can persuade the market that he can make money out of them. He has some hard talking to do, however. The pits he has bid for have been rejected by British Coal. There has not been a rush of takers for the 19 pits put out to licence by the corporation, which has received about a dozen bids for eight pits. Five of the bids are from Mr Edwards and another five are from RJB Mining. Mr Edwards' confidence stems from his belief that the pits can be profitable if producing lower tonnages through methods less capital and labour intensive than those used by British Coal. He also intends to aim some of his output at parts of the market other than power stations on which British Coal concentrates. He believes that British Coal is importing 1.2m tonnes of coal a year and that some of this could be replaced by UK coal from mines Geevor may buy. The thinking is similar to that of RJB Mining. Both Edwards and RJB feel the need for stock market funds to achieve the potential provided by British Coal's contraction. RJB chose a flotation earlier this year. Mr Edwards has chosen to move into the shell of Geevor. 'It is a relatively cheap and quick way of getting to the market,' he said yesterday. Geevor made its name over 85 years largely through its association with tin mining. It has been involved with coal only recently and even then at the periphery of its operations. It ceased tin mining in 1990 and now has minimal assets. Its main hope of survival in the last year or so collapsed when AF Budge, the civil engineering group which had been keeping the company afloat, was forced into receivership last year. Since then Smith New Court, Geevor's stockbroker, has been looking for a company with mining-related interests to take it over. This is because many of Geevor's institutional shareholders hold the equity in mining funds. Mr Edwards is not taking the company over - his eventual stake will be about 3 per cent, but his involvement will allow the restructuring necessary to attempt the transformation in Geevor's fortunes. He is putting Coal Investments, a subsidiary of Edwards Energy, his consultancy, into Geevor, to be renamed Coal Investments. Geevor is also buying UK Mining, a small Welsh company, the assets of which include the Cwmguili pit. Officially closed by British Coal in 1980 after 20 years of operation, Cwmguili survived under the corporation's ownership until last year under salvaging arrangements which enabled the continuation of mining. It is capable of producing about 100,000 tonnes of coal but needs several hundred thousand pounds of investment. Its creditors and shareholders will be given shares in Coal Investments as will Geevor's current creditors, led by the loan stockholders. Most of Geevor's creditors have already agreed to take Pounds 10 of new shares in exchange for every Pounds 100 of debt they hold, according to Mr Christopher Stainforth, an executive at Guinness Mahon, the merchant bank, who devised the reconstruction plan and is advising Mr Edwards. The deal is a comeback for Mr Stainforth, a former director of the broking firm Phillips &amp; Drew, who is rebuilding his City career following his acquittal last year in the long-running Blue Arrow trial. Following the restructuring, there will be a 16-for-1 rights issue to provide about Pounds 1.75m which can be used to provide the working capital for Cwmguili and, if necessary, funding for one of the five pits for which Mr Edwards is bidding. Mr Stainforth is restructuring the balance sheet with the aim that the shares will pay a dividend yield of a little less than 10 per cent within two years at the yet-to-be-determined rights issue price. Success in bids for any of the other four mines would almost certainly cause Coal Investments to return to the market for additional equity. Mr Stainforth said that the company would prefer not to fund future expansion with borrowings. At Coal Investments, Mr Edwards will be joined by Mr Brian Nicholls, 53, a former British Coal employee who has worked in Australia for the last 22 years. He will be director in charge of mining operations. Mr David Howard, 40, formerly of Ernst and Young will join as finance director.</p>

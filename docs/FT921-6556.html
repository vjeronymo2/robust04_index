			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / International Company News: Celsius in Dollars 42m ordnance deal CELSIUS, the Swedish state-owned industrial group, is to acquire Nobel Industries' half-share in Swedish Ordnance, the armament company, for SKr250m (Dollars 42.1m). The deal will transform Celsius into Sweden's leading military equipment manufacturer with an annual turnover of nearly SKr13bn, a capital base of SKr2.8bn and liquidity of SKr4.3bn. Swedish Ordnance was established at the end of 1990 as a joint partnership between the Bofors division of Nobel and FFV, the state-owned arms company. It makes advanced weapon systems for tanks, anti-aircraft equipment, naval vessels as well as battle vehicles, and employs 6.300 people. Last year, its sales totalled SKr4.7bn. Celsius includes the Kockums group of marine technology products, including submarines and surface combat ships which account for some 60 per cent of its business activities. As part of the deal, Celsius and Nobel industries have also agreed to spend SKr375m on restructuring the Swedish Ordnance's defence equipment activities. The company is also being provided with SKr600m in risk capital. 'Swedish Ordnance has now achieved the economic conditions to carry through the structural measures that have been agreed on,' said Mr Olof Lund, Celsius's chief executive. The company has an order book totalling SKr9bn, he said. Mr Lund said there were now real possibilities of expanding arms sales abroad and establishing closer co-operation with foreign defence industries. Celsius is one of the state companies awaiting privatisation.</p>

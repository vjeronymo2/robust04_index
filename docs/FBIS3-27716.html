			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Recent news on the alleged abuse of Thai  prisoners in a Laos jail is worrying for two reasons. Firstly,  there is the concern on a personal, humanitarian level for the  welfare of approximately 100 Thai prisoners. Secondly, there is  the worry about what the story, if substantiated, could do for  Thai-Lao relations at this crucial juncture.    According to a former Thai prisoner who was held for a short  period in the Pakse jail in Champassak in Laos, as many as 100  Thai prisoners have died due to cruelty and neglect. The man  talked of the inhumane conditions and treatment the Thais face  at the hands of their Lao captors. The former prisoner accused  the Laotian authorities of chaining the Thai prisoners up and of  providing only poor food each day.    Humanitarian concerns aside, this type of news does little  to  help the relationship between Thailand and Laos at this  important time. [passage omitted]    Yet under the surface many of the old animosities remain.  Racism, in terms of the relationship between Thai and ethnic  Lao, is still a problem in both countries. This is aside from  the clash between the Marxist ideology pursued by the government  in Vientiane and the democratic and free market ideals of  Bangkok.    The niggling animosities are partly a product of struggle  and  competition over the centuries, and partly due to a dislike of  people considered outsiders.    Many people in government and private circles in Laos fear  being swamped by everything Thai. Not only are Thai companies  and businessmen making major inroads into Laos with their  products and services, but Thai culture as a whole, brought by  the mass media, is being lapped up by many Laotian people who  have televisions, radios and cassette recorders. Modern Thai  culture -- a cross between Thai and Western influence -- is  having a significant effect on a country which has very limited  forms of modern entertainment and is only just emerging from the  pall of the monotony of communism.    This is a period in time when the relationship between  Thailand and Laos should be handled sensitively. The Lao and  Thai governments would do well to work together in a spirit of  cooperation to iron out contentious issues, including how they  treat each others' nationals. This not only applies to Thai  people in Laos, but also to Lao people in Thailand. Stories  about the bad treatment of foreign nationals do not help.</p>

While Longuet told Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata that he  hopes Japan will not yield to Washington's stance of force, Hata  said Tokyo will neither yield nor respond to talks supposing  retaliation, the officials said.    Longuet said in a 40-minute meeting that France will be  unhappy if major powers like the United States use force against  Japan and achieve major results in Japanese markets, they said.    Hata told Longuet he has repeatedly urged U.S. officials not  to take "unilateral" moves.    The U.S. Government reinstated the Super 301 trade provision  which gives it broad powers to impose sanctions against  countries it judges to have unfair trade practices.    Longuet was quoted as saying France is steadily trying to  promote exports to Japan and has made progress in certain areas  such as pork and helicopter exports.    Hata praised French efforts to promote exports to Japan,  such  as its business-boosting campaign called "Le Japon C'est  Possible," and said he is sure steady efforts will promote  bilateral economic ties, they said.</p>

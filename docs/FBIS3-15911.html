He noted, however, that in the regions where  elections had been properly prepared, they would be held  according to schedule.    Filatov believes that elections to the local governments  should be suspended because it is still unclear what authority  they would carry. The population must decide what their  government should be like, he said. In each region the  government should have its specific features, he added.    He expressed concern about the violations in the election  campaigns revealed in individual regions. Some electoral  districts are formed up on the basis of the national principle,  he said, and the electors' proportions are violated, too.  Filatov stated that if these violations were politically  tinged, a new wave of confrontation might rise and the process  of national reconciliation might be slowed down.</p>

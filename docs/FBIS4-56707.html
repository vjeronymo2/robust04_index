			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Guillermo Endara by Dorita de </F> Reyna at the Presidential Palace in Panama City on 8 May --  recorded]    [Text] [Reyna] Good afternoon, Mr. President. How do you  feel today?    [Endara] I must say I am happy and proud to be a Panamanian.  I am happy because when I went out to vote, I saw in the faces  of the Panamanian people the same pride I felt. People feel  proud of their democracy and freedom. That makes me very happy  as president and as a Panamanian citizen.    [Reyna] What institutions do you think helped you in your  democratic work?    [Endara] Many. I must mention the Public Force, in  particular the National Police. Five years ago, this body was  an Army with military training. Today, the police are  performing their duties by helping voters cast their votes and  preserve order. The Supreme Court of Justice has played a very  important role, not just because it has remained independent of  the executive branch. Not only that, when the executive branch  overstepped its duties regarding rights -- thank God, it did  very few times -- the Court ruled against us and we abided by  its decision immediately because we know this Court is very  responsible. I must also thank the Legislative Assembly.  Although I do not enjoy a majority there, it has supported me  when fundamental proposals, such as the Electoral Code, have  been presented. In general, I must thank government and  opposition parties because they handled the campaign very well  and enjoyed democracy.    [Reyna] What advice would you give the candidate who comes  out the winner, after all of the votes in the ballot boxes are  counted?    [Endara] To protect these democratic institutions we have  put  to work during this brief period of time, he should protect and  preserve them so they can mature. It would be criminal to let  something so beautiful be ruined. I would say this should be  the primary concern.    [Reyna] Mr. President, a message for the 18 countries of the  continent of America who are watching us through Cadena Sur?    [Endara] I thank all Latin American friendly countries for  the support they have given Panama in its struggle for democracy  and freedom. We have always appreciated this support. We expect  them to continue supporting us now that we live in freedom and  democracy so this democratic experiment can continue and we can  live in a free, democratic America.</p>

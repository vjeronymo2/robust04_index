			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BUYERS OF SALVAGED CARS GIVEN CHANCE TO RECOUP  </P> <P> The owners of 753 "potentially dangerous" salvaged used cars sold by the Hertz  car-rental firm can either get their money back or have their autos inspected  and fixed free, the San Diego County district attorney's office announced  Wednesday in settling a lawsuit.  </P> <P> All 753 cars are Hertz Corp. rentals that had been in crashes, then sold from  1984 to 1987 through a Chula Vista auto auctioneer without the document that  would alert buyers that the cars had been in serious collisions, Dist. Atty.  Edwin L. Miller Jr. said at a press conference.  </P> <P> Under the settlement of the suit filed by the district attorney's office  against Hertz and the Chula Vista-based County Auto Pool, Hertz agreed to buy  back or to inspect and repair the cars, Miller said. The pact could yield as  much as $2 million in benefits for the 753 owners, Miller said, calling the  case the "largest consumer-protection settlement" ever produced by his office.  </P> <P> Hertz executives and the company's San Diego lawyers, however, said the agency  figured the program would cost a maximum of $1 million and insisted that none  of the cars were, or are, unsafe. And one of the lawyers, Robert G. Steiner,  called the settlement "discriminatory enforcement, not consumer protection."  </P> <P> As many as 60 other private firms and government agencies followed the same  resale procedure Hertz did, but only Hertz was sued, Steiner said.  </P> <P> Although Hertz believed it was "free from fault or illegality," it agreed to  settle the case "as a safety matter" and to show it is a "very responsible  company," Steiner said. Besides, though the settlement also included the  payment of civil penalties and fees -- $285,000 by Hertz and $50,000 by County  Auto Pool, or $335,000 -- to the district attorney's office and to the  Department of Motor Vehicles, it was still more economical than years of  litigation, Steiner said.  </P> <P> According to the suit, Hertz sold wrecked cars from its California fleet  through County Auto Pool, unlawfully passing along with each a certificate of  title -- the familiar DMV "pink sheet" -- that provided no clue that the cars  were salvage vehicles.  </P> <P> California law says a car that has been so banged up in a crash that the owner  finds it uneconomical to repair must be sold not with the "pink sheet" but with  a "salvage certificate," which lets buyers know they are buying a damaged car,  Deputy Dist. Atty. Clifford P. Dobrin said.  </P> <P> The cars suffered "frame damage, brake damage, steering damage -- that sort of  thing," a DMV investigator, John Acuna, said at the press conference.  </P> <P> About 1,040 Hertz cars that should have had salvage certificates were sold  through County Auto Pool from July 1, 1984, through June 30, 1987, the suit  said. Of those, 753 still do not have the salvage certificate, Miller said.  </P> <P> Hertz contended that the law originally required only insurance companies to  obtain salvage certificates before sale. The law has been amended several  times, but, until 1987, it was unclear whether private and fleet owners also  had to obtain salvage certificates, the company said in a statement.  </P> <P> Because the law was fuzzy, Hertz did not believe the cars it sold through  County Auto Pool during those three years fit the definition of salvage  vehicles, the statement said.  </P> <P> Since the law was changed in 1987 to specify that fleet owners must apply for  salvage certificates, all damaged Hertz vehicles have been sold with that  document, the statement said.  </P> <P> There is "no indication" that autos Hertz sold through its own used car lots  from 1984 through 1987 were in any way defective or that any cars other than  Hertz autos sold then through County Auto Pool were lacking the correct  documents, Miller said.  </P> <P> Although Miller repeatedly said at the press conference and in a statement  distributed to reporters that the 753 remaining cars could be unsafe, he  conceded that his office has "no evidence of injury" to drivers or passengers.  </P> <P> Hertz lawyer Steiner adamantly denied that any of the cars were dangerous.  "There are no reports of unsafe cars on the road arising from these sales,"  Steiner said.  </P> <P> Owners of the 753 cars will be receiving a letter from Hertz in the next 60  days outlining the repair or buy-back plan, Miller said.  </P></p>

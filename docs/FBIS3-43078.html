			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Pokrovskiy: ``The Academy Again Demands </F> Saltykov's Blood'']    [Text] From what we see on the television and read in the  newspapers we know that Yuriy Osipov, president of the Russian  Academy of Sciences, is extremely concerned with the financial  situation of academic science and is especially upset by the  circumstance that an individual item ``Russian Academy of  Sciences,'' the backbone of Russian fundamental science, has  disappeared in the draft budget for 1994.    Yuriy Osipov blames the loss of the item directly on two  Borises: Boris Fedorov, Minister of Finance, and Boris Saltykov,  Minister of Science and Technical Policy. In the opinion of the  RAN (Russian Academy of Sciences) Presidium, which was expressed  on 14 December in an appeal of the academicians to Boris  Yeltsin, these two ministers are intentionally and  systematically destroying the Academy. A resolution of the RAN  Presidium dated 21 December already contains a threat of public  denunciation of the mentioned Borises.    In the appeal to the president the indignant scientists  proposed that an end be put to this disgraceful situation and  that all fundamental research in the country be conveyed to the  oversight of the Academy of Sciences and that the Ministry of  Science and Technical Policy be eliminated. The leaders of the  Academy are by no means submitting this appeal for the first  time. But for the first time all these conversations are no  longer confined to the offices and are reaching a broad public.  And perhaps for the first time the ``immortals'' are quite close  to their desired objective. The dogfight has ended and war has  been declared.    The Ministry of Science and Technical Policy is being  bombarded with angry telephone calls: ``How could you? How dare  you leave academic science without funds for its existence?''  Andrey Fonotov, the deputy minister, shrugs his shoulders in  perplexity. In his opinion the panic arose due to a  misunderstanding.    ``We thought that this matter was settled long ago. After  all, the new draft of the budget in which this item is missing  was sent out to all interested departments last summer. And it  was not the Academy, but we who drew the attention of the  Ministry of Finance to this detail. The draft was very inept and  we sent it back with a great many critical comments; on 28  October the ministry agreed with our criticism and the Academy  item was returned to its rightful place. It is strange that  Yuriy Osipov was not interested in learning the true status of  matters from the Minister of Science and Technology before  dashing off one denunciation after another.''    But, from all appearances, the RAN president did not clarify  the status of matters because this was not in his interests.  Available facts make it necessary to assume that he had to have  a panic precisely at that postelection moment when Boris Yeltsin  announced an impending reduction in the number of ministries and  their personnel. The panic was necessary around any problem,  even if it be nonexistent. We find it difficult to believe that  the leaders of the Academy, with all their friendly  relationships to the president and prime minister of the  country, had no access to the last draft of the budget.    But the facts are as follows. Already on 14 September  Nikolay  Malyshev, an advisor to the president of Russia on science and  education, sent a memorandum to Yeltsin in which he proposed  that of which the RAN Presidium is now proposing -- conveyance  of all fundamental science to the oversight of the Academy and  abolition of the Ministry of Science and Technical Policy. Then  the dispersal of parliament occurred and the seat of Boris  Saltykov for the first time in many months ceased to shake. The  Minister of Science and Technical Policy as a member of the  Gaydar camp during this unconstitutional period was completely  untouchable. As soon as the elections had ended in the way we  know they did the Malyshev memorandum with the presidential  decision ``examine'' was laid on the desk of Yegor Gaydar.    The Malyshev proposals taken separately could scarcely harm  the ministry -- the accusations made so little corresponded to  reality. The ministry was accused of an excessive expansion of  staffing at the very same time when the personnel rolls were  being significantly reduced; due to low salaries people are now  fleeing from the Ministry of Science and Technical Policy. The  ministry was accused of working ``in the old style'' in that no  one there was occupied with anything but ``petty details and the  distribution of funds.'' But it is hard to call a ``petty  detail'' the organization of new structures of the state  scientific center type, which has literally rescued from  collapse several tens of very large scientific organizations in  the country. It is difficult to call work ``in the old style''  the method, completely new for us, for distribution of funds by  scientists themselves: reference is to the organization of a  Russian Fund for Fundamental Research. This fund, incidentally,  despite all the criticism directed at it, has invigorated much  neglected research. ``Instead of complaining,'' said one  scientist, ``we are now filling out applications for grants.''    In a preelection meeting with scientists Boris Saltykov  spoke  of establishing a similar fund for specialists in the  humanities, a Technological Fund, the possibility of  establishing a fund for payment of thousand-dollar stipends to  representatives of the scientific elite of the country. Now  everything may end in a crash.    The Malyshev proposals, supported by the surprisingly  similar  proposals of the RAN Presidium, multiplied by a precisely  selected moment in time, may still topple the minister hated by  the Academy. According to information from the government  apparat, a paper already lies on the desk of Boris Yeltsin  providing for the abolition of the Ministry of Science and in  its stead the organization of a department of science affairs.  Malyshev, naturally, is to be named to this post. He once was  the former Minister of Science and Technical Policy, sure, for  an entire month.    ``The ministry in its present-day form is not the most ideal  structure for leading science from a state close to clinical  death,'' says Aleksey Zakharov, a member of the Russian  Consultative Council of the International Science Fund, an  active supporter of science reforms, who more likely could be  called an opponent rather than an admirer of the Ministry of  Science and Technical Policy. ``The ministry is frequently  criticized and at times very correctly. Like any Russian  department it acts very slowly and each new thing that comes  along -- be it regulations on preferential taxes for  international philanthropic organizations or the setting up of a  new fund -- is dealt with only with excessive difficulty.  However, this is the sole department which is taking steps in  the right direction, something not characteristic of Soviet  administrative methods. If the ministry is abolished and the  funding of fundamental research is returned to the Academy  Russian scientists might as well put on mourning -- hopes for  improvement in the situation are low even without this and they  will decrease virtually to zero. Experience has shown that the  only thing which the leadership of the Russian Academy of  Sciences can do effectively is to ask for money. The Academy  Presidium is not capable of carrying out reforms making it  possible to conserve scientific potential because any of these  reforms lessens its authority. It is capable only of dragging  out the agony and making it irreversible.''    A short addendum to this article.    The poor Russian Academy of Sciences, constantly whining  about budget support, has at its disposal, for example, several  recreational facilities, including one held jointly with an  Austrian company -- the five-star ``Palace Hotel.'' Still  another five-star hotel is located on the grounds of the Organic  Biology Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, where an  automobile shop also is in operation. Just what is done with the  considerable hard currency receipts is unknown. In particular,  in checking the Palace Hotel one discovers unaccounted for cash  receipts of 860 thousand real American dollars belonging to the  Academy. It must be surmised that they were not very necessary  to the scientists or have been laid away for a rainy day.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA or the Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6926(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR parts 124, 260 through 268, and 270.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> B. Louisiana  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Louisiana initially received Final Authorization, effective February 7, 1985 (see 50 FR 3348), to implement its base hazardous waste management program. Louisiana received authorization for revisions to its program effective January 29, 1990 (see 54 FR 48889), and October 25, 1991 (see 56 FR 41958, and Corrections at 56 FR 51762). On September 22, 1994, Louisiana submitted a final complete program revision application for additional program approvals. Today, Louisiana is seeking approval of its program revision in accordance with &sect;271.21(b)(3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1983, the Louisiana Legislature adopted Act 97, which amended and reenacted Louisiana Revised Statutes 30:1051 et seq., the Environmental Affairs Act. This Act created the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ), which has lead agency jurisdictional authority for administering the RCRA Subtitle C program in the State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA reviewed LDEQ's application, and made an immediate final decision that LDEQ's hazardous waste program revision satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for Final Authorization. Consequently, EPA intends to grant Final Authorization for the additional program modifications to the State. The public may submit written comments on EPA's final decision until December 22, 1994. Copies of LDEQ's application for program revision are available for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section of this document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Approval of LDEQ's program revision shall become effective 75 days from the date this notice is published, unless an adverse written comment pertaining to the State's revision discussed in this notice is received by the end of the comment period. If an adverse written comment is received, EPA will publish either: (1) A withdrawal of the immediate final decision; or (2) a notice containing a response to the comment that either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or reverses the decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Louisiana's program revision application includes State regulatory changes that are at least equivalent to the rules promulgated in the Federal RCRA implementing regulations in 40 CFR parts 124, 260&hyph;262, 264, 265, 266 and 270, that were published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  through June 30, 1987. This proposed approval includes the provisions that are listed in the chart below. This chart also lists the State analogs that are being recognized as equivalent to the appropriate Federal requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

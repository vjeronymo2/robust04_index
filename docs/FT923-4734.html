			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mr Shaikhislamov faces up to his American dream - An exchange visit that is proving something of a culture shock WHEN MR Artur Shaikhislamov, a Russian poultry unit engineer, arrived in Iowa on a farmer-to-farmer exchange programme in early July, he was stunned by what he saw. American agricultural technology was impressive enough, but that was not what really wowed him. He was amazed by the trust between people and their sense of personal responsibility. 'How can people trust each other in this country? How can they make agreements? We can't trust people. It's not their property. It doesn't matter for them how good their work is,' says Mr Shaihislamov. This kind of market economy culture shock is the least tangible but perhaps the most crucial result of a farmer exchange that is being run by the Center for Agricultural and Rural Development at Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa. The programme, in its second year, is at present playing host to ten agricultural practitioners - farmers, agricultural engineers and agribusiness executives - from Russia, Ukraine and the Central Asian Republic. The programme, which also sends Americans to the former Soviet Union, is designed to provide links between Americans in the farming business and citizens of the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Baltic states who are dedicated to agricultural reform and establishing private agribusiness. It has received financial support from the US Information Agency, the state of Iowa and the university. It is also receiving assistance from several US farmers' groups, including the National Farmers' Organization. On the CIS and Baltics side, support has come from various state governments and their agrarian academies, national spin-offs from the old Soviet Lenin All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Last year, 25 people from the CIS and the Baltics came to the US and 25 Americans returned the visits. This year, the exchange has risen to 40 from each side. The university intends to continue the programme and foresees useful cross-fertilisation with some of its other activities, such as research exchanges and a new programme to establish agribusiness demonstration centres in the CIS. While it would seem peculiar that Americans would want to assist those who might one day become some of their fiercest competitors in international agricultural trade, the farmers involved in the programme seem to want to play a part, however small, in burying the Cold War and helping those, who while they might compete in some areas of trade, could also one day be good customers. Mr DeVere Noakes, a farmer who offered to host a Soviet farmer, puts it this way: 'I firmly believe if we are ever to solve international misunderstandings it will be done at the common person's level. For people everywhere have the same basic desire we do; to have a family, make a living, be safe from harm and live peacefully'. Mr William Meyers of ISU says that while some American farmers object to lending a helping hand abroad many others believe that by cultivating relationships with countries that are developing their agricultural businesses they will able to hatch some eventual commercial ties. They also believe that if they do not foster such links, others, particularly the Europeans, will. The programme has already born commercial fruit. One joint venture has sprung from the 1991 exchange. While it may seem inappropriate that CIS and Baltic farmers be exposed to high technology farming (when it is unlikely that they will be able to replicate such methods, at least in the near future), Mr Meyers does not think this will be a source of frustration for them when they return. He emphasises that far more important than technology - about which many are fairly sophisticated, even if they cannot afford to buy it - is learning about farm management decision-making. While their technical knowledge may be good, seeing how decisions are made about costs, prices and how to come out ahead in earnings is more valuable, says Mr Meyers. Mr Shaikhislamov, who is the chief engineer at the Sredneuralskaya poultry enterprise near Sverdlovsk in the Russian region of Yekaterinburg, is living his dream. He taught himself English through two years of night study so that he might one day be able to travel to see western agricultural methods. His hosts are Mr Craig Herrig and his wife Cathy, who with Mr Herrig's brother and sister-in-law run two turkey farms. The four Herrigs produce 350,000 tonnes of meat a year; Mr Shaikhislamov's enterprise produces 750,000 tonnes a year with 500 people. Most of those, admittedly, work in the hatchery, feedmill and a slaughterhouse, but Mr Shaikhislamov says that some 100 people work in the raising segment, which is comparable with the Herrigs' operation. The Herrigs, who say they volunteered to host a Russian visitor because it would be 'fun and educational', are often bewildered by what they are learning of thew inefficiency of Russian poultry production. The American family does not farm as an independent producer but works on contract raising turkeys for a large poultry processor. This type of scheme has given a whole new set of ideas to their guest. But the older generation is still in charge and minds are resistant to change. Making money is still regarded as a dirty business. 'I can understand what we can do. I just don't understand how we can persuade people,' says Mr Shaikhislamov. 'American support would mean a lot to make the case.' And therein perhaps lies the ultimate value of such an exchange programme.</p>

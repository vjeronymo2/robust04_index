			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Philippine group takes over airline A CONSORTIUM led by prominent local business groups yesterday won control of Philippine Airlines (PAL), the biggest state company to be auctioned under the government's privatisation programme. The group, led by AB Capital and Investment Corporation which has links with the Soriano family-controlled Asian Bank and runs the San Miguel beer and food conglomerate, offered a winning bid of Dollars 368m (Pounds 205m), including a local-currency cash component equivalent to Dollars 150m. The AB Capital consortium includes Philippine Bank of Commerce, headed by Mr Antonio Cojuangco, president of Philippine Long Distance Telephone and a relative of President Corazon Aquino. The other partners are International Container Terminal Services, controlled by the Soriano and Razon families; venture-capital firm Hambrecht and Quist, and the Armed Forces of the Philippines Retirement and Separation Benefits System. The winning group, which expects to take over management of the flag-carrier by March, has contracted Korean Air Lines for two years to provide 'general consultancy advice' towards improving operations. Korean Air has no equity in the group. Others in the bidding were Philippine Commercial International Bank, which had American Airlines as consultant, and another group led by UBP Capital, which had links with British Airways. AB Capital won 67 per cent of PAL's outstanding capital stock, leaving the government's holdings at 13 per cent. Two other state institutions, Government Service Insurance System and National Development Company, still have 15 per cent and 5 per cent stakes, respectively. The privatisation plan calls for sale of 5 per cent of the remaining government holdings to PAL employees this year. Mr Filomeno Francisco, AB Capital's executive vice-president, said his group wanted 'to take over as soon as possible' and 'restore PAL's position as Asia's premier airline'. PAL which had been incurring losses for the past 10 years, posted unaudited net profits of 1.11bn pesos (Pounds 24m), in the April-December period last year, reversing a loss of 1.65bn pesos the year before. Sources in the winning consortium said a return-on-investment performance of up to 30 per cent within two years of the group's takeover would be possible if certain operating and supply procurement procedures were changed. Mr Feliciano Belmonte, PAL's incumbent president, said the new group might want to expand operations rather than retrench. Among PAL's assets are unutilised entitlements to certain routes. Of its options of 24 flights on the profitable trans-Pacific route, PAL uses only about half. Mr Jesus Estanislao, the finance secretary and chairman of the bidding committee, said he was 'pleasantly surprised' over the auction results. Last-minute criticism from opposition politicians and from the state Commission on Audit earlier threatened further to delay the privatisation, which had been on the drawing-board since 1987.</p>

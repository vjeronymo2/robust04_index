			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Business and the Law: Spate of actions against City law firms - Legal briefs A spate of legal actions against City law firms has raised fears that the US trend towards suing lawyers and accountants - as the best available source of compensatory damages when deals go wrong - is about to cross the Atlantic. Yeoman International, an Irish leasing company, has settled its Pounds 115m action against Linklaters &amp; Paines and merchant bank S G Warburg arising out of the offers made by Yeoman for CLF Holdings, a British leasing company, in December 1988. Linklaters says it did not pay any money to either Warburg or Yeoman in settlement. Barclays de Zoete Wedd has issued a writ against Clifford Chance alleging negligence on a deal involving the failed financial conglomerate, British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings; and Simmons &amp; Simmons is being sued for Pounds 50m by Banque Bruxelles Lambert for alleged negligence in the handling of a property deal. And although no writs have been issued, Allen &amp; Overy and Clifford Chance are believed to be footing the bills for investigations by Freshfields and Lovell White Durrant into advice given by the firms to the troubled Queens Moat Houses hotels group. The problem came to light when Allen &amp; Overy realised it had made an error in interpreting QMH's articles of association in 1993 and that Clifford Chance may have made the same error in 1989.</p>

			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SAVVY TRAVELER: IF YOU HAVE THE MONEY, THEY HAVE THE RENTAL CAR;  </P> <P> AUTOMOBILES: RENTING A CAR CAN BE MORE FUN THAN EVER THESE DAYS, WITH AN  EXPANDING CHOICE THAT INCLUDES MERCEDES-BENZES, PORSCHES AND EVEN ROLLS-ROYCES.  </P> <P> Tired of the same compact car each time you need to rent an automobile on a  trip? If you're willing to pay the extra tariff, the business of renting a car  is getting to be a little more fun.  </P> <P> All across the country, rental fleets are being upgraded. Luxury cars and  exotic sports cars are being offered at more and more outlets.  </P> <P> Budget Rent-A-Car has a luxury line of automobiles available at locations in  Los Angeles, Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Hawaii, Miami, New Orleans,  Phoenix and Washington. Cars include the BMW, Corvette, Jaguar, Ferrari,  Rolls-Royce, Mercedes, Porsche, Toyota Supra, Mustang convertible, Mercedes  Benz 190, Porsche 944 and Mazda Miata.  </P> <P> Budget's midweek rate, Monday through Friday, for many of these cars is $99 a  day. The Beverly Hills-based company's "Drive A Dream" fleet of cars includes  Ferraris and a complete line of Mercedeses and Rolls-Royces.  </P> <P> High-end vehicles like the 1990 Mercedes 500 SL rent for $395 a day. Ferraris  start at $500 a day, same as a Rolls-Royce Corniche convertible. But the  convertible Suzuki four-wheel-drive rents for $49.95, and the Mazda Miati is  $79.  </P> <P> Many special services are available upon request -- from pickup and delivery to  car phones and other services.  </P> <P> So who drives these cars? "Everyone from Aunt Rose and Uncle Sid to top-name  rock-and-roll stars," says Ken Kerzner, Budget's president and chief operating  officer. "People come here to express themselves, and to drive a dream. They  park their Chevy and see Hollywood like the stars."  </P> <P> In a city where style often rates a higher priority than substance, Kerzner's  expensive rental cars do very well. "People are either coming to drive a car as  a status symbol," he says, "or to wave their hair in the wind and get closer to  the California life style."  </P> <P> Sometimes it can be the reverse. Diane Keaton comes to Kerzner's place to rent  a VW Rabbit "so she won't stand out."  </P> <P> But other celebrities who seem to go for flashier rental transportation include  Warren Beatty, Michael Jackson and Diana Ross.  </P> <P> One word of caution: As you might suspect, there can be some hefty mileage and  insurance charges for some of these cars. For Budget's luxury fleet you get 50  miles a day free. It's 25 to 50 cents a mile thereafter.  </P> <P> National Car Rental has a special luxury fleet: American classic cars from the  1950s and '60s. You can find "California Classics" at its Los Angeles  International Airport location and "Florida Fun Wheels" at four locations in  Florida.  </P> <P> A few years ago National hired a special car buyer who traveled throughout the  United States for months. He attended car auctions, spoke with dealers and even  put notes on windshields of individual cars he saw on the road. Thus National  began assembling its fleet.  </P> <P> The rates for these cars are surprisingly reasonable: $49 a day and 30 cents a  mile. There's a small catch: You can only rent one if you are a member of  National's Emerald Club, the company's frequent renter program. (It's not hard  to join; a one-year membership costs $60 and includes lots of discount and  upgrade certificates.)  </P> <P> National rents the cars with the same collision-damage waivers and liability  insurance provisions as its other cars. "These cars were so well-built," says  National Vice President Michael Olsen, "that we've had few accidents where the  old cars sustained damage. And most people treat these cars with kid gloves. We  had one guy who rented a '57 Chevy to take to a wedding, and he polished it for  three hours himself."  </P> <P> For the time being you can forget about renting one of these cars -- or any  other type of "exotic car" -- in cities such as Omaha, Neb., or Canton, Ohio.  </P> <P> "We would never rent out a Rolls-Royce there," says Kerzner. "You need a place  with a certain magic, and there are few places like Beverly Hills."  </P> <P> At most Hertz locations, for example, about the most exotic cars you can rent  are a Cadillac Coupe de Ville, Lexus, Lincoln Continental or Lincoln Town Car,  each for $49.90. Among the selection of sports cars are the Pontiac Firebird,  Chevy Camaro and Chevy Beretta.  </P> <P> At Avis you can rent a Cadillac Coupe de Ville, Chrysler Le Baron Convertible,  Chrysler New Yorker or Pontiac Sunbird convertible.  </P> <P> But that doesn't mean the car you want is necessarily available. If you really  want to rent one, call Avis and ask for the "special services" desk.  </P> <P> If the company has a special vehicle available at another location they will  transport the car, or a similar model, to the requested rental location. Of  course, you should expect to pay whatever the company had to pay to transport  the car there.  </P> <P> At the airports in both Denver and Salt Lake City, renters can pick up Broncos  and Toyota Forerunner trucks for $54.99 a day.  </P> <P> At some locations, companies have tried renting "exotics" without much success.  Last year Dollar Rent A Car in Hawaii began offering BMW convertibles but the  program was soon canceled. The company couldn't make a profit -- even at higher  rental rates -- because of the high cost of maintenance, insurance and repairs.  </P> <P> Still, you can find some special cars to rent in Hawaii. You just have to be  prepared to pay for them. Ferraris, Corvettes and other exotics are for rent in  Honolulu. But rates can be as high as $300 a day (not including mileage and  insurance).  </P> <P> On the Big Island of Hawaii a company called Kona Convertibles will rent you a  Camaro Iroc Z convertible for $125 a day, or a Corvette at $175 a day. At  nearby Ciao Rentals you can get other convertibles -- there's the Mazda Miata  ($99 a day), Maserati ($225), Porsche 911 ($250) and, last but not least, a  selection of Harley-Davidson motorcycles.  </P> <P> Not every car-rental company is jumping on the exotic bandwagon. Alamo, the  fourth-largest rental-car company in the United States, has stayed away from  renting unusual cars.  </P> <P> But in Southern California, luxury and exotic cars are fixtures on the road. If  money is no object, you can rent anything from an amphibious landing craft to a  Ferrari or Rolls-Royce.  </P> <P> At Luxury Line Rent-A-Car in Beverly Hills, if they don't have the car you want  to rent they go out and buy it for you. Luxury Line Rent-A-Car has offices in  Los Angeles, Beverly Hills and at the Burbank Airport.  </P> <P> Luxury Line's 700-car inventory includes a full line of Mercedeses, Rolls-Royce  Corniche convertibles, Ferraris, Jaguars, BMWs and Porsches. "What sets us  apart isn't so much the cars we rent," says owner Marc Fogel, "it's our  willingness to go that extra mile."  </P> <P> Fogel's not kidding. A few months back he received a call from a rock star,  calling from an airplane. The singer would be in Los Angeles in five hours. He  wanted two white vans for his equipment, a red Ferrari Testarossa for himself  and a gray or black Rolls-Royce Corniche convertible for his manager.  </P> <P> A further request: The Corniche had to have two cellular phones, a fax machine  and a secretary. And all had to be delivered to the airport for his arrival at  5 p.m.  </P> <P> The vehicles were waiting when the star arrived. The bill for the five-hour  rental: $5,000. "The funny thing," says Fogel, "is that the rock star chose to  ride in the van. He never even used the Ferrari."  </P> <P> But sometimes, when speed is essential, a rented Ferrari can truly make a  difference. Not long ago a man and woman showed up at the Cresskill, N.J.,  offices of Roaring Roadsters, a rental company specializing in luxury cars.  They rented a red Ferrari for two days. But when they returned the car, the  manager noticed that the couple had logged more than 1,000 miles on the  odometer.  </P> <P> Where did they go? On a whim, the couple decided to get married, zoomed up to  Niagara Falls for a quick ceremony and -- quite literally -- zoomed back.  </P></p>

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Councils warned of 50% rise in premiums COUNCILS face steep in-creases in insurance premiums as a result of the demise of Municipal Mutual, the stricken insurer, a conference organised by local-authority associations heard yesterday. The increase could average at least 50 per cent from last year's estimated total of Pounds 600m, according to the Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities. Nine out of 10 councils bought their insurance from Municipal Mutual, which stopped writing new business and renewing existing policies last week. Municipal Mutual is still seeking to sell its home, motor, life and health insurance businesses and is again meeting claims after temporarily suspending payments. Mr Ken Kennedy, the risk and facilities manager with Surrey County Council, warned the meeting that insurers would increase rates and 'saw councils as ripe for the picking'.

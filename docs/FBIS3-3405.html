This has turned out to be consensus reached by the deputies  to the ongoing session of the Eighth National People's Congress  (NPC).    Necessary macro-control measures reflect the actual needs of  the current Chinese economy with initial features of the market  economy, some deputies held. Under such circumstances, it is  impossible to bring the economy completely onto the track of the  market economy at one stroke on the basis of decades-long  practice of the planning economy.    To some extent, market economy is in essence an economy  under  a developed legal system and characterized of fair competition,  no matter in a socialist or a capitalist country, said Tao  Dayong, a noted economist from the Beijing delegation.  Therefore, the development of a socialist market economy  without strengthening macro-economic control will give rise to  economic disorder.    Wu Shuqing, president of Beijing University and also a  renowned political economist, said China started its  modernization drive from a comparatively backward economic base.  If China develops its economy by relying on the economic  evolution out of its course, the market economy process will be  longer and harder and the economy will be in no way competitive  in the world.    Facing the imminent task of curbing inflation and the  disorderly capital investment, forceful macro-control measures,  including some administrative means, will be entirely necessary  and proper, some deputies said. In this aspect, the central  bank should effectively control money supply and stabilize money  value.    The deputies voiced unanimous support to the various reform  measures with regard to strengthening macro-control including  the introduction of the tax-revenue sharing system, which they  said is one of the most important elements in the whole  macro-control system. However, the system should proceed  steadily as it might exert more financial pressure on  enterprises, those in coastal areas in particular, deputies from  the coastal areas said.    To effect a less uneven economic development between the  east  and west parts of the country, appropriate macro-control  measures will help bring about a comparatively balanced economic  development towards common prosperity, a provincial governor  from northwest China has said.    While agreeing the macro-control measures will be of benefit  to the national economy as a whole in long-term prospective,  some of the measures will possibly cause temporary financial  problem in the immediate future, deputies from the  underdeveloped regions said.    For example, more investment will flow to coastal areas once  commercial banks to be established start operation because the  investment returns there is much better than in the west parts  of the country. As a remedy, some deputies from the west  suggested that preferential monetary policies be introduced and  that development banks with more competitive rates and  exclusively for western parts of the country be established.</p>

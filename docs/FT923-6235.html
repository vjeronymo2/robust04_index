			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Barclays rewrites its PR As the latest of the big clearing banks to shake up its public relations team, Barclays Bank has restored the job of polishing up its battered image to a couple of career bankers. Terry Jones, 47, has been appointed group communications director and Geoffrey Kelly, 55, has been made group public relations director. James Poole, Barclays' head of corporate affairs, is leaving when his contract expires shortly, and the bank has decided to restructure its communications staff and recruit from within rather than hire another outside pr expert. Jones, who joined Barclays in 1982 and is European director, will have overall responsibility for the group's public relations, investor relations and employee communications. Kelly, currently corporate communications director at BZW, the investment banking arm, will have direct responsibility for the group's public relations functions, and will be Poole's effective replacement. Although he will report to Jones, on corporate communications issues he will report directly to Andrew Buxton, Barclays' chief executive. Of the two new faces, Kelly is the better known. He joined Martins Bank - acquired by Barclays in 1969 - almost 40 years ago and has been dealing with the media for much of the time since then. When he was seconded to the information division of the CBI in the early 1980's, it looked as if he was being groomed for the top job on his return to the bank. But Barclays hired Poole and Kelly was moved sideways to BZW. In March, National Westminster Bank brought in S G Warburg's Simon Lewis as director of corporate affairs. And it remains to be seen who HSBC Holdings will pick as its London pr chief following its acquisition of Midland Bank last month. ***** A Frankfurt-born American of Russian parentage is to lead HOLIDAY INN's drive to find new franchisees in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Before joining Holiday Inn, Reas Kondraschow spent 16 years with Burger King, now owned by Grand Metropolitan. His last job at Burger King was as vice-president of franchise sales and development. Franchising will be particularly important if Holiday Inn is to achieve its European goal of extending its network from 127 hotels today to 200 by the mid-1990s. Of the existing hotels, 70 per cent are franchise operations. The company hopes to increase the proportion to 80 per cent. ***** Henry Pohl, formerly senior vice-president international of Fox Video in Los Angeles, has been appointed finance and business affairs director of POLYGRAM VIDEO INTERNATIONAL. Nadia Ostacchini, formerly international marketing manager, becomes marketing director.</p>

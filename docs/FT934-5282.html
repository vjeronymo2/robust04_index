			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (4): Gold fever, and how to catch it THE WORLD OF GOLD: THE INSIDE STORY OF WHO MINES, WHO MARKETS AND WHO BUYS GOLD by Timothy Green Rosendale Press, Pounds 21 388 pages It is 25 years since Tim Green became entranced by the mystique of gold and quit his job as editor of Illustrated London News to write the first version of this book. Time has not diminished his enthusiasm nor his ability to bring the world of gold to life with writing that has crystal clarity and huge dollops of humour. These flow from the anecdotes he has picked up travelling well over 1m miles in a global search for the gossip which is essential to an understanding of a deeply secretive business. He contends that during those 25 years the world of gold has changed more than in the preceding three or four thousand. He has seen the price of gold move from Dollars 35 a troy ounce in 1970, up to Dollars 850 in 1980 and back down to Dollars 350 in 1990. But he cannot decided whether the decision by international governments to end the fixed price of gold in 1968 or the subsequent radical transformation in communications was the more important influence. According to Green: 'It meant that, for many new players in the market, volatility, not stability, was the chief attraction: to them it did not matter whether the price went up or down, as long as it moved. The communications network brought everyone together, round the world, round the clock, and made the gold price a moveable feast.' The gold market has been dishing up futures, options, warrants in ever more exotic combinations to woo a new clientele whose prime concern was often a piece of the action without the acute embarrassment of having to take delivery of a single ounce. Green argues that this has left the gold market's future very much in the hands of the New York investment funds. Futures, options, swaps and related instruments today make up an estimated Dollars 10,000bn in investments traded both over the counter and on regulated exchanges. 'The gold market is only a side-show in this revolution much of the time,' Green points out. 'But mobile money can be switched into it in an afternoon if the mood is there, as happened in 1993 when high-profile players like Sir James Goldsmith and George Soros kick-started a rally that ran from Dollars 340 to Dollars 400, triggering not only a scramble for cover, but luring the weight of serious money from managed futures funds who saw gold as the play-of-the-day.' Such a wave can easily swamp momentarily the 'rather modest' physical market in gold. Green puts the total value of newly-mined gold each year at less than Dollars 30bn (at Dollars 400 an ounce). 'This is petty cash when one considers that Dollars 1,130bn is traded every day in currency markets.' Managed futures funds have more than Dollars 20bn at their disposal and think nothing of zipping in an out for 100,000 ounces of gold or more at a clip. 'Annual trading volume on futures thus dwarfs conventional physical markets.' Green also shows the way tactics in gold options and futures have become increasingly dictated by technical charting and computer trading which are all about 'buy' and 'sell' signals and give short shrift to the fundamentals of who mines and who buys gold. 'Detecting when those signals may be triggered is a part of a dealer's life. Every bullion bank has its in-house chartist, plotting support points, moving averages and momentum indicators or oscillators as they are known in the US.' Green tells of a colleague who ventured to tackle a fund manager after a New York seminar on the growth of managed money, with the suggestion that the mine production numbers might mean something. 'He had his head snapped off. 'I don't care if South Africa produces one ounce or one million,' the manager said, turning on his heel and leaving. His fund looks after a modest Dollars 650m, some of which may shift into gold from time to time, when the computer says so.' This book is not for that fund manager. Green gives us gold's fascinating history as well as showing us many of today's great gold mines through an expert's eyes. He explains how new technology - and a climbing price - spurred the gold rushes in Australia and North America during the 1980s. The broad message of this book will please the bulls. Green suggests that gold has come to terms with its new environment while the broad canvas of supply and demand looks promising. Gold 'has come through what could have been a traumatic transition from being principally a monetary metal to one principally used in jewellery, but with the added zest of continuing universal acceptance as a means of exchange and as a speculative or investment vehicle.'</p>

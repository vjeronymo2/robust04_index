			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Andrey Golubov] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 25 TASS -- The negotiations between the  Russian and Panamanian foreign ministers, Andrey Kozyrev and  Jose Raul Mulino, ended at the Russian Foreign Ministry on  Monday with the signing of the declaration on the principles of  mutual relations and cooperation between Russia and Panama.  "The declaration is the first document laying down the  foundation for our relations", Kozyrev said after the signing of  the declaration. "We have agreed to transform the  consulates-general into embassies so that Russia and Panama  should have full-scale diplomatic relations". He said Russia  closely follows developments in Panama. "We have a large  interest in economic relations with that Latin American  country," Kozyrev said.    Kozyrev noted that Russia welcomes Panama's role in the  development of the peace process in Central America. On its  part, Russia is vigorously participating in the Central American  settlement the beginning to which was put by the negotiations on  the Panamanian island Contadora back in 1983.    In his turn, the Panamanian foreign minister expressed  confidence in the development of Panamanian-Russian contacts.    Jose Raul Mulino is in Russia on an official four-day visit,  the first one since the two countries established diplomatic  relations in March 1991.</p>

			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Exorcising the demons THIS WEEK the Bundesbank, the tabloid press and the speculators vied with each other for pride of place in the government's new demonology, as sterling plumbed further depths and Mr John Major shed the unfortunate heritage secretary Mr David Mellor from his cabinet. Yet the weakness of the government and its excuses were simultaneously exposed by the impressive French attempt to tough it out with the markets. After massive intervention, the franc was well clear of its floor in the exchange rate mechanism by the end of the week. What it is, you might conclude, to have Chancellor Kohl and the Bundesbank on side, though that is not a lesson that Mr Major and his chancellor appear anxious to take aboard after their undignified exit from the ERM last week. A two-speed Europe was always implicit in the convergence criteria of the Maastricht treaty. It is now likely to become more explicit, as the Eurosceptics' pet demon Mr Jacques Delors hinted on Thursday, with a hard core of countries moving towards monetary union. But at what cost to other European aspirations, such as the Single Market? One of the more striking financial developments of the week was the re-introduction of exchange controls in Spain, Portugal and Ireland in response to huge speculative flows. Yesterday officials in Brussels confirmed that this did not contravene EC law. The wider worry, though, is that if the measures prove other than temporary, they might be construed as a serious blow to the 1992 programme in which the abolition of controls played a key part. Yet the countries that have chosen to retreat into this form of financial protectionism are responding all too logically to the pressure of events. The Bretton Woods system, to take an obvious parallel, did not operate without exchange controls. They were an important prop in a fixed exchange rate system where one leading country, the US, pursued its own monetary policy without undue regard for the other participants. Unless the peripheral countries were prepared to accommodate the policies of the central country, they needed the protection of exchange controls to prevent speculators exposing divergences in policy. Early warnings The ERM has operated on the same asymmetrical basis, with Germany occupying the central role. Since early 1987 the member countries sought to avoid realignments; and they were prepared to pursue that goal without the exchange control prop despite warnings from prominent members of the banking community about the potential difficulties. It was easy enough to accommodate the policies of the Bundesbank for the first four years of the experiment. But then unification substantially raised the cost of doing so, as German fiscal policy loosened. Meantime real exchange rate appreciation in Italy and Spain left the lira and the peseta looking overvalued; arguments raged about the sustainability of the sterling parity and the disinflationary thrust of the British government's policy in a protracted recession. One-way bet After their heavy losses in the 1980s, the banks were initially reluctant to run big speculative positions against the weaker currencies. But when it became clear that intervention to support the lira was on a scale that posed a threat to the German money supply, the bankers scented a one-way bet. International fund managers who had invested in Europe on the assumption that the ERM parities would hold felt obliged to hedge against devaluation in the weaker currencies. And when it emerged that a slanging match had developed between the British and the Germans, folk memories of a comparable battle between the US and Germany before the Bretton Woods system collapsed in the early 1970s suggested that there was risk-free money to be made by taking on the central banks. There are costs to Britain's exit from the system, even if the chancellor, Mr Lamont, seems decreasingly aware of them. But those costs, happily, are unlikely to include the nightmare envisaged by the trade secretary, Mr Michael Heseltine, who sees Britain as a potentially less attractive place for inward investment in the wake of the debacle. After the devaluation Britain is a potentially more profitable place from which to attack the European market and one whose domestic growth prospects have greatly improved. Over the long term, flows of capital are driven precisely by perceptions about the strength and weakness of the underlying economies. The one thing that might lend support to Mr Heseltine's thesis is the possibility that competitive devaluations and the reintroduction of exchange controls will so blunt the political impetus behind the Single Market programme that Europe itself might become a less attractive place for outsiders to invest. It is a thought that Tory Eurosceptics should ponder before inflicting further damage on a weakened government as it approaches the European summit on October 16.</p>

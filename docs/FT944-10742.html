			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Acquisitions behind rise at Wyndeham Press Contributions from three acquisitions made earlier this year helped Wyndeham Press, the printing and packaging company, double pre-tax profits from Pounds 750,000 to Pounds 1.51m for the six months to September 30. The purchases - of Westway Offset, B&amp;P, and Unity Paper Tubes - follow the acquisition in July last year of the Gait group. Turnover of the enlarged company for the half year was up by 85 per cent from Pounds 6.27m to Pounds 11.6m, of which Pounds 4.03m came from acquisitions. The pre-tax outcome was struck after a net interest charge of Pounds 141,000 (Pounds 28,000). Despite the issue of some 6m shares during the period, earnings emerged at 4.9p (3.3p). The interim dividend is raised to 1.4p (0.75p). Since the period end Wyndeham has acquired BR Hubbard Printers, a label and magazine printer.</p>

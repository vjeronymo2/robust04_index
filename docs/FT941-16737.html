			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Ruling on French markets The French bourse and equity options markets moved closer to full recognition in the UK yesterday after the Office of Fair Trading ruled that there were no significant anti-competitive rules which governed their operation. The Treasury will now decide whether to approve the two exchanges - the Societe des Bourses Francaises (SBF) and the Societe de Compensation des Marches Conditionnels (SCMC), operator of the French equity options market MONEP - as overseas investment exchanges in the UK. In a report to the chancellor Mr Kenneth Clarke, Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, notes two rules which 'could have the potential to produce significant anti-competitive effects - but do not appear to do so at present'. These two rules are requirements that members of the SBF have holdings of its share capital and that they abide by certain price limits and trading halts on the exchanges. Sir Bryan says he will keep these rules under review but that they are not likely to have the effect of restricting, distorting or preventing competition to any significant extent. Approval would make it easier for UK securities firms which do not have Paris-based operations to become members of the two exchanges. The two would become the fifth and sixth authorised overseas investment exchanges approved to operate in Britain. The others include the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) and the Barcelona-based futures exchange Mercado de Futuros de Renta Fija.</p>

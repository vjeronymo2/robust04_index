			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Administrators put Platt Saco up for sale as recession bites PLATT SACO Lowell (UK), one of the UK's biggest remaining textile machinery manufacturers, has been put up for sale by administrators from KPMG Peat Marwick. The company emerged in 1982 from the controversial receivership of Stone-Platt Industries with new owners, the oddly-named South Carolina company John D. Hollingsworth on Wheels. However, it has been hit recently by a worldwide slump in orders for its cotton processing equipment. Earlier this month directors asked a court to put the business into administration, giving protection against creditors while allowing time for attempts to be made to sell it or turn it round. Mr Mike Seery and Mr Peter Terry from KPMG, appointed joint administrators, are trying to sell Platt as a going concern. Platt had turnover of Pounds 10m last year. Its present workforce, following eight redundancies in the administrative staff, is 260. KPMG said yesterday that Platt had state-of-the-art manufacturing technology, and had an international reputation for its spinning and fibre preparation equipment.</p>

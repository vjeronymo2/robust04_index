			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Kirsanov: "The Routes are New, the </F> Problems Old"]    [Text] The adoption of the military doctrine  of Russia, which has a clearly pronounced defensive tendency,  compels us to rethink many problems not only of the country's  military development, but also of its economic development.  Improvement of the transportation system is one such problem.    Transportation has always had enormous military importance  at  all times and in all countries. In the history of war there are  many examples of failures of strategic operations, when military  campaigns and whole wars were lost because of the disruption of  operations or poor development of lines of communications. And  in Russia, with its great expanses, transportation lines and  railroads in particular have always played a special role.    Now, under new conditions, the Russian Armed Forces are  confronted by new tasks: To improve the methods of building up  forces in specific strategic and operational sectors with  limited manpower; to have mobile forces ready to go to any point  in the country on short notice; to assimilate methods of  strategic and operational deployment and regrouping which are  adequate to present-day conditions. It is impossible to assure  accomplishment of these tasks without full allowance for the  transportation factor. This must also be taken into account when  creating troop groupings in strategic sectors, in supporting  their communications both with military district  materiel-suppliers and with one another. There is a broad  spectrum of questions here: accomplishment of military transport  movements, freight delivery, technical support and restoration  of lines of communications. And all of this under the real and  difficult conditions of transition to the market.    For now, I believe, these problems are not being given due  attention. The reason? It is because military strategy and the  concepts of types of transportation have been developing  recently as if independent of one another. But not a single  operational plan is conceivable without allowance for the  transportation factor; in every strategic sector the  transportation system has its own parameters and at times they  are very limited ones.    Also, one cannot ignore the fact that in the last few years  the military sphere has been quite "dynamic," while  transportation systems have been rather inert in their  development. The service lives of the basic structures, roads,  landing strips, ports, and canals reach 70 to 100 years, those  of pipelines 25 to 30 years or more, and for locomotives, rail  cars and ships, 15 to 30 years. For this reason, the development  of the transportation system must be laid out for the future  with allowance both for economic indices and for defense  requirements.    For a start, let us try to compare the extent to which the  actual state of affairs in transportation corresponds to the  current requirements of the Armed Forces. In brief, there are  few grounds for optimism here. The Russian lag in terms of roads  has already become notorious. For example, in the U.S. the  length of the transportation net is six times longer and its  density 14 times greater than it is in Russia. This makes it  possible to have a 3- to 4-fold margin of through-put capacity  of transportation lines for creation of the necessary reserves  and conduct of planned repair tasks without disrupting the  rhythm of shipments. It is also possible to rationally  distribute the volume of shipments among the types of  transportation. Even when we had a more stable economy, this was  something we could only dream of, all the more so now in the  reform period.    Railroad lines and highways are in unsatisfactory technical  condition over significant stretches, and require  reconstruction. Volumes of road work have decreased recently by  20 to 25 percent. Wear of the basic stock in transportation is  approaching 40 percent. In the last twenty years there have been  reductions in the volume of deliveries of freight cars for  railroad transport, and this has led to intense aging of the  rail-car inventory. In track facilities, 300 thousand tonnes of  the total mass of metal frameworks of bridges require  replacement.    The situation is no better in other branches of the  transportation system. For instance, the seagoing fleet, which  in the years of the USSR was the sixth-largest in the world, has  markedly diminished. The share of it which went to Russia turned  out to be out of balance, and the age of the Russian vessels  proved to be much greater than that of those which went to the  other independent states. More than third of the wharf  facilities of Russian ports require repair and reconstruction.  According to predictions of experts, most of the  second-generation aircraft inventory must be written off by the  year 2000 due to exhaustion of service life. But because of a  lack of resources, the program for renewal of the aircraft  inventory is being delayed. The air disaster at Irkutsk once  again confirms the fact that this problem has to be resolved,  otherwise the number of accidents and disasters will grow. There  are also problems with pipeline transportation. The time has  come to renovate a large number of pipes and compression  equipment in a number of main sectors, since the questions of  safety of further operations will greatly depend on this.    Now other factors also affect the rhythm of shipments. These  include problems with energy resources, the change in  transportation economic ties, and legal questions. Difficulties  arise with respect to unhindered passage of cargoes over  territories of adjacent states without abridgement of the  interests of Russian shippers and consignees. In these cases,  the need often arises to divert the shipments in other  directions, or to switch to other types of transportation. Or it  is simply necessary to change the shipment deadlines. This is  one thing when the cargo is civilian, but quite another when it  is military, and often poses a potential danger during transport.    Even this cursory listing of the problems of the country's  transportation system suffices for one to understand that under  these conditions, it is quite problematic for the Armed Forces  to meet the requirements of military doctrine with respect to  the transportation factor. In what way can we raise the mobility  of units and formations? The choice has been made, and as I see  it, it has been made correctly in the prevailing situation. In  the doctrine, a course has been set toward priority development  of military transport aviation.    But this is clearly insufficient to raise troop mobility.  Military Transport Aviation can accomplish only a comparatively  small part of the deployment of the Armed Forces or the  regroupings they carry out. So we must consider the  transportation system of Russia as a whole for this purpose:  Rail, water and air transport and oil pipelines in combination,  in specific strategic sectors, taking into account the  transportation support of the particular theater of military  operations. Each type of transportation must have its own  reserves, and troop mobility must be achieved first of all  through these reserves. But as I see it, in normal mode Military  Transport Aviation must ensure against "bottlenecks" in the  transportation system and perform the most urgent movements of  troops and cargoes. But in general, defense transportation needs  at this stage must become the subject of special scientific  research.    Alas, there are no specific developments on this topic. And  not only the immediate future is vague. Military doctrine still  does not influence the strategic development of transportation  in Russia either. At present a special targeted state program,  "Transport Rossii" [Russian Transportation] is being developed,  in which the questions of its stability, profitability,  controllability, manning and much else must be considered.    It would be good if the questions of transportation support  of the Armed Forces were also fully reflected in it. In  particular, in the near future we must take a serious look at  questions of preparation of new points for unloading and loading  troops and temporary transfer areas, development of military  requirements on new transportation resources, and also on the  means of control, and the transportability of new types of  armaments and military equipment. We need the appropriate  approaches to the development of new high-speed roads. This is  only one example. At present, the possibility of construction of  a high-speed Moscow-Brest-Warsaw-Berlin-Paris rail line is being  examined. It will allow our country to join the Unified  High-Speed Net with a track gauge of 1.435 mm. But this in turn  will greatly complicate the technical support and restoration of  this line on the territory of Russia from the standpoint of  defense requirements. And even now many such problems are  arising.    The tone is now set by the economy in transportation  strategy. The basic volume of railroad construction in the  foreseeable future will go to the Asiatic part of the country,  in connection with the economic conquest of new regions. The  construction of the Berkakit-Yakutsk railroad line will be a  kind of beachhead for the future creation of a supporting system  of railroads in the eastern part of the country with possible  extension subsequently to Magadan and on to Chukotka, Kamchatka,  and the U.S. transportation system. The  Surgut-Urengoy-Igarka-Norilsk line under construction is  intended to provide all-weather communications with the Norilsk  mining and metallurgical combine.    Talk that the Russian economy will grow Siberia has already  become a cliche, but what will grow the combat capacity and  mobility of the Armed Forces?    And finally, under present conditions the problem of  "transportation and conversion" is a very important one. In my  view it requires the closest attention from the standpoint of  all structures and priority financing, because this is precisely  the case in which, by switching defense enterprises to peacetime  channels, one can both effectively influence the development of  the Russian economy and help raise the combat capacity of the  Army and Navy. The production of transport planes, dry-cargo  ships, tankers, road-building machinery and so forth  indisputably will most effectively raise military potential,  whose level is set by the military doctrine of Russia. I think  that this direction in conversion of military industry must  become one of the highest priorities.</p>

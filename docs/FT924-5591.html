			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Communist old guard turns the tables on Moslems in Tajikistan: A setback for Islamic militants MOSLEM LEADERS in troubled Tajikistan, the only former Soviet nation where Islam had become a key political force, appear to have lost most of their power during the last week in a stunning reversal engineered by ex-communists. The political shift comes just 10 weeks after Islamic fighters expelled ex-communist President Rakhmon Nabiyev, becoming major partners in a coalition government. The central Asian nation of 5m people will once more be dominated by the old Soviet hierarchy of politicians and industrialists staunchly opposed to the Islamic militants. They will call the shots behind the nominal leadership of the newly elected parliamentary speaker, Mr Imamali Rakhmanov, who until recently ran a state collective farm. 'Whatever they do, they're finished,' a senior diplomat said of the Islamists. 'This is the old guard coming back.' Analysts have watched central Asia, Algeria and Tunisia as laboratories for the world's new strain of Islam that, unlike the violent movements of the 1970s and 1980s, aims to gain power through popular means. In the five ex-Soviet central Asian nations, only Tajikistan has experienced a rise of political Islam. The new government could eventually help stabilise Tajikistan if it reduces the fighting that divided the republic into what amounts to independent cantons. The counter coup reinforces the growing power of irregular military commanders who, propping up the opposing political forces, are largely responsible for the ex-communists' triumph. The capital Dushanbe has been in turmoil for most of this year as the rivals tussled for power, while across the south-eastern republic dozens of private armies, some with largely criminal rather than political motivations, have clashed repeatedly. In recent weeks, militias loyal to the ex-communists have routed the Islamic forces, and now lay siege to Dushanbe where Islamic fighters are holed up. The strongest of the ex-communist commanders is Mr Sangak Safarov, who spent 23 years in prison for murder. Now Mr Safarov is a power behind the throne. Only after Mr Safarov and allied militias won a string of triumphs did Tajikistan's weakened parliament, dominated by the old guard, reassert itself. The parliament met for a special session in the northern city of Khojand, home of Tajikistan's former Soviet hierarchy. Last week the parliament elected Mr Rakhmonov as its speaker - effective head of state as there is no president. It has agreed to meet again today. Mr Rakhmonov succeeds Mr Akhbarshah Iskandarov, who led a coalition government propped up by its Islamic and democratic partners. Until last month, Mr Rakhmonov administered a state farm near Kulyab, the anti-Islamic regional stronghold. Then, with the backing of the militia leader, Mr Safarov, was named governor of Kulyab. The pro-old guard prime minister, Mr Abdumalik Abdullajanov, is more experienced than Mr Rakhmonov and an influential power broker. Enjoying considerable influence in the north, which produces two thirds of Tajikistan's industrial output, he could become an important figure. Having forced out Mr Iskandarov, the old guard is still in Khojand deciding how and when to return to Dushanbe. The little changed ex-communists know that when Mr Rakhmonov enters the capital he may provoke fresh fighting as defending forces make a final stand. Even with a more stable situation, the new government faces enormous problems. The winter will be difficult, as six months of fighting has prevented farmers harvesting crops in the southern regions of Kulyab and Kurgan-Tybe. More than 100,000 refugees from the fighting have swollen Dushanbe, under blockade for two months. Until now Tajikistan's paramount Islamic leader, Qazi Akhbar Toradzhon Zoda, was perhaps its most important political force. The republic's competing political factions were said to consider him a rational moderate capable of solving differences between political rivals. Mr Zoda's well-armed military force put muscle behind his words. A twin political force was the Islamic Renaissance party. The IRP, including a wing demanding an Islamic government in Tajikistan, was often at odds with Mr Zoda politically. But its equally effective army, partly supplied and trained by Afghan rebel leader, Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, fought alongside Mr Zoda's fighters. While Mr Zoda's influence will be eroded, a new Islamic leader has risen in importance. Mr Haidar Sharifov, chief mullah in the Kulyab region, is the strongest Islamic force in the new power circle.</p>

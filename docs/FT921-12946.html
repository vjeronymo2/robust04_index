			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Questions raised over Stolpe's links with Stasi A SHADOW has been cast over the political future of Mr Manfred Stolpe, prime minister of Brandenburg state, by Mr Joachim Gauck, the German official in charge of the files of the former East German security police, the Stasi. Mr Stolpe admitted this week to regular contacts over a 30-year period with the Stasi. A Social Democrat and east Germany's most highly-regarded native politician, he has frequently been mentioned as a future German president. He served as the senior lay official of the Protestant church in east Berlin and Brandenburg until the collapse of the communist regime in 1989. However, Mr Gauck said in an interview yesterday: 'Manfred Stolpe will have to do some explaining. . . . Who cleared him (for contacts with Stasi officers)?' Mr Stolpe's bishop, Mr Gottfried Forck, has said he knew nothing about the contacts. Mr Gauck stressed that the criteria for being a Stasi informer were not simply whether a person had signed a pledge and received money. The decisive question was whether the relationship was 'conspiratorial or open'. Both the Protestant church and the public would be asking Mr Stolpe to explain why he had kept his contacts a secret from his superior, Mr Gauck said. Despite the disclosures, however, Mr Stolpe has attracted widespread support from nearly all the political parties for his past humanitarian work in divided Germany. A spokesman for the Gauck Commission said this week that the Stasi files held nothing which 'incriminated' Mr Stolpe. The east German politician said on Wednesday that he would apply to read his own file. However, it is understood to have been destroyed by the Stasi along with the records of other prominent east Germans.</p>

			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Kuchma's task As the west dispatches firemen to small embattled nations throughout the globe, Ukraine is quietly emerging as one of the next major tests of the new world order. Ukraine must implement radical economic reforms and the west must help to pay for them. Kiev's capacity for producing disaster is enormous. The current, farcical power struggle in the break-away Crimean peninsula is one symptom of festering regional tensions in Ukraine, but if the economy deteriorates further Ukraine's separatist comedies could turn into the tragedy of civil war. Given Ukraine's location on the edge of a more economically robust, but politically still fragile, eastern Europe, civil strife would be bad enough. Yet Ukraine's proximity to Russia makes it even more dangerous. Given most Russians' view that Ukraine is a natural part of their country, the temptation for Moscow to meddle in a war-torn or destitute Ukraine would be as attractive as it could prove fatal. Russian involvement in a Ukrainian civil war would make it the most threatening conflict in Eurasia. Moreover, a Russian effort to reabsorb Ukraine would break Russia's tentative hold on democracy because it would require authoritarian measures in Russia itself. With the election of President Leonid Kuchma in July, a chance to avert these nightmare scenarios has emerged. Mr Kuchma appears to have understood that Ukraine cannot survive intact without the economic prosperity which only radical market reforms can bring. His task, paradoxically, may be easier than it seems because the previous, inept government inadvertently inflicted much of the shock of transition on the country's economy: energy prices are nearly at world levels and the deep industrial decline which all of eastern Europe experienced has already happened in Ukraine. If Mr Kuchma were to add therapy to the shock, he could emerge as a political hero and his country could prosper. But to do that, he needs western assistance. Ukraine is too important, and too potentially disastrous, for half measures. If Kiev begins reforms, Ukraine must rapidly receive significant western financing along the lines of the Dollars 4bn promised at this summer's G-7 summit. That money would help support the painful measures Mr Kuchma must implement: price liberalisation, budgetary discipline, currency stabilisation, liberalisation of transactions on the current account and rapid small-scale privatisation. By helping Kiev to pay for the energy Russia now sells at close to world prices and covering part of the large budget deficit that even a reformist Ukrainian government could not initially avoid, the west could give Ukraine a fighting chance. Ukraine will not survive as a country without radical economic reforms. Paying for them now would be far cheaper for the west than coping with a collapsed Ukraine in 12 months time.</p>

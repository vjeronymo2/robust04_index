			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> REP FEISTY DESPITE FINANCES;  </P> <P> THEATER: AFTER TAKING A BEATING LAST YEAR, THE COMPANY SHOWS ITS CONTINUING  DESIRE TO PRESENT THE UNDER-REPRESENTED POINT OF VIEW.  </P> <P> Even when you think you've got the San Diego Repertory Theatre pegged, artistic  director Douglas Jacobs and producing director Sam Woodhouse still have  something up their sleeves.  </P> <P> "A Lovely Sunday at Creve Coeur" opens tonight on the Lyceum Stage, and you may  think this quiet Tennessee Williams play is their attempt at playing it safe  after last year's disastrous premier-laden season. But, actually, this quiet,  rarely done, late work of Williams fits into a larger plan to present  under-represented points of view at the Rep. It calls for an all-female cast  for a story about a woman waiting for that elusive someone or something she  believes will change her life.  </P> <P> The company is presenting a wide array of voices this season: women, Latinos,  African-Americans and gays, among others. While "A Lovely Sunday" uses all  women, two other plays in the season use all Latino casts -- "Latins Anonymous"  and the upcoming bilingual production of "Man of the Flesh" are part of the  Teatro Sin Fronteras project.  </P> <P> Winding up the season will be the company's African-American musical, the world  premiere of "The Life and Life of Bumpy Johnson," based on the story of a  real-life black gangster who bankrolled the Harlem Renaissance. Earlier this  year, the company presented "Burn This," a play that gave a gay character a  major role.  </P> <P> "In the early days, all we were trying to do is put a play on stage and see if  anyone would come and see it," said Woodhouse, who started the company with  Jacobs 15 years ago. "Now there's a great deal more professional theater, and  the environment in which we provide theater has changed. Our commitment to and  our interest in multicultural programming has evolved over time. And I think we  have become more interested in investigating the mysteries of existence rather  than in expressing the hard-core realities of existence."  </P> <P> For Jacobs, part of that exploration comes in the form of plays such as "A  Lovely Sunday" and the play he will direct back to back at the Rep,  Shakespeare's fairy-tale-like "Cymbeline," another late work that is rarely  produced.  </P> <P> "I've always been intrigued by the late plays of playwrights," Jacobs said.  "They move into these interesting new realms that anticipate where later  playwrighting went. At the time when 'A Lovely Sunday' came out, people said  Williams was getting old, that he didn't know what he was doing. People thought  he was losing his powers. But it makes sense 10 to 15 years later. It was just  a strange kind of awkwardness that comes when the playwright goes back to being  a child, trying to make sense of the world and how the mind works. And then  people say that this was the real interesting stuff."  </P> <P> Jacobs has no apologies for the reception of last season, which he compares to  the initial reception of "A Lovely Sunday" when it was first produced in 1979.  He sees some of the work from last year as "some of the best work we've ever  done."  </P> <P> And he believes that time will be kinder to the season than the critics were.  </P> <P> "I consider fallow periods as a time when some of the most creative work is  happening. Some get excited, some get puzzled. I was happy with the work we did  on 'Albanian Softshoe,' " he said, referring to Mac Wellman's abstract science  fiction  </P> <P> comedy, which turned out to be one of the more controversial offerings.  </P> <P> "There were some losses in subscriptions. But there was also some  ground-breaking work," he said.  </P> <P> Still, the Rep is paying the price for taking those chances. The subscription  base, which dropped from 6,500 to 3,500 at the beginning of this year, must  rise to 6,000 for the company to be able to pay operating costs, managing  director Adrian Stewart said. As of this week, the subscription base had inched  up to 3,800 and single-ticket sales are at an all time high, which suggests  that one-time subscribers may still be patronizing the theater, but are  sampling the season cautiously, one show at a time. The Rep is trying to reach  out to those people who were not ready to subscribe at the beginning of the  season, by marketing what it calls "a winter season package" for the first  time.  </P> <P> In addition, by the end of the fiscal year the company must raise $726,000 of  its $2.1 million budget, which was reduced $300,000 from last year. Ninety days  ago, Stewart said that if the company hadn't reached that goal by this time,  the theater would be in crisis. On Monday he said the success of the Rep's  first three shows "bought us a little time," although he wouldn't say how much.  </P> <P> "But it's still of grave concern," he said. "It's a fragile situation and I'm  very concerned about revenues. We've still got a good way to go."  </P> <P> And yet, such crises are hardly news to the Rep. Even a cursory look back  reveals periodic ones since the company was jump-started by the 25-year-old  Woodhouse and 26-year-old Jacobs, who were former classmates fresh out of UC  Santa Barbara and the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia.  </P> <P> Three years after Jacobs and Woodhouse started the company, a writer questioned  the Rep's high rent (which at that time was $600 a month for the Sixth Avenue  Playhouse) and wondered if the city could support another theater when it  already had the Old Globe, the Mission Playhouse (now defunct) and various  college and university theaters.  </P> <P> Five years after that, in 1983, season subscriptions took a whopping 33% nose  dive, which some blamed on an eclectic season of little-known modern plays.  </P> <P> In retrospect, it becomes clear that a new era of competition was beginning in  local theater. In the early 1980s, the Old Globe closed after an arsonist  destroyed the theater, then reopened as a fully professional operation; the La  Jolla Playhouse was revived, and the Bowery Theatre, the Gaslamp Quarter  Theatre Company and the North Coast Repertory Theatre all opened.  </P> <P> By 1986, the San Diego Rep had pulled itself together again and moved from the  Sixth Avenue Playhouse to the newly built Lyceum Stage and Space in Horton  Plaza. But just a year later, there were reports that behind the scenes of the  company's critically acclaimed "Hard Times," things were living up to the name.  Rapid expansion and round-the-clock activity were taking their toll.  </P> <P> But 1988 brought the Rep a financial boon in the long-running "Six Women With  Brain Death, or Expiring Minds Want to Know." Coupled with a benefit by one of  the theater's celebrated alums, Whoopi Goldberg, and some unexpectedly generous  contributions, the theater found itself back on track. At least until it  launched into the ill-fated 1989 season.  </P> <P> Even so, you won't hear regrets from either Jacobs or Woodhouse.  </P> <P> If Woodhouse made a mistake with his commission and direction of the  disastrously received "Animal Nation" last year, he says the problem was that  the work was rushed on stage too soon.  </P> <P> " 'Animal Nation' was definitely an example of a piece of art that needed more  time before it was exposed to the demands of a subscription audience and San  Diego critics," he said.  </P> <P> The company is continuing to develop new work, which it will integrate in the  1991 and '92 seasons, Woodhouse said. The only difference is that the company  will give the work more time to mature in development programs such as  WordWorks, a 2-year-old staged reading program. A workshop series may also be  in the works somewhere down the line.  </P> <P> Jacobs and Woodhouse are hard to predict, idealistic and feisty. Clearly, even  in the face of financial pressures, they will not stop trying to be different.  And even after 15 years it appears they intend to ride out the challenges --  both the ups and downs.  </P> <P> "There are parts of theater that are repetitive. There is a lot of drudgery,"  Jacobs said. "You open a show and close a show and you always wish you had more  time for rehearsal. But when you can get into a rehearsal hall with a great  play and a talented group of actors, you never know what's going to happen. And  that's why you do the rest of it."  </P></p>

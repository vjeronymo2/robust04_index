			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Civil servants accept pay terms OPPOSITION AMONG unions to widespread reform of Civil Service pay bargaining ended yesterday when the NUCPS union agreed to accept this year's pay deal. The NUCPS had been the last of four Civil Service unions to resist deals that couple this year's pay offers - worth about 4 per cent to 4.5 per cent  -to the acceptance of increased use of performance-related pay and devolution of pay bargaining, in some cases to departments. A fifth union, the Inland Revenue Staff Federation, has negotiated a deal with the Inland Revenue that does not include a specific commitment to performance-related pay, but tacitly accepts that it will happen in the next year. The government announced last year that it wanted changes to pay agreements, but all five unions expressed scepticism and, in some cases, opposition. The NUCPS balloted its members, then told the government it would accept the pay offer, which added 4.1 per cent to basic rates, but rejected the pay bargaining changes. The government withdrew the offer, but is likely to renew it after the union's change of stance. Mr Leslie Christie, NUCPS general secretary, is understood to have told his union's executive yesterday that the government was likely to impose a lower deal on civil servants unless the deal was accepted. The NUCPS might also lose its negotiating rights and a long-term agreement that guarantees members a pay deal each year falling in the middle 50 per cent of private-sector settlements in the previous 12 months.</p>

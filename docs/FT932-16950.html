			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Survey of Spain (4): When a king can decide - Juan Carlos THE SOLE explicitly political role that King Juan Carlos is called upon to play under the terms of the Spanish constitution is to consult the leaders of the parties that have contested an election and select one of them to be prime minister. The prospect of a hung parliament later this year is likely to make the selection process a delicate task, writes Tom Burns. There is no precedent for such constitutional fine tuning. In the past the monarch's consultations were a mere formality because in each of the five previous parliaments of his reign one party, first the Centrists and subsequently the Socialists, had a clear ascendancy in the legislature. In the circumstances it is useful that King Juan Carlos' profile should be riding as high at present as it was at the beginning of the 1980s when his decisive support of constitutional legality saved Spain's nascent democracy from a right-wing military coup. Two recent developments have served to project the king. One is the publication of an authorised biography, written in the form of an extended interview, that has become a runaway bestseller. The other mood is of national grief prompted by the terminal illness over the past few weeks of Don Juan, Count of Barcelona, the monarch's father. In the book the king successfully walks a tightrope by being respectful about General Franco who placed him on the throne and also respectful to his father who was banished by Franco on account of his liberal views. The dual theme of the biography has something for everybody: Franco gave the king a free hand to govern after him as he saw fit and Don Juan, who was to abdicate his rights in favour of his son, bequeathed to his son both the legitimate line of succession and the constitutional ideas that he had lived by. The passing of Don Juan will be marked by a royal pomp and circumstance that was absent in 1975 when the king succeeded Franco. The king, who has lately spent most of his time at his father's bedside, has drawn up plans for a lying-in-state in the royal palace and a solemn burial in the royal crypt of the Escorial monastery which has hitherto been reserved for monarchs. The book, 'El Rey' by Jose Luis de Villalonga, is the king's own version of recent Spanish history and promotes him as the guarantor of the nation's stability. Don Juan's funeral will affirm before the Spanish public, for the first time in generations, the grandeur of the monarchy as an institution.</p>

			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / People: David Kendall to chair Meyer Meyer International, the building products group which owns the Jewson chain of builders' merchants, has filled the vacancy created by Richard Jewson's decision to step down as chairman at the end of last year. David Kendall, a former chief executive of BP Oil between 1985 and 1988 and chairman of Bunzl until September last year, was yesterday named as Meyer's non-executive chairman. Kendall, 58, will take up his new post from the start of next month. He currently holds a number of non-executive directorships, including the chairmanships of Ruberoid and Whitecroft. His appointment follows a board decision last year to split the roles of chairman and chief executive at Meyer, in line with the Cadbury committee recommendations. That decision led Richard Jewson to announce in September that he was stepping down as chairman and chief executive from the end of December. At the time Jewson, who became chairman in 1991, explained that while he did not disagree with his board's decision to divide the two roles, he did not want to become a non-executive chairman, having worked 'hands-on', nor did he wish to go back to being chief executive, his earlier post. Jewson was succeeded as chief executive by John Dobby, managing director since October 1991. Yesterday Dobby said the board, which already includes three non-executive directors, had been able 'to take its time' to appoint a new chairman and was 'delighted' to have found David Kendall. Donald Ford, 63, announced his retirement as a non-executive director following six years on the Meyer board and will be replaced in due course.</p>

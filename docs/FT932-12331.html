			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Pakistan deficit Mr Farooq Leghari, Pakistan's new finance minister, yesterday warned against the consequences of a big budget deficit and appealed to business leaders for help in solving economic problems, writes Farhan Bokhari in Karachi. During his first meeting with representatives of the Federation of Pakistani Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the country's largest business grouping Mr Leghari said that if the problems created by the deficit are not solved, 'our economy can go into a tailspin, if that happens, we can look for a disaster.' The warning came amid growing concerns over the current year's budgetary deficit, which is expected to exceed PRs100bn (Pounds 2.36bn) against an earlier target of PRs65bn.</p>

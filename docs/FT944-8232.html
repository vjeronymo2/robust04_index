			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / International Company News: VW revises Skoda production plan Volkswagen, the German carmaker, has agreed to raise the production capacity of Skoda, its Czech affiliate, to 340,000 units a year by the late 1990s from about 230,000 at present. The deal, initialled by VW and the Czech government on Friday, has won Prague's backing for a revised development plan for Skoda and includes a commitment to develop further the Czech car components industry. It opens the way for Volkswagen to raise its 31 per cent minority holding to 60.3 per cent by the end of December - including the conversion of preference stock into ordinary voting shares - and to 70 per cent by the end of 1995. VW will have paid DM1.4bn in three tranches for the 70 per cent stake - DM200m (Dollars 129m) to the Czech government for the acquisition of part of its holding and DM1.2bn in new equity capital for Skoda. Renegotiation of the contract, which was agreed in 1991 and gave VW management control, was forced by VW's withdrawal, without warning last autumn, from a DM1.4bn project finance facility for Skoda. The move caused consternation in Prague, which has been seeking reassurance ever since about the level of VW's commitment to Skoda. In early 1991, VW had said it planned capital investments totalling DM9.5bn for Skoda by the end of the decade, that it would more than double Skoda's production capacity to about 390,000 cars a year and would build a new engine plant. Under the revised deal VW has won approval for a more modest capacity expansion, and has dropped the engine plant plan. The current capital spending plan totals around DM3.7bn from 1991 to 2000, but this could be reduced if VW can find additional investment cost savings. Under the new agreement VW's plans include: Development of a second car range for Skoda due for launch in 1996-97, code-named A+. The larger Skoda range will be derived from the VW group's so-called 'A' platform, which will also form the basis for the next generation VW Golf in the late 1990s and be used initially for a new range of small Audis - the group's up-market brand - due for launch in mid-1996. A new paint plant at Skoda's main production facility at Mlada Boleslav. It will have a capacity for 1,300 cars a day, or 307,000 a year. A new assembly plant for the second car range with a capacity in the first phase for 70,000 cars a year, which could be raised to 90,000 a year. Development of Skoda's existing all-aluminium 1.3 litre engine for use in its planned car ranges and for possible use by Seat, the VW group's Spanish subsidiary.</p>

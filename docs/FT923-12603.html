			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Shell will launch Pounds 250m food shops SHELL, the oil group, is to spend Pounds 250m on building up to 1,000 food shops on its garage forecourts, it announced yesterday. The decision is in response to moves by food retailers in recent years to open petrol stations on their superstore sites. Oil companies have become increasingly irritated as food retailers have won a growing share of the petrol market. Some have now decided to fight back by selling more food. Shell said it was taking advantage of what it describes as a developing 'top-up society'. The company suggests that 90 per cent of consumers 'top up' every week in addition to a the main shopping trip to a supermarket. Petrol stations, Shell believes, are well placed to take advantage of such passing traffic by stocking items such as milk, bread, pet foods and hot and cold snacks. The concept of shops on petrol-station forecourts is hardly new - BP, Esso and Texaco also run them - but Shell is spending big money on expanding its Select chain. The company runs 350 Select service stores, and plans to open a further 650 by 1995. Shell is due today to launch a Pounds 2.5m television and poster advertising campaign promoting its 'most convenient convenience stores'. According to Gallup market research commissioned by Shell, a quarter of the average weekly grocery budget of about Pounds 55 is spent on 'topping-up'. Shell believes the trend will increase as more working women find they have less time to shop at out-of-town superstores. Meanwhile, the grocery superstores are hoping to attract more custom by selling petrol. There are more than 500 retailer-owned petrol stations in the UK. Last December the Safeway chain, which is owned by the Argyll Group, hired its own oil trader in Rotterdam in order to buy petrol at more competitive prices. Norwich Union, the insurance group, is refusing to insure new customers seeking cover for high-performance hatchback cars unless they are fitted with Vecta engine immobilisers. The company said the cars were three times more likely to be stolen than standard models. It had decided to make the immobiliser a requirement instead of raising premiums. A 10 per cent discount had been negotiated for customers in the cost of fitting the device, which would make the average price Pounds 360. Existing customers with such cars would not have to fit the device but would get a discount if they did.</p>

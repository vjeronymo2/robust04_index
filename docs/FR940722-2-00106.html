			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis and Conditions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Sections 26(a)(2) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act prohibit a registered unit investment trust and any depositor or underwriter thereof from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments are deposited with a qualified trustee or custodian and held under arrangements which prohibit any payment to the depositor or principal underwriter except a fee, not exceeding such reasonable amounts as the Commission may prescribe, for performing bookkeeping and other administrative services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Applicants request an order under section 6(c) exempting them from sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit the deduction of the mortality and expense risk charge from the assets of the Separate Account under the Contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Applicants represent that the mortality and expense risk charge is within the range of industry practice with respect to comparable annuity products. Applicants base this representation on an analysis of publicly available information about comparable products, taking into consideration such factors as any contractual right to increase charges above current levels, the existence of other charges, the number of transfers permitted without charge and the ability to make free withdrawals. The Company represents that it will maintain at its home office a memorandum, available to the Commission, setting forth in detail this analysis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. To the extent the CDSC is insufficient to cover the actual cost of distribution, the excess distribution costs will be paid from the Company's general assets, including the profits, if any, from the mortality and expense risk charges. The Company represents that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements will benefit the Separate Account and Contract owners. The basis for such conclusion will be set forth in a memorandum maintained by the Company at its service office and available to the Commission upon request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The Company represents that the Separate Account will invest only in management investment companies that undertake, in the event the company adopts a plan to finance distribution expenses under Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act, to have a board of directors, a majority of whom are not interested persons of the company within the meaning of section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, formulate and approve any such plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants assert that, for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, the requested exemptions from sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to deduct the mortality and expense risk charge from the assets of the Separate Account under the Contracts meet the standards in section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. Applicants assert that the exemptions requested are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policies and provisions of the 1940 Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

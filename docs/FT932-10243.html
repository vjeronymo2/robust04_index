			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Fields of frustration: China's economic miracle is fuelling an exodus from its rural heartland It's just not worthwhile ploughing the fields any more,' says Yan, a peasant farmer from Sichuan province in China's centre-west. 'We've got enough to eat at home, but no money to spend, so people are leaving their villages to find work. In our village, there are only kids and old people left.' Dressed in ragged clothes and obliged to sleep on the ground in Beijing's overcrowded railway station, Yan and his colleagues are part of a vast, surging army that involves what may well prove one of the greatest population shifts in history. The peasant exodus - according to official statistics at least 15m have deserted the land for the cities since the late 1980s - is sounding alarm bells, perhaps belatedly, in Beijing. For it reflects not only a desire by impoverished peasants to share the fruits of China's rapid economic expansion, it also reveals deepening disillusionment among the country's 900m farmers and their families over the slim benefits of toiling in the fields. Official statistics reveal that peasant per capita net income is Yn770 (Dollars 135) a year. This represents less than half that of urban dwellers. Agricultural production is also flagging compared with industrial output. Growth in 1992 reached just 3 per cent against 19 per cent for industrial production. The bleak outlook for peasant farmers, dependant on tiny plots of land, is the other side of the coin of China's economic 'miracle', based as it is on the success of new industrial enterprises in coastal regions fuelled partly by investment from abroad. This marks a sharp reversal from the beginning of China's economic reforms in the early 1980s when agriculture led the way and peasant farmers were held up as models of entrepreneurial achievement. Officials in Beijing say that after internal Chinese travel restrictions were relaxed it was inevitable that farmers would drift away from their villages towards areas where economic rewards might be higher, such as China's larger cities and coastal regions. The number of people affected by this economic shift is staggering. Mr Yi Yan Li, a specialist in migrant labour at the agriculture ministry, estimates that among China's 400m peasant labourers, about 160m are surplus to requirements. 'These numbers,' he said 'are equivalent to the population of a big country.' About 100m peasants have been absorbed in the past 10 years into township and village enterprises that have mushroomed all over China, but this still leaves a vast pool of under-utilised farm labourers which Mr Li described as a 'severe problem.' If the authorities cannot persuade people to stay down on the farm, or at least in nearby towns and villages, then problems of urban overcrowding - and the associated danger of heightened political unrest - might become overwhelming. Increasingly dissatisfied with their lot as the gap in incomes between city and country dwellers becomes ever wider, peasants have begun assailing local tax-collecting officials, sometimes violently. Authorities are especially worried about another consequence of the migration of peasants to urban areas - it has weakened the ability of officials to enforce family planning controls. In an effort to bolster birth control efforts, an additional 15,000 family planning associations have been established, but these organisations have proved intrusive and unpopular. Sharpening the focus of peasant discontent over the past year or so has been the sometimes protracted delays by local authorities in redeeming 'IOUs', or promissory notes, to farmers obliged to sell a proportion of their grain to the state. Peasant anger goaded the central government into bringing heavy pressure to bear on local officials to honour obligations. Nevertheless Beijing must share responsibility since it has been slow to transfer funds. At the recent session of the National People's Congress, the Chinese parliament, leaders were taken to task in private discussions over the dangers of neglecting the 'farm sector'. Wan Li, one of China's eight 'immortal' leaders - the surviving Long March veterans in the leadership - is said to have assailed Premier Li Peng over 'lukewarm' references to agriculture in his 'work report' to the Congress. Mr Wan reportedly summoned the ghosts of leaders of peasant revolts in China's history to remind Mr Li of the dangers of neglecting more than 80 per cent of China's 1.1bn people. He is also said to have pointed out to his listeners the vital importance of peasant support to the success of the communist revolution. In his parliamentary address, Mr Li admitted that agriculture, which he described as the 'foundation of our economy', was 'relatively weak', and noted that peasant incomes had risen slowly and their financial burden has been 'too heavy'. This was a reference to taxes which are not meant to exceed 5 per cent of net income and other local levies. Peasants are said to be paying on average about 10 per cent of their meagre earnings in taxes and levies. Costs of farm supplies such as fertilisers have also shot up recently as China has begun phasing out subsidies. China's budget this year provides for a 9.3 per cent increase in investment in agriculture to Yn42bn, but few believe that this will do much to redress a growing imbalance between the agricultural sector and industry. According to government figures, agriculture's share of gross national product slid from 33.7 per cent in 1978, when the so-called open-door reforms began, to 22.1 per cent in 1991. Recent forecasts of grain output have also painted a fairly gloomy picture when taken together with alarming reports of the 'loss' of at least 1.6m hectares of invaluable farmland to industrial parks and development zones. The official China Daily newspaper commented recently that grain production is likely to drop in coming years due to 'shrinking arable land and deflated enthusiasm among farmers'. Output this year is forecast to be 442.5m tonnes, roughly the same as last year. A target of 475m tonnes in 1997, outlined by Premier Li in March, is regarded as unrealistic, given problems of morale among farmers and slender rewards available from grain production on small plots of land. The authorities have been slow to recognise the dangers posed by deteriorating morale in the countryside, coupled with problems caused by the peasant exodus to the cities. There is little sign officials have worked out how to deal with the challenge, beyond expressions of concern. As the income gap between country and city, rich and poor, continues to widen tensions will certainly not diminish.</p>

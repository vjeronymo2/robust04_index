			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Staffing turnover in hotels declines ANNUAL LABOUR turnover in the hotel and catering industry fell from 60 per cent in the late 1980s to less than 30 per cent during the recession, says the Employment Forecasts Update issued by Hotel and Catering Training Company. The sector, which expects to create a net 150,000 new jobs by the end of the century, has a current annual turnover of about 640,000 people out of a total of just over 2m. That means about 13,000 people must be recruited each week to maintain employment levels. Several other sectors have experienced a rapid fall in turnover during the recession. A recent study by the Institute of Manpower Studies says turnover has come close to zero in many companies. The institute warns that companies should prepare for a rapid increase in turnover as the recovery continues. The hotel and catering workforce is expected to regain its 1990 level of 2.5m by 1995. A net 72,000 jobs are forecast to be created each year between 1992 and 1995 and a further 24,000 jobs each year between 1995 and 2000. The HCTC report predicts that restaurants and contract caterers will have the highest rate of jobs growth, with employment in these sectors rising 17 per cent and 16 per cent respectively.

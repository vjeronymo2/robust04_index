			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Honda's UK output of Civic to double Honda yesterday unveiled its new Civic small family car range for the European market. Next year, this will lead the company to more than double production, to around 100,000 cars a year at its UK assembly plant. Mr Kazue Ito, president of Honda Motor Europe, said total investment at its plant at Swindon, southern England, would rise to Pounds 700m (Dollars 1.1bn) by the late 1990s, with production capacity rising to more than 150,000 cars a year. Honda was seeking to increase its annual European car sales to 300,000 a year by the end of the decade from 164,576 last year, and a target of 200,000 in 1995. It aimed to raise its European market share from 1.4 per cent to 2 per cent over the same period, and would increase its European dealer network from 1,700 to 2,300 by 2000. Mr Ito said Honda was aiming to produce around half the cars sold in Europe at its UK plant, with the remainder imported from Japan and the US. Around 500 jobs will be added at its UK plant by the late 1990s from the level of 2,000 that will be reached by the end of this year. The five-door Civic unveiled yesterday, which will compete with European rivals such as the Ford Escort, the Volkswagen Golf and the Opel/Vauxhall Astra, is the second car to be built by Honda in Europe following the launch of the Accord at the end of 1992. Volume production of the Civic at Swindon will begin next month, with the car going on sale in some parts of southern Europe in December, in Germany in January and in the UK in March. The Civic is the first step in an ambitious joint production programme with Rover, the UK carmaker, which will launch a sister car, built under licence from Honda, early next year, to replace the Rover 200/400 range. In the European market, the Civic will replace the Honda Concerto, previously built at Rover's plant at Longbridge, Birmingham. Honda is aiming to sell around 60,000 of the Civics in Europe next year, while output of the new Rover 400 range at Longbridge will total more than 200,000 a year. The level of commonality between the Honda and Rover ranges will be around 70 per cent for the bulk of Rover's output, which use its own K-Series engines, but will rise to more than 90 per cent for versions using Honda's automatic transmission and 1.6 litre engine. Honda said yesterday that Rover had been licensed to produce five- and four-door versions of the new range, which will be Rover's most important volume car at its Longbridge plant. The licence would run to the end of the year 2000, but an extension could be negotiated. The UK-built Honda Civic will have a local European content of more than 80 per cent, with Honda and Rover using a common network of more than 200 suppliers. Mr Ito said the new Civic was 'the most important car' Honda had ever launched in Europe and would be 'one of the foundations' of its future expansion. The car is derived from the four-door Honda Domani launched in Japan two years ago. Design and basic engineering was carried out in Japan with some detailed development and testing carried out at Honda R&amp;D centres in the UK and Germany. Honda said it was achieving an assembly time for the larger Accord at its Swindon plant of 12.5 hours per car. The Japanese carmaker is negotiating with Rover, PSA Peugeot Citroen of France and other European carmakers for the supply of diesel engines for its European-built cars. It had no plans to produce diesel engines itself.</p>

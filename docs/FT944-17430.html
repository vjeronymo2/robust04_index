			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Homeowners pick direct insurers Direct insurers, selling via the telephone and advertisements, are proving increasingly adept at persuading homeowners to switch house content and structure policies, according to a survey by the NOP market research group. In the first six months of this year, more than half of those who took out a combined structure and contents policy for the first time did so through a building society, the survey shows. But direct insurers, in spite of acquiring only 4 per cent of all first-time customers, attracted 21 per cent of those changing their policies from one business to another. 'Consumers' experience with motor insurance has taught them to shop around for the best price. They are now using this experience in other markets - including household insurance,' said Ms Heather McAdam, director of NOP's financial division. She added that the housing insurance market was proving 'increasingly dynamic. Although building societies are still acquiring the majority of first-time customers, they are finding it more and more difficult to retain this business'. The survey was based on interviews with 60,000 adults. NOP suggests that if the current trend continues, societies could begin to lose market share rapidly. It also finds that combined insurance policies are becoming increasingly popular - evidence that companies are putting more emphasis on cross-selling and promoting combined insurance products.</p>

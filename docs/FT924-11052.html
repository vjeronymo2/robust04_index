			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Major ready to take on Tory Euro-sceptics MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday signalled his readiness to face down his Euro-sceptic opponents on Maastricht with an unprecedented move to set out his case personally to all Conservative backbench MPs tomorrow. However, he used a private meeting last night with a small group of Tory MPs to play down speculation that he will call a general election if defeated over the treaty. The meeting marked the beginning of a concerted government operation to head off the threatened Conservative revolt in next week's Europe debate. It followed a public warning by Mr Major to Tory MPs against 'isolating ourselves' and of losing influence in the European Community. Mr Major's decision to address tomorrow a full meeting of the 1922 committee  -the group that embraces all Tory backbenchers - was clearly intended to underline the prime minister's seriousness about pressing on with the Maastricht bill. Last night he was helped by pro-Europe Tory MPs agreeing to campaign more actively in support of the cabinet line. He will also be encouraged by Denmark's move to overcome the country's referendum result on Maastricht. It will weaken his opponents argument that he should wait until the Danes move before proceeding with the treaty's ratification. But amid a feverish atmosphere at Westminster, rightwing Tories were intensifying attacks on Mr Kenneth Clarke, the pro-Europe home secretary - accusing him of manoeuvering the prime minister into ratifying Maastricht with unnecessary speed. Earlier, senior cabinet ministers and government business managers met to discuss how to proceed towards next Wednesday's crucial paving debate. Downing Street officials said that no conclusions had been reached over how to phrase the motion for debate or on what shape it might take. A decision will be taken by the full cabinet at its weekly meeting tomorrow. Nonetheless, senior ministers involved in the talks appear to have backed what is believed to be Mr Major's preference for a substantive motion, rather than draw back from a head-on confrontation with the Euro-sceptics by tabling a technical 'adjournment' motion. In the Commons, Mr Major appeared to press his personal commitment to ratification and to castigate opposition parties for threatening to oppose a paving motion. His rigorous rebuff was paralleled by Mr Hurd who used a speech to the European Parliament in Strasbourg to challenge Labour's European credentials. Mr Hurd said the opposition's promise to vote against the government next week indicated a 'change for the worse' in its attitude. Danes seek compromise, Page 22 Parliament, Page 8</p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Members to discuss coffee pact's future Members of the executive board of the International Coffee Organisation begin a three-day meeting in London today at which they will discuss the organisation's future role, delegates said, reports Reuter. 'There will be plenty of time to look at the issue of what we want to do with the ICO. . . but I doubt it will be time enough to take a decision,' one producer said. Members have theoretically until the end of September next year to decide on the organisation's role after the collapse of difficult negotiations on a new economic pact in March. Delegates agreed to extend the existing administrative accord by a further 12 months to October 1, 1994, but were then shocked in September by an announcement from the US, the biggest consumer, that it would not accede to the extension. Its decision has been linked with a scheme devised by producers to hold back some supplies from the world market. This came into effect from October 1.</p>

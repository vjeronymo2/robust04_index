Pryor, 34, has  pleaded innocent to drug charges, saying a cocaine pipe police found in his car  belongs to a friend who borrowed the vehicle recently.  </P> <P> Police arrested Pryor late Monday and charged him under a city drug  paraphernalia ordinance after finding the pipe in the car's seat. Pryor pleaded  innocent to the charge Tuesday in Hamilton County Municipal Court.  </P> <P> Pryor, who has a career record of 37-1 with 33 knockouts, was world champion  from 1980 until 1985. Officials took him off the boxing card Jan. 26 after  doctors said his left eye was too badly injured to let him fight.

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Commission twists knife into UK The European Commission yesterday twisted the knife deeper into the UK government, underlining the limited scope of the weekend compromise on voting rights in an expanded European Union. One day after rebutting Mr John Major's claims to have received assurances on future social policy legislation, the commission issued a public declaration that the compromise was not legally binding. The agreement on rules for allowing a small minority of member states to block EU measures was struck at an informal meeting of EU foreign ministers in Greece. Yesterday in Brussels, representatives of the 12 sealed agreement on entry terms, paving the way for Finland, Sweden, Austria and Norway to join the EU next year. Brussels said that although this was a political agreement entered into 'in good faith', both Britain's partners and the commission could end any prolonged attempt to delay decisions by simple majority. The commission declaration signalled a much more robust tone after months of self-effacement, and it followed a row at a meeting of all 17 Commissioners on Tuesday. Mr Jacques Delors, commission president, was questioned closely about a private breakfast meeting with Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, last Sunday in Ionnanina. Mr Hurd was said to have pleaded with Mr Delors for assurances on social policy legislation in order to win support for the voting rights compromise later presented to the UK cabinet. These assurances were not forthcoming, and yesterday Britain was still seeking the tightest form of written guarantees it could get. Commission wrangling over how to treat the UK's demands led to a confrontation between the two British commissioners, Sir Leon Brittan, conservative, and Mr Bruce Millan, a former Labour cabinet minister. Mr Millan accused Sir Leon of complacency about Britain's efforts to circumvent EU rules. This statement prompted a vigorous rebuttal by the senior British commissioner. The commission noted in its declaration that there would be a fundamental review of institutional questions at the 1996 inter-governmental conference to take account of a possible increase in the Union to more than 20 member states. 'Majority voting will have to be arranged so that the Union can improve its ability to take decisions and act,' the commission said. Member states agreed not to make statements clarifying support for the compromise, but they endorsed the commission position.</p>

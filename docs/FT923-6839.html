			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Letter: Slipping out of a negative equity trap Sir, The Bank of England estimates that 1m households are trapped in homes worth less than the loans upon them ('Mortgage debt traps 1m households', August 17). It adds that only 100,000 of these households are in this position through mortgage arrears or further loans secured on their properties. Thus, about 90 per cent of households pose no immediate credit risk. When will building societies realise that an option is to allow non-arrears households to move and take their 'negative equity' with them, to be paid off over the period of the new mortgage? The building societies would expose themselves to no added risk as 'negative equity' is, in effect, an unsecured loan. This, with increasing volume in the housing market, would boost the economy without artificially distorting the market. I am in such a non-arrears 'negative equity' trap. I work 75 miles from home but my salary has doubled since I took out my mortgage. The societies should help good customers, not only those in arrears.

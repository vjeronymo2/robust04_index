			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Taikichiro Mori, Tokyo developer: Obituary MR Taikichiro Mori, the Japanese property developer and one of the world's richest men, died on Saturday, aged 88. Mr Mori, who built up an empire through development of more than 80 of Tokyo's most prestigious office buildings, amassed a fortune estimated at Dollars 13bn in 33 years. Control of the group, Mori Building, is expected to pass to Mr Mori's second son, Mr Minoru Mori. It is understood Mr Mori junior was made president of the company at a board meeting shortly after his father's death. Mr Taikichiro Mori, ran a conservative financial policy, eschewing the rampant property speculation which spread through Tokyo during the bubble economy years of the late 1980s. However, it is thought that the group has not escaped the fall-out from the property market's collapse. Tokyo is facing an unprecedented glut of unsold office space as developments planned during the 1980's are completed. Mr Taikichiro Mori became involved in his father's property business in 1959 at the age of 55, just as Japan's economic recovery from the second world war was gathering momentum. In the following 33 years he was largely responsible for the remaking of Tokyo as his large office buildings replaced the city's traditional clutter of narrow lanes crowded with small shops, workshops and houses. Despite his great wealth he maintained a modest lifetsyle - he neither drank nor smoked. In spite of his traditional personal values he was an avowed modernist as far as Tokyo was concerned. One of his most treasured projects is the Ark Hills high-technology office building in central Tokyo. He began work on the scheme more than 20 years before when he purchased the first lot of land to make the redevelopment possible.</p>

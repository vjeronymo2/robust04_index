The  behavior of the country's trade balance will depend on whether  or not Mexico's businessmen are capable of taking advantage of  free trade with the United States and Canada.    Serra Puche noted the U.S. economy is on a firm path to  recovery and U.S. consumers will demand Mexican products more  and more. The secretary explained NAFTA's first month in  operation.    [Begin Serra Puche recording] There are no definite trade  figures for this first month of January because it takes more  than one month to prepare reports, but I do have day-by-day  reports indicating operations are under control and the problems  that arose at the start were of a customs nature, and they are  being resolved. [end recording]    Serra Puche was interviewed following his private meeting  with Mexican Telephones System [Telmex] officials and U.S.,  Canadian, and European investors. During the meeting, it became  evident that in the past few years, Telmex invested 20 billion  new pesos and this allowed telephone services to be installed in  8,000 rural towns.    [Begin recording of Telmex Director Juan Antonio Perez] This  coming year we will maintain the investment rhythm of the past  few years: approximately $2.2 billion. [end recording]</p>

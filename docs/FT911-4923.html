			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / International Company News: L'Oreal meets forecast with FFr1.69bn L'OREAL, the leading French cosmetics group, has met its forecasts with a 15 per cent increase in net current profits to FFr1.69bn (Dollars 298.8m) last year, its fifth consecutive year of double digit earnings growth. The company, whose products range from Elnett hairspray to Helena Rubinstein cosmetics, Lancome skin creams and Ralph Lauren perfumes, said sales rose to FFr30.4bn, up 12.5 per cent on a comparable basis. Net attributable profits totalled FFr1.82bn, compared with FFr1.80bn in 1989. Last year's results included essentially only one exceptional gain, a FFr272m clawback from the FFr388m provision made the previous year to cover a dispute with the French tax authorities over the treatment of l'Oreal's royalty revenues, whereas 1989 had included FFr747m of exceptional profits mainly from the sale of its hygiene and comfort divisions. L'Oreal's hair and skin care products performed particularly strongly in 1990. Although the perfumes division showed a slowdown towards the end of the year and worsened at the start of this year, some perfumes, such as the Ralph Lauren and Paloma Picasso brands, produced strong gains. Mr Pascal Castres Saint Martin, vice-president in charge of administration and finance, said L'Oreal's improved results stemmed principally from its control of the cost of raw materials and outside services. 'All our outside services were very tightly managed, including advertising costs, which had risen faster than sales in 1989. Last year, advertising progressed at around the same rate as sales,' he said. L'Oreal was less affected by currency movements than many of its competitors in the perfume and beauty products sector. Around 44 per cent of its sales are billed in French francs, and a further 40 per cent in other currencies belonging to the European Monetary System, Mr Castres Saint Martin explained. The group's exposure to the dollar is limited because its US activities are conducted, for historical reasons connected with the old French exchange control regulations, through an associate, Cosmair, which it manages but does not own, and from which it receives royalties.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The Department finds that each of the increased standards levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered above would result in a significant conservation of energy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 4. Economic Justification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> A.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Economic impact on manufacturers and consumers.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The per unit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased cost to manufacturers to meet the efficiency of levels 1 and 2 for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the representative class is $3.81; to meet levels 3&hyph;7, the manufacturers' cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increases are $10.10, $11.75, $23.42, $50.24, and $210.24, respectively. See  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technical Support Document, Table 1.6.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At those levels of efficiency, the consumer price increases are $4.77  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for levels 1 and 2 and $13.64, $15.43, $32.55, $54.61, and $220.04 for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard levels 3&hyph;7, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The per-unit reduction in annual cost of operation (energy expense) at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels 1 and 2 is $5.12 for the representative class; standard level 3 would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduce energy expenses by $9.13; standard level 4 by $9.73; standard level 5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by $11.16; standard level 6 by $12.41; and standard level 7 by $16.10. See  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technical Support Document, Table 4.1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model results for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all classes of room air conditioners show that revised standards would cause a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prototypical manufacturer to have some reductions in short-run return on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equity from the 8.6 percent return in the base case. Standard levels 1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through 7 are projected to produce short-run return on equity's of 8.5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent, 8.5 percent, 8.4 percent, 8.4 percent, 8.4 percent, 5.2 percent and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minus 4.3 percent, respectively. However, revised standards have little or no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect on the prototypical manufacturer's long-run return on equity. Standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels 1 through 7 are projected to produce long-run return on equity's of 8.5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent, 8.5 percent, 8.5 percent, 8.5 percent, 8.6 percent, 7.9 percent and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7.1 percent, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Tables 5.1 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5.2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most financial data of the type needed to characterize the prototypical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer are generally not available because most real firms are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsidiaries or divisions of larger parent companies. Hence, DOE assumes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the prototypical firm has largely the same financial characteristics (e.g.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt-equity ratio, interest rate on debt, etc.) as parent firms. Financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data for the parent firms are based on publicly available sources such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Securities and Exchange Commission 10K reports and company annual reports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Life-cycle cost and net present value.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A life-cycle cost is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculated for a unit meeting each of the candidate standard levels. For the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative class, life-cycle costs at all standard levels other than level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7, the max tech level, are less than the baseline unit. Of the seven  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> candidate standard levels, a unit meeting level 4 has the lowest consumer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> life-cycle cost. See Technical Support Document, Figure 4.1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, other than at the max tech level, consumers do not purchase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units of the same efficiency. At each candidate standard level, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department determines the average change in life-cycle costs by considering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only those consumers who are being forced by the standard to move from a lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency unit to one which just meets the standard level being considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This is done by assuming in the base case a distribution of purchases of units  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting the efficiencies of the various standard levels. The base case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution is based on the distribution of current sales as a function of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency. As each standard level is examined, the change in life-cycle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost reported is the average change only for affected consumers. Under this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scenario, standard levels 1 and 2 would cause reductions in life-cycle costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the average affected consumer of $38.86 for the representative class of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> room air conditioner; standard level 3 would reduce average life-cycle costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by $54.75; standard level 4, by $56.68; standard level 5, by $53.47; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard level 6, by $43.47. These life-cycle cost reductions indicate that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no standard level, other than max tech, would cause any economic burden on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average consumer. At standard level 7, the life-cycle costs are projected to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase $86.09, compared to the base case. See Technical Support Document,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Table 4.13.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department examined the effect of different discount rates (4, 6,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 10 percent) on the life-cycle cost curves and generally found little  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact. The Department did not consider higher discount rates, since such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates would be beyond the range of real, after-tax rates that consumers would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likely face in financing the purchase of room air conditioners. Similarly,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DOE did not consider different energy prices, including regional prices, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the life-cycle cost analysis. Since any standard is to be a national  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard, DOE believed that national average energy prices were appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

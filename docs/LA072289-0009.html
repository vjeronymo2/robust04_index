			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH COST OF THE B-2 STEALTH BOMBER  </P> <P> So, the B-2 stealth bomber is, in the words of Air Force Secretary Donald B.  Rice, "the most efficient option available" to threaten well-defended Soviet  targets. ("Capitol Hill Has 'Sticker Shock' Over B-2," Part I, July 13).  </P> <P> Which war are we fighting here? This is all old talk. No nation today can  afford major war, let alone the nuclear winter a nuclear war would bring. This  is just pork-barrel politics the way Americans have always liked it.  </P> <P> The entire Western world is in debt up to its eyeballs. If America wants to  make a contribution to the security of the West, if nothing else, it can put  its financial house in order. Then, short of nuclear exchanges with the  Soviets, we at least won't die at the barricades over food riots in a few  years.  </P> <P> JIM REAGAN  </P> <P> Norwalk  </P></p>

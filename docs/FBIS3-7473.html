			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Talk of the Week" feature] </F>   [Text] Dear listeners: In our program Talk of the Week  last Friday, we told you about the character of Nguyen Xuan Chu,  who is now in the Van Hanh Monastery in Australia. This time we  would like to talk about his sabotage activities while he was in  Vietnam as well as what he is doing now in a foreign country,  and the real objectives of these activities.    When he was in Vietnam, Nguyen Xuan Chu told the police of  the former southern province of Nghia Binh during an  interrogation: I was born and grew up under the U.S. puppet  regime, the political system full of dark [word indistinct]. As  a result, I was influenced by the U.S. puppet's [word  indistinct] allegations against the revolution. After the  liberation of southern Vietnam in 1975, a number of people in  the name of the leaders of the United Vietnam Buddhist Church;  the An Quang faction; and a number of bad friends, including  Huyen Quang in the Dharma Institute, who had hostile ideas and  activities against the revolution, directly incited and guided  me to act against the state and people. Huyen Quang, at his own  free will, made use of his position at the time of the  liberation, to initiate a policy with political undertones, not  corresponding to the nature of a traditional appeal [words  indistinct]. He compiled a document entitled: BUDDHISM IN THE  NEW SITUATION, in which he advocated non-cooperation with the  revolutionary administration. Huyen Quang made use of his  prestige to cheat people and abuse the trust and enthusiasm of  Buddhist followers as well as the obedience of the local  Buddhist churches and followers to stir up hostile activities,  pushing them onto a sinful road against the administration. I am  one of these victims.    However, since he arrived in Australia, particularly over  the  last few years, Nguyen Xuan Chu has acted against the Vietnamese  people's revolutionary cause and the national renovation  process. He has incited some MPs to use their influence on their  government as well as on the governments of other countries to  maintain the embargo against Vietnam and restrict their  cooperative relations with Vietnam.    He collected signatures of Vietnamese Buddhist followers and  residents of Australia for a letter sent to the Australian  Parliament, supporting hostile and opposition activities. He  has coordinated with Vo Dai Ton,and reactionary groups in  carrying out sabotage activities against Vietnam. Together with  the group of Vo Van Ai, and Thich (Vien) Ly, he organized  meetings, demonstrations, and hunger strikes and made use of the  mass media to slander Buddhist affairs.    It was reported by many people in Australia that Nguyen Xuan  Chu is specializing in trading goods and furniture for Buddhist  monks, nuns, and followers. He has been made bankrupt, and  there are possibilities that his property will be confiscated by  the Australian Court. Therefore, Nguyen Xuan Chu is trying to  smear and slander the situation of Buddhism in Vietnam to raise  funds among Vietnamese residents abroad, including reactionary  organizations in exile, for the so called support for the  struggle of Buddhists at home.    But in fact he has put all the money in his own pocket.  These activities of Nguyen Xuan Chu have been protested against  by Buddhists in Australia, and exposed by the press there.  However, the matter remains unknown to many Buddhists in  Vietnam and many Vietnamese residents in France, Canada, and the  United States. Nguyen Xuan Chu is one of those people who, for  their own interests, are ready to carry out any activities,  including those against their own nation, people, and friends.</p>

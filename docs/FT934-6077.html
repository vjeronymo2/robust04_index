			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Cooling off would avert tax problem Sir, Andrew Jack highlights the possibility that the chancellor will reduce or remove tax relief on pension contributions in the forthcoming Budget ('Planning to counter the budget crunch', November 20). He indicates that higher rate taxpayers should consider making contributions before Budget day to safeguard higher rate relief currently available. However, his warning that any immediate action could result in the potential loss of higher levels of tax relief, assuming income tax rates go up and pension tax relief is untouched, is spurious. The cooling off requirements of the Financial Services Act mean anyone in this position can safely make a contribution. Should this prove not to have been the best course of action, they will be able to cool off and receive a full refund of their contributions within 14 days. Those likely to be affected by these possible changes should consult an independent financial adviser.

			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / International Company News: Viacom chief defends share purchases Mr Sumner Redstone, chairman of cable company Viacom, which is involved in a takeover battle for Paramount Communications, has issued a strong defence of controversial purchases of his company's stock in recent months. The move came on the eve of last night's deadline for final bids in the Dollars 10bn battle for Paramount. Mr Redstone's statement appeared designed to reassure the board of Paramount and Wall Street of the value of Viacom's stock, which is likely to form part of a revised bid by the company. Viacom is in a bidding war for Paramount with QVC Network, a television shopping company headed by Mr Barry Diller. There has been speculation in the US media that the share purchases - some by a private company owned by Mr Redstone and some by an investment firm in which he holds a stake - could have helped bolster Viacom's share price. However, Viacom said that 'rather than inflating the price of Viacom securities, the more legitimate inquiry is whether the repeated, inaccurate and misinformed publication of rumours and innuendo has served the agenda of QVC by damaging the reputation of Viacom's management and by artificially damaging the market price of Viacom stock.' The company added that investments in Viacom by Mr Redstone's private company, National Amusements, had taken place in the period preceding the announced merger with Paramount and they were part of a well-publicised market purchase programme which had been in effect for six years. When there was any likelihood of a successful Paramount deal, National had suspended all trading activity, and it had made no purchases since August 20, the date of a Viacom-Paramount meeting which led three weeks later to a merger agreement. The investment company, WMS Industries, bought stock in Viacom while the takeover battle was in progress, between September 27 and October 22. However, Viacom said that neither Mr Redstone nor any of his representatives 'discussed with WMS or had any knowledge whatsoever of WMS's purchases of Viacom stock or intention to purchase Viacom stock'. It added: 'Assumptions made by certain members of the press that Mr Redstone controls or has any influence on the management of WMS are totally inaccurate.'</p>

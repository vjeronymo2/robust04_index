			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: POSSIBLE TO HEAR DURING SURGERY  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: Recently, I underwent surgery in our local hospital, and  later I told my husband that I recalled the doctors and anesthesiologists  discussing the scores of a ballgame while I was under the knife. My husband,  who is a doctor, laughed at this and told me I couldn't possibly remember  anything. Could I have just imagined this? -- C.J.  </P> <P> DEAR C.J.: Of course it's possible that you may have imagined it, or you may  have heard this conversation before you were fully anesthetized. It's also  possible, however, that some part of your brain recorded such a conversation.  </P> <P> New studies have given credence to the idea that patients who are completely  anesthetized can still register some of what goes on around them. This is  significant information because it indicates that patients may comprehend  enough of what is said during surgery to affect the course of their recovery.  They may respond to positive comments and negative comments may upset patients  long after surgery.  </P> <P> The ability of patients to learn under anesthetic was revealed in a study by  researchers at Cambridge University where patients were given information about  a number of odd facts and later when questioned on the topics scored  significantly higher than would be expected.  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My 22-year-old daughter has an annoying, alarming habit of  buying out department stores. We're not poor, but if she continues to use her  credit cards with such abandon, we soon will be. What really irritates me is  that she buys things she doesn't need or use. My late wife told me about the  joys of buying, but why buy what you don't need? I've talked with my daughter  about this. She agrees with me, but she doesn't change. What's wrong? -- P.W.  </P> <P> DEAR P.W.: Some people use shopping as a way to escape from their problems. If  they're depressed, they rush to a department store and buy a new dress, new  shoes or new coat. Such purchases are usually unrelated to need -- at least,  not the need of clothing. They are closely related to emotional needs. This  kind of misuse of shopping is dangerous because this can quickly develop into  an addiction.  </P> <P> Buying something -- anything -- becomes a quick fix in much the same way a shot  of drugs is a fix for a junkie, or placing a bet relieves anxiety for a  compulsive gambler. Whether the addiction is to food, drugs, alcohol or  shopping, the relief it gives is only temporary and does nothing to solve the  real problem.  </P> <P> Addicts typically suffer from loneliness, a feeling of emptiness and a low  sense of self-esteem. I suspect that your daughter would profit from some  professional counseling.  </P></p>

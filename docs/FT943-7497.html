			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Technology: Virtual repairs for hole in the road - Welsh Water is using interactive systems A public utility in the UK will use virtual reality for the first time this year to show customers why a busy road must be closed and dug up. Welsh Water, the privatised water company, will use a personal computer-based interactive virtual reality system at public meetings in Wrexham, north Wales, to show the public how a sewerage rehabilitation scheme will affect the local community. The system will replace 'costly' and 'less flexible' rigid models of the proposed work. In addition to the PC-based interactive system, Welsh Water plans to make a 'textured' version available on video, which uses photographs of the actual buildings in the affected street to make the scene more realistic, created on a RealityEngine from the US-based Silicon Graphics. Much of the research for the project has been carried out by Intelligent Systems Solutions, based in Salford. The company has been working with NW Barber Group, a civil engineering consultancy based in Cheshire, which hopes the money-saving technique of creating virtual environments on PCs then sending them to higher level machines for texturing will attract a broad customer base. Roger Moore, planning manager with Welsh Water, says that illustrating the disruption caused by sewerage work is particularly important because sewers are usually deeper and larger than other services. As a result, the disturbance during rehabilitation work is considerable. The public will be able to 'fly' along 600m of street affected by the work stopping outside their own virtual house or business. It will also be possible to 'fly' down to the decaying sewerage system. Clicking on icons in the virtual pavement will activate a real-time video of the sewer. And the effects of a sewer overflow will also be shown. 'Our customers will be able to evaluate the extent of the proposed excavation and use the system to make changes,' says Moore. To keep costs down, most of the work to create the virtual world is being done on PCs. But the graphics are not as good as those on more expensive higher level machines so the information is sent from one to the other. 'The graphics and hierarchical structure of something with the complexity of the real world is ported from the PC to a RealityEngine where it is rendered using photographs of the real world as well as geometrical objects,' explains Andy Connell, lead virtual reality researcher at Intelligent Systems Solutions. These techniques mean 'Pounds 1,000 platforms do 90 per cent of the job, making the work affordable to companies like NW Barber,' he adds. To create the virtual world for Welsh Water, Intelligent Systems is using Ordnance Survey information of the local area to form the backdrop above ground. Individual elements such as virtual houses, business premises, road machinery and street furniture (telephone boxes, road cones and street signs) are stored in a library on a PC before being called up to build the virtual street. If the demonstration is successful, Moore believes it could help raise the profile of public consultation meetings which are 'sometimes greeted with total apathy'. The public, he says, is often unimpressed and confused by plan drawings provided by consultants. They can in some cases be hard to interpret, he adds. 'The use of virtual reality will bring clarity to our presentation and best explain to our customers how the work will impact on the local community.' Dave Walters, associate in research and technological development at NW Barber, says other water companies are now exploring uses for the virtual reality system. South West Water plans to use a similar technique to illustrate why it needs to dig up parts of a road close to an ancient monument - Exeter Cathedral. Thames Water is considering ways the system might be used to show how a new sewerage pumping station in south-east London, will blend with its surroundings.</p>

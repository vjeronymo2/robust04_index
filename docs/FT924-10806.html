			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / International Company News: Higher polymers income provides Du Pont boost DU PONT, the leading US chemicals group, said sharply higher polymers income and its cost-cutting and productivity improvement plan contributed to an 18 per cent rise in underlying earnings in the third quarter. The underlying profits rise was, however, based on stripping out non-recurring extraordinary items, such as a net gain of Dollars 103m in the third quarter of 1991. Du Pont's net income level for the third quarter was Dollars 475m, or 70 cents per share, down from Dollars 504m, or 75 cents, in the same period of last year. Revenues in the quarter were Dollars 9.7bn, a 9 per cent rise year-on-year after adjusting for a new coal venture. Combined sales for chemicals, fibres, polymers and diversified businesses were 6 per cent better year-on-year. International sales were 7 per cent improved thanks partly to the weakness of the US dollar. US sales were 3 per cent improved. Du Pont is engaged in a reorganisation plan aimed at expanding European and Asian business, disposing of non-core assets and curring US costs. Part of its programme includes the recently-approved plan to swap Du Pont's acrylics business for the European nylon interests of Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) of the UK. Du Pont has also opened a new European composites development centre in Bad Homburg, Germany. The idea is to stimulate more European business in the advanced materials sector. Mr Edgar Woolard, chairman, said the chemicals and polymers divisions enjoyed a significant increase in sales volume despite generally weak economic conditions in the company's main markets. Du Pont's chemicals division earnings were up by 25 per cent to Dollars 86m, its fibres business increased after-tax operating income by 11 per cent to Dollars 166m and the polymers division achieved an impressive 81 per cent leap in earnings, to Dollars 121m. In the first nine months, Du Pont recorded net profits of Dollars 1.4bn, down from Dollars 1.64bn year-on-year. Sales slipped to Dollars 28.7bn from Dollars 28.9bn. On Wall Street, Du Pont's share price rose Dollars  5/8 to close at Dollars 48 7/8.</p>

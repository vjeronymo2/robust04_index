			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Julio Armando Valdez; all figures as heard] </F>   [Text] Hugo Noe Pino, president of the Central Bank of  Honduras [BCH], explained at a news conference his monetary plan  aimed at reducing inflation and the fiscal deficit.    Asked about one of the resolutions aimed at establishing the  percentage that banks, savings and loans associations, and  currency exchange houses have to pay everyday to the BCH, he  replied that this figure will increase from 0.50 percent to  0.100 percent; in other words, the BCH administration is  authorized to handle 60-90 percent of the available foreign  currency according to needs and thus avoid speculation and  pressure on the Honduran currency.    Pino clarified the doubts that have arisen on this among  business and commercial sectors:    [Begin Pino recording] Sincerely and unfortunately there has  been a terrible misunderstanding on this decision. Why?  Because the BCH sets a percentage to purchase from the banking  system and for a long time this has been 30 percent. This is  the rate at which the BCH has been purchasing. A week ago the  BCH decided to increase the amount from 30 to 40 percent. But  why did we decide to go to 40 percent? What does the BCH use  this 40 percent for? First of all, it uses it to pay the  foreign debt; often to pay for infrastructure and various  projects that benefit society as a whole. Second, the BCH pays  the oil bill -- oil that not only the government uses but  society as a whole. Third, in view of the imbalances we have  pointed out, the BCH has the obligation to increase  international reserves to strengthen the national economy. I  insist, it is not true that the BCH is purchasing 50 percent of  the foreign currency. Right now we are purchasing 40 percent due  to Honduran society's needs. It should be clearly understood  that the measures adopted by the BCH are to attend to affairs  that are vital to the national economy. [end recording]    When referring to how the fiscal deficit will be reduced,  which right now is at 11.2 percent, Pino explained:    [Begin Pino recording] We have told the international  organizations that such a reduction is practically impossible.  Right now we are negotiating an intermediate point that will  also allow us to reduce the fiscal deficit, because we are  unable to finance it in full -- a balance between reducing the  deficit and fulfilling needs such as health, education, and  other programs that are definitely needed by the country. [end  recording]    Hugo Noe Pino said that interest rates for BCH repeat  discounts [redescuentos] will be kept at 19 percent and this  rate will be reviewed quarterly. The banking cash reserve  [encaje] will be set at 34 percent of the fiscal income and  establish the percentage that banks, saving and loans  associations, and currency exchange houses are obliged to sell  foreign currency to government banks every day. Regarding the  banking cash reserve Pino added:    [Begin Pino recording] The legal banking cash reserve, which  is the legal percentage of deposit reserves that banks have to  keep, by obligation, at the BCH, remains the same. The only  thing we have done is that the 34 percent has also been applied  to deposits by public institutions -- in other words tax  deposits, ENEE [National Enterprise for Electric Power] payments  by the public through banks and savings and loans institutions,  payments by the public for other services such as SANAA  [National Autonomous Aqueduct and Sewage Service], and Hondutel  [Honduran Telecommunications Enterprise]. This means that all we  have done has been to broaden the banking cash reserve base. We  have not increased it but have said, you, the banking system  gentlemen have these resources and in this case these resources  will also be subject to the legal banking cash reserve system.  [end recording]    Regarding prohibitions that Congress may apply in the case  of  foreign currency auctions, Hugo Noe Pino explained:    [Begin Pino recording] The BCH, as director of foreign  exchange policies, should not have such a prohibition. In the  event the BCH at a given moment decides to exercise this  control, it will be announced publicly in advance. I want to  emphatically stress that the BCH has not decided to hold any  foreign currency auctions. I want to first of all reiterate  that it is not true that 50 percent is being purchased, as I  have already stated; we are only purchasing 40 percent. [end  recording]    Hugo Noe Pino concluded by saying that among other  resolutions, the monetary program should be accompanied by other  measures applied to the fiscal deficit, such as limiting banking  system internal credit to the public sector to 1.11 billion  lempiras and establish overall financing of about 1.36 billion  lempiras. He also added that he will not resign at the first  signs of rough weather and will remain in the post as BCH  president as long as President Carlos Roberto Reina so desires.</p>

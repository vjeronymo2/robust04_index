			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Good blue chip quarterly results push Dow ahead Wall Street GOOD quarterly results from a few big blue chip corporations lifted share prices on US stock markets yesterday, as investors continued to digest the implications of the new budget package and comments by the chairman of the Federal Reserve about the state of the economy writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 19.90 firmer at 3,244.86, its high for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index improved 1.28 to 411.62, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks advanced 5.06 to 621.37. New York Stock Exchange turnover amounted to 195m shares. The sharp fall in prices on Wednesday was triggered by hints from Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, that because the economy was steadily recovering it was unlikely that fresh interest rate cuts would be needed to stimulate growth. Mr Greenspan did say, however, that policy would be eased if economic indicators suggested that further stimulus was required, and in light of yesterday's bad economic news - a bigger than expected fall in December durable goods orders and a 24,000 rise in weekly jobless claims - investors' hopes for more rate red-uctions were briefly revived. Among individual issues, three Dow contituent stocks gained good ground on positive fourth-quarter earnings reports. Coca-Cola jumped Dollars 5 5/8 to Dollars 77 1/8 , Boeing Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 52 3/4 and McDonald's Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 44 1/4 . Dow Chemical rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 54 3/8 in spite of news of a fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 92m, incurred because of a one-off Dollars 370m charge to cover asset write-offs and write-downs related to a recent retrenchment in the company's operations. Investors were cheered by the company's forecast of a return to profitability in 1992. Airline issues were in the news. UAL forged ahead Dollars 5 1/4 to Dollars 144 1/2 after the company, as it had warned, announced its biggest ever quarterly loss, a Dollars 10.69 a share deficit for the final three months of 1991. UAL also revealed a Dollars 130m charge and plans to cut capital spending by Dollars 2bn over the next three years. Kellogg advanced Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 57 7/8 on news that Merrill Lynch, the big broking house, had upgraded its long-term investment rating for the food company's stock to 'very attractive', citing strong volume and margin prospects. The recovery in Kellogg follows the sale on Wednesday by a Boston-based money manager of his entire 1.1m-share stake. On the over-the-counter market, Immunex jumped Dollars 5 3/8 to Dollars 62 after entering an agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb (up Dollars 5/8 at Dollars 80 3/8 ) to develop and market cancer therapeutics. Canada TORONTO finished on a modestly firmer note after fairly heavy trading. The composite index gained 7.2 at 3,605.8, while rises exceeded declines by 316 to 245 after volume of 31.2m shares. Canadian Turbo, up 65 cents at CDollars 3.30, said it has signed a letter of intent with private concern Pay Less Holdings under which Pay Less would buy most of Turbo's common shares for CDollars 3.96 apiece.</p>

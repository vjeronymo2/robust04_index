			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MURDOCK WILL QUIT JOFFREY, CO-CHAIR SAYS  </P> <P> David Murdock, the prominent businessman and multimillionaire who was  instrumental in the Joffrey Ballet's adopting Los Angeles as a second home in  1983, has submitted a letter of resignation from the board of the troubled  company, according to a fellow board member.  </P> <P> Murdock was unavailable for comment, but Anthony Bliss, who served as  co-chairman with Murdock, said he was told by a Joffrey staff member that  Murdock's resignation letter was at the ballet's office at the Music Center.  </P> <P> The company has been in turmoil since last week, when Joffrey co-founder and  artistic director Gerald Arpino submitted his resignation on the eve of the  company's first performance of the spring season at the Dorothy Chandler  Pavilion.  </P> <P> Arpino resigned because of a board reorganization, which he claims stripped his  authority. His attorney subsequently advised the company to refrain from  performing Arpino's works, claiming that the choreographer owns the rights to  his ballets.  </P> <P> The company is also suffering from severe financial problems, with a deficit  approaching $2 million.  </P> <P> Murdock's resignation would be significant, because he has been a major donor  to the company and reportedly offered to lead the effort to erase the Joffrey's  deficit.  </P> <P> "Frankly, (the company) is in jeopardy," Bliss said from his New York home  Thursday night. "One of the main problems has been getting people together to  talk. And this has all made it difficult to raise funds.  </P> <P> "We all hope it will be settled, that everybody would agree on the problems and  agree to conquer them."  </P> <P> Bliss said such an agreement, in his opinion, would include Arpino's return to  the company.  </P> <P> The embattled Joffrey received yet another blow Thursday when Cal Performances,  the presenting organization at UC Berkeley, canceled the company's scheduled  July 17-29 engagement.  </P> <P> Paulette Wamego, a spokeswoman for Cal Performances, said negotiations for a  final contract were terminated as a result of the resignation of Arpino.  </P> <P> Wamego said the Berkeley contract rested on Arpino's personal appearance at  Berkeley and the inclusion of his works on four of the six scheduled programs.  The company was scheduled for 14 performances in the 2,000-seat Zellerbach  Hall.  </P> <P> Nancy Davis, the Joffrey's West Coast manager, tried to minimize the Berkeley  situation Thursday. "Nothing is final. We're trying to work something out right  now and we'll be talking to Berkeley tomorrow," she said. "I don't have a sense  of why this happened. I think we'll be able to get something settled."  </P> <P> The Joffrey board is scheduled to meet this morning in a continuing effort to  resolve the dispute with Arpino.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Charisse Jones, Steven R. Churm and Lewis Segal contributed  to this story.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SEARCH CONTINUES FOR MARINE AIRPLANE WITH 2 ABOARD  </P> <P> A Marine Corps observation plane with two crew members aboard disappeared on a  practice run over the Southern California desert, prompting a search that  failed to turn up any sign of the aircraft by late Friday.  </P> <P> The twin-engine OV-10A Bronco left Camp Pendleton at 11:30 a.m. Thursday and  was due back three hours later, said 1st Lt. G.C. Browne, spokesman for the 3rd  Marine Aircraft Wing headquartered in El Toro. The aircraft, from Marine  Observation Squadron 2, Marine Aircraft Group 39, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, was  on a photo reconnaissance mission over the desert, said gunnery Sgt. Bob  Torres.  </P> <P> A search was conducted over an area between Yuma, Ariz., and Twentynine Palms  when the plane -- carrying a three-hour fuel supply -- was declared missing.  </P> <P> Names of the pilot and an observer aboard the aircraft were not released. The  plane was based at Camp Pendleton in San Diego County.  </P> <P> Browne said the aircraft is used by the Marine Corps for forward air control  and observation. In combat, he said, the plane is used to spot enemy aircraft  for interception by fighter jets. The pilot sits forward and the observer in  the rear.  </P> <P> The last crash of an OV-10 Bronco occurred in December, 1987, when the pilot  and observer were killed on a routine mission in the desert near Palm Springs.  </P> <P> The plane is a multipurpose two-seater used primarily for reconnaissance,  including artillery and naval gunfire fire control. The two-engine  propeller-driven craft is built by Rockwell International.  </P> <P> The plane is the earliest model of Broncos manufactured by Rockwell. According  to Jane's: All the World's Aircraft, an authority on world aircraft  specifications, Rockwell built 271 of the OV-10As before moving on to other  models.  </P> <P> Deliveries of the most recent model, the OV-10D, were completed in 1980,  according to Jane's. In addition, 17 Marine Corps' OV-10As have been outfitted  for night observation surveillance.  </P></p>

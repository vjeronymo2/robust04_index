			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Cadbury guidelines face delay IMPLEMENTATION of import-ant parts of the Cadbury code on corporate governance is to be delayed after growing pressure from business. Final versions of guidelines for directors' commentaries in the accounts of whether their companies remain 'going concerns' and on the quality of their internal controls are unlikely to appear before the end of this year. A separate statement by the accountancy profession on interim financial reporting has also been stalled. Details of the slowdown are due to be released this week by several organisations including the Financial Reporting Council, the parent body for the Accounting Standards Board, and the 100 Group of leading finance directors. The reporting council's announcement this week is designed to placate companies by stressing that the Cadbury code does not require statements on internal controls or going concerns until the guidelines have been discussed, completed and tested. It will also emphasise the need for greater co-ordination between standard-setting bodies. The delays follow growing concern by industry over the quantity and consistency of financial reporting standards with which they are expected to comply, and the variety of bodies producing them. Concern has intensified recently because companies with year-ends after June 30 are expected to present a statement of compliance with the Cadbury code in their annual reports on pain of delisting. Mr Michael Lawrence, finance director of the Prudential and chairman of the 100 Group, warned in a speech to a Confederation of British Industry conference last month of companies suffering 'corporate overload'. His comments led to a crisis meeting last week co-ordinated by Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the Financial Reporting Council. Delays in producing the new statements have been caused by concerns about how practicable and acceptable they are to businesses. The statement on internal controls is believed to have been through 17 drafts already.</p>

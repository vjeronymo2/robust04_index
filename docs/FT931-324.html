			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei at high for year as economic outlook improves A SHIFT in investors' views on the economy triggered active buying, and the Nikkei average gained 1.4 per cent, rising above the 19,000 level for the first time since March 31 last year, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average rose 259.68 to 19,048.38 after opening at the day's low of 18,829.55 and rising to the session's high of 19,126.38 during the last half-hour of trading. Foreign investors and dealers were leading buyers, while most institutions remained on the sidelines. Volume totalled 650m shares, against 802m. Advances overwhelmed losses by 913 to 175, with 78 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks surged 26.82 to 1,455.02, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index finished 4.29 firmer at 1,164.48. In spite of the jump in prices, traders were sceptical about the sharp gains in some sectors. The market faces a shortage of sellers at present, because investors need to register their stocks ahead of dividend payments; analysts said dealers have taken the opportunity to buy up shares. Mr Jason James, a strategist at James Capel, said: 'The obvious target is the 19,300 level, but the rise seems to be overdone.' 'There seems to be a concerted effort to boost optimism,' said one trader, referring to local media reports listing recent positive economic data. Rising speculation about a larger than expected economic stimulus package also lifted sentiment. The increase in speculative trading lifted Aids-related issues. Tsumura rose by its daily limit of Y200 to Y1,230 on reports of a new anti-Aids discovery. Green Cross, a speculative favourite, put on Y20 at Y1,310. Gas and electric utilities, which have high dividend ratios, were the day's top performers. Gas utilities gained 10 per cent, led by Tokyo Gas, up Y49 at Y500, while electric power shares rose 6.6 per cent, Tokyo Electric Power ending Y370 higher at Y3,290. Iseki, a farm machinery maker, climbed by its daily limit of Y80 to Y406 on an announcement that the company will become a component stock of the Nikkei average, replacing Sanyo-Kokusaku Pulp, which will be delisted following its merger with Jujo Paper that becomes effective this week. High-technology issues were higher on active buying. Hitachi moved forward Y17 to Y845 and Toshiba advanced Y25 to Y683. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 381.05 to 20,346.92 in volume of 40.4m shares. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets were mixed, with Taiwan closed for a public holiday. HONG KONG fell prey to market rumours that China would dump shares of Jardine Matheson and boycott it for important mainland construction projects. Jardine, a key component of the Hang Seng index, ended HKDollars 1.25 lower at HKDollars 47.50, pulling the index as a whole down 18.35 to 6,322.90 in turnover of HKDollars 2.96bn, compared with Friday's HKDollars 3.53bn. The index had recorded modest gains through most of the day amid hopes that the Hong Kong Governor will not submit his democratic reform bill to the legislature for debate at the end of March, which would raise the possibility that Sino-British talks on Hong Kong might resume. AUSTRALIA took its lead from Tokyo, with a late rally taking the All Ordinaries index 1.1 higher to 1,677.0 in turnover of ADollars 292.8m. Poseidon was 5 cents ahead at ADollars 2.42 and Plutonic Resources 10 cents up at ADollars 2.80. News Corp declined 6 cents to ADollars 7.36 in volume of 4.3m shares after Mr Rupert Murdoch's agreement to buy the loss-making New York Post. BHP picked up 4 cents to ADollars 14.88 as it said wage talks with unions would resume tomorrow after the one-day strike that closed the company's steel mills yesterday. SINGAPORE found selective buying support, which took the Straits Times Industrial index 9.96 higher to 1,670.72. Singapore Bus Service, which announced a one-for-five scrip issue on Friday, topped the gainers, ending 25 cents stronger at SDollars 7.45. SEOUL was lower for the fifth consecutive session, with vehicle shares the only sector to buck the trend of across-the-board selling. The composite index dipped 3.27 to 653.21. BANGKOK saw selling of bank, finance, brokerage and property shares which left the SET index down 9.40, or 1.1 per cent, at 858.04, the sixth consecutive daily decline. KUALA LUMPUR closed higher on renewed speculative and institutional buying and the composite index rose 4.45 to 638.87. MANILA was disrupted by power blackouts, a computer system which crashed when a generator broke down, and a mild earthquake. The composite index shed 10.91 to 1,440.10. BOMBAY fell under selling pressure from investors needing funds to settle tax payments for the 1992/93 fiscal year ending March 31. The BSE index lost 64.52, or 2.8 per cent, to 2,276.90, a broker saying that, apart from tax matters, rights and public issues continued to have an adverse effect.</p>

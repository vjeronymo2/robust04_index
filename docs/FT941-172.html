			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Lib Dems offer pact to beat BNP The Liberal Democrats yester-day launched an appeal for party politics to be put on hold in part of east London in an attempt to prevent the far-right British National party from making fresh gains in May's local elections, David Owen writes. The party said it was prepared to stand aside in the Tower Hamlets ward of Millwall, where the BNP won its first local authority seat in a by-election in September - if the Labour and Conservative parties offered to do the same. Labour - which holds the other two seats in the ward - rejected the proposal. The Liberal Democrats said their proposal would clear the way for a 'community' ticket of three candidates to be drawn up with the express purpose of defeating the BNP. Mr Peter Hughes, the Tower Hamlets Liberal Democrat leader, said his party's proposals were 'probably the only real way' of defeating the BNP. But he said Liberal Democrat candidates would stand down only if the other two parties agreed to similar action. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said in a letter to Mr Hughes he was 'glad decisive action is being taken to prevent fascism . . . gaining a foothold in Britain'.</p>

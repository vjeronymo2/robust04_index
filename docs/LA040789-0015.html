			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'VISION OF ONE WORLD'  </P> <P> Garrett Hardin ("Khomeini Discolors Vision of One World," Op-Ed Page, March 22)  argues that a single world state would inevitably destroy freedom of speech  anywhere on the planet. He cites as evidence the works by Lawrence and Joyce  which were first released in foreign countries because "passionate minorities"  prevented home publication. To Hardin, the Ayatollah Khomeini's death sentence  against Salman Rushdie is a similar phenomenon, and in a One World state  powerful minorities like Khomeini would prevent the worldwide expression of  views disagreeable to them because the authors would have "nowhere else to go."  </P> <P> Hardin's logic fails on two counts. Khomeini is not a "passionate minority" in  Iran; he is the ruler of a theocratic and authoritarian state where his decree  is law, and where freedom of speech is not an accepted political norm. And  despite the success of passionate minorities in preventing the publication of  the works of Lawrence and Joyce in England and Ireland, no less passionate  minorities in the United States fail to suppress the expression and publication  of ideas offensive to them every day.  </P> <P> Today there are numerous groups in America who yearn to prohibit the  dissemination of such works as textbooks on evolution, "The Last Temptation of  Christ," and indeed, "The Satanic Verses" itself. They fail not because the  creators of these works have somewhere else they can go, but because the value  we place on free and open inquiry outweighs the offense any individual idea may  render to any particular group's sensibilities.  </P> <P> Hardin's argument derives from the tired old claim that a single world state  would "inevitably" become a tyranny, and that the continuation of the  500-year-old nation-state system, however successful it may have been, is our  only alternative.  </P> <P> The only thing "inevitable" is the continued movement of humankind toward its  inevitable destiny of a One World state and a One World human community. Such a  One World will not inevitably be a tyranny or a theocracy or inevitably  anything else. It will instead be whatever we make of it.  </P> <P> TAD DALEY  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOVIETS BUY FRENCH JETS; COST PUT AT $310 MILLION  </P> <P> In its first purchase of Western commercial aircraft, the Soviet airline  Aeroflot has ordered five Airbus A-310-300 wide-bodied jets, Airbus Industrie  said today.  </P> <P> Officials of Airbus, a Western European aircraft manufacturing consortium,  declined to disclose the value of the order.  </P> <P> Aircraft industry sources said the contract is worth about $310 million.  </P> <P> Airbus Managing Director Jean Pierson said the Aeroflot order represents "the  new kind of relations between Eastern Europe and Western Europe."  </P> <P> State-owned Aeroflot also has taken an option to buy five additional Airbus  jets, Airbus officials said. Each plane can carry 195 passengers.  </P> <P> The planes will be delivered between November, 1991, and June, 1992, and will  be used for Aeroflot's flights between the Soviet Union and the Far East,  Europe and North America.  </P> <P> Alexander Aksenov, the Soviet Union's civil aviation vice minister, told  reporters in Toulouse that Aeroflot is holding talks with Western European  airlines on a maintenance contract for the new jets.  </P> <P> A full maintenance base in the Soviet Union would be uneconomical for such a  small number of planes, he said.  </P> <P> Aeroflot must still choose between General Electric or Pratt and Whitney  engines to power the aircraft.  </P></p>

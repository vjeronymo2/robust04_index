			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Uncertain outlook for Oslo Norwegian share prices face a volatile period after next Monday's referendum on membership of the European Union, say analysts, irrespective of the outcome of the vote. 'The most unsettling outcome of the referendum will not be rejection of membership, but a 'yes' win so slim as to put in doubt the process of ratification,' says Enskilda Corporate in London. The official outcome will be known by Tuesday morning, and the Storting, or parliament, will meet on Wednesday to set the agenda for a debate and the subsequent ratification vote which could take place one or two weeks later. Enskilda says that extreme political uncertainty is likely to follow a 'yes' vote, which would result in rapidly increasing volatility in the stock market. Prices would be likely to fall even more than if there were a 'no' vote, says the broker, which expects the market to test its all-time high within two or three months of the issue being resolved, irrespective of the outcome. In the event that voters approve EU membership, ratification by the Storting needs a 75 per cent majority. But the main opposition, the anti-EU Centre and Socialist Left parties, have threatened to block ratification if they consider that a 'yes' majority is not large enough to be representative of the whole country. Oslo's all-share index reached an historic peak of 688.23 on February 4. Since then share prices have been unstable and are currently around 11 per cent below their record, largely due to interest rates which have risen strongly since August in response to inflationary fears over consumer spending and the weaker krone against the Ecu. Yesterday the all-share rose 6.78 to 603.07 in relatively thin trade. The US investment house, Goldman Sachs, believes that the market could rise 15 to 20 per cent over the next 12 months in the event of a 'no' vote. If membership were approved, however, the investment bank reckons that the market could climb between 20 to 25 per cent, based on a favourable macro outlook, strong earnings growth prospects and the scope for sustained profitability and competitiveness in the export industry.</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / The ICI Demerger: Pounds 1.3bn rights issue cools investors' enthusiasm for bioscience demerger INSTITUTIONAL investors greeted ICI's plan to demerge its bioscience business with resignation but no great enthusiasm yesterday. Several said they failed to see strong investment attractions in either company. There was particular concern that, in ending its year with higher-than-expected debt of Pounds 2.3bn, ICI would have to accompany the Zeneca demerger with a rights issue as large as Pounds 1.3bn. 'The world is a lot different now from nine months ago, certainly in terms of the valuation of pharmaceuticals stocks,' said one large institutional investor. 'And the trading position for bulk chemicals has not got any worse but it certainly has not got any better. The amount they are seeking to raise smacks slightly of robbing Peter to pay Paul, in that they have committed to pay a level of dividend on the difficult bit - the bulk chemical side - of the business.' Shareholders were universally unimpressed by the 71p rise to Pounds 11.53 1/2 p in the share price yesterday after the demerger news. Not only did the rise follow a run of recent falls, but institutions said the stock had attracted heavy interest from US investors attracted by the yield of more than 7 per cent. Once the stock went ex-dividend, this interest might be reversed, they said. Institutions appeared to need convincing that the alchemy of demerger - whereby the value of the sum of the demerged parts is greater than the whole  -would work. 'We are not saying we are against demerger in principle nor are we saying that the pharmaceuticals division needs to be an integrated part of ICI,' one invester said. 'But we are struggling to see whether two and two does in reality make four and half.' Some shareholders were also surprised at ICI's choice of raising finance through the demerged Zeneca rather than through ICI. Given the marked under-performance of the pharmaceuticals sector since ICI announced it would demerge last year, Zeneca may be rated lower than the old ICI, which has recovery potential. There is also a large expectation that ICI's bulk chemicals business is about to benefit from recovery, even though ICI is fairly dependent on sales to continental Europe, where economies are slowing down. Shareholders recognise this operational gearing but accept they will have to more patient still. One investor said that unless ICI and its advisers can dissuade them from this less-than-enthusiastic view, they might sell enough ICI to take up the Zeneca rights without having to put any new funds into the two companies.</p>

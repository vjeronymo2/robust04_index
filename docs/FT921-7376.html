			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Books: Where imagination rules OK CYBERSPACE: FIRST STEPS edited by Michael Benedikt MIT Press Pounds 19.95, 436 pages LOST IN Cyberspace? Then blame Descartes: 'I have, on the one hand, a clear and distinct idea of myself as a thinking, non-extended thing, and, on the other hand, a distinct idea of my body as an extended, non-thinking thing; it is therefore certain that I am truly distinct from my body, and can exist without it' (Meditations, 1642). Three hundred and fifty years on, technology has proved this almost instinct almost true. Leibniz arrived in 1666 with his idea of 'electric language' for logical reasoning outside language, and the coordinates for Cyberspace were set. Cyberspace: First Steps, is a difficult, technical and interdisciplinary collection of 15 essays from architects, philosophers, Sci-Fi writers and intellectual historians. It gives the history of a technology that will alter our lives next century, although no one knows exactly how. The essays' limitations - obscurity, obtuseness and jargon - are entirely consistent with confusions surrounding VR technology. No one knows what kind of world the technology is driving us towards. The history, however, is plain enough. After written texts (around 1600) came the electronic revolution (after 1900) and the age of information technology (after 1960). In 1984, the Sci-Fi writer William Gibson coined the term 'Cyberspace' in Neuromancer, a bewildering journey through a matrix of 'collective hallucination.' Instead of sitting at the computer keyboard controlling information, Gibson's characters were inside the matrix. They were information. The current pop-example of Cyberspace is the new 'Virtual Reality' (VR) technology. This lets a computer's users represent themselves in three dimensions and wander around with other bits of electronic information in the computer's memory; this technology has become useful for architects, designers and fire fighters as well as games-players. But Cyberspace is more than that; it is the place where all information, visualised spatially, moves along electronic networks between users; the place where data is collected and robots controlled remotely; the place where the mind floats free of the body. So, what does living in Cyberspace mean? Many people are already there. With portable PCs and modems, we are turned into nomads who are always in touch. Within the permanently ephemeral world created by digital television, PCs and high bandwidth cable or radio-frequency networks, we build structures of information like data visualisation, user networks or graphic user interfaces. These structures exist in the country called Cyberspace: bank accounts, credit ratings, company files. The rules of evolution for Cyberspace have yet to be defined. That uncertainty makes these essays an adventure in honest perplexity. The Cyberspace revolution has spawned a new commentator, the Cyber-architect, who unites (as traditional architects do) the disciplines of design, technology and sociology. The language which explains Cyberspace is overwhelmingly architectural: dimensions, structures, habitations. But there is no obvious 'natural space' equivalent for motion or physical interaction in Cyberspace. Those who write about it in this collection are mining in unknown seams with an occasional pit-prop and no illumination from the outside world. Now, Cyberspace research is beginning to call into question our very notions of 'space', 'intelligence' and 'perception'; so these essays are a taxing excursion in philosophical and semantic thinking. The contributors require a highly eclectic knowledge from their reader, who is expected to be familiar with such disparates as Baudrillard, Habermas, Lacan, CS Lewis, le Corbusier, McLuhan, Merleau-Ponty and Gerard de Nerval. Michael Benedikt's editing is rather too light for the non-specialist, but then Cyberspace involves enough disciplines to make a nonsense of specialism. Since no process of logical reasoning can add to the information which its founding axioms contain, nor to the observations from which it proceeds (information encoded in a molecule of DNA or an architect's blueprint), and since Cyberspace has yet to decide on its logical processes and its axioms, this is a fascinating area which allows every intellectual discipline a fair shout. Few academic subjects are confident enough not to exclude others these days. Perhaps because Cyberspace is a country of the mind, the laws of the imagination will turn out to be the processes which govern the new electronic frontiers. As Dr Johnson said, 'Were it not for imagination, sir, a man would be as happy in the arms of a chambermaid as of a Duchess.'</p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Kalon in Pounds 2.4m DIY purchase WHAT A difference a letter makes. Just 11 weeks after failing to take over rival paint-maker Manders for Pounds 86m, Kalon has bought the principal assets of the DIY business of Mangers for a more affordable Pounds 2.4m. J Manger &amp; Son is a Northamptonshire-based maker and distributor of DIY products. Kalon is buying the goodwill and intellectual property rights of the business, its freehold and leasehold properties, which it will sell or sub-let, and the plant, machinery and stocks. The business will be relocated to Kalon's factories and its head office in Batley, West Yorkshire. Essentially Kalon is buying the Mangers name, best-known for its sugar soap products, but also caustic soda, steel wool, polyurethane foams, and household insulation equipment products, as well as a range of decorating sundries.</p>

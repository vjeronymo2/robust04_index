			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BULGARIANS GET PARTY PLEDGE OF FREE ELECTIONS  </P> <P> The Communist Party leader of Bulgaria on Monday promised free elections by  June and an end to the party's automatic right to rule.  </P> <P> "We propose that the National Assembly organize new, free democratic elections  by the end of May," Petar Mladenov told a meeting of the party's  decision-making Central Committee.  </P> <P> Mladenov also said the party's guaranteed dominance of Bulgarian society is  being scrapped. "The leading role of the party cannot be declared  administratively," he said, "but must come from the trust of the people."  </P> <P> A Communist Party spokesman told a news conference that the party is proposing  to the National Assembly that the article of the constitution guaranteeing the  party's monopoly on power be scrapped and a new constitution drawn up by the  end of 1990.  </P> <P> Mladenov's announcement comes in the wake of similar moves by the East German  and Czechoslovak parties to surrender their absolute grip on power.  </P> <P> It followed a four-week whirlwind of political change in this Balkan country of  9 million, culminating in a pro-democracy rally Sunday in Sofia that drew tens  of thousands of people to the streets.  </P> <P> Mladenov, a former foreign minister who took over from veteran hard-liner Todor  Zhivkov last month, also proposed a dialogue "with all powers of society which  work on the basis of socialism and patriotism."  </P> <P> But it was not immediately clear if this dialogue would involve opposition  groups, which have demanded talks with the ruling party on the future of the  country.  </P> <P> Free elections as early as May in this country -- which until a few weeks ago  was a fortress of Stalinism -- are likely to favor the Communists. The growing  number of still-unregistered political, religious and ecological groups were  banned until recently and have had little time to establish themselves.  </P> <P> A Sofia court Monday registered Eco-Glasnost, an environmentalist group, as  Bulgaria's first officially independent organization.  </P> <P> Mladenov, whose speech to the policy-making Central Committee was carried by  Bulgarian Radio, said the party will also hold an extraordinary congress of  grass-roots members next March. The congress is the body that could elect a new  Central Committee, and the prevailing belief is that a more reformist Central  Committee would result. Until Mladenov's speech, the party congress had been  scheduled for late next year.  </P> <P> Mladenov also proposed that Parliament vote this week to set up a commission to  investigate charges of corruption during the 35-year rule of the now-disgraced  Zhivkov.  </P> <P> As the Central Committee meeting continued in closed session, 12,000 Bulgarians  massed in freezing darkness near party headquarters to hold a silent  candlelight vigil in support of opposition demands for further political  change.  </P> <P> "The people are not satisfied with what the party has done until now," a  dissident priest, Father Hristofor Sabev, told a reporter. "People want general  change, not just lies."  </P> <P> In a gesture of anger, those in the crowd raised their candles in the direction  of a giant red star atop the party building. Police did not intervene, and the  crowd dispersed peacefully after one hour.  </P> <P> Sunday's rally, organized by 19 independent groups, was the largest public show  of skepticism about Mladenov's commitment to reform since he ousted Zhivkov.  </P> <P> Although Mladenov has purged many of Zhivkov's hard-line allies from top party  posts and brought unprecedented openness to the state-controlled media, many  Bulgarians have said the changes are not enough.  </P> <P> Those who turned out Sunday voted to support opposition demands for the  resignation of the entire Central Committee, an end to the party's guaranteed  monopoly on power and immediate round-table talks.  </P> <P> Unofficial trade union leader Konstantin Trenchev, speaking before Mladenov  announced the political changes Monday, said he could not rule out the  possibility of a general strike.  </P> <P> "People expect changes, and if they don't happen, a strike could be possible in  the coming months," he said.  </P> <P> Rabotnichesko Delo, the party's daily newspaper, reported that more than 4,000  letters and telephone calls demanding reforms have been received since Zhivkov  was dismissed.  </P> <P> An opinion poll ordered by the Central Committee and published by the paper  said that only 23% of those responding expressed great trust in the party and  only 32% indicated trust in any political organization.  </P> <P> The paper reported that one-third of those polled said they wanted a  multi-party political system, 68.9% supported a system based on law and 77.7%  said economic reform was imperative.  </P></p>

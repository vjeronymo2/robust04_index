			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SAT TEST FAILS TO MEASURE FAIRLY  </P> <P> In "Crash Course," The Times misrepresents the basic message of the Princeton  Review.  </P> <P> Everyone talks about the SAT, but rarely does anyone actually look at it. We  prepare over 25,000 students a year for the SAT; we know this test intimately.  As far as we can tell, it neither predicts college grades nor measures anything  of importance.  </P> <P> Its biases (60 points against women, 110 points against blacks) make it even  less useful. Of white men, 1% don't reach the NCAA's SAT cutoff; of black  women, 50% don't reach it.  </P> <P> Students miss questions on the SAT for two reasons: The lack some basic math  and reading skills, or the idiom of the test itself makes it difficult for them  to show their ability. We feel that the quality of an exam depends on how  little testmanship it requires.  </P> <P> The SAT, a relic of a time when every college student was a white,  upper-middle-class man, requires much more than most students learn in school.  </P> <P> It's time to find a new test, one that's not biased, that promotes real  educational values, and that correlates to college performance. Until the NCAA  uses that test, we will continue to lift students over the arbitrary hurdle of  the SAT better than anyone else (as The Times reported, our results are  unquestioned.) Reebok should be congratulated for helping athletes over this  hurdle, and for helping create a better test.  </P> <P> JOHN KATZMAN,  </P> <P> President, Princeton Review  </P> <P> New York  </P></p>

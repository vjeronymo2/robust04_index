"Though there has been no tangible progress in North  Korea-IAEA talks in Vienna, we believe North Korea will turn  affirmative by the time the IAEA Board of Governors meeting  opens on Feb. 21," he said.    The official observed that North Korea now seems trying to  make most of the inspection issue as a valued "negotiation card"  in the talks on the nuclear question.    He said that the question of inspecting two undeclared  facilities at Yongbyon would be handled at third-round  U.S.-North Korea high- level talks.    However, if the North Korea-IAEA talks fail, the February  IAEA Board of Governors meeting would certainly declare that the  safeguard continuance of the North Korean nuclear facilities was  broken, in which event the nuclear question woud unavoidably be  referred to the UN Security Council, he said.</p>

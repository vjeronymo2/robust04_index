			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Tragedy' for Windwards bananas if Geest pulls out The banana industry in the Caribbean Windward Islands group will become 'unstable' if Geest industries, which markets the islands' fruit, were to discontinue its interest in bananas, according to senior government minister in Dominica. While the Windward Islands should not be 'overly concerned' about reports in the UK press that Geest was considering its future in the banana business, a pull-out by the company 'would create some instability and some sense of uncertainty on the part of our farmers', said Mr Brian Alleyne, external affairs minister of the island of Dominica. The Windwards group, comprising Dominica, Grenada, St Lucia and St Vincent provides two out of every three bananas eaten in the UK. The four islands and Geest are at present negotiating a new contract for the marketing of bananas. The economies of the Windward Islands are heavily dependent on the banana trade. 'The banana industry has been examining a number of options, not only the Geest negotiations, but alternatives in the event that we cannot arrive at a satisfactory conclusion with Geest,' Mr Alleyne said. Geest had been helpful to the islands in negotiations with the European Union over the marketing of bananas, and it would be 'tragic, although not the end of the world for us. . . if the company were to significantly reorganise its banana marketing arrangements'.</p>

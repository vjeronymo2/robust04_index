(``CSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CSE hereby proposes to amend its prior filing regarding the CSE's policy governing Quality of Markets. The following is the text of the proposed rule change, with italics representing new language to be added and brackets representing deleted language: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> D.

If there exist no preferencing Dealers on CSE that are manually entering quotations, then the percentage of a non-preferencing member firm's total monthly CSE trade activity which consists of ITS inbound executions shall equal at least 5%. For the purpose of comparing ITS inbound activity, a rolling three-month average will be used to derive the percentage for the DDs entering manual quotations and these will be compared to the next month's percentages achieved by those member firms using computer-generated quotations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=3 --> II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=3 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> 1. Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> On February 25, 1994, the CSE filed proposed changes to its quality of markets policy. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  The proposal calls for the elimination of autoquoting and the adoption of objective standards to ensure that CSE specialists are contributing to the national market system. In response to comments on the filing, the Exchange proposes to amend one component of its new policy, the Intermarket Trading System (``ITS'') inbound execution requirement. Specifically, the requirement, as amended, would require that all Designated Dealers who computer-generate their quotations, whether or not they preference order flow, generate the same percentage of ITS inbound activity as preferencing Designated Dealers who manually generate quotes. The Exchange believes that such an approach would more fairly allocate the burden of improved performance across all of its specialists.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> The rule change was published for public comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33849 (April 1, 1994), 59 FR 16870 (April 8, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> 2.

			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE HALTS DEPORTING OF SALVADORANS, SAYS INS VIOLATED ASYLUM HELP ORDER  </P> <P> A federal judge in Los Angeles has halted the deportation of several hundred  Salvadorans from a U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service dention facility  in Texas, ruling that the detainees have been denied access to telephones and  lawyers in order to apply for political asylum in this country.  </P> <P> In a ruling issued Friday, U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon held that INS  officials were in violation of an April, 1988, order he authored requiring the  agency to provide help for Salvadorans seeking political asylum.  </P> <P> Civil rights attorneys had argued that immigration officials routinely deported  thousands of Salvadorans to their homeland without advising them of their  rights.  </P> <P> Although INS officials assured Kenyon that all Salvadorans at the INS center in  Port Isabel were advised of the right to apply for political asylum, the judge  held otherwise.  </P> <P> "Out of a group of 67 Salvadorans deported from Port Isabel on April 20, none  were represented by counsel at their deportation hearings," the judge said in  his ruling. "The court finds it difficult to believe that each of these  individuals learned of knowingly and effectively waived his or her right to  counsel."  </P> <P> Kenyon's order remains in effect until a May 30 hearing on the matter.  </P></p>

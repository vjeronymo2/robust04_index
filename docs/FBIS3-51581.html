			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Mariela Leon] </F>   [Excerpt] President Ramon J. Velasquez and President-elect  Rafael Caldera have formally asked the U.S. Government to  participate in consultations within the GATT in the hope of  satisfactorily settling a controversy stemming from a new  regulation imposed by the United States that will harm  Venezuelan gasoline exports to that market.    An interministerial commission was established to coordinate  the Venezuelan strategy. It is made up of the Venezuelan  Petroleum Corporation, the Ministry of Energy and Mines, the  Ministry of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, and the  Foreign Trade Institute [ICE], which led the commission in  filing this request through the U.S. Embassy in Caracas.    Miguel Rodriguez Mendoza, ICE minister of state-president  [title as published], pointed out that "the regulation  promulgated on 15 December by the U.S. Environmental Protection  Agency violates, according to Venezuela, GATT Article III  (National Treaty) for establishing different quality standards  for imported and domestic gasoline."    This will have negative effects on Venezuelan exports  beginning in 1985. Initial estimates indicate that gasoline  exports to the United States could drop by 50 percent, that is,  a $150 million revenue loss. This figure does not take into  account the impact on trade of a possible exclusion of Venezuela  from the U.S. market for a period of about two years.    Rodriguez Mendoza pointed out that the Venezuelan Government  position was channeled through a letter to U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor. The letter calls for the start of  consultations within GATT to determine the legality of  regulations approved by the United States detrimental to  Venezuelan gasoline exports.    The ICE president said that, based on Article XXII (1) of  the  GATT General Agreement, the U.S. regulation violates Venezuela's  rights and causes that country to break its commitments. GATT  procedures state that consultations must start within 30 days.    He pointed out that should the outcome be unfavorable to  Venezuela, our country may request the establishment of a  tribunal or arbitration panel (made up of three independent  experts) that would be tasked with issuing a ruling within six  months. Thus, this controversy -- that we hope will yield a  favorable ruling for our country -- should be settled this year  to avoid the economic impact that this regulation could cause  beginning in 1995.    The U.S. regulation could remove Venezuelan petroleum  exports  from that market. This is the first time that Venezuela, on an  individual basis, will resort to GATT controversy-solving  procedures. We have, however, some experience in this area  because we participated -- not as a litigant but as an  interested party -- in the controversies linked to the tuna  embargo (United States) and banana problem (EEC).

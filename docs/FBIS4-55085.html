			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "No Entry in Macedonia for </F> Zhirinovskiy"]    [Text] Radio Belgrade reports that the president of the  Democratic Association of Serbs in Macedonia, Bora Ristic, has  invited the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia,  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy (presently visiting Belgrade), to visit  the Serbs in "The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  [FYROM]." In his interview for Radio Skopje, Ristic said  "Zhirinovskiy's behavior is quite interesting, some even say  extreme. As he is visiting Yugoslavia at the moment, we invited  him as an ordinary citizen, to get directly acquainted with his  philosophy and views on the Balkan region. But, I believe  chances are he will not be able to come, as the Bolsheviks in  Belgrade, and I do not think these Bolsheviks in Macedonia are  any better, have deprived him of the right to publicly appear in  Belgrade."    Radio Skopje unofficially informs that the Macedonian  authorities are not inclined to grant Zhirinovskiy entry and  stay in the country. The A1 television finds out Zhirinovskiy  had planned to arrive in Macedonia at the Skopje airport. The  airport authorities were allegedly ordered not to allow  Zhirinovskiy to set foot on Macedonia territory. A1 reports  that the air companies have also brought a decision not to allow  Zhirinovskiy to board any of their planes flying on  international routes.</p>

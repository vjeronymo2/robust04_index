			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / International Company News: John Fairfax settles with Packer JOHN FAIRFAX, the Australian publishing group, has settled outstanding obligations to Mr Kerry Packer's Consolidated Press (ConsPress) by effectively allowing the Australian businessman to increase his interest in Fairfax. The cash obligations arose from a two-year-old deal, under which Mr Packer agreed to withdraw from the Tourang consortium which successfully acquired Fairfax for ADollars 1.4bn in late-1991. Mr Packer's withdrawal came after the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal started an inquiry into whether his role in the consortium breached laws limiting investment of TV proprietors in newspapers. Fairfax yesterday said that it would pay ConsPress ADollars 60m (USDollars 39m) 'in full and final satisfaction of all its obligations' under the 1991 termination and release deed. However, it added that Nine Network, one of Mr Packer's publicly-quoted companies, had separately agreed to subscribe for 20m shares in Fairfax, at a cash price of Dollars 3 apiece. From Fairfax's viewpoint, the arrangement means that there will be no net cash outlay. Nine Network, meanwhile, claimed to be showing a paper profit of around ADollars 51m on its interest in Fairfax. The newly-acquired 20m shares bought its total stake in Fairfax to 52.89m shares - or about 7.7 per cent of the equity - and the average buy-in price was said to be ADollars 2.07. Fairfax shares closed unchanged at Dollars 3.04 last night. In addition to Nine Network's interest in Fairfax, some further shares are held by ConsPress. The total Packer interest in Fairfax, therefore, has risen from around 10.5 per cent to about 13 per cent.</p>

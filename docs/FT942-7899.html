			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Athens to sell off 25% of Greek telecoms company Greece's Socialist government yesterday announced the partial privatisation of OTE, the state telecommunications company. The move appeared to be aimed at restoring confidence to local financial markets after a week of steady pressure on the drachma. The government hopes the flotation of 25 per cent of the company on the Athens stock exchange, planned for October, will realise at least Dr250bn (Pounds 674m), with overseas investors likely to take up about half the issue. At least 60 per cent of funds raised will go towards covering a revenue shortfall in this year's budget, estimated at Dr450bn-Dr500bn. The remainder will be used to improve OTE's ageing fixed-wire network. The timing of the announcement reflects government anxiety over the continuing currency crisis, despite official statements to soothe fears of a devaluation. It had not been due until the government had persuaded the OTE union to give the partial privatisation its full backing. While the union now accepts the flotation in principle, it is still demanding that most of the funds raised be reinvested in the company, 'not poured into the black hole in the budget', as one prominent member said yesterday. Mr Yannos Papantoniou, economy minister, said Credit Suisse First Boston and J Henry Schroder Wagg would be reappointed as global co-ordinators for the issue, while National Bank of Greece, the country's largest state-controlled bank, would handle the domestic tranche. The two international investment banks had advised the previous Conservative government last year on the disposal of 49 per cent of OTE through the sale of a strategic stake to an international telecommunications operator, to be followed by a flotation. But the agreement was suspended when the Socialists came to power last October, promising to halt privatisation. However, the need both to reduce a soaring public sector deficit and raise funds for long-overdue modernisation of state corpor-ations forced the government to reverse its policy two months ago. With privatisation now high on the agenda, the government is also considering a partial flotation this year of the state-controlled corporation which controls the country's two largest oil refineries. Pressure on the Greek currency eased yesterday, although dealers said a holiday on German financial markets was responsible rather than the government's announcement on OTE. Short-term interest rates declined from last week's levels of more than 200 per cent, but the one-month offered rate remained at over 140 per cent. The drachma improved yesterday against the US dollar, closing at Dr245.1, against Dr247.4 on Friday. Economists said that before interest rates could start to come down the government would have to demonstrate a firmer commitment to fiscal reform, by trimming spending and curbing tax evasion. However, Mr Alexandros Papadopoulos, the finance minister, said yesterday that at present he had 'no plans to introduce supplementary budgetary measures'.</p>

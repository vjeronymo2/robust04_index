			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Insurance company alters flexitime CLERICAL MEDICAL, the insurer, has abandoned its system of flexitime, reports the latest bulletin from Industrial Relations Services, the independent pay analysts, David Goodhart writes. Flexitime allows employees to decide their own hours of work around a core time specified by the company. Clerical and Medical said it had moved to a system of paying people to do a job rather than to sit at a desk for a fixed number of hours. This new culture clashed with the notion of 'counting hours and minutes' inherent in pure flexitime systems. It has run a flexitime system since 1975 for 1,200 of its 1,600 staff, but said it had had to change as a result of growing competitive pressures. The bulletin also reports on a study of the use of fixed-term contracts, based on a survey of 123 organisations. This found that on average only 2.5 per cent of staff were employed on such contracts. Nearly two-thirds of the survey respondents said they did not use them and their use is concentrated in the public sector - eight out of 10 public-sector employers said they used them. The most common group covered by fixed-term contracts was found to be 'professionals' followed by clerical workers. There was also evidence of an extension of their use to managerial occupations. The main reason employers gave for the use of fixed-term contracts was to provide cover for short-term projects. More than half the organisations surveyed give employees the same terms and conditions as permanent employees.</p>

			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Watchdog accuses generators of inflating electricity prices BRITAIN'S TWO leading generators, National Power and PowerGen, were accused yesterday by Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, of using their dominant market position to push up electricity prices. In the Review of Pool Prices report, he said the companies constituted a duopoly which worked against consumers' interests by creating uncertainty and discouraging competition. Although the report was further evidence of concern about the structure of the post-privatisation electricity industry, Prof Littlechild stopped short of accusing the generators of collusion. Instead, he said, they both used their market strength to raise prices, even at the cost of losing market share. He found higher prices were justified because the generators' production costs were generally higher than prices at which they could sell in the 'pool', the wholesale power market. Because of the technicalities of the pool, the generators' practices might not lead to higher profits, or push up electricity prices for domestic consumers. But Prof Littlechild repeated charges that the generators are pricing coal-based electricity too high in the contracts they are negotiating with distribution companies. These contracts are crucial to British Coal's future. Yesterday's report investigated complaints by big industrial electricity users about rising pool prices. Although Prof Littlechild finds no evidence of malpractice, the report will add to pressure for a restructuring of the generation market in England and Wales, where National Power and PowerGen hold 72 per cent between them.

Sir Leon Brittan, EC competition commissioner, told the Trades Union Congress yesterday he would investigate their complaint that the UK energy market is unfair to coal.

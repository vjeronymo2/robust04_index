			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Erving Sanchez Rizo] </F>   [Text] The government is, in practice, putting the  administration of the country's economy into the hands of the  International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, thereby  losing sovereignty in its decisionmaking ability, even in such  areas as education and law.    This is not only demonstrated by the government's acceptance  of the so-called Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF),  which is a formula imposed by multilateral organizations, but  also by the acceptance to reduce the state payroll by dismissing  13,500 employees and appointing supervisors in the programs of  tax administration and public investment.    As part of the measures to be implemented in the so-called  Macroeconomic and Structural Adjustment Policy, the government  is calling for a series of measures that will affect not only  thousands of public employees but the entire population.  <H5>  Voluntary Mobility Program </H5>   In terms of fiscal policy, the government is determined to  reduce the size of the public sector by firing, through the  so-called "voluntary mobility program," 7,000 employees in 1994,  5,000 in 1995, and 13,500 in 1996.    This decision in reality will only affect sectors where  state  jobs will be "voluntarily guided." The ensuing effects of this  decision will fall, however, also on the families of the  dismissed state workers, businesses that will see their sales  reduced, and even maids, who will lose their jobs after their  employers get fired.    Although there are very few exemptions on indirect taxes,  the  government is determined to eliminate such exemptions, while  adopting a mechanism to increase the price of fuel monthly in  relation to the U.S. dollar.  <H5>  Fuel Indexed and 6 Percent Eliminated </H5>   The decision to index the price of fuel to the U.S. dollar  will result in an immediate increase in the price of consumer  products as well as in the price of raw materials and tools as a  result of higher monthly costs in transportation. In addition,  the price of energy will gradually increase.    The ESAF also establishes fees for such services as health  and education as well as elimination of the law earmarking 6  percent of the national budget for national universities. This  may have serious repercussions on the training of personnel the  country needs for its development.  <H5>  Customs and Revenues Under the IMF </H5>   A very serious aspect of the ESAF is that the government is  willing to place under IMF supervision both the tax  administration program and the revision of the Public Investment  Program with the World Bank before the country's spending plan  is presented.    With that decision and the meddling of the two multilateral  world organizations, the government will in turn lose its  ability to freely decide on its annual budget for revenue and  expenditures.  <H5>  No Small- and Medium-Sized Production </H5>   In another of its recommendations, the ESAF proposes to keep  the financial sector free from guided credit policies. This  decision will deflate the hopes of small- and medium-sized  producers of access to special credit to implement development  programs.    With regard to the Banades and Banic banks, a continued  restructuring and reduction of operating expenses is envisioned,  which has normally translated into a reduction of employees. In  addition, capitalization of these state-owned financial entities  is rejected.  <H5>  ESAF Eliminates Restrictions on Payments Abroad </H5>   In this aspect, which shows the IMF's true nature as a debt  collector, the organization is proposing the elimination of all  restrictions on payments for current international transactions  and is calling for a reduction in importation taxes. A positive  aspect of the ESAF is that it creates a mechanism to encourage  exports.    One aspect of macroeconomic policy is a draft bill to  privatize Telcor [Nicaraguan Telecommunications and Postal  Services Institute] by using indemnity bonuses. It also  recommends the liquidation or sale of 38 businesses still  remaining at Cornap [National Corporations of the Public  Sector], among which are mining and energy companies. It also  calls for the "restructuring of ports."    As part of this point, the ESAF also deprives the government  of its ability to control or interfere in market prices at any  given moment. Some of the few positive aspects include the  proposed administrative and legal framework to consolidate  rights with regard to agrarian property and the preparation of  environmental regulations.  <H5>  6 Percent for Universities in Danger </H5>   Regarding education, the ESAF proposes giving priority to  elementary school education, reducing subsidies on high school  and higher education. This will in fact result in a possible  reduction in student enrollments at state-owned high schools or  universities.    This last proposal is linked to the project to eliminate the  law which gives 6 percent of the budget to state-owned  universities, for which the student movement fought so hard.  Although this has not come true yet, there is a danger of  eliminating this right.    Finally, in one of the most dangerous decisions for workers,  behind the decision to revise the Labor Code to facilitate the  functioning of the labor market lies the possibility that  private sector or state employees may be dismissed at any  minute, and temporary job contracts will prevail.</p>

			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average eases on profit-taking TOKYO stocks continued to drift downwards yesterday in the absence of any fresh supporting factors, writes Bethan Hutton in Tokyo. The Nikkei average dropped 146.29 to close at 16,634.69, its fourth consecutive decline, for a 1.7 per cent fall on the week. After rising briefly on futures arbitrage-linked buying, the market fell steadily from a high of 16,805.66 in the morning to a low of 16,634.49 towards the close. Trading volume was estimated at 224m shares, up from 219.8m. In a reversal of Thursday's position, declining stocks outnumbered gainers by 602 to 301, with 191 unchanged. The Topix index closed down 8.73 at 1,289.52, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.96 to 1,048.23. The previous day's mood of comparative buoyancy, stemming from news of the crown prince's engagement, was not sustained, and the morning price fixing of the January stock index options contract triggered selling. Profit-taking weakened some stocks which had made engagement-related gains on Thursday, while others continued to firm. Mitsukoshi, the department store group, lost Y3 to finish at Y730 but its rival, Takashimaya, which is closely linked to the Imperial household, carried on climbing, ending up Y20 at Y896. Nippon Television gained on expectations of higher audiences for its coverage of the crown prince's wedding, closing up Y300 at Y13,700. Hitachi attracted the heaviest trading, dropping Y8 to Y757 in volume of 2.4m shares. Steel sector stocks experienced a general decline, with Nippon Steel losing Y4 to end at Y286. Victor Co. of Japan (JVC) gained Y51 to Y860 in heavy volume, after announcing its development of a lower-priced high definition television and a VHS recorder for HDTV, to be launched later this year. Other consumer electronics stocks declined, in spite of the possibility of increased sales in the run-up to the royal wedding. Sony fell Y40 to Y4,180, Matsushita Electric Industrial dropped Y20 to Y1,120, and Pioneer Electronic closed down Y30 at Y2,580. In Osaka the OSE index closed down 106.96 at 18,398.98 in volume of 27m shares. Roundup WALL Street's overnight drop gave some markets an unhappy day. AUSTRALIA, already weakened by uncertainty over the Australian dollar, saw heavy selling in futures and the All Ordinaries index dropped 28.6 to 1,502.3, 3.1 per cent lower on the week. Turnover was ADollars 273m. Major stocks bore the brunt of the sell-off, with BHP 32 cents lower at ADollars 12.82, CRA down 50 cents at ADollars 12.70 and TNT off 5 cents at ADollars 0.75. NEW ZEALAND fell on Wall Street and caution about higher domestic interest rates, the NZSE-40 index closing 26.94 lower at 1,526.86, 2.6 per cent down on the week. HONG KONG's Hang Seng index dipped 17.76 to 5,529.56 in turnover down from HKDollars 1.69bn to HKDollars 1.49bn, its domestic worry being the Sino-British row. TAIWAN ended higher on a technical rebound, and media reports that the government would consider lowering the stock transaction tax. The weighted index bounced off support at 3,100 and closed 36.43 up at 3,171.99, 6.1 per cent lower on a politically fearful week, in moderate turnover of TDollars 9.5bn. MANILA saw fresh foreign enthusiasm and the composite index breached the 1,300 mark for the first time since November, rising 21.10 to 1,313.31, 4.5 per cent higher on the week. SEOUL closed comfortably above the 700 mark in spite of profit-taking in highly-capitalised securities house and construction shares, the composite index rising 7.54 to 704.49, up 3.8 per cent on the week. BANGKOK was led by late demand for banks and brokerage shares, as the SET index rose 6.47 to 920.79, 3.1 per cent up on the week.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By BELINFORM correspondents Vladimir Glod, Larisa Lazar for </F> TASS]    [Text] Minsk, 26 Feb -- It appears that on the first day of  spring Belarus will change from being a parliamentary republic  into a presidential republic. On the evening of 1 March the  results will be announced of the secret vote by Belarus  parliamentarians, with named voting slips, for or against  introducing the institution of a presidency. And although  officially the voting will end only at 1800 on 1 March, the  BELINFORM correspondents have learned from confidential sources  that 230 voting slips have already been deposited in the ballot  boxes and 210 deputies have voted in favor of introducing the  post of president as the head of state and executive authority.  For this decision to receive the force of law it needs to  gather another 22 votes.    About 100 parliamentarians have not yet received their  voting  slips. And even taking into account that 40 deputies have said  that they will not vote, one can predict today with 99.9 percent  certainty that Belarus will have a new state structure.</p>

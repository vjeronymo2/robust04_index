			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Turkish-US joint arms venture jams - John Murray Brown on problems of a home-grown defence industry Costly delays of Turkey's largest defence industry collaboration project could be ironed out this week when US and Turkish officials gather at the US army's ballistics testing centre at Aberdeen in Maryland for a week-long demonstration of Turkey's armoured personnel carrier produced by FMC of the US. This unusual move follows an intervention by General Dogan Gures, the Turkish chief of general staff. Turkish concern about the quality of the FMC vehicle's armour follows complaints by the Turkish land forces, which have refused to take delivery from the FMC plant outside Ankara where more than 400 vehicles await collection. The dispute has meant FMC has not been paid since November. The company has informed the Turkish authorities it is setting off its debt payments against some Dollars 60m (Pounds 41m) worth of debts owed by SSM, the government procurement agency, for vehicles which FMC has already produced. With these amounts denominated in Turkish lira, company officials estimate that as a result of the recent lira devaluation the delay in payments has cost FMC an additional Dollars 15m. With no response, FMC has stepped up the pressure and in February took its case to the international court of arbitration in Vienna. The twists and turns of this Dollars 1bn deal - the first co-production joint venture managed by the civilian-run SSM - provide a telling snapshot of the problems of a homegrown defence industry. The project has been the subject of the conflicting aims of cost and efficiency. FMC also seems to be caught up in the rivalry between the civilian-run procurement authority and the Turkish military over defence spending. Despite cuts elsewhere in Europe, Turkey's defence sector has continued to attract a growing share of the budget. But the issue has become particularly acute at a time when the economy is under strain and the Kurdish insurrection in the country's south east has reached a new intensity. The challenge to the military's shopping list has intensified with the appointment of a new head for the SSM, Mr Yalcn Burcak, a former Treasury official, who has put all spending on hold and is reviewing on-going projects. The FMC contract when agreed in 1987 was to deliver 1,698 vehicles by August 1997. The project was a joint venture with the local Nurol group  - the target was to achieve a local manufacturing content of about 70 per cent. Some 200 vehicles have been produced, some of which were deployed to support the Turkish troops in UN operations in Somalia. Others are in use in the Turkish security forces' 10-year-old counter-insurgency operations against Kurdish rebels. However, since the summer of 1992 not a single completed vehicle has left the Golbas factory. Defence experts say the cause of the problem was SSM's decision in 1991 to change the contract terms. The original contract was a turnkey arrangement, under which FMC would deliver the completed vehicle to the Turkish army. Now SSM has decided it will furnish such equipment as the engine, the gun turret and the night-sighting equipment from its own sub-contractors. Delays followed, some of which were not of SSM's making. For instance, the 25mm gun for the armoured fighting version was originally to be supplied by Oerlikon of Switzerland but the contract was discontinued after the Swiss parliament placed an arms embargo on Turkey because of its heavy handling of Kurdish unrest. The latest row concerns armour quality and follows a test at the Turkish army's own centre. FMC says the testing was unscientific. It claims the vehicle meets specifications of the contract and the armour quality is exactly the same as that on the vehicles supplied to the Belgian military. However, some defence experts say the army has deeper reservations, and is using the FMC issue to signal a more general discontent with the way SSM, a civilian authority, is now in charge of what has traditionally been part of the military's preserve.</p>

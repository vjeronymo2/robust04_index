			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> ALTRUISM, BUSINESS JOINED AT FACILITY  </P> <P> The man on the phone sounded desperate. He had been working at a factory for 13  years but had not been promoted -- because he is Latino, he suspected. What  should he do?  </P> <P> Moments before, an exasperated woman called seeking help in collecting $1,000  that her former landlord had borrowed more than a year ago. Neither caller  spoke English.  </P> <P> The director of Centro de Proteccion Familiar (Center for Family Protection)  set up appointments to help solve the problems.  </P> <P> Director Ana Rosa Rodriguez told the man that the center's staff could write  letters to his supervisor and to the company president explaining the  situation. She would also refer him to the state Department of Fair Employment  and Housing.  </P> <P> Rodriguez assigned one of her mediators to work with the other caller and the  former landlord.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Charged No Fee  </P> <P> There was no charge to either client.  </P> <P> The same services could be provided by a number of publicly funded, nonprofit  social service agencies, but Centro de Proteccion Familiar has a distinguishing  characteristic: It is a business run by executives who mix altruism with  profit.  </P> <P> The center is the brainchild of Spanish Research &amp; Marketing, a South  Pasadena-based advertising and marketing firm that specializes in the Latino  market. It sees itself as a way to help first- and second-generation Latinos  adjust to life here, while generating business for doctors and other  professionals.  </P> <P> It tries to build good will in the Latino community by providing free services  such as translation of rental agreements and other legal documents, mediation  services for tenants and consumers and information on immigration questions,  among other things.  </P> <P> In the process, counselors come across people who need medical, legal and  insurance services. Dennis Delmonte, one of three principals of Spanish  Research &amp; Marketing, says the center has generated hundreds of referrals  for doctors and other health professionals, who pay from $3,000 to $5,000 a  month to be part of the cooperative marketing campaign. More than 60  professional health offices and an insurance company participate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Giving Something Back  </P> <P> "Fortunately we've done very well," Delmonte said. "We had a sense we owed  something and wanted to give something back. . . . "  </P> <P> The center's first office was opened in the Pico-Union district of Los Angeles  in 1986. A second office was established in Montebello last July, and a third  was opened in Santa Ana last month. Rodriguez said a fourth office will be  opened in San Bernardino within two months.  </P> <P> Spanish Research &amp; Marketing was established in 1978 by Jorge Azpiazu, who  was born in Argentina, and Tito Alvarez, a native of Puerto Rico. Delmonte, who  said his parents are from Puerto Rico and Chile, became a partner later.  </P> <P> The cooperative marketing campaign for lawyers they opened in 1978 became  Centro de Proteccion Legal, a subsidiary. Delmonte said lawyers from about 350  offices in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego  counties pay from $1,500 to $9,600 a month to participate in that campaign.  </P> <P> The monthly fee buys them a marketing program, which includes group advertising  in Spanish-language media, instruction in how to treat Latino clients and other  assistance.  </P></p>

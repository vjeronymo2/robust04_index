According to the draft law, Latvian citizenship could be  granted only to ethnic Latvians who have returned to the  republic; those legally residing in Latvia before 1940 but  lacking citizenship; spouses of Latvian citizens living on the  Latvian territory over 10 years and citizens of Lithuania and  Estonia permanently residing in the republic.    In addition, the factions proposed setting the annual quotas  for granting citizenship at 0.1% of the Latvian population. At  the moment, it is about 1900 persons a year.    The authors of the draft law propose the beginning of the  naturalization be linked with the ultimate withdrawal of Russian  troops.    At a press conference, they pointed out that their proposals  were an alternative to the document prepared by the ruling  coalition, encompassing the factions "Latvian Way" and  "Peasants' Union," which was passed in the first reading last  December.    This draft law stipulates that the Latvian citizenship could  be granted to former citizens of the Soviet Union permanently  residing in Latvia for over 10 years and having command of the  Latvian language. The annual naturalization quota will be set  by the republican government.</p>

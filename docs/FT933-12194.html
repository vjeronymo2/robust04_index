			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Thousands of commuters to face disruption Thousands of London commuters face disruption of railway services to and from Charing Cross station today, Tim King writes. British Rail will not run any trains to Waterloo East or Charing Cross for the next three weeks. The stations have been closed because work at London Bridge (above) has cut off the entry route. Main line services from Ashford, Kent and suburban line services from Dartford via Bexleyheath are being diverted to Victoria and the frequency of trains will be reduced. All other services are being diverted to Cannon Street. Tickets issued by British Rail for travel to Charing Cross will be valid on the Underground between Cannon Street and Victoria stations. The Underground station at Cannon Street will be open longer hours and at the weekend. British Rail is paying London Transport to provide extra buses from Cannon Street.</p>

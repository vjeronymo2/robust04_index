			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 7 KYODO -- Japan's governing coalition  agreed Monday [7 February] to a 6 trillion yen income tax cut,  postponing for a day the details of paying for it, government  and coalition officials said. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  agreed that the government will settle the divisive tax-cut  issue by midday Tuesday, announce its delayed economic stimulus  package in the evening and meet its Friday deadline for the  Finance Ministry to craft its fiscal 1994 budget draft, Chief  Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi takemura said.    After a day of fruitless meetings and dashed compromise  plans, coalition leaders agreed in the evening to essentially  scrap Hosokawa's plan to change the 3 percent consumption tax to  a 7 percent "National Welfare Tax" in 1997, sources said.    Instead, they will meet at 10:30 A.M. Tuesday to deal with  setting up a consultative body of coalition members to decide  within a year on funding the income tax cut, a key component of  the stimulus package, the sources said.    Divorcing the stimulative tax cut from a hike in indirect  taxes has been a key demand of the coalition's biggest member,  the Social Democratic Party (SDP), which has threatened to quit  the coalition if Hosokawa did not revise the welfare tax scheme  he announced early Thursday. But the powerful Finance Ministry  has been dead-set against the decoupling, insisting as late as  Monday afternoon that any law cutting income taxes must  explicitly set out the timing and rate of the offsetting tax  hike.    Despite Hosokawa's apparent confidence in getting the  budget draft out as planned by Thursday, when he leaves for a  Washington summit with President Bill Clinton, the Finance  Ministry indicated that the prolonged bickering was straining an  already tight schedule.    The U.S. Government has repeatedly called for Japan to spur  its domestic demand to boost imports and cut Tokyo's huge trade  surplus. But the ministry will not be able to complete its  draft budget for the coming fiscal year by Friday if the  coalition does not settle the funding issue Tuesday, a ministry  official said.    As it is, the coalition's failure to agree Monday on funding  the cuts will make it "very difficult" for the government's Tax  Commission to complete its final tax reform report for fiscal  1994 by its Wednesday deadline, which could affect the timing of  the draft budget, a senior ministry tax bureau official said.    On the other hand, SDP leaders indicated approval of the  plan  to set up a consultative body to seek a funding agreement within  a year, a plan that closely resembles the SDP's latest  compromise proposal.    SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama met with other party leaders  and appeared ready to accept the plan, but he chose to hold off  on formal approval until the government made its next move,  sources said.    The agreement on the 6 trillion yen in tax cuts, of which  5.3  trillion would be income and residential tax reductions, while  putting off the thorny question of funding, followed three  meetings of coalition leaders Monday and vain attempts to  placate the SDP, sources said.    The SDP rebuffed proposals through the day. The party has  said even talking about tax hikes is bad for the teetering  economy and that any eventual revenues must be earmarked for  welfare-related spending.    The day's proposals included one ordered by Hosokawa and  crafted by his colleague Hiroyuki Sonoda, leader of the alliance  of Sakigake (Harbinger) and the Japan New Party, combining a new  indirect tax with the tax cuts.    In the rush to cobble together new plans, Hosokawa summoned  Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii to direct him to draw up a new  ministry plan, then phoned Fujii minutes later to explain that  the ministry was instead to help with the Sonoda plan, a  bewildered ministry official said in the afternoon.    When the SDP balked at the Sonoda compromise, the secretary  of coalition member party Komeito, Yuichi Ichikawa, stepped in  with the plan that sealed the evening's half-agreement, sources  said.    Under the plan, the name "welfare tax" would be scrapped and  the consultative body would try to "deal responsibly" with the  funding within a year, the sources said.    It remained unclear how the Finance Ministry and Tax  Commission would respond. As late as Monday afternoon, both  continued to blast the idea of cutting taxes now with only the  vague promises of politicians as collateral for repayment.    A ministry official said in the afternoon there was no  change  in the ministry's stance. Fujii has repeatedly rejected any  such unspecified funding scheme as "untreated," using a word  usually reserved for raw sewage or human incontinence.</p>

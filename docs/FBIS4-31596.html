			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zoran Pusic: "Victory Day: The Square of Victims </F> and Their Rulers"]    [Text] In September 1990 the Assembly of the city of Zagreb  made the decision to change the name of the Square of the  Victims of Fascism to the Square of Croatian Rulers. All streets  that lead to the square have been given the names of various  medieval Croatian rulers. Thus, the part of Rudjer Boskovic  Street that leads to the square in question was renamed King  Drzislav Street. Even Mestrovic's pavilion, built immediately  prior to the war (in 1990 it was not necessary to emphasize  particularly which war was being referred to), and conceived as  a lasting display of modern art, which at the time of the NDH  [Independent State of Croatia] was converted into a mosque, and  after the war into the Museum of the Revolution of the People of  Croatia, must now become a pantheon-mausoleum for (future?)  Croatian rulers.    When this decision of the City Assembly was announced,  protests by citizens took place en masse and petitions were  written, and on 22 September 1990 a large number of Zagreb  residents gathered (on that day alone 2,371 people signed a  petition of protest against changing the name) in front of  Mestrovic's pavilion, encircling the whole pavilion with candles  as a sign of remembrance of the victims of fascism and as a sign  of protest against the decision to change the name of the square.    The mayor at that time, Boris Buzancic, informed the  president of the republic about the dissatisfaction of part of  the citizens with the decision to rename the Square of the  Victims of Fascism, but the president was unyielding in his  conviction of the need for the renaming. He gave up the idea of  the pantheon and a version of the Square of Croatian rulers, but  on the afternoon of 27 November 1990 the plates with the name  Square of the Victims of Fascism were removed and replaced with  new ones. In stealth, almost secretly, and, as Srdjan Dvornik  will say in an appropriate article, "as if suitable for an  unworthy act." It reminded many people of the removal of the  monument to Ban Jelacic, with which another government  "announced with the support of a plebescite that everything was  starting anew with it."    Officially, it has been the Square of Croatian Greats since  then; unofficially, the Square of the Victims of Fascism for  many residents of Zagreb.    A Council for Action on the Square of Victims of Fascism has  been founded, which writes petitions, gathers signatures, and  organizes speaker's platforms, is issuing the booklet Square of  Victims of Fascism in Zagreb. Among the numerous arguments as to  why the name Square of the Victims of Fascism should be  restored, the following are repeated:    --that this name is a reminder of the thousands of Zagreb  antifascists who did that which was most worthy in the history  of the people--oppose darkness and tyranny when the darkness  seemed impenetrable and the tyranny undefeatable;    --that this name is a reminder of the thousands of citizens  of Zagreb and citizens of Croatia, victims of fascism, who were  not antifascist, only of another nation, another faith, or  another race;    --that right on that square during the NDH, there were  Ustashi and Gestapo prisons, through which thousands of victims  of fascism passed;    --that countries of today's Europe, when they speak of the  vision of a Europe of prosperity, do not call on their  totalitarian, nation-building regimes from the past, but on the  values that have always been the hope of the oppressed and those  deprived of rights--freedom and the worth of the individual, the  universality of human rights, and tolerance of differences.    The president of the Republic has answered all the arguments  and petitions cited: "The restoration of the name Square of  Victims of Fascism is sought by political dilettantes and  exhibitionists." (VJESNIK, April 1991)    Since 9 May 1991, the Council for Action on the Square of  the  Victims of Fascism has organized each year, at 1800 hours, a  gathering of citizens as a sign of observance of the Day of  Europe-Day of Victory.    On that day the demand for the restoration of the name  Square  of the Victims of Fascism is always repeated. This name has  become not only a symbol of arrogance and the devastation that  the ruling group caused during the antifascist part of Croatian  history, but also that narrow watershed that can determine if a  country wishes to move toward an appropriate well-being for its  citizens oriented to administrative organization, or ends in  totalitarianism and repression. Naturally, the existence (or  restoration) of the name Square of the Victims of Fascism is not  a sure guarantee even of this, but for this reason a national  government that removes names of streets and squares of victims  of fascism, and puts up names of fascist war criminals, has  oriented itself quite certainly to the trash heap of history.  The way through Gospic, Pakracka Poljana, Ahmic, the Mostar  stadium....    Croatia has earned something quite a bit better than such  nostalgic NDH people, who cannot restore the name Square of the  Victims of Fascism, but who can, to the detriment and shame of  Croatia, introduce the kuna as Croatian currency. The best that  this government can do for Croatia is to lose democratically  organized elections and withdraw, in a democracy of customary  consequence. Restoration of the name Square of the Victims of  Fascism is conditional on a change in the existing government.  Or, as it could be said with a little optimism as a paraphrase  of a famous sentence: "Next year on the Square of the Victims of  Fascism!"</p>

			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> 3 GIRLS RESCUED ON MOUNTAIN  </P> <P> Three teen-age girls from Orange who got lost Monday while hiking during a  church outing in the rugged Angeles National Forest were rescued by authorities  at dawn today, unharmed but shaken from their night under lightning and  thunder-filled skies.  </P> <P> The girls -- identified as Debbie Johnson, 13, Kristen Lawrence, 14, and  Christina Roberts, 15 -- spent the night huddled together under leaves and pine  trees and required no medical attention, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt.  Bobby Denham at the Antelope Valley substation.  </P> <P> Other officers said the girls, camping with a Mormon church group from Orange,  had left their campsite about 5 p.m. Monday bound for Jackson Lake, 1 1/2 miles  away. On their return trip they ventured off the trail -- intentionally -- and  became lost. By nightfall, Denham said, a "huge downpour" struck.  </P> <P> The girls heard a helicopter at daybreak and hiked to a clearing where they  could be seen, Denham said. Members of the department's volunteer search and  rescue team found them at 7:15 a.m. near Inspiration Point, about a half-mile  from the Angeles Crest Highway.  </P></p>

Throngs of citizens have  assembled on the highways and roads amid a heavy traffic jam.  According to the information announced by the interior minister  a short while ago, nine people were killed and a number of  others injured in the blast. He declared that the church and the  worshippers inside it have escaped a horrible massacre because  not all the explosive charges planted in the church went off.  [passage omitted]    [Reporter] Mr. Minister, having been briefed by the security  agencies on the effects of the explosion, what is the latest  death toll?    [Mirhij] We are not yet sure of the number of dead, but I  believe there are nine dead.    [Reporter] [question indistinct]    [Mirhij] The explosive charge was designed to cause a big  massacre, but God's care, [words indistinct] some charges went  off but not all. Had all the explosive charges gone off, the  result would have been devastating.    [Shahin] Anyway, the security forces are conducting  investigations inside the church. Reporters have been forbidden  to enter the church for security reasons. They will be allowed  in later after the initial investigations. Destruction and  devastation are evident inside and outside the church. There  are no doors or windows. Cars parked nearby have been damaged,  along with homes. The church is located in the Zuq Musbih area  and there is heavy traffic on the highway. The Internal  Security Forces are trying to facilitate traffic.</p>

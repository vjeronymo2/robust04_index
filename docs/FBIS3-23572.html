Shpilev </F> and Candidate of Technical Sciences Professor Lieutenant-Colonel  Ye. Matveyev: "Specific Features of Aviation Engineer Support  for the Combat Operations of Ground Forces Aviation"]    [Text] The improvements in the structure of the Ground  Troops, accompanied by changes in their force composition and  their saturation with air units (helicopter units in  particular), require corresponding changes in aviation engineer  support (IAO) for combat operations. This is commonly taken to  mean the whole set of measures performed by engineering and  technical personnel, aimed at maintaining aircraft hardware and  the means of operating and repairing it in constant readiness  for battle. The structural changes have unfortunately not yet  had much of an impact on the organization of IAO in Ground  Troops Aviation.    The simultaneous use of a base airfield and sites for the  dispersal of groups of helicopters, with the prolonged conduct  of combat operations by small groups, pairs and individual  helicopters separated from their permanent base locations, as is  well known, is typical of Ground Troops' Aviation. This latter  circumstance, as a rule, is the focus in the organization of IAO  today, as is indeed reflected in the guiding documents. The  principal and sole feature of the operation of Ground Troops'  Aviation in accordance with them is "the organization of flights  of solitary or small groups of helicopters away from their  permanent basing."[.sup]1[/]    The ways of resolving the problems of aviation engineering  support that arise are thus sought within the standard  organizational structure of Ground Troops Aviation. Here is an  example: "The preparation of helicopters in group basing away  from the main airfield is accomplished by the technical crews  with the involvement of members of the flight crew," the  corresponding manual states. "The regular maintenance and repair  operations on helicopters that are away from their primary base  airfield may be performed by a mobile (air-mobile) TECh  [Technical-Maintenance Unit] or PARM [Mobile Aircraft Repair  Shop], with the involvement of the crew.[.sup]2[/]    Significant changes have occurred in recent years in both  the  helicopter hardware and the conditions for its application,  while the structure of the system of IAO, combat preparation and  combat operations in Ground Troops' Aviation has effectively not  changed. The discrepancies between the ever-increasing  requirements made toward Ground Troops' Aviation, the  considerable changes in the conditions for its employment and  the capabilities of the "old" IAO system were demonstrated  especially visibly by the armed conflict in Afghanistan. Quite a  few examples could be cited, at the same time, of the mutual  integration of the technical and rear support for Ground Troops'  Aviation and combined-arms formations, where entire helicopter  squadrons operated for a long time together with units and  formations of the ground forces as a unified, integral organism.  A group of helicopters (6 Mi-8, 8 Mi-24, 2 Mi-6 and one Mi-10  and Mi-9), for example, supported units and subunits of a  motorized-rifle division and an assault brigade in the  Feyzabad--Taloqan--Qonduz--Sar-e Pol--Mazar-e Sharif--Meymaneh  area for two months in June--August of 1980. The group, carrying  out raiding operations, was constantly in motion--basing in one  place did not exceed two, or more rarely three, days. The IAS  [aviation engineer service] group was at just 70 percent  personnel strength.    The subunits for technical and rear support were operating  together under these conditions. The "ground" people prepared  the basing sites, provided security, defense and food, brought  up ammunition and mat&eacute;riel, repaired the ordnance loads  (BK)  and reloaded the helicopter weaponry (ASP). Mixed crews were  formed in practice, with an aviation mechanic for aviation  weaponry and five or six people from the Ground Troops subunits  engaged in reloading the ASP, for example. All of the manpower  was thus thrown into the fastest possible preparation of the  aviation hardware (AT). The ground servicing equipment moved in  a unified column.    It is instructive that armored personnel carriers were the  principal means of transport in a number of cases. They were  used in particular for the delivery of ASP right to the  helicopters. When a helicopter made a forced landing in a swamp  in the area of the city of Feyzabad, it was an armored personnel  carrier that pulled it out and towed it to the repair site.    Ground troops in general were the first to come to the aid  of  helicopters in forced landings in areas where ground forces were  stationed, assisting them in every way they could, starting with  defense and ending with direct participation in restoring the  craft. There are lots of examples where both the crews and the  aviation hardware were saved thanks to the timely assistance of  the ground forces.    The improvement of IAO for ground forces aviation, in our  opinion, entails a comprehensive review of all factors  (conditions) that affect its organization, including of course  specific features arising out of the operations of helicopters  that are away from their main base locations. It should be taken  into account therein that it exists within a system of overall  technical support (TO) for the ground forces.    Analysis of the nature of combat operations by ground  forces,  and the role and place of helicopter units or subunits in them,  makes it possible to ascertain several specific features of the  employment of army aviation. First of all, ground forces  aviation performs a unified combat mission in close interaction  with combined-arms formations and units. Second, the great  intensity of battle is a cause of the mass damaging or disabling  of armaments and combat hardware (VVT), and the necessity of  performing recovery and repair operations that are close in  nature for most types of VVT (including aviation hardware) in a  very short time. Third, the reliance of the enemy on firepower  against troops in their full depth and the substantial  disruptions of lines of communication lead to increased demands  on the lower levels of the systems of technical support for the  troops, and an increase in the role and significance of their  interaction in isolated areas. Finally, the increased  maneuvering capabilities of ground forces groupings makes it  necessary to ensure the equal mobility of all of their elements.    Moreover, the results of research testify that the design  and  systems (type of operating body, parameters) are close for many  models of aviation and armored hardware: Up to 24 percent of the  entire body of aircraft weaponry and up to 70 percent of the GSM  [oils and lubricants] employed on helicopters are also used in  combined-arms units. The fasteners, technological methods,  tooling and consumable materials are 60-80 percent similar for  technical maintenance and repairs. The mobile  technical-maintenance gear in service with the rear-support  services of the ground forces may be used as much as 70 percent  (for the types of work performed by the general-purpose  ground-servicing for ground forces aviation), and the overhaul  gear as much as 35 percent (for the types of work being  performed by mobile ground forces aviation checkout and repair  stations), for refueling and reloading operations and the  overhaul of aircraft hardware. This value is close to 100  percent for its recovery by ground transport.    Analysis of the conditions for the employment of ground  forces aviation in contemporary battle thus testifies to the  expediency of developing the system of technical maintenance for  the ground forces in the direction of integrating the TO  subsystems of the various branches, formulating uniform  regulations (standards), and making joint use of some of the  elements or facilities of the system of maintenance and repair.  This system should include the elements (manpower and equipment)  that performs general measures for the IAO of ground forces  aviation and the TO of armored, engineer and motor vehicles,  missiles, artillery and other types of VVT. The system of  maintenance and repair of ground forces aviation hardware will  thus include both the IAO elements of the combat entity itself  (unit, subunit), and the common elements of the aforementioned  system intended for the servicing and repair of AT.    The variation we are proposing for the system of maintenance  and repair of ground forces aviation hardware is presented in  the diagram. Its realization, in our opinion, would make it  possible to increase the firepower of field forces by 8-10  percent.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-010C-30A>           [Left:] Existing system of TO </FIG>          We would note, in speaking of the integrated elements, that  they include separate modules (repair and overhaul and recovery  companies or battalions, the TEChs of brigades, VARMs [field  aircraft repair shops] etc.). Some of them could be  standardized, for example, for the performance of fitting,  welding and soldering, dismantling and assembly, refueling and  reloading, recovery, preparation and other operations, and  another unit could specialize in individual types of VVT. The  quantity of modules depends on the variation for the realization  of the assigned combat task, and the requirements for work in  recovery, salvage, overhaul and servicing of ground forces VVT.    Improvements in the structure of TO for ground forces  aviation hardware, in our opinion, should proceed in three  directions from a practical standpoint: Refueling and reloading,  recovery and salvage, and field repair of AT. The creation of  forward points for the replenishment of ammunition and fuel for  helicopters would be expedient, in order to organize refueling  and reloading operations and reduce the time to prepare for  repeat sorties and the deployment of teams or crews for  technical maintenance in forward areas from the main repair  elements of the ground forces. The refueling of helicopters,  tanks and other types of VVT could be performed by refueling  helicopters, as well as the ground forces rear-support gear.    The dedicated purpose of the recovery companies and  battalions must be expanded in order to organize the recovery  and salvage of damaged AT, so that those units are able to  recover all types of ground forces VVT, including aviation.  Their composition would best include helicopters, and it makes  sense to use the assault-transport helicopters in their  interests. They could recover damaged hardware and bring it to  the corresponding repair points when returning from forward  areas.    The overall supervision of the organization of TO (sequence  and procedure for maintenance, recovery and overhaul of  hardware) is exercised by the apparatus of the deputy commander  for weaponry. Technical supervision (determination of technical  status and the overhaul of the aircraft and helicopters, among  other things) is accomplished by the aviation specialists, using  the manpower and equipment of the ground forces.    Domestic research has devoted a great deal of attention to  experience in the organization of aviation engineer support in  U.S. army aviation. IAO is performed there according to rules  that take into account the specific conditions and requirements  of the ground forces. The work on the technical servicing and  repair (TER) is performed at three levels. The first includes  the corresponding platoons of the battalion Ground Troops'  Aviation. They perform field TER--all of preparation of aviation  hardware for flights, as well as minor and routine repairs of  assemblies.    The second level is the AT TER companies and battalions of  the corps and divisions. They perform medium repairs, complex  inspections and regular servicing operations. The third level is  plant repair. It is performed in the continental United States  by aircraft-repair facilities of the ground forces, other  branches of the armed forces and civilian firms.    The IAS subunits that are performing intermediate TER are  not  part of the regular composition of the flight units, but are  rather subordinate to the elements for technical and rear  support of the divisions, corps and commands of the ground  forces in a theater. They are the bulwark of the IAO of  army-aviation units (the center of field repairs and technical  servicing of aviation hardware in the areas where Ground Troops'  Aviation units are stationed), and perform the principal repair  and complex servicing operations, as well as allocating mobile  teams to assist the field TER subunits. The subunits for  intermediate TER are moreover the principal source of spare  parts support for the flight units, from an exchange fund that  is created from units and assemblies they have repaired.  Analysis shows that the center of IAO operations is not in the  flight units, but is rather in the subunits subordinate to the  technical and rear-support elements of the ground forces.    The comprehensive utilization of the manpower and equipment  of technical servicing could facilitate an increase in the  efficiency of IAO for combat operations for ground forces  aviation under our conditions. A standardization of both the  models of VVT themselves and the means of servicing and  repairing them, assurance of the preparedness of the ground  forces personnel to perform operations on various types of VVT  and the creation of a unified system for the administration,  supply and training of personnel and VVT orders are all  necessary for this to happen.

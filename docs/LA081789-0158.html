			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PULLING AN OVERNIGHTER IN BUSH WHITE HOUSE  </P> <P> There is a story -- not apocryphal -- about the night in January 1967 when  George and Barbara Bush's furniture arrived in Washington from Houston.  </P> <P> A snowstorm was in progress as the moving van pulled up at the Bushes'  Hillbrook Lane home shortly before midnight. The movers managed to unload the  mattresses and bedding but not much more before the Bushes called a halt,  invited them to spend the night and sent everybody off to bed.  </P> <P> Nobody remembers the movers' names, but they surely rank first among equals in  that exclusive group of Bush insiders on social Washington's much coveted  A-list. Twenty-two years later, when invitations to dinner or a movie at the  White House are as common as a Washington rumor, overnighting with the Bushes  is the new measure of status. Only a select few, toothbrush and pajamas in  hand, make the cut.  </P> <P> They're not necessarily famous or rich or even powerful, though many are all  three. Most are family members or Bush friends -- usually old friends,  occasionally new friends, but always loyal friends. Friends such as Kentucky  horse breeder Will Farish, Hollywood producer Jerry Weintraub, Pennzoil  executive committee chairman Baine Kerr, fellow Yale Skull and Bonesman Thomas  W. Moseley, and childhood friend FitzGerald Bemiss -- to name a few.  </P> <P> Were there such a thing as an A-plus list, theirs would be among the names on  it, for they, not kings or presidents, have been sleeping royally in the  Queen's and Lincoln bedrooms during the seven months the Bushes have been  living in the White House. And if those second-floor bedrooms were filled, they  moved up to the third-floor family quarters.  </P> <P> "It's a storybook experience," confirms Shirley Pettis, the former California  representative who was a Bush neighbor here for 10 years. The Bushes invited  Pettis and her husband, Ben Roberson, to stay with them during a trip to  Washington in May. Shown to the Queen's Bedroom, where five queens have slept  in Andrew Jackson's handsome four-poster bed, they were overwhelmed by the  historic surroundings.  </P> <P> "Every place you turn there is a sense of your forebears," says Pettis, equally  impressed by how thoroughly her hostess had done her research. "Bar makes you  feel you must know everything about this wonderful house, and because she knows  every piece and can tell its story, the whole floor comes alive."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Most Gracious Staff  </P> <P> Pampered by what Pettis describes as one of the world's most gracious household  staffs, guests find all the amenities of a luxury hotel -- and then some. There  are heavy terry-cloth robes in the bathrooms, crisp white stationery engraved  with "The President's House" on the desks, bouquets of fresh flowers everywhere  and the best security system in the world.  </P> <P> Guests also are faced with such big decisions as whether to unpack their own  bags or let the staff do it; what to order for breakfast (menu cards are left  in their rooms each evening), and where to eat it -- in their rooms or the East  Sitting Hall. Pettis and her husband chose the latter and were enjoying the  morning sun when who should come over to join them for a cup of tea but the  President himself.  </P> <P> "He came romping down the hall. Fortunately, I was wearing my prettiest  peignoir," says an amused Pettis, who remembers that same spontaneous nature  from when she and the late California representative Jerry Pettis lived next  door to another freshman congressman, then-Texas Rep. George Bush, on Palisade  Lane.  </P> <P> There are tales of other unexpected encounters. One house guest, awakened by  gentle but persistent tapping on the door, heard Bush outside inquiring, "Is  anybody up in there?" Another said it wasn't unusual for the President to  casually warn that he was taking someone through the room "so make sure you  don't have anything sitting around."  </P> <P> Even if for only a night or two, living amid history takes some getting used  to. Jack Steele of Houston, longtime Bush friend and a confessed Walter  Mitty-type at heart, says he had trouble sleeping his first night in the  Lincoln Bedroom so he stayed up looking at the Washington Monument and writing  notes at the desk where Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.  </P> <P> He isn't the only one who's had trouble sleeping. Houston friends David and Ann  Peake were put up in the Queen's Bedroom, where the original copy of "The Star  Spangled Banner" hangs on one wall. In the morning, Peake -- a friend of  Barbara Bush from her childhood in Rye, N.Y. -- asked his wife -- a history  buff -- if she'd slept well. "Not particularly," she replied. "What a waste of  time!"  </P> <P> Some guests -- like the Peakes and Baine and Mildred Kerr -- have been invited  to spend the night after a state dinner. Sadruddin Aga Khan, a former United  Nations official and tennis friend to whom Bush turned recently in the current  hostage crisis, stayed the night that Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto  was an official visitor in June. Invited to stay after other state dinners were  country singer Crystal Gayle; Steve Fisher, coach of the national college  basketball champion University of Michigan Wolverines; and Bush cousins John  and Shelley Jansing of New York.  </P> <P> Another recent guest was New York socialite Mildred Hilson, the Bushes' Waldorf  Towers neighbor when George Bush was ambassador to the United Nations in the  early '70s. Barbara Bush's favorite interior designer, Mark Hampton of New  York, has stayed, too. So have all the Bushes' children and grandchildren, most  of the Bushes' siblings, and many of their nieces and nephews.  </P> <P> The Bushes are similarly generous with their invitations to Camp David. Their  firstborn, George Walker Bush, and his wife, Laura, up from Texas for the Texas  Rangers' three-game series with the Baltimore Orioles, and Bush cousins Craig,  Debbie and Walker Stapleton, down from Connecticut, spent last weekend with the  Bushes there.  </P> <P> Cabinet members and their spouses, and some key presidential aides, have been  weekend guests. Some non-family guests, such as Jack Steele, are also twofers  -- welcome at both the White House and the Catoctin Mountains retreat. Steele  describes that setting as "glorious -- we walked in the woods and that night  sat with our feet up and watched a movie."  </P> <P> For the unathletic, the pace is relaxed; for others, it's highly competitive,  as when Bush invited Pam Shriver and a group for a recent weekend of tennis.  Bush also likes "wally ball," a corrupted version of volleyball played on a  squash court. Even before Marine One, the presidential helicopter, touches  ground, Bush, sometimes with his grandchildren in tow, starts marshaling the  troops to suit up and report for jogging.  </P> <P> The White House, by contrast, is a bit more formal. Everyone is on best  behavior, and those who aren't can expect a refresher course. At dinner time  recently when the First Lady realized that her twin granddaughters, Jenna and  Barbara Bush (George W. and Laura Bush's children), were not at the table, she  asked the butler if he knew where they were. In the bowling alley, he informed  her, waiting to be served. They didn't wait much longer. Barbara Bush ordered  them back to the family quarters by sending word that Bush grandchildren do not  eat in the bowling alley, they eat with the family in the dining room. She also  warned the White House staff to beware of young charm artists.  </P> <P> There are also rules at the family's Walker's Point compound in Kennebunkport,  but, according to Barbara Bush, no one keeps them. She has posted notes such  as: "Picnics should be planned early for the beach," and "Please pick up wet  towels and use them twice," and "Please be down for breakfast between 7 and 9  or no breakfast."  </P> <P> "You're so absorbed into their activities that you don't think of yourself as a  visitor because you become an instant member of the family," says former Bush  spokesman Pete Roussel, who has stayed at Walker's Point several times.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Decades of Guests  </P> <P> The Bushes have been putting up house guests in their 15-room, seven-bath,  stone-and-shingle "cottage" there for almost a decade. Before that, they put  them up at the house they owned across the road. Bush's family has been  spending summers at Kennebunkport since the 1880s and at Walker's Point since  1902, when it was bought by the President's grandfather. Dorothy Walker Bush,  the President's mother, still has a cottage within the compound.  </P> <P> It is George Bush's favorite place on earth -- "politics be damned," he says  fearlessly -- and perhaps the most coveted overnight of all. French President  Francois Mitterrand has already spent the night -- in a rented king-size bed  for which Barbara Bush herself brought in the sheets, according to the  furniture store owner who supplied it.  </P> <P> At the moment, the doorstep is being swept in preparation for an an Aug. 24  overnight visit by Danish Prime Minister Poul Schlueter and his wife, Anne  Marie Vessel, and an Aug. 30 overnight visit by Canadian Prime Minister Brian  Mulroney and his wife, Mila, and their children, Caroline, 15; Benedict, 13;  Mark, 10, and Nicholas, 3.  </P> <P> The Schlueter and Mulroney visits raise prospects for yet another A-plus list  category, this one of world leaders whom Bush might single out for more  intimate get-togethers than are possible during the highly ceremonial state and  official visits.  </P> <P> "You can avoid misunderstandings if you can go one-on-one in a relaxed,  personal way," Bush has said.  </P> <P> The Schlueters are stopping on their way to Mexico, where they're making an  official visit. Schlueter and Bush have been friendly since they met in 1982,  and when the new Danish ambassador mentioned the Mexico trip as he was  presenting his credentials at the White House earlier this month, Bush extended  the invitation on the spot. The Mulroney invitation grew out of an expansive  moment in Paris last month when the company-loving President invited his  Canadian neighbor to bring the wife and kids down from Ottawa for a few days in  August.  </P> <P> In a mood of similar unsuppressed hospitality at the Tokyo funeral of Emperor  Hirohito in February, Bush invited France's Mitterrand and his wife, Danielle,  to be overnight house guests. The Mitterrands came in May on their way to  Boston, where honorary degrees awaited both Mitterrand and Bush at Boston  University.  </P> <P> Walker's Point guests can expect a rigorous workout. Mitterrand, not usually  identified with informality or sports, nonedheless brought along his corduroys,  plaid shirt and hiking boots for a walk with his host in the mosquito- and  black-fly-infested woods nearby. When Bush invited him to take a spin in his  high-speed Cigarette boat, Mitterrand, who gets seasick, declined and headed  indoors for a rest.  </P> <P> Schlueter plays some tennis and likes to bike, and Mulroney is the All-Canadian  Boy type who reportedly likes horseshoes, boating, fishing, tennis (he met his  wife at a Montreal tennis club) and just about any other sport, except golf,  that Bush might propose.  </P> <P> Mulroney is also an all-star first baseman, as he proved earlier this summer  when he was named "most valuable player" during a charity softball appearance  in Vancouver.  </P> <P> Since Bush is no slouch with the horsehide himself, a pickup game featuring  Bush and Mulroney on opposing teams would surprise no one at all.  </P></p>

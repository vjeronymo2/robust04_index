			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Interest rate cut catches traders wrong-footed - Market Report The stock market was caught on the wrong foot yesterday morning by the 1/2 percentage point cut to 5.5 per cent in the Bank of England minimum lending rate. Share prices, which had opened lower in the face of a further setback on Wall Street overnight, spent the rest of the session trading through a range of 40 points on the FT-SE 100 Index, which ended the day not far from its overnight level. While the overall reception for the interest rate cut, which was swiftly followed by the lending banks, stock market traders admitted to a 'very difficult session.' Genuine retail investors often found problems in trying to deal at wildly fluctuating share quotations as market makers traded between equities and an equally exciteable stock index sector. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 3,069.3, down 1.3. The Index was down to 3,050.6 ahead of the interest rate announcement, then soared to 3,090 before falling closing nervously after Wall Street made a poor start to the new session. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index closed 3.8 up at 3,439.2, reversing an early fall. The uncertain response on the trading screens, which inspired a leap in Seaq volume to 667.1m shares from Monday's 455.2m, contrasted with the more positive reception accorded by market strategists to the base rate cut. On Monday, retail business fell below Pounds 1bn, effectively for the first daily session for several months. While caught out by the timing of the move, which appeared to have been prompted by trends in London money markets, analysts acclaimed the decision both as a favourable indicator of Budget plans and as confirmation that further reductions in base rates are likely. 'It indicates that London markets have decoupled from the New York Treasury markets,' said Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull. He sees UK interest rates at 5 per cent by the year-end. At Kleinwort Benson Securities, Mr Trevor Laugharne was equally positive, believing that although the next half point cut might not come until early January, rates could be down to 4 per next later next year. By the close of trading, international stocks, including ICI, Glaxo and BAT Industries were not far from overnight levels, but reacting with caution to a Wall Street market then in the process of reversing its opening gain. Oil stocks edged higher, however. But the domestic, interest-related, stocks traded a more uncertain path. Bank shares, which respond readily to base rate optimism because it lightens their bad debt burdens, moved sharply before closing with mixed changes. Store and retail issues tried to move ahead but failed to hold their best levels. The favourable attitudes from market analysts were slow to work through to the equity trading desks, where dealers remained unsettled by the outlook for both the Japanese and US stock markets. Throughout the session, UK equities were led by the December contract on the Footsie, and the setback suffered late in the afternoon came when the future fell to a discount. Yesterday, London had to cope with the absence of a lead from Tokyo overnight and the prospect of a New York market slowing down for the Thanksgiving Day holiday. Traders said there was a general unwillingness to take on stock positions in the international blue chips which might prove difficult to unravel until next week.</p>

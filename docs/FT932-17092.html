			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Management: The side-effects of a 'cure-all' approach FEW management concepts, even including 'excellence' and 'total quality', have caught on as fast and furiously as 'organisational re-engineering' - otherwise known by the equally awkward labels of 'core process redesign', 'business re-engineering' and a dozen other permutations of the same six words, depending on which consultancy you talk to. But few concepts have been as misunderstood, or risk being as misapplied. Nor has so much doom been purveyed about the possible employment impact of any organisational innovation. One forecast last month was that re-engineering could destroy as many as 25m US jobs, mainly in service activities. Contrary to the easily confused, but broader and more complex, concept of 'organisational architecture', the principle behind re-engineering is straightforward. Its US consultant-progenitors, Michael Hammer and James Champy, define it as 'the fundamental re-thinking and radical redesign of business processes to achieve dramatic improvements in critical, contemporary measures of performance, such as cost, quality, service and speed'. The word 'radical' means what it says: re-engineering may use similar analysis methods to the old disciplines of work and time study, or 'industrial engineering', but unlike them it does not cover the simplification and improvement of existing processes. Instead, it involves transforming an organisation from one based on separate 'functions' (or specialist departments) - such as product or service design, engineering, manufacturing, marketing, service and accounting - to one based on the processes which span most or all of these activities and disciplines. Most consultants advise organisations to start by re-engineering processes which take them: from the initial concept for a product or service to its launch; from customer identification to initial order; from order to delivery; from service inquiry to fulfilment; and from delivery to payment. In academic terms, which are being purloined increasingly by the consultants to help convey their message, re-engineering involves transforming part of a business unit - and eventually the entire organisation - from its traditionally 'vertical' structure to a 'horizontal' one. US companies which have reached various stages down this track, despite the myriad of political and other internal stumbling blocks, include Texas Instruments, AT&amp;T, Motorola, Ford, Kodak and Hallmark Cards. Unlikely partial practitioners in Europe include British Telecom and Lucas. The reasons why re-engineering has surged to craze-like status over the past three years are plain but numerous. They include: Recessionary and other competitive pressures, especially to slash costs, but also to increase value. If re-engineering promises anything, it is that an organisation can be re-designed to do 'more with less' - or 'much more with the same'. It is the most effective way of making an organisation far faster on its feet, and more responsive to customers and competitors. It is the logical next step after 'delayering', 'down-sizing' and 'restructuring' a vertical organisation by conventional means - something which many large US companies, and a growing number of Europeans, have accomplished or initiated since the mid-1980s. It promises an answer to the much-debated problem of stagnant service productivity. In effect, the re-engineering craze is sweeping into offices a concept which was tested by cross-functional teams in factories and product development centres during the 1980s. It responds to the belated realisation of top managers that fortunes were wasted on data processing investment in the 1970s and 1980s. Companies automated old, inefficient functional procedures, instead of first abandoning many of them, redesigning the resy, and only then computerising. Hammer shot to general prominence in 1990 with a Harvard Business review article called 'Don't automate, obliterate'. It is being driven by sales pressure from every type of consultancy as they jostle to annex the same territory. The most desperate are those firms which used to specialise in information technology, such as CSC Index. But generalists such as McKinsey, which majors on 'core process redesign', are also in there fighting. Given the breadth of these influences, it is not surprising that re-engineering is so widely misunderstood. Like excellence and quality in the 1980s, it is being touted as both a cure-all and what Hammer calls, in American franglais, a 'term du jour'. He resents especially the use of it to embrace delayering and down-sizing. 'Some companies say they've re-engineered when they've done nothing of the sort - they've simply lopped off part of the business,' he complains. In many cases, re-engineering creates no net job losses at all, he says; instead, its prime objective is to slash 'cycle time' or to raise quality. But in other instances it can remove between 50 and 75 per cent of the jobs in a particular process, 'though not in the total organisation'. At CSC Index, Tom Waite dismisses the 25m US jobs scare as 'beyond the realms of possibility' if his consultancy's experience with clients is any guide. His analysis, and Hammer's, is a partial corrective to the jobs horror story  -unless one really expects companies to 'go horizontal' from bottom to top, and to create no extra value or jobs, however indirectly. There is certainly much talk in US companies of functional bosses transforming themselves into new 'process owners'. But the realities of executive life make one sceptical. Re-engineering is a juicy but tough nut to crack.</p>

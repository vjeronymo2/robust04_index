			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [INTERFAX "Express"] </F>   [Text] U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry on Sunday  evening assured Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev that  there would be no air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs within  the next two days, although the NATO ultimatum expires at  midnight on Sunday [20 February].    In a telephone conversation, conducted in the presence of  correspondents from Interfax and Russia's NTV television  company, Grachev told Perry: "In our opinion, far from all  political and diplomatic measures have been used."    The minister said Russia's 400-strong U.N. contingent around  1700 GMT was entering Sarajevo, where the commander of the  Russian airborne forces, Colonel-General Yevgeny Podkolzin, a  group of Russian Defense Ministry officials and Russian Deputy  Foreign Minister Vitaly Churkin had already arrived.    "The use of air forces against any of the parties to the  conflict must be ruled out. This must be the basis of a  solution at the present moment," Grachev said.    He said Perry agreed with this and said no air strikes would  be carried out on Monday. Attempts would be made that day to  establish the exact location of the heavy weapons removed by the  Serbs, Grachev said. He said the abundant snow was hampering  the withdrawal of the weaponry. "This factor must come into  account when decisions are made," he told Perry.    Grachev said civilians and Russian troops could be among the  victims of the air strikes.    He made it clear that Moscow could send a reinforcement for  the U.N. force if the Russian parliament approved it. "We are  ready to respond to the appeal of the U.N. secretary general to  send an addition contingent of up to 300 if such a decision were  approved by the Federal Assembly," he said.</p>

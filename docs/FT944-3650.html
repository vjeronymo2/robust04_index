			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / World Bond Markets: Global success bodes well for domestic issues - South African bonds The resounding success of South Africa's Dollars 750m global bond offering, launched last week, suggests that international investors have discovered a taste for South African debt. They should now focus on the country's domestic bond market, where the returns are attractive and the signs are that it is poised to rally. This has been a bad year for the South African government bond market, as it has for bond markets worldwide. Yields on long-dated government bonds climbed from below 12 per cent in January to 17 per cent in October. They have fallen back slightly in recent weeks to around 16 1/2 per cent. The sharp rise in yields was due partly to the adverse international bond market environment. But it was also due to concern among investors that the new Government of National Unity, dominated by the African National Congress (ANC), would spend excessively as it embarked upon its plan of reconstruction and development. Furthermore, inflation began to turn upwards as the country's economic recovery gathered momentum. The new government's ability and willingness to keep a tight control on the budget deficit continues to be watched closely by international investors. After all, the country's outstanding public debt amounts to a relatively high 55 per cent of gross domestic product. 'It is here that the ANC is expected to have its greatest difficulties, and it is here that people are expecting results,' said Mr Nicolas Blancher, an economist at Societe Generale, the French bank, in Paris. However, progress is being made. Tax revenues are growing and the government is likely to achieve its target for a budget deficit of 6.6 per cent GDP in 1994. The prospect is that it will fall further next year. What is more, although price pressures have been strong - inflation recently jumped to an annual rate of around 10 per cent - much of this was caused by a surge in food prices following the 1992-93 drought. Excluding food prices, inflation is running at a rate of about 7 per cent. In addition, there has been a dramatic turnround in the capital account of the balance of payments. The country's foreign exchange reserves came under pressure in the run up to April's elections as many foreign investors closed their books on South Africa. Since then, however, trade credits have been renewed and capital for project finance has begun to flow again. Net foreign exchange reserves have risen by R9bn since the election. To add to this, the success of the global bond offering is likely to precipitate a flood of bond issues from some of the country's major public and private institutions, as well as further offerings from the government itself. 'The capital account seems assured of performing very well,' said Mr Graham Bell, of Baring Securities in London. 'All the concerns about the bond market are gradually being eased.' As ever, the extent to which South African government bonds can make any progress will depend on the general sentiment in international bond markets. But with signs of stability emerging in the US and Europe, the outlook is encouraging. 'Rand bonds are poised to rally,' said Mr Bell. His view is shared by Mr Paul Abberley, head of fixed-income at fund managers Lombard Odier in London. 'The domestic market offers good value with attractive real yields and a relatively stable currency. There is always a political risk and the currency could come under pressure, but we're looking to buy back into the market,' he says. The greatest obstacles blocking foreign investment in South Africa have been the country's dual exchange rate system and exchange controls. Foreign investors wishing to buy domestic bonds must do so through the financial rand, a relatively illiquid and volatile second-tier currency which trades at a discount to the commercial rand, the currency which is used for all regular balance of payments transactions. However, the government says it wants to merge the currencies and lift controls. The prospect of that happening is likely to lead to a further strengthening of the financial rand against its commercial counterpart. That is another reason to buy South African bonds now, says Mr Bell, since investors will benefit from an appreciating currency. The gap between the two currencies has already narrowed significantly.</p>

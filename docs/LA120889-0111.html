			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> MASS KILLER NAMED BY MONTREAL POLICE  </P> <P> A gunman who killed 14 women, wounded 13 other people and killed himself here  Wednesday evening was identified Thursday night as Marc Lapin. He had used the  name "Marc" to sign a three-page suicide letter that police retrieved from his  pocket.  </P> <P> Canadian Broadcasting Corp., which reported that police had confirmed his  identity through his mother, said little was known about the gunman's  background. The broadcaster described him as being about 5-foot-9 inches tall  and weighing about 160 pounds, with brown hair and blue eyes.  </P> <P> In his letter, "Marc" said that he was going to have to die on Dec. 6, then  blamed his problems on "feminists who had always ruined his life," according to  Jacques Duchesneau, head of the Montreal police organized crimes unit. The  letter, which has not yet been released in full, also included a list of women  in Montreal. Police declined to reveal their names or speculate on why they  were mentioned in the letter.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the lone gunman walked into the Ecole Polytechnique of the  University of Montreal and went on what witnesses described as an anti-feminist  rampage. He fired shots into the ceiling and at students, then burst into a  classroom during an oral presentation and ordered the male students and teacher  out the door. One student said he heard the gunman say, "I want women."  </P> <P> According to survivors, the man then shouted an obscenity and called the women  "feminists" in French, and opened fire on them, killing six. He then left the  classroom and roamed the corridors, pausing to fire and reload as he went.  Eight women were fatally shot elsewhere in the building. One policeman arriving  at the scene discovered his own daughter among the dead.  </P> <P> As of Thursday, one of the injured was still in critical condition, and the  other 12 were said to be "stable." It was the worst mass killing ever in Canada  -- a country that tends to look upon senseless, violent crime as an American  phenomenon -- and the third worst in North America.  </P> <P> Duchesneau said the man's suicide note claimed he had "political reasons" for  committing the massacre but didn't explain what these were. The officer said  the letter further complained of a life of unhappiness, and especially the  unhappiness of the man's final seven years. "Marc" also wrote that he had tried  to enter the armed forces and been rejected as "anti-social," Duchesneau said.  Police said the killer, thought to be between 22 and 25 years old, didn't  address the handwritten note to anyone in particular.  </P> <P> In addition, police said, the letter referred to Cpl. Denis Lortie, a  well-known mass-killer who worked as a supply clerk at a Canadian Forces base  until 1984, then stole two sub-machine guns and a pistol and went on a shooting  spree in the Quebec National Assembly in Quebec City, killing three government  employees and wounding 13 other people.  </P> <P> Police said they were able to get a line on the gunman's identify by tracing  the purchase and registration of the weapon he used -- a .223-caliber Sturm  Ruger semi-automatic rifle, a gun commonly used in hunting. They said that they  had learned where the gun was purchased and that it appeared to have been  registered properly.  </P> <P> On the university campus Thursday, students seemed stunned by what had  happened.  </P> <P> "We were doing our oral presentation," said engineering student Roger  Thiffauld, who was in the room where the gunman killed four women and shot  himself. "The girl in my team had just finished her presentation, and I did  mine. Just when we were switching transparencies, the guy came in."  </P> <P> Thiffauld said he didn't hear the gunman make any anti-woman remarks, but as  all the students dove to the floor, he said he could hear him walking about the  room on the tops of the desks, picking out students here and there. At the  time, he said, he didn't realize it, but the killer was finding the women where  they lay and shooting them. He said that during the ordeal, the woman next to  him on the floor, just two or three feet away, was shot. She lay moaning and  eventually bled to death, he said.  </P> <P> "He was serious," Thiffauld said of the man. "He wasn't excited, or anything  like that."  </P> <P> Another engineering student, Mario Cantin, said he couldn't understand why the  man had singled out the women in the building. "The guys at Polytechnique are  quite happy that the number of women is increasing every year," he said, as he  bundled up for a candlelight vigil held for the dead in the bitter night air.  "I don't think they feel the women are stealing our jobs."  </P> <P> Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, speaking in Ottawa, expressed his shock at the  mass murders and sent his condolences to the families. Here in Quebec, Premier  Robert Bourassa told the legislature Thursday: "All of Quebec is in mourning."  </P></p>

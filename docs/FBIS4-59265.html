			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Professor Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's </F> ambassador to the United States and chief delegate to the talks  with Syria, by Washington correspondent Arye Golan on 11 May;  place not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Golan] Sir, we hear that the State Department has  very low expectations about Secretary of State Warren  Christopher's upcoming trip to the Middle East and it does not  expect an imminent breakthrough. Do you share this cautious  pessimism?    [Rabinovich] I would not necessarily use the pessimistic  language used here, in Washington, on the eve of the visit.  Lowering expectations in advance of trips by senior U.S.  statesmen to enable them to deal with the issues on the agenda  free of pressure for immediate achievements is a known pattern.    [Golan] Did Secretary of State Christopher voice any  reservations whatsoever about the Israeli package? In the  meetings you held with him and his peace team this week, did you  equip him with different or new ideas to present in Damascus?    [Rabinovich] The U.S. side had no reservations about the  Israeli package, I do not know what such reports are based on.    [Golan] Did he approve of the Israeli package?    [Rabinovich] No new ideas were required in the wake of our  discussions with the Americans this week. We presented our  so-called package to the secretary of state in his previous  visit. He relayed his impressions [as heard] to the Syrian side  and came back with reactions and counterproposals. We clearly  do not plan to go into any bargaining at this point. First of  all, we want to make sure that the Syrians fully realize that we  are talking about a comprehensive package in which every element  is part of a whole complex and that a specific issue cannot be  singled out. This is the package, and its principles are  nonnegotiable.</p>

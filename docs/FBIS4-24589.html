			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Liming (3769 7812 2494) ] </F>   [Text] Shenyang, 31 May (XINHUA)--Dandong City in Liaoning  Province is giving play to its geographical advantages and is  rapidly developing border trade with the DPRK. In the first  four months of this year, the volume of border trade exceeded  $17 million, an increase of 93 percent over the same period last  year.    Dandong City is located in the northern end of the mainland  coastline of China, and faces the DPRK's Sinuiju City across the  Yalu Jiang. It is one of the largest border cities in China.  In 1988, Dandong City was named as one of China's open cities,  and in 1992, the State Council approved the establishment of the  Dandong Border Economic Cooperation Zone. After that, Dandong  City made use of its favorable geographical position of being  adjacent to Korea and the doubly favorable policies for coastal  and border areas and has increased border trade with the DPRK  year after year. In 1993, the volume of Dandong's border trade  with the DPRK exceeded $52 million.    In Dandong's border trade with the DPRK, Dandong mainly  exports grain, pork, beef, textiles, chemical raw materials,  household electric appliances, and light industrial goods to the  Korean side, and mainly imports steel products, timber, aquatic  products, minerals, and silkworm cocoons from the Korean side.    As Dandong's opening up to the outside world continues its  expansion, the structure of trade with the DPRK has also  expanded from the previous sole pattern of barter trade to  plural forms of cash-based trade, processing trade, entrepot  trade, and the tourist trade. At present, there are more than  170 business companies engaged in trade with the DPRK. Trade  partners on the Korean side extend from Sinuiju to such interior  cities as Pyongyang and Wonsan. There is economic and trade  cooperation with an increasing number of the DPRK's large,  state-level commercial institutions.</p>

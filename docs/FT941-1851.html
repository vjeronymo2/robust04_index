			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Australia Air offered grant to move base The Victoria state government has offered a ADollars 5m (USDollars 3.5m) grant to Australia Air International if the carrier moves its headquarters from Sydney to Melbourne, writes Nikki Tait from Sydney. Australia Air was given the rights to weekly flights between Australia and Beijing last year, but has been unable to satisfy the International Air Service Commission that it has the funds to start operating. The offer is conditional on a ADollars 55m flotation of the airline during the next two months.</p>

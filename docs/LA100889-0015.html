			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RITA DOVE REMEMBERED  </P> <P> "A poem should not mean but be." Rita Dove's intriguing "Genetic Expedition"  (Book Review, Sept. 17) is, but it would have become even more meaningful to  many readers if you had provided more information about her than just her  photo. For example, the lines "My child has / her father's hips, his hair /  like the miller's daughter, combed gold" could be appreciated even more by  knowing that her German-born husband sports a blond mane. (He is Fred Viehbahn,  prize-winning novelist and essayist, as well as a guest professor at American  universities.)  </P> <P> The mention of German bread and radishes for breakfast, as well as the shades  of Rumpelstiltskin, do echo her immersion in German culture with a  Fulbright/Hays Fellowship in 1974-75. I know, because I arranged for her visit  in November 1981 to Cal State University, Fullerton. She lectured in perfect  German in my advanced literature class and in delightful English to a class on  American poetry.  </P> <P> G.

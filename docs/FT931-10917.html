			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Housing policy HOUSING associations have been at the forefront of the government's strategy for providing affordable homes for rent. They have shown themselves to be flexible, efficient and responsive landlords - unlike many of the local authorities they have supplanted. They have also been imaginative developers, raising the quality of social housing, and financing an increasing proportion of the cost by raising funds on the capital markets. It is surprising, therefore, that the government should be planning to cut its funding to housing associations. Following the Autumn Statement, the grant paid to associations is to be reduced from 72 per cent of the cost of each new home to 55 per cent by 1995. This means that the proportion of the cost which must be raised privately will rise from 28 per cent to 45 per cent, a step which could undo much of the good work associations have done. The first problem this causes will be in raising the private finance needed to complement government grant. It is unlikely that institutional investors will be prepared to provide the balance of 45 per cent of the cost against the security of a tenanted home. The Housing Corporation, the quango which supervises the housing associations, believes that only the most financially sound associations will then be able to borrow on the capital markets. It therefore proposes to reduce the number of associations which receive government grant for development from over 600 to under 100. This reduction in the number of associations building new homes is undesirable. It will concentrate development among a few 'premier league' associations, contrary to the government's aim of breaking up large social landlords. It will also exclude the smaller specialist associations which have catered successfully for students, single people and ethnic minorities. Even more undesirable, however, will be the dramatic rises in rents needed to service the higher level of private funding. These rents will be beyond the means of low-income families unless they are on benefits. Housing association estates will become welfare ghettos, recreating the worst aspects of council estates that associations were supposed to avoid. Worse, the government could find that the savings from the cuts in grant are wiped out by the additional housing benefit. That could lead to pressure to cut housing benefit, which might leave some tenants unable to pay the rent. Housing associations would then be further destabilised, while investors would be even less willing to invest in social housing. It is not too late to avoid these outcomes. The reduction in grant is to be phased in over three years. The government should reconsider its plans, and think again about cuts which could reduce the quality of social housing and recreate the sort of no-hope council estates which housing policy has rightly sought to eliminate.</p>

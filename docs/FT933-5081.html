			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / US textiles demand angers China China has said US demands for stricter penalties in a new textiles agreement violate bilateral and international trade pacts, AP reports from Beijing. Ms Jennifer Hillman, of the US trade representative's office, said on Saturday that China must crack down on transshipment of its textiles through third countries before a new agreement could be reached. Otherwise, the US could limit textile imports unilaterally whenever Chinese goods were found to cause market disruptions.</p>

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Marling unloads lossmaking subsidiary Marling Industries, the industrial textiles company, yesterday announced a 25 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits and the sale of its lossmaking German industrial webbing subsidiary. Mr David Abel Smith, chief executive, said that the disposal of Oppermann was part of the strategy of concentrating on higher margin products. 'We have now completed the task of eliminating the problems of the past.' The original owner, Mr Hans Dieter Oppermann, has acquired the company - which lost DM363,000 (Pounds 148,000) in the six months to September 30 - for the nominal consideration of DM1. Oppermann will retain debts of DM810,000. Marling is keeping Oppermann's seatbelt webbing business, which has been transferred to its Netherlands factory. It incurred a Pounds 1.24m loss on the disposal. Marling's pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 rose to Pounds 1.14m - after the Pounds 1.24m charge - compared with Pounds 910,000, which included Pounds 485,000 losses on disposals. Turnover advanced 8 per cent to Pounds 32m. That compared with Pounds 29.5m - including Pounds 4.04m from discontinued operations. Operating margins on continuing businesses rose from 7 per cent to 9.8 per cent, despite higher raw materials costs. Mr William Rollason, finance director, said that all the group's businesses had shown improvement. The main business, seatbelt webbing, benefited from increased demand in the UK and continental Europe. Gearing fell from 95 per cent to 83 per cent. Mr Rollason said the ratio would be 70 to 75 per cent at the year end. Earnings per share fell to 0.08p (0.29p). The company said that on continuing operations, and before charges, earnings rose to 0.78p (0.35p). The interim dividend is 0.25p (0.2p), payable as a foreign income dividend.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Budva, 22 May -- After almost two years everyone  knows that the sanctions against the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia [FRY] are absurd and unjust. However, even if they  were just, they need to be more flexible, at least enough to  acknowledge the basic humanitarian needs. Montenegrin Prime  Minister Milo Djukanovic said this at a news conference today  with a group of international journalists who have been in  Budva, Montenegro, for three days. They go to Serbia on 23 May.    Djukanovic said that the negative consequences of the  sanctions on the Montenegrin economy have caused more than $5  billion in damage, with the greatest repercussions on the  humanitarian situation because Montenegro is supporting about  50,000 refugees, 20 percent of whom are Muslim. He said  Montenegro has been coping with a serious humanitarian crisis  for months. UN bodies have not yet aproved a single request for  the import of certain goods which would ease humanitarian and  other problems.    The Montenegrin prime minister was frequently asked about  the  effects of the sanctions and how long Montenegro will be able to  endure them. Djukanovic said that the international blockade  has been a complete fiasco, but if someone is interested in  testing our ability to suffer, the nation is resilient and can  endure the imposed hardships.    Illustrating the deadly effects of the sanctions, the  Montenegrin prime minister said the government had already sold  several vessels from the republic's relatively opulent fleet.  However, a number of vessels are in danger because they are  trapped in foreign ports, and the costs of their anchorage are  growing alarmingly day by day. [passage omitted]    Djukanovic was also asked repeatedly about Montenegro's  position in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Djukanovic said  that most citizens of Montenegro would be in favor of a joint  state with Serbia; others are iin favor of that, but only with  absolute equality between the federal members. Montenegro will  not back up on that position by a millimeter, the prime minister  said. He added that there are secessionist and unitaristic  political forces in both Montenegro and Serbia. In this context  he mentioned certain political trends from within the Serbian  Academy of Science and Arts and certain political views voiced  at the recent congress of Serbian intellectuals. However, he  stressed that official policy does not support those views,  either in Serbia or in Montenegro.    Any denial of Montenegro as a separate entity and the denial  of its equality has a very destructive and destabilizing effect  on the FRY, Djukanovic warned, and said that the overall  constitutional commitments do not threaten Montenegro's position  in any way.

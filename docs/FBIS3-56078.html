			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Economics Minister Ojars Kehris reported on  returning to Latvia that during a visit to Baku an official  Latvian government delegation established diplomatic relations  with Azerbaijan and concluded a trade and economic cooperation  agreement.    The Latvian delegation met Azerbaijani President Geydar  Aliyev and representatives of the government.    Due to the unstable political situation and the state of war  in Azerbaijan, possibilities for cooperation are limited, but  successful development cannot be ruled out in the future.    Latvia also plans to conclude similar agreements with  Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.</p>

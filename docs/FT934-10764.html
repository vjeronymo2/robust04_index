			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / De Benedetti legal team voices optimism Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the Olivetti chairman, could be back at work 'within two or three days,' according to lawyers defending him against charges of alleged corruption, writes Haig Simonian from Milan. Mr De Benedetti was placed under house arrest on Tuesday after giving himself up to police in Milan. Following a transfer to Rome, where he was formally jailed, he was interrogated by magistrates investigating political corruption. The terms of Mr De Benedetti's detention at his home in one of the most prestigious parts of Rome are relatively lax. Unlike some businessmen implicated in the 21-month corruption scandal, Mr De Benedetti has been allowed to receive visitors and to use the telephone to conduct his business affairs. However, Rome magistrates have forbidden him from leaving home until they can weigh up the 'new' information, which they claim emerged from Tuesday's two interrogations. Mr De Benedetti admitted in May to Milan magistrates then investigating alleged kickbacks to post office officials that Olivetti had paid about L10.6bn (Pounds 4.4m) in bribes to win equipment contracts.</p>

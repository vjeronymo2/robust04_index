			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary prepared by the News Research and Commentaries </F> Group]    [Text] A bill for foreign aid in 1994 amounting to $20.861  billion has been submitted to Congress. The Zionist regime is  to receive more than $3 billion, while Egypt is to receive  $2.116 billion of this amount.    Political observers believe that such so-called financial  aid  is to pursue objectives that are 100-percent political in  nature. The six-point criteria of the U.S. State Department,  which is in charge of distributing this aid, does not fully  justify the method of distribution, and this signals the  existence of other covert motives.    The allocation of more than $6 billion of this aid to boost  the U.S. economy by expanding commercial ties with East European  countries and countries of the former Soviet Union shows that  the major objective of the United States behind such aid is to  expand its foreign markets by creating dependence. Also, the  allocation of about $3 billion of this aid to the defense of  democracy on the international scene reveals another truth. The  use of this aid by Israel, whose hands are stained with the  blood of the Palestinian people, as well as by the Egyptian  regime, which imprisons or murders dozens of combatant Muslims  on charges of fundamentalism, shows what kind of democracy the  United States supports.    The allocation of $5.225 billion, or in other words,  one-fourth of U.S. foreign aid, to Middle East peace reveals how  important the success of the current talks on solving the Middle  East crisis is for Washington and the White House rulers. Until  now, the Zionist regime has successfully played its role of  middleman between the West and part of the Third World and has  been able to increase the dependence of these countries on the  West. Extensive U.S. investment in making the so-called Middle  East peace process successful will decrease the regional  differences that Israel and the United States are facing and  will pave the way for the infiltration of the Zionist regime in  the Arab and Islamic world.    Even though U.S. plans for extending financial aid are based  on political realities and the extent of cooperation among  governments, there are other variants that upset these plans.  When the Camp David compromise deal was signed, various  agreements in the field of political and economic cooperation  and especially in the field of tourism, industry, and  agriculture were signed. However, the steely determination of  the Egyptian people prevented the implementation of most of  these agreements. Now the Zionist regime's industrial and  agricultural cooperation with Egypt, as well as tourist  exchanges between the two countries, are at the zero level.  This reality shows how effective the people are in the outcome  of decisions.</p>

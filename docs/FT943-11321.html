			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Retail sales - Directors' Transactions The beginning of the week was marked by a high level of selling in blue chip retailing companies. David Quarmby, one of the joint managing directors of J Sainsbury, sold more than 35,000 shares at 393.5p, a total reduction of 27 per cent from his existing holding. At Marks and Spencer, Andrew Stone sold more than 13,000 shares, a 15 per cent reduction. The largest sale of the week was not in a retailer, but at Granada Group. Charles Allen, who heads up the television operations, sold 145,000 shares at 537p. The company said the sale had been made to fund the purchase of a house, but we note that the period of outperformance that the stock has enjoyed over the past year, appears to be ending. Nigel Alliance is already a substantial shareholder in N Brown Group, home catalogue retailing company. His stake accounts for more than 12 per cent. Last summer he sold a considerable amount of stock: 800,000 shares around the 190p mark after adjusting for the one-for-one rights issue announced in the middle of July. Since then he has been buying stock: 238,000 shares around the 231p mark. Johnston Group is a tightly-held stock in which family interests account for almost 50 per cent of the equity. The last time Michael Johnston bought stock was more than a year ago around the 114p mark. Since then, the company's stock has outperformed the market by 70 per cent and analysts forecast results moving from loss to profit this year.  -------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  --------------------------------------------------------------------                                                               No of Company                      Sector     Shares      Value   directors  -------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Austin Reed                    RetG     65,300    148,884       1 * Delyn Group                    PP&amp;P     20,000     17,600       1 Granada Group                  L&amp;Hl    145,000    778,650       1 London Scottish Bank           OthF     42,300     47,799       2 Marks &amp; Spencer                RetG     15,170     65,383       2 RIT Capital Partners           InvT    225,000    396,000       1 Sainsbury (J)                  RetF     35,467    139,563       1  -------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  -------------------------------------------------------------------- 3i                             InvT    217,733    592,234       5 BCE Holdings (Pens trust)      L&amp;Hl    135,000     13,163       1 Bentalls                       RetG      9,000     10,080       1 Boustead                       EngV     50,000     14,000       1 Brown (N) Group                RetG    238,000    556,920       1 Carpetright                    RetG     20,000     48,200       1 Christie Group                 OthF     20,000     12,000       1 Dewhirst Group                 Text     30,000     39,000       1 El Oro Mining                   n/a     10,000     57,500       1 Greene King                    Brew     15,000     70,350       1 Herald Invst Trust (Warrant)   InvT     50,000     20,000       1 Inveresk                       PP&amp;P     24,000     38,400       3 Johnston Group                 BM&amp;M     10,000     26,700       1 McKay Securities               Prop     14,755     26,707       1 Mercury Asset Man.

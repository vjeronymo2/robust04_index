The PKK militants cut off the  Diyarbakir-Lice road and abducted 16 people, 14 of them civil  servants.    [Begin off-screen reporter recording] The terrorists stopped  vehicles travelling from Lice to Diyarbakir near the village of  Guclu last night and abducted 16 travelers. Some 14 of them  were civil servants working at various public organizations in  Lice. Operations are continuing in the region to catch the  terrorists.    Elsewhere, the fire that broke out at the Iraq-Ceyhan crude  oil pipeline as a result of sabotage has been extinguished. The  damage is being assessed and efforts are under way to collect  the crude oil in wells dug by teams of workers. The oil had  spread to the surrounding area. The valves on the pipeline will  be replaced before repair work starts.

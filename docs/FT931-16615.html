			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Kosovo PM seeks help for Serbia's 'next target': A warning of war spreading THE strong showing of ultra-nationalists in Serbian elections last month set alarm bells ringing from Moscow to Washington over the heightened danger of war spreading to Macedonia and Kosovo. Sceptics, on the other hand, said an over-stretched Serbia was unlikely to risk it. Mr Bujar Bukoshi, prime minister of the self-declared Republic of Kosova, as ethnic Albanians call what used to be the Yugoslav autonomous province of Kosovo before its re-integration into Serbia by Serbian leader Mr Slobodan Milosevic, is not so sanguine. 'Serbia is well armed and able to fight not just on two but on five fronts at the same time,' he says. 'The Serbs are not mad, but they continue to do irrational things.' In London as part of a tour of European capitals, Mr Bukoshi says his aim is 'to alarm the civilised world and prevent conflict spilling over to Kosovo as the next target of Serbian aggression'. 'The situation in Kosovo is much more tense after elections which brought criminals like Zeljko Raznjatovic (better known as 'Commander Arkan') and Vojislav Seselj of the ultra-nationalist Radical party into top positions in the Serbian government,' he adds. As 'an urgent first step' he calls for the despatch of several thousand UN forces to Kosovo, where it has only 16 observers. Mr Bukoshi, a 45-year-old doctor now based in Germany, was chosen as prime minister after clandestine multi-party elections last May. The election in the Serbia poll of the two ultra-nationalists recently named as 'war criminals' by Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, the US secretary of state, confirms that Serbia is seeking a Nazi-style 'final solution' in Kosovo, Mr Bukoshi warns. Both men were involved in the worst of 'ethnic cleansing' in Croatia and Bosnia and openly threaten to expel ethnic Albanians who make up 90 per cent of the 1.9m population of Kosovo, and reclaim the medieval Serbian kingdom, he adds. Mass expulsion of unarmed ethnic Albanians would almost certainly lead to large-scale violence which would increase pressure on western leaders to intervene, partly to forestall military support from fellow-Moslem countries and the spread of the Yugoslav war to Albania, with unpredictable consequences for the region. 'The Serbs are demanding historical rights, the rights of those dead for 500 years, while suppressing the human rights of those who live there now,' he argues. 'It is absurd to ignore 500 years of Ottoman rule. The Serbs only regained Kosovo in the 1912 Balkan war, and now they are also preparing 'ethnic cleansing' in territories like Vojvodina, with 400,000 ethnic Hungarians and other minorities. But Vojvodina was never part of historical Serbia, and only ceded by the Treaty of Berlin in 1878.' Faced with armed oppression, Kosovars have created a parallel state, with a clandestinely elected president, prime minister and parliament, as well as underground schools and hospitals. It is a tactic pioneered by Solidarity in Poland under martial law. Part of the aim has been to prevent anger spilling over into open revolt and giving the Serbs an excuse for further repression. 'We deserve the Nobel prize for patience,' says Mr Bukoshi wryly. 'But the international community must now help us to breathe freely. Our autonomy, our schools, our elemental human rights, everything has been taken away. We are treated like animals to be exterminated.' Unlike Poles, who were repressed by a Polish general to pre-empt possible Soviet occupation, Kosovars are at the mercy of alien forces. The 200,000 ethnic Serbs left in Kosovo are well armed and organised in para-military units. Serb garrisons dominate many towns and villages and control roads, railways, Pristina airport, and the hills surrounding villages. Serb forces are also massed just over the Serbian and Montenegrin borders. The oppression is not only military. More than 85 per cent of Albanian Kosovars have lost their jobs, forcing the community back on family solidarity and the fertile land which provides 70 per cent of their food. Above all they rely on remittances from nearly 250,000 Kosovars working mainly in Germany and Switzerland. Corruption is rife, Mr Bukoshi says. Serb police and para-military shake down returning Gastarbeiter, confiscate goods and hidden money and then sell both on the black market.</p>

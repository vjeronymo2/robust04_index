			<p>BFN     [Text] Canada is not enthusiastic about the idea of sending  more peacekeeping troops to Rwanda. Defense Minister David  Collenette says a UN relief effort such as being used in Bosnia  would have to be approved by the Canadian cabinet. He said a  solution to the chaos in Rwanda may have to be part of a larger  solution to war, famine, disease, and poverty in Africa. The UN  has reduced the number of its peacekeepers in Rwanda from 2,500  to about 270.    The head of the UN contingent, Canadian Major General Romeo  Dallaire, says more peacekeepers would help the situation there.  The UN is reported to be studying a plan to pay for African  troops to intervene in the Rwandan civil war.</p>

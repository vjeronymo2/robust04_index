Wang, who has  formerly served as deputy director of the Beijing Institute of  Social and Economic Sciences, is to be released so he can  receive medical treatment, the source said. During the U.S.-PRC  summit meeting in Seattle last November, U.S. President Bill  Clinton expressly cited Wang's name and asked Chinese President  Jiang Zemin to have Wang released. In view of the approaching  expiration of the most-favored-nation (MFN) status for China  next June, it is believed China plans to release Wang as a  gesture toward the United States for requesting renewal of the  status.    On renewal of the status, the Clinton administration has  maintained it an imperative condition that improvements be made  in China's human rights issue. U.S. Secretary of Treasury Lloyd  Bentsen plans to address Chinese leaders to reiterate U.S.  position on this issue during his planned visit to Beijing on 19  January. Moreover, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher  plans to ask Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen during a  foreign ministerial meeting in Paris on 24 January that  improvements be made on the human rights issue.    China has already expressed its willingness to accept  inspections of its prisons by the International Committee of the  Red Cross. Recently, it also dropped charges against two Tibetan  political prisoners and released them. The United States,  however, has asserted these actions are insufficient.</p>

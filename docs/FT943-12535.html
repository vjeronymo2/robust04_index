			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Management: When tears are good for business When Roger Fernley heard that the bid for London Transport's advertising arm had been referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, he wept. Far from feeling embarrassed about his outburst, the managing director of British Transport Advertising wrote to the FT last week and told us all about it. I was so surprised to read his letter that I phoned him up to ask whether this was his idea of a joke. On the contrary, he said, he had been angry, incredulous and disappointed, and had shed real tears. In so doing, he broke the ultimate corporate taboo. I have just done some research into tears in business and found barely a wet eye anywhere. Robert Maxwell was constantly sobbing, but then he was always a law unto himself. It is said that Freddie Laker was close to tears when Laker Airways collapsed and that Sir Kenneth Berrill had a lump in his throat when he failed to be reappointed as chairman of the SIB. I have also heard that Michael Green of Carlton was damp eyed in the 1980s on discovering that he had lost the BSB contract. But all of these tales are years out of date, few and far between, and none amounts to a good public weep. There are examples of grown men blubbing openly in politics and sports, often to advantage. Bob Hawke, the former Australian PM, greatly increased his popularity by sobbing over everything from domestic difficulties to the massacre in Tiananmen Square. Even more famously, Paul Gascoigne, the footballer, showed himself to be a human being when he broke down on receiving a yellow card in the 1990 World Cup. But businessmen? Never. The only time they seem to cry is when seriously frustrated: when they have missed an aeroplane, or cannot make a foreign bureaucrat do as they want. Earlier this month I saw an executive in black tie close to tears at Victoria station having learnt that trains to Glyndebourne were not running. By shedding these sort of impotent tears, businessmen look foolish. By contrast, to cry at critical moments in a company's history could add a certain something to the occasion and might encourage others to be more understanding. It would, of course, be intolerable if executives cried at the smallest setback. Displays of emotion can be a form of manipulation - and there is enough of that in office life already. But on big occasions tears could be called for. If Graham Hearne of Enterprise Oil had wept on losing the battle for Lasmo, people might have been sympathetic rather than carping away about how he must drop one of his posts as chairman or chief executive. Fernley's tears may not influence those hard-hearted pen pushers in the DTI and at the MMC. But they show he is a human being who is not afraid to admit as much. It has only just been drawn to my attention that Harrods, the tourist attraction in Knightsbridge, does not let shoppers in to buy its pricey goods unless they are suitably dressed. On the face of it, this seems a bizarre policy. Surely Harrods knows that the customer is king, and that those in shorts and vests deserve the same fawning service as ones in suits and designer frocks? It is all very well for pubs to specify no work clothes, as they do not want souvenirs from the building site on their upholstery. But a pair of designer jeans with a rip on the knee does not hurt anyone. I now see this is a naive reaction. Harrods has explained to me that lady customers were offended by 'sweaty hairy men with their armpits or crotches on display'. The store also pointed that something urgent had to be done given that 'shopping at Harrods is the most pleasurable thing that many of our customers do all week'. Leaving that remarkable assertion to one side, Harrods is on to something. The image of a business is dependent not just on its own actions, but on the customers it attracts. Just as shops can reasonably tell customers not to smoke, they should also be able to insist on any other standards they see fit. If people do not like it they can always take their custom elsewhere. The fact that Harrods' dress code has been greeted with such suspicion shows that the customer-is-always-right mentality has gone too far. Sometimes the customer is a damn nuisance and I admire the companies that do not stand for it. Well done also to Standard Chartered for its fine and upstanding declaration that it will withdraw from any country that relies on bribes or unethical business practice. I shall be fascinated to see how it gets on. The bank does business in a long list of countries where I had always thought large and small backhanders were part of the cost of being there. If Standard Chartered stays in those places, that will be proof that stories of corruption are overdone or out of date. Alternatively, it just could mean that no such international operation should make sweeping declarations of that kind and hope to live by them.</p>

This decision was made  today during a meeting of the Supervision and Control Commission  [CSC] of the General Peace Accord. A total of 5 percent of  troops from both sides will be demobilized in a first phase.    Until 1 March Finance Minister Eneas Comiche will create  conditions to immediately pay the subsidies to the demobilized  troops and to speed up solving the problems connected with their  integration into civilian life.    Aldo Ajello, special representative of the UN secretary  general in Mozambique, said although there is a considerable  delay in the process, the demobilization process could continue  until June.    During today's CSC meeting the government, Renamo and the UN  Operations in Mozambique signed an agreement on criteria on the  selection and training regulations of the special forces of the  army.</p>

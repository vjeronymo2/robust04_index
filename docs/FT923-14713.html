			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Italy (13): The brakes are kept on - Transport projects are taking too long ROME was not built in a day; even the project for rebuilding the capital's underground railway has taken some time. Indeed, for several years passengers have been able to observe the leisurely pace at which work is progressing to improve the stations and lines. Commuters will probably be seeing lightly-manned work-sites for many more years as, little by little, the project is brought to completion. Travellers using Rome's 'Grande Raccordo Anulare' have been fretting with similar experiences; first as the ring road was upgraded to dual-carriageway, and more recently during the construction of a third lane. The sight of contractors' equipment lying idle for extensive periods is commonplace in this highway project which, like many others, seems to lack a sense of urgency. Even before sites are opened, delays are affecting a much-needed doubling of the trans-Apennine Bologna to Florence a u t o s t r a d a t o r e l i e v e saturation on the existing road. Though the engineering for the 59-kilometre section has been completed, the construction go-ahead has been awaited since early this year. It seems unlikely that work will get under way before 1993. This year's hold-ups have been attributed to environmental impact studies for the project. But other factors have put a brake on it, not least politics and public sector finances. Indeed, political problems were present from the start, with the regional authorities of Emilia Romagna and Tuscany initially failing to agree about the project. Recent delays owe something to political problems at national level; the paralysis towards the end of the Andreotti government and during the difficult formation of a new government after April's parliamentary elections put major decisions on hold. The Milan kickback scandal that broke this spring, with revelations of widespread corruption in subway, railway and airport projects that involved politicians and civil engineering contractors, is reported to have held up the award of many contracts. Apart from the caution induced by the Milan scandal, difficulties in public sector finances, which have become acute over the past year, are also delaying projects. Lack of finance helps explain the slow progress of work on transport schemes, which are often sub-divided into small jobs for which funds can be more easily be disbursed. Railway projects as well as roads have been affected by adverse political, financial and administrative factors. For example, though most of the track of the new fast line between Rome and Florence is now in use, after two decades the p r o j e c t is still not completed. With the start on the Bologna to Florence autostrada project put back, there are concerns for the high-speed rail link between the two cities, whose construction is planned at about the same time and over the same terrain. The rail line is part of TAV (treno ad alta velocita - high-speed train) network that was announced last year. This will have five new lines totalling 950 kilometres that will connect Turin to Milan, Milan to Bologna, Milan to Venice, Bologna to Florence and Rome to Naples. A novel feature of the TAV, a project that will require total investment of about L30,000bn, is its attempt to marry public and private sectors in a joint venture framework. But, so far, backing has come essentially from public sector banks, and foreign interest, deterred by the state of public sector finances, has been negligible. Another feature of the TAV is the designation of general contractors who will bear responsibility for ensuring that works are completed on time and to budget, with penalties and premiums for late and early completion. Two state holding corporations, IRI and ENI, and private sector Fiat have signed up as contractors. The TAV is still a long way from being transformed from a paper project into concrete reality, and it is hard to see it keeping on track. When the project was announced, there was talk of moving the first earth in spring. Meanwhile, talk of carrying the first passengers on the Rome to Naples line in 1996 looks even more a flight of fantasy now than it did last year. But, at least, the project represents a recognition of the great need to modernise Italy's railway system. However, the railway corporation must also make major improvements to goods transport. Austria and Switzerland are both upgrading their railways. They have been restricting the p a s s a g e of Italian trucks for some time, and Italian industrialists are worried that environmental considerations will lead to further curbs on trans-Alpine goods transport by road. A recent report from Confindustria, the industrialrisk seeing our goods marginalised from the EC, to which most exports are sent.' Only 10 per cent of Italy's international freight traffic at present travels by train and 16 per cent by sea, while 58 per cent goes by road. It is a index of poor efficiency in the country's port facilities that, when they despatch goods overseas, Italian exporters often find it more convenient to transport by truck for shipment from ports outside Italy. The stevedores' pickets in Genoa at the end of June were symptomatic of the difficulties in this part of the transport sector. Notwithstanding Italy's lengthy c o a s t l i n e and its numerous ports, domestic transport of goods by sea is negligible. Confindustria's research indicates that only one tenth of 1 per cent of this traffic is carried by ship. And while railway use is higher, at under 5 per cent the figure is still low. Cost and convenience have forced Italian business to prefer to transport goods by road. Confindustria says that 94 per cent of Italy's total internal goods traffic is moved in trucks. The 1986 national transport plan forecast annual growth of 3.5 per cent in goods traffic in the period to the end of the century. With the forecast for the year 2000 already reached last year, it is not surprising that the autostrade arteries are clogging up. Clogged up or choking are also apt descriptions for Italy's major c i t i e s where the authorities have been forced to ban private cars on several occasions during the past year, as exhaust emissions hit dangerous levels. The urban transport problem seems to be intractable, particularly in the capital. Serious shortcomings encourage the use of the private car, thereby worsening the congestion and causing still more people to abandon the buses. Industrial disputes are also a discouragement to passenger loyalty. There is little to relieve a desolate transport scene. Urban passenger systems and road, rail and sea transportation for freight have fallen behind the modernisation levels of other EC countries. How has air transport measured up to the challenges? Here, too, not enough has been done, argues Mr Gastone Nardoni, deputy chairman of Ibar, the foreign airlines association. A big complaint concerns airport and air traffic services and costs. 'Services fall short of appropriate standards and costs are high and opaque. They are over-manned and inefficient, and the user has to foot the bill,' says Mr Nardoni. He adds that the foreign airlines' complaints have been referred to the anti-trust authority. There is a widespread belief that Italy's monopoly, state-owned flag-carrier Alitalia enjoys preferential treatment. 'Why are national costs so different? What criteria are used in the calculations?' asks Mr Nardoni. Conditions are not easy for Ibar's members, who also have to contend with a Levantine bureaucracy, strikes at short notice and technical backwardness which not infrequently leads to major airports being fogbound. The gloomy reality that characterises the Italian transport sector, road, rail, sea and air, is of great concern to business. Referring to infrastructural shortcomings and the low level of public services, Confindustria notes: 'Transport represents for industry an essential means for getting to the market in the right way and at the right time.'</p>

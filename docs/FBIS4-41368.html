			<p>BFN     [Text] [No dateline as received] -- On 22 June the  Ukrainian Naval Forces' press center announced that some of the  mass media circulated reports by the Black Sea Fleet press  center to the effect that "addressing the electorate of the city  of Donetsk, Ukraine's Supreme Council Speaker Oleksandr Moroz  spoke out for a single Black Sea Fleet, which should serve the  interests of the fraternal peoples of Ukraine and Russia." It  was also reported that Oleksandr Moroz believed the Black Sea  Fleet should be commanded jointly, following NATO's example.    The Ukrainian Naval Forces' press center declares that the  Black Sea Fleet press center's report grossly distorts the  meaning of the statement made by Ukraine's Supreme Council  chairman concerning the solution of the Black Sea Fleet issue.  In Donetsk Oleksandr Moroz spoke out in favor of setting up a  united command of the Ukrainian and Russian fleets on the Black  Sea. At the same time he emphasized that "this command should  be united, not a joint one."    The Ukrainian Naval Forces command believes that the  leadership of the Black Sea Fleet thus, mistakes the wish for  the reality and reiterates that the negotiating process on the  Black Sea Fleet division is continuing at the governmental level  at which both sides point out unequivocally that the fleet must  be divided.</p>

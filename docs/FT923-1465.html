			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Russia freezes trade with Ukraine FINANCIAL transactions between Ukraine and Russia, the two largest former Soviet republics, have been frozen since Friday when Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, chairman of the Russian central bank, bowed to pressure from reformers and said he would no longer accept payments from Ukraine. Blocking Ukrainian-Russian trade, which accounts for about 70 per cent of inter-republican trade, is likely to deepen the recession in most former Soviet republics. It represents another blow to the faltering financial links between the republics of the Commonwealth of Independent States. A senior official at the National Bank of Ukraine confirmed yesterday that Russia would not accept further payments from Ukraine. The rationale is Russia's contention that by issuing credit to Ukrainian enterprises, which in turn purchased goods from Russia, Ukraine is exporting inflation to its northern neighbour. 'These actions will only speed Ukraine's exit from the rouble zone,' a senior Ukrainian banker said. This banking wrangle coincides with a continuing struggle between Mr Gerashchenko, a conservative thought to favour Russia's powerful industrial lobby, and Mr Igor Gaidar, Russia's reformist prime minister. Against Mr Gaidar's wishes, on September 10 Mr Gerashchenko signed an agreement with Mr Vadim Hetman, chairman of the National Bank of Ukraine, which was aimed at simplifying payments between the two republics. Russian reformers have been outspoken in their criticism of the deal which they say would allow Ukraine to sabotage Mr Gaidar's efforts to tighten Russian monetary policy by flooding Russia with devalued 'Ukrainian' roubles. Ukrainian banking officials said that Russia shares the blame for Ukraine's runaway emission of credit. According to Ukrainian calculations, Russian enterprises, feeling the pinch of Mr Gaidar's austerity measures, have amassed a debt of Rbs300bn to Ukrainian enterprises. Mr Viktor Ilin, Ukraine's deputy minister of finance, reacted angrily yesterday to Russia's freeze on payments from Ukraine. He said the Russian move could lead to mass bankruptcy of enterprises and a catastrophic collapse in trade between Ukraine and Russia. Mr Ilin said the Russian decision was likely to hasten Ukraine's exit from the rouble zone and the introduction of a separate currency. 'Russia is pursuing a protectionist policy,' Mr Ilin said. 'Russia seeks to dictate conditions to Ukraine and to force Ukraine into economic dependency.' The financial crisis has highlighted a fundamental flaw in the banking system of the former Soviet Union. While Russia is the only republic able to print paper roubles, the central banks of all 15 former Soviet republics have the ability to issue credits. This means that Russia's efforts to tighten monetary policy can be sabotaged by a loose credit policy in any of the other republics.</p>

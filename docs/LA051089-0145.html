			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SWISS UNVEIL PROPOSAL TO BAN MONEY-LAUNDERING  </P> <P> The Swiss government unveiled plans today to outlaw money-laundering and  prevent criminals abusing Swiss bank secrecy to dispose of their loot.  </P> <P> Justice Minister Arnold Koller said money-laundering should be made a crime  punishable by up to five years in prison or a fine of $595,000.  </P> <P> "Switzerland does not need dirty money," he told a press conference in Berne.  "The government wants to make a contribution to the fight against drug  trafficking, money-laundering and organized crime."  </P> <P> Koller was outlining a bill that will be put before parliament this year. It  could become law in 1990.  </P> <P> Switzerland has been criticized in recent years by police in other countries  who say its bank secrecy laws make it a safe haven for the proceeds of crime.  </P> <P> Koller said the new law would make it an offense for anyone to help to conceal  the origin of money that he had reason to suspect was obtained through crime.  </P> <P> It would also oblige banks to check the identity of the real beneficiaries of  money or valuables deposited with them.  </P></p>

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Pounds, pioneers and more pounds: The Channel tunnel opens this week, late and over budget. Andrew Taylor says it is not unique Sir Alastair Morton and Mr Andre Benard, co-chairmen of Eurotunnel, will on Friday join the ranks of engineering pioneers such as Thomas Telford, Isambard Brunel and Ferdinand de Lesseps who have presided over grand engineering projects completed late and over budget. The official opening of the Channel tunnel by the Queen and President Francois Mitterrand of France is a year later than originally planned. A full service is unlikely to be available until the autumn. The cost of the project, at more than Pounds 10bn including interest payments, is more than double the Pounds 4.8bn forecast in 1987. Shareholders, who have invested Pounds 1.6bn already, will be asked later this summer to find another Pounds 500m-Pounds 750m as Eurotunnel seeks to raise yet more cash to meet the spiralling costs. Similarly, banks will have to lend more. Their experience, and those of promoters of other large engineering projects, raises the question of whether such pioneering schemes are suitable for private investment when they are almost impossible to cost in advance. Potential promoters of the Pounds 2.7bn proposed high-speed rail link between the Channel tunnel and London have succesfully argued that the government should share the financial risk as it can take a broader view of other social and economic benefits which the development may bring. The UK government says it will bear part of the cost but the amount has not been decided. Developments which have substantially exceeded their original budgets in recent years include the Thames Barrier which cost Pounds 46m (compared with an original price of Pounds 23m), and the NatWest Tower in the City of London, Pounds 115m (Pounds 15m). Outside the UK, the Seikan rail tunnel, connecting the island of Hokkaido to mainland Japan was completed 14 years late and billions of pounds over budget. History is littered with grandiose schemes which have failed to satisfy the original expectations of bankers, investors and politicians. Yet many have come to be regarded as successes bringing great strategic advantages. Mr Patrick de Pelet, head of project finance at Kleinwort Benson merchant bank, says: 'The political, commercial and financial risks involved in large infrastructure projects are such that the private sector will look to the government to bridge the gap to bring the economics into balance in this more demanding climate.' Mr Roland Paxton, historian at the Institution of Civil Engineers, says large projects have particular features which make it difficult to forecast the cost and construction time. He says the scale of the work means that construction, invariably, has to start before detailed designs are completed and potential problems and bottlenecks can be identified. Engineers without detailed plans tend to be over-optimistic in their projections, particularly with nervous bankers and shareholders to convince. For example, a cooling system in the Channel tunnel was not included in the original plans. The need for one only became apparent when final designs revealed that friction caused by the passage of some of the world's largest trains, together with heat generated by signalling, communications and other equipment, would increase the temperature inside the tunnels to 50'C. As a result engineers had to install hundreds of kilometres of pipes to pump 220 litres of water a second, chilled to 3'C by cooling plants equivalent to 25,000 domestic refrigerators. Designs on long-running projects also have a habit of changing. Mr Neville Simms, chief executive of Tarmac, one of the five British and five French construction companies which built the Channel tunnel says: 'The speed of technological development has been such that even if we had spent two years preparing detailed designs before starting work we would have had to change them before construction was completed.' Even if the technology is simple, the scale of large projects in itself makes costings unreliable, if only because there is no previous experience to draw on. Organisation and communication problems are different between, say, a 5km and a 50km tunnel. More than 800,000 concrete segments, 22,000 tonnes of railway track, 15,000 supports to carry overhead power lines and 20,000 light fittings were just some of the components installed in the Channel tunnel. Mr Michel Barbier, responsible for installing mechanical and electrical equipment from France, described the process of transporting much of that equipment through the narrow tunnel mouth as like 'force feeding a goose in a very short space of time to produce the best ever pate de foie gras'. Such problems are hardly new. Thomas Telford, who built the Menai bridge between the island of Anglesey and the Welsh mainland in 1826 - then the world's largest suspension bridge - had expected the scheme to be completed in three years at a cost of Pounds 70,000. Instead he found the technology outpacing him. The bridge took eight years to build and cost Pounds 170,000 after Telford was persuaded that it would be stronger if he increased the height of its towers. The bridge improved an important Anglo-Irish trade route and gave Britain a lead in bridge building technology which it was able to exploit elsewhere. The financing of the Suez Canal, completed in 1869, is a classic example of engineers persuading investors that they would be able to meet over-optimistic cost forecasts. The private-sector project, proposed by Ferdinand de Lesseps, a French entrepreneur, was to be financed by the issue of 400,000 shares at FFr500 each to meet the Pounds 8m construction cost. But the project finished a year late and cost Pounds 18m. Even then, shareholders' problems were not over. Revenue from the canal failed to cover costs and the promised 5 per cent dividend on the shares. Ishmail Pasha, the viceroy of Egypt, whose family had spent Pounds 6.8m on the canal shares, sold his stake to the British government for Pounds 4m. De Lesseps ran into still more serious trouble with plans to finance privately the Panama Canal. The project was forecast in 1880 to cost Dollars 240m, including interest repayments. It was expected to take 12 years to complete. The venture was eventually finished in 1914 by the US government after the French venture failed in 1889 having spent Dollars 287m and made little progress in building the canal. The US spent a further Dollars 352m on the project, making a total of Dollars 639m - more than two and a half times the original budget. Another private-sector project that had to be rescued by a government was the first tunnel under the River Thames built 150 years ago by Marc Isambard Brunel (father of Isambard Kingdom Brunel). Shareholders lost all of their money but the project was an engineering triumph breaking new ground in tunneling technology. The tunnel is still used as part of the London Underground. Telford, De Lesseps and Brunel may have failed to meet their original financial targets - and many shareholders have had their fingers burnt. But their projects have yielded strategic and economic benefits over many years. With Eurotunnel shareholders facing yet another call on their cash, that might bring them a little satisfaction.</p>

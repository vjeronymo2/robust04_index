			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Johannesburg Dec 31 SAPA -- A second underground  armed grouping has claimed responsibility for the late Thursday  night attack on a Cape Town tavern. A caller purporting to be a  member of the Azanian National Liberation Army [Azanla], armed  wing of the Black Consciousness Movement of Azania, told SAPA in  a telephone call on Friday that his movement had been  responsible for the attack on the pub in which four people died.    Earlier, a man claiming to be a member of Azanian Peoples'  Liberation Army [APLA] telephoned SAPA and said the Pan  Africanist Congress' armed wing was responsible for the attack.    "They (APLA) must not claim responsibility for things they  did not do," the purported Azanla caller said from a payphone.  The man said he was calling from the southern Cape town of  George. He identified himself as "Mobutu", the same name given  by a caller who on Thursday telephoned various news  organisations to claim responsibility for an explosion which  damaged a block of flats in Port Elizabeth's Swartkops  industrial area shortly after midnight on Tuesday. There were  no injuries in that incident.    Shortly after the Tuesday blast, police found large amounts  of explosives in several places at a block of flats in Algoa  Park, about 15km from Swartkops. Officers said at the time  police were investigating a possible link between the blast and  the explosives seized.    The "Mobutu" caller told SAPA on Thursday the sabotage was  part of Azanla's campaign for the complete liberation of all  Azanians. "The struggle will continue until we are all free."    There was no way on Friday of independently confirming the  caller was from Azanla.</p>

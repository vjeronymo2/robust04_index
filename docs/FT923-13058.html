			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / International Company News: Iberia turns in further losses IBERIA, Spain's govern-ment-owned air carrier, is continuing to make heavy losses despite a capital injection from public funds earlier this year and the high profile Spain has received as the host of the summer Olympic Games in Barcelona and of the Seville Expo '92. According to Madrid newspaper reports, the airline lost up to Pta25bn (Dollars 265m) in the first six months of the year. Iberia officials said the company did not release its first-half results but conceded that losses had been substantial and that the reports were largely accurate. Iberia admitted losses of Pta35bn over the same period last year and finished the 12 months Pta52.2bn in the red. The officials said that overall losses this year were expected to be well down on the 1991 figures but were nevertheless likely to overshoot the target of a Pta8bn shortfall. Iberia's disappointing performance so far this year risks raising further questions at the European Commission's Competition Directorate which is already investigating a first-quarter Pta120bn capital injection to the airline provided by INI, Spain's public sector conglomerate. The directorate could rule that the recapitalisation, purportedly to finance Iberia's fleet renewal and the airline's expansion in Latin America, had instead been chiefly allocated to stemming losses. The officials said there was an outside possibility that Iberia might have to pay back to INI 10 per cent, Pta12bn, of the funds it had received. Iberia's losses also indicated that a hoped for influx of foreign visitors to Spain on account of the 1992 events had failed, so far, to materialise. The officials said that revenue from the airline's European and transatlantic traffic had been considerably less than that which had been initially forecast. Under an ongoing rationalising plan, designed in part to justify the capital injection, Iberia has reduced its 28,000 payroll by 1,500 over the past six months. These were the first staff cuts in the company's history, and a further 1,500 employees will leave the company before the end of the year under early retirement and voluntary redundancy schemes.</p>

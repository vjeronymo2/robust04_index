			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Norway (1): A confident nation is wary of change - Polls suggest that most people disagree with the government over EU membership. Hugh Carnegy and Karen Fossli examine the pre-referendum mood. Norway's Labour government is poised this summer like a ski-jumper in mid-air, whose perfect take-off could yet end in a painful crash landing. Under the leadership of Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, one of Europe's most experienced prime ministers, Labour has skilfully prepared the way for the country at last to join the European Union - along with its fellow Efta (European Free Trade Area) members, Austria, Finland and Sweden - on January 1. Labour, although a minority administration, is virtually unchallenged in power after strengthening its position in the Storting (parliament) in last September's general election. After long and difficult negotiations, it concluded an accession treaty with the EU in March, which even many sceptics within Labour welcomed as a good deal. In the meantime, the mood of the nation has rarely exuded such self-confidence. The oil-boosted economy is on the up after several laggardly years, and is set to grow by up to 4 per cent this year - one of the fastest rates in Europe. Great pride was generated last autumn when it was revealed that Norway had secretly helped two of the world's most bitter foes - Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation - to reach an historic peace accord. Earlier this year, Norwegians revelled in the international praise the country won for its impressive organisation of the Winter Olympics at Lillehammer and celebrated a record haul of gold medals by its athletes. To cap an unprecedented year for a nation devoted to sports, the Norwegian football team qualified for the world cup finals for the first time since the war. But for Mrs Brundtland and her government, these are mere diversions: the real test lies ahead in the shape of a referendum on EU membership, on Monday, November 28. Despite several years' unequivocal advocacy of membership by Mrs Brundtland (and most of the business community), opposition to joining remains deeply entrenched in Norway. Opinion polls have for months consistently shown the No camp with a majority of up to 56 per cent. Even many top politicians and government officials privately doubt whether they can turn opinion around in time. Memories of 1972, when Norwegians voted down a proposal to join the European Community, destroying the Labour government of the day, are vivid as Mrs Brundtland seeks to avoid a crash landing in November. The No campaign revolves round the widespread perception that EU membership involves a significant erosion of national sovereignty, will threaten the country's control over its cherished natural resources - especially oil and fish - and mean an end to Norway's long-standing policy of encouraging people to remain in the far-flung northern communities through heavy agricultural and regional subsidies. These arguments proved decisive in 1972 and are hardly less potent now, in a country which only won its independence from Sweden in 1905 and suffered occupation by the Nazis during the second world war. Opposition in parliament is led by the rurally-based Centre party, which, under the charismatic leadership of Ms Anne Enger Lahnstein, stormed to become the second largest party in the general election on the back of its fierce anti-EU stance. Outside the Storting, opposition is grouped under the well-organised 'No to the EU' campaign. 'Our side is much more enthusiastic - the Yes side is finding it very difficult to generate any momentum,' says Mr Johan J. Jakobsen, leader of the Centre party's Storting group. 'They are badly organised, while all the No groups have accepted that the No-to-the-EU movement co-ordinates all opposition activities.' Faced with this unpromising outlook, Mrs Brundtland has by no means been idle. Working closely with Mr Thorbjoern Jaglund, who took over as official Labour leader in 1992, she has managed to keep the party together under a pro-EU policy, despite the presence of a large anti-EU Labour faction. Above all, the government achieved an accession accord with Brussels which was sufficient to ensure that senior ministers like Mr Jan Henry Olsen, the fisheries minister, and Mr Bjorn Tore Godal, the foreign minister, who were in the No camp in 1972, are now firmly behind Norwegian membership. Norway made minimum concessions on allowing EU fishing boats more access to Norwegian waters, and maintained Olso's full control over fish resources in its northern waters until 1998. The deal requires little change in Oslo's control of oil concessions and its ownership of the national oil company Statoil. Norway's heavily subsidised farmers will have to adjust to much lower EU farm prices, but will be cushioned by transition funds. Norway will keep its stringent environmental regulations and its state monopoly of alcohol retailing. With the detail of the accession terms settled, the government - backed on the issue by the opposition Hoyre, or Conservative, party - could switch its campaign to the chief motivation for joining the Union: Norway's desire to be a partner in an organisation seen as shaping the economic and political future of Europe. 'Norway has a natural place in this forum,' insists Mrs Brundtland. This, however, is proving a difficult case to make in a prosperous country, which has long been satisfied with the security afforded by membership of Nato and already has most of the economic benefits of full EU membership through its participation in the European Economic Area agreement with Brussels. Recognising this, the government deliberately engineered a sequence by which Norway will vote last on the issue - after Austria (which confirmed its entry in a referendum earlier this month), Finland and Sweden. Opinion polls show clearly that the best chance of winning a Yes vote in Norway is if Finland and especially Sweden vote Yes in their respective referendums on October 16 and November 13. The irony of letting Sweden, Norway's former ruler, effectively decide the issue is not lost on many Norwegians. The No camp still believes it can win even if Sweden votes Yes. A No vote would be a huge blow to Mrs Brundtland, who has made EU membership something of a personal mission. Her government would also be badly wounded, having invested so much in the belief that it can turn opinion around. The opposition parties, though themselves deeply split, would doubtless seek a repeat of 1972 when prime minister Trygve Bratteli resigned. But Mrs Brundtland insists this will not happen. 'The Labour party is prepared to continue in power in the event of a No vote in the referendum,' she told the FT (see page 3 of this survey). 'The country needs stable leadership and firm government, and in the current political situation, the Labour party is the only political force that can provide this.' Its policy under this 'second best solution', she said, would be 'to build on our membership of Nato, our associate membership of the WEU (Western European Union) and on the EEA agreement.' A No vote is expected to have little economic effect. But the pro-EU side fears a longer-term drain on investment in the Norwegian economy, which could seriously damage the country as it begins to face the prospect of a decline in oil and gas earnings after the turn of the century. This year, the economy looks stronger than for some time. The annual inflation rate is below 1 per cent. The current account is in surplus, and the central government deficit is set to decline. Unemployment, at an historically high 6 per cent for Norway, is stabilising. But the economy has a core structural weakness in the narrowness of its non-oil manufacturing base, which the government and independent economists agree must be addressed. A decision to stay out of the EU would be a short-term relief to sheltered sectors such as the food processing industry. But in the longer term, much needed investment, to increase the volume of value-added production in Norway, could be jeopardised.</p>

This policy should be the core of government  actions," Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev told a  government meeting here today. The meeting focused on 1993  social and economic results of Kazakhstan and outlined actions  for the immediate future.    "We have been stating production recession, deterioration of  financial situation and drop in the living standards for three  years. The only reason we cited was breaking of economic  relations between former Soviet republics accompanied with  payment crisis and increase of the inflation. Generally, it is  so, but internal processes in the economy and society testify to  much more," added the president. In his opinion, their quality  "gives rise to more profound consideration and slightly  different conclusions".    Last year three fourth of enterprises improved their work  against the background of general production recession. Labor  collectives of these plants have turned into genuine owners,  adopted market laws and display independence and business-like  attitudes. Those who still count on state support are not very  successful, said the president. He called for more active  reforms, denationalization and privatization of property.    Kazakhstan failed to achieve economic stabilization in 1993.  Production recession in all material productions and drop in the  living standards are underway.    The gross domestic product reduced by 12.9 per cent as  compared to 1992. The production output decreased by 16.1 per  cent, agricultural output by 9.8 per cent and construction works  - by 25 per cent.    Price liberalization without tough financial-budget and  credit policy did not change much the economic recession  tendency but resulted in uncontrolled price rise. Prices have  went up most in the fuel and energy complex, metallurgy, the  chemical and petrochemical industries. Consumer prices and  tariffs increased by 23 times.    The enormous increase of consumer prices resulted in a drop  in the living standards. Their 1993 index is 2,265 per cent.  Foodstuff prices increased by 23 times, prices on consumer goods  - by 18 times and service tariffs - by 41 times. Stratification  of the population goes on. Four fifth of the population are on  the verge of poverty.    The government plan for 1994 is expected to help overcome  the  economic crisis, said the meeting.</p>

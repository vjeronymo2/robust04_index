			<p>BFN     [Text] Port-au-Prince, 20 Jun (AFP) -- This morning,  Haiti's provisional President Emile Jonassaint, who has not been  acknowledged as such by the international community, personally  hoisted his country's blue and red flag in front of the National  Palace as numerous Haitian and foreign journalists watched.    Earlier, an official communique had announced that "from now  on, the national flag will remain at the top of the flagpole  until further notice, and it will be saluted every morning. The  daily ceremony of lowering the flag has been abolished." The  purpose of this measure is to strengthen the "flag's symbolism"  to contribute to the safeguarding of "national independence."    Bernard Sansaricq, president of one of the Senate's  opposition blocs (not acknowledged by the international  community), and Army Chief General Raoul Cedras, along with the  Haitian military high command, were at Jonassaint's side.</p>

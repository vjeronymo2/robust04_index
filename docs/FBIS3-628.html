			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [All figures as heard] </F>   [Text] President Idriss Deby this morning chaired an  extraordinary cabinet meeting devoted to the examination of the  draft bill on the 1994 budget. The general state budget for  1994 was fixed at 203,329,800,000 CFA francs. Here is the  report on the extraordinary cabinet meeting presented by the  government spokesman, Communication Minister Ouardougou Bolou:    [Begin Bolou recording] The cabinet examined the only item  on  its agenda, namely the examination of the draft 1994 general  budget bill. The general state budget for the 1994 fiscal year,  which comprises recurrent expenditure for institutions and  public investment expenditure and is worth 203,329,800,000 CFA  francs, was adopted after extensive debate. This amount is  broken down as follows: recurrent expenditure, 70,839,800,000  francs; public investment budget, 132,783,000,000 francs.    The budget falls within an extremely difficult context for  our country which is characterized by economic recession and the  new financial situation brought about by the devaluation of the  CFA franc. However, the government wants to rigorously take  national imperatives into account, particularly the  implementation of the transition guidelines and the honoring of  its foreign commitments in line with measures to redress the  serious macroeconomic imbalances of the country.

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / International Company News: Danish group to issue 3m shares in New York ISS International Service Systems, the Danish industrial cleaning group, is to issue 3m B shares on the New York Stock Exchange this autumn. Plans to seek a New York listing were initially announced last year, when ISS paid Dollars 93.5m for National Cleaning Group of the US to become the largest cleaning business in North America with sales of about Dollars 950m. The share issue was postponed this spring when the ISS share price, which peaked at DKr276 early in the year, began to weaken. The shares took a further beating in August following the group half-year results, falling some 20 per cent to DKr177. But Mr Poul Andreassen, chief executive, said the group's investment bankers had advised it to go ahead with the issue, which will raise about DKr530m (Dollars 86m) at the current market price. 'The issue will strengthen our equity capital and enable us to go ahead with our strategy of expanding our core cleaning business, including by new acquisitions,' he said. Group equity capital at the end of June was about DKr1.47bn and assets about DKr6.15bn, an equity ratio of 23.9 per cent. ISS is the world leader in industrial cleaning with a labour force in excess of 120,000. For the first half of 1994 sales rose 22 per cent to DKr7.24bn and pre-tax profits climbed 33 per cent to DKr193m.</p>

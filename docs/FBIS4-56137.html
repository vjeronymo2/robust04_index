			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, May 25 (CTK) -- "For the Czech Republic  relations with Germany are extremely important, as is promoting  dialogue on all questions. What we oppose to are talks between  a grouping and the Czech Government," Czech Foreign Minister  Josef Zieleniec told journalists today.    He said the Czech Republic's stand towards the Sudeten  German  question is "clear and does not ensue from its relation to  Germany but from the international and legal nature of the  problem."    The "Four Plus Two" treaty on Germany's unification  essentially substitutes a peace treaty from the view point of  the Allies, Zieleniec said, when asked what prevents the Czech  Republic from concluding a peace treaty with Germany.</p>

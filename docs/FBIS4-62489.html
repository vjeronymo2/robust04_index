			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 13/5/1994 -- During the two  months of the Parliament's activity, 99 important documents were  adopted, stated Dumitru Motpan, chairman of the Moldovan  Agrarian Democratic Party (PDAM), at a press conference held  today by the governing party. The PDAM leader pronounced  himself in favor of conducting elections to the local  administrative organs in the near future and excluding from the  future Constitution the words "federalization" and  "confederalization." Motpan promised that "no later than  November the Constitution will be adopted." Referring to  detainee Ilascu's [Ilie Ilascu, sentenced to death by a Dniester  court] problem, he expressed the certainty that Ilascu will not  be executed. Motpan believes that Tiraspol tries to increase  the price for Ilascu's release. He said that he knows nothing  about some alleged guarantees made by Tiraspol leaders that  Ilascu's life is out of danger. He also pointed out that during  the last meeting between Moldovan and Gagauz representatives,  "Gagauzians sent some extremists who want more the more they  receive."</p>

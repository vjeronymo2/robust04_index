			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in </F> Bucharest on 23 April -- recorded, in English with  passage-by-passage translation into Romanian; translated from  the Romanian]    [Text] [Announcer] Shim'on Peres, deputy prime minister  and foreign minister of the State of Israel, left Bucharest this  evening. Teodor Melescanu, minister of state and foreign  minister of Romania, accompanied the guest to Otopeni airport.  Before his departure, the Israeli guest granted an exclusive  interview to our correspondents Nicu Popescu and Ion Marinescu.    [Begin Peres recording] In the three days of talks, one of  the issues approached was bilateral relations between Romania  and Israel, and the other issue was relations with the  Palestinians.    As far as bilateral relations are concerned, we are on the  right path. There is an increase in economic activities and  cultural and scientific relations and there are technological  exchanges between our countries.    We held talks with the foreign minister, the prime minister,  and the president of your country in a very nice atmosphere. We  have the impression that we are on the right path. Romania has  a very important investment in Israel -- namely, the people who  left Romania for Israel but without divorcing their feelings  from Romania. They feel very strong about it. We will build a  new strong bilateral relationship. As far as the Crans Montana  Forum conference is concerned, there were 350 delegates from  abroad, but what is more important was the presence of over 700  correspondents in this rather impressive palace. I think it was  an important congress. I think Bucharest was interesting. The  issues discussed have exceeded your own nation and these issues  are not part of the Black Sea, but of the Balkans. I met many  interesting and acknowledgeable people.    Then there was the meeting with Mr. 'Arafat, where we tried  to solve the different points in our discussions and clarify  relations between the PLO and Israel. We tried to create the  right atmosphere. The tradition of Romanian diplomacy that has  been mediating in the Middle East has been felt now, too. In  general, it was a very useful meeting. As you know, Mr. 'Arafat  felt at home here and I believe this will accelerate the pace of  negotiations toward a positive final result. I am grateful to  the Romanian Government for the attention granted to me. We had  a working lunch today with the prime minister and the foreign  minister that was completely kosher and held in a very good  atmosphere and I hope we will continue to work together.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["fy"-signed report: "For a NATO Partnership With Russia </F> `Without Any Adjectives'"]    [Excerpt] Brussels, 24 May -- The future of relations with  Russia and the visit of Russian Defense Minister Grachev were at  the center of the NATO defense ministers' spring summit in  Brussels on Tuesday [24 May]. Even before the ministers met  with Grachev in the evening, the ministers' talks mainly  concentrated on further developments of the alliance's relations  with Russia. Balanzino, the NATO deputy secretary general,  chaired the meeting, as Secretary General [Manfred] Woerner had  followed his doctor's advice not to participate.    Defense Minister Volker Ruehe spoke out clearly in favor of  offering Russia a "partnership without adjectives" such as  "strategic," "pragmatic," "cooperative," or "privileged." As  Russia cannot become a member of NATO, the alliance must offer  it a comprehensive partnership within and outside the  Partnership for Peace that corresponds with its importance.  After the first round of talks in Brussels on Tuesday, Ruehe  reported that he agrees with U.S. Secretary of Defense Perry  that the alliance should enter into a general foreign and  security policy dialogue with Russia. The nuclear issues and  proliferation of nuclear weapons should not be discussed by the  United States and Russia alone in the future, but by Russia and  NATO as a whole. On relations between NATO and Russia, however,  Ruehe said it is out of the question to grant Russia a de facto  right to veto alliance resolutions, to allow Moscow to impede  NATO's capacity to act, or to subordinate the alliance to the  Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).  "Cooperative relations of partnership within and outside of  Partnership for Peace are the key to security and stability in  Europe," Ruehe said. Russia must be treated as a great power  and a partner, but it must gain its neighbors' confidence by  itself, whether they be "distant" or "near" neighbors. This  requires acknowledging their sovereignty and the inviolability  of their borders. It is NATO's task to give Russia as much help  as it can in a difficult situation. But the Atlantic alliance  must watch out for false partners.    Ruehe recommended that it should be made clear to Russia  that  its participation in the Partnership for Peace is important.  Moscow should sign the framework agreement without additional  conditions or changes. This includes the willingness to aim at  a comprehensive cooperation between NATO troops and the Russian  Armed Forces. The practical part of the Partnership for Peace  is to focus on promoting military cooperation. Even if it is  given the same status as the other partners, Russia has the  possibility to acquire a position that corresponds with its  size, importance, and potential. Outside the Partnership for  Peace, relations should focus on the dialogue on political and  strategic issues. In this connection it is important that the  dialogue between NATO and Russia is transparent. If this is  safeguarded, it will be possible to convince the partners in  Central and East Europe of the importance of cooperating with  Russia. [passage omitted]</p>

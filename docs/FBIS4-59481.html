			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] It has been announced today that President Yasir  'Arafat had issued a decision on 10 December 1993 which  stipulated the appointment of Major-General (Musbah Hanafi Saqr)  director of preventive security.    WAFA learned that this decision was not made public at the  time to protect the secret presence of brother Major-General  Saqr in the occupied Palestinian territories, whereby his  martyrdom was announced in 1968 in order to protect the secrecy  and continuation of his work.

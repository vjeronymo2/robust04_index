			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jaime Hernandez] </F>   [Text] Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien yesterday  began an official three-day visit to Mexico to talk with  President Carlos Salinas and other Mexican officials on how to  stimulate bilateral trade in the framework of NAFTA.    On landing at the Mexico City International Airport,  Chretien  said that Mexico becomes more and more important for Canada.  "It is truly a pleasure for me to have arrived in Mexico for my  first official visit, from which I expect good results for both  countries," he said.    According to a Foreign Relations Secretariat report,  bilateral trade between Canada and the United States amounts to  $3 billion annually and will soon total $5 billion. The  document says that, in the framework of NAFTA, the delegates in  charge of debating antidumping and subsidies as related to the  agreements between Mexico, United States, and Canada are  expected to determine the corresponding codes prior to 31  December 1995.    The document adds that in the next five years the three  countries will spend approximately $30 million in a three-nation  program to improve the qualification of human resources in  Mexico and the technical level of the country's universities and  industries. "Through an enterprise council, the private  initiative will participate in the creation of training  standards."    In addition, Canada wishes to explore the possibility of  creating a technical and scientific cooperation sub-group in the  Mexico-Canada Ministerial Commission, similar to a sub-group  recently established between Mexico and the United States.    The sub-group would attend to matters related to scientific  exchange programs between the two countries, human resources  follow-up, technology transfer, and environment protection and  improvement programs. The two countries approved the creation  of the sub-group, which is expected to meet at the next  Ministerial Commission's session, according to the Foreign  Relations Secretariat.    It has also been reported that a new proposal for a  memorandum of understanding on fishing cooperation that the  Canadian Ministry of Fisheries and Oceans presented to the  Mexican Fisheries Secretariat is still being negotiated.    According to bilateral agreements, Mexican inspectors at  Canada's request would travel to eastern Canadian provinces in  the first week of April 1994 to conduct phytopathological  inspections of apple orchards.    The Canadian Government's request to lift the current  tariffs  on wheat and barley exports to that country is also being  studied. Several enterprises consider the possibility of  investing in energy and mining. The enterprise Canada World  Construction will spend 300 million new pesos to mine granite  and limestone in Izucar de Matamoros. Campbell Resources will  prospect for and mine gold.    In this first visit, the prime minister will attend the  closing of the industrial and services exposition, Canada  Expo-94, where more than 450 enterprises are represented and  which is Canada's largest commercial venture abroad.    President Salinas reportedly had dinner with Chretien  yesterday. The prime minister today is scheduled to meet with  Salinas at the Los Pinos official residence. Chretien will meet  with Mexican congress members and offer a reception at the Banco  General de Canada. He will also meet with Mexico City Mayor  Manuel Aguilera Gomez, will stand at attention at the Homeland's  Altar, and hold a news conference at the Canadian Embassy.</p>

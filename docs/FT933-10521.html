			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Russia wins debt rescheduling from London Club RUSSIA HAS won a limited debt rescheduling from the London Club of commercial banks, requiring it to pay just Dollars 500m by the end of 1993 and postponing by five years the repayment of another Dollars 3bn owed to western banks this year, writes Leyla Boulton. The agreement easing Russia's Dollars 24bn commercial bank debt, reached in Frankfurt in talks with representatives of western banks last week, was announced in Moscow yesterday. It coincides with renewed chaos over Russian economic reforms, sparked by the central bank's botched monetary reform last month. Since debt talks started in December 1991 Russia has been postponing repayment on commercial debt through a series of three-month deferrals. 'By saying we agreed these deferrals made them and us look good, even though they would not have paid us anyway,' one western banker said. Mr Andrei Vavilov, deputy finance minister, said nothing had been decided about rescheduling amounts which would come due next year. But if Russia pays the Dollars 500m this will mark the resumption of commercial debt servicing suspended when the Vnesheconombank, which used to service the Soviet Union's foreign debt, defaulted on payment. However, western bankers say Russia has been making payments to some banks all along - a practice the rescheduling is supposed to replace with equal treatment for all creditors. Mr Vavilov admitted there were disagreements on the implementation of Russia's existing agreement with the Paris Club of government creditors. But he said Russia would pay a total of Dollars 3bn in debt servicing this year.</p>

The Constitution Will Be Abolished Later On"]    [Text] After the government has been reformed, the  parliamentary majority has found itself in a difficult position:  T he ambiguous assessments of the new Cabinet of Ministers have  played havoc with the Communists' plans. The economic part of  the program by the Russian Federation Communist Party and its  allies was based on "anti-shock" declarations. Whereas the  agrarians' tasks are obvious -- get as much money as possible --  the communists, fighting against President Yeltsin and "his  constitution," have lost their main trump in this struggle --  propaganda against Russia's Choice.    Communist Party leader Gennadiy Zyuganov believes, however,  that Russia's Choice members are still entrenched in the  presidential and government apparatus. By way of illustration  of their continued activity he cited the signing of a friendship  treaty with Georgia and the abolition of benefits for workers in  the country's northern regions.    Mr. Zyuganov is ready to be patient with the "sensible" part  of the Cabinet of Ministers if he sees "a sound program for  revising the reform course." The Russian Federation Communist  Party is ready to approve in general "the initiative by  Academicians Abalkin and Petrakov." The communists hope that  their program will be a focus "around which all forces in the  government and parliament, except Russia's Choice, will rally."    To accomplish their main objective -- "the removal of the  ruling regime" -- the communists are still considering three  options. The first is achieving victory in local elections.  According to Mr. Zyuganov, regional administrations will try to  write regulations on elections to suit themselves and the  president will end up controlling the provinces. Here, the  communist leader believes, the Duma must step in by adopting a  local election law.    The second option -- disavowal of the constitution --  according to Zyuganov, is too early to discuss. "One must not  stir up a storm all at once," he said. The constitution, in his  opinion, will be "rejected by life itself."    The third option relates precisely to how such life should  be  organized. The "extreme measure" -- a Russian-wide strike --  the communists claim, "will wipe out the regime but also finally  kill the economy."</p>

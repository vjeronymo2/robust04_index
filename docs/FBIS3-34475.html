			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A responsible source at the General Civil Aviation  and Meteorology Authority has made a statement to the Yemeni  News Agency, SABA', in which he expressed surprise over the  statement made by brother Brigadier General Qasim Tahir, defense  minister and member of the Political Bureau of the Yemeni  Socialist Party, on the Ugandan Boeing 707. He said that the  statement is not in harmony with the Civil Aviation Law and the  valid rules pertaining to aviation, and does not reflect reality.    To explain this, he said the air traffic controller at Sanaa  International Airport was surprised by the entry of the plane  into Yemeni airspace without obtaining a prior authorization  from the competent authorities. The air traffic controller  recalled the report of the Air Defense Command, which also  stressed that there was no authorization for the entry and  landing of that plane. If there had been any prior permit from  the competent authorities, the concerned parties at air traffic  control and air defense would have been informed [words  indistinct] in accordance with the rules of the air  transportation valid in our country and the rest of the world.    The responsible source at the Civil Aviation Authority  asserted that the General Civil Aviation Authorities is the  party responsible for issuing such permits in accordance with  Article 10 of the Civil Aviation Law. Neither airports nor any  other party have the right to grant such permits.    In addition to that, and if we consider that the Ugandan  plane's travel was in the interest of the war effort of the  Armed Forces in the southern and eastern governorates, as stated  in the defense minister's statement, the Defense Ministry should  have obtained a permit from the General Civil Aviation Authority  in accordance with Article 10 of Civil Aviation Law No. 12 of  1993, to which the authority referred in its previous statement.    The source also added that the authorization mentioned in  the  defense minister's statement No. 94/57, Aden, [word indistinct]  was not issued by the competent and authorized authority;  namely, the Civil Aviation Authority, which does not have any  information on the issue. The source denounced the content of  the statement made by the defense minister, who said that the  measures taken to make the plane land in al-Hudaydah airport is  considered a violation of the rules of the national and  international aviation. The reverse is true. Organizing  aviation is part of the duties assigned to the aviation  authority, which it does in accordance with international  agreements, particularly with the Chicago agreement on civil  aviation.    Concluding, the source said: The brother defense minister  should not have interfered in the work of the authority that is  charged with the organization of aviation rules and should have  encouraged the employees of the civil aviation authority, who  carried out their duty to defend national sovereignty over the  Republic of Yemen's airspace.</p>

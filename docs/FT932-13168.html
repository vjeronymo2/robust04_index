			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / UK Company News: Hi-Tec remains in loss and plans Pounds 5m restructure HI-TEC Sports, the sportswear company, yesterday announced that it continued to lose money in the second half of last year and said it would restructure its European operations at a cost of about Pounds 5m. One of Britain's largest sports shoe suppliers, Hi-Tec had hoped to return to profit in the second half after announcing interim losses of Pounds 2.8m. However, the company said that the second half would show a 'relatively small' but 'disappointing' loss when it announces results next month. The shares, which have collapsed from 207p last May as problems mounted, dipped 1p to 42p. Analysts said the share price already reflected Hi-Tec's problems. These included the sudden resignation last month of two recently appointed non-executive directors, Sir Michael Edwardes, a former chairman of British Leyland, and Mr Richard Fenhalls, former chief executive of Henry Ansbacher. No Hi-Tec officer was available to comment, but the company said in a statement that its UK operations continued to suffer from pricing pressures. The US division performed well. In Europe, sports shoe operations had made 'substantial losses' and the company said it planned important, but unspecified, changes. Analysts said this could mean a withdrawal from some European markets and a greater use of agents in Europe. The company said these decisions had been taken before the year end and the restructuring costs of Pounds 5m will be taken in last year's accounts. Hoare Govett, Hi-Tec's corporate broker, was forecasting trading losses of up to Pounds 3.5m for last year, but a profit of Pounds 5m this year. Hi-Tec has also appointed Mr Peter Butler as group finance director, a position left vacant since February. Mr Butler, a former chief financial officer of property and agribusiness company Berisford, has been granted 400,000 options at 50p. These can be exercised at 80p or above in three years time. Hi-Tec was left without non-executive directors following the two resignations, but is understood to be still trying to recruit replacements.</p>

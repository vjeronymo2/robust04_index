			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Management: Friends, Romans businessmen Few modern management concepts are as vague, yet promise as much, as the 'network organisation'. Among many other benefits, it claims to make companies much more cost effective, faster, more flexible and more open - what some business academics call 'borderless'. Yet evidence is mounting that, at least in one of its various forms, the concept can be dangerous. To most people, the word 'network' conjures up either the uninspiring image of a series of linked computers, or the much more powerful one of a set of close but informal relationships between individuals, whether within one company or across several. But to other people, the concept of networks stands mainly for a set of links between companies: strategic alliances, joint ventures, co-operative development deals, licensing collaborations, and so forth. Of this corporate fraternity, one of the most advanced practitioners is Olivetti, the Italian computer manufacturer. Its colourful chairman and chief executive, Carlo de Benedetti, tends to wax lyrical about his belief that the 'network corporation' as he calls it, is 'the reference model for the future'. Over the last decade, Olivetti has built up a network of alliances that, relative to its size, is quite large even for the electronics industry, which goes in for such arrangements more than most. As Olivetti has been broadcasting to the world over the past fortnight, in a series of curious-looking full page advertisements in this newspaper and elsewhere, it has 229 alliances of various kinds at present. Their purpose, it says in the advert, is to 'guarantee' a future not only of collaboration (obviously), but also of independence. But will they actually achieve this? One of the main purposes of the ad campaign is to calm customers worried by Olivetti's inability so far to strike a really significant deal with another computer company. It came close to doing so a couple of years ago with both Philips and ICL, but each of them found more powerful partnerships elsewhere. Olivetti has been left trying noisily to make a virtue of its myriad of smaller links, even though none of them assures it a future. Therein lies the rub. Unfortunately for Olivetti, its ad campaign coincides not only with the widespread scepticism of many outside observers, but also with the publication of an erudite book on alliances which warns against precisely the sort of strategy which the company appears to be following*. The only saving grace for the Italian company is that the book, by two Norwegian business academics, Peter Lorange and Johan Roos, does not actually criticise Olivetti by name. It is also written in a pretty impenetrable style. But its message is still powerful. The issue revolves around the relationship between alliances and another powerful management concept, that of 'core competences'. This label refers to a company's unique skills which give it a competitive edge. It is pretty obvious that no company can survive for long without at least one core competence: Honda's engine technology, for example, or Tetra Pak's packaging skills. Networks of strategic alliances can be used to reinforce a company's core competences, or to exploit them, for instance through distribution deals. But, as the Norwegians' book warns, woe betide the company which takes the co-operation doctrine so far that it bases its core competences entirely on alliances. Until a few years ago, Olivetti still had a very obvious internal core competence which gave it an edge against many of its rivals: its product and manufacturing know-how in personal computers. But PC technology and software are now virtual commodities. Other Olivetti strengths lie in its undoubted edge in ergonomics and industrial design. Its brand and distribution channels are also worth a pretty penny. But none of these really ranks as a core competence on the level of Apple's skills in user interfaces. So whither Olivetti? Or will Olivetti indeed wither, to little more than a brand and distribution channel for American and Japanese companies? It is just possible that the company has discovered a managerial master-key which enables it to extract more value than its rivals from the process of forging alliances, exploiting and replacing them (most alliances are temporary). Its executives sometimes claim as much. But such a competence is extremely intangible. It has not yet been expressed in a string of competitor-beating systems. Beneath its corporate rhetoric about alliances, the odds must be that Olivetti would be just as relieved today as it almost was two years ago to find a properly marriageable partner. The independence of equity ownership on which it now places so much emphasis is, after all, pretty irrelevant, given its dependence on the technology of its allies. Carlo de Benedetti should swallow that truth, and curb his mistaken enthusiasm for the notion that co-operation is a viable strategy almost in itself. It is not. Other companies take note: you cannot live by alliances alone. *Strategic Alliances. Blackwell Pounds 35.</p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / International Company News: Abitibi-Price loses CDollars 5.5m ABITIBI-PRICE, one of Canada's three biggest integrated pulp and paper groups, registered a small fourth-quarter loss, writes Robert Gibbens. It also warned it expected a difficult year because of poor markets, especially in newsprint. Sales in the period dipped 7.5 per cent to CDollars 726m (USDollars 625m); the loss was CDollars 5.5m or 9 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 11.3m or 17 cents a year earlier, including a CDollars 13.7m special charge. During the quarter, Abitibi, controlled by the Reichmann brothers of Toronto, made two disposals for CDollars 53m.</p>

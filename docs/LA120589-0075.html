			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON CALIFORNIA: IMAGE-MAKERS CAN'T HEAL A SHAKEN CITY  </P> <P> Take a walk through downtown San Francisco these days and you will see the  change from Christmases past. The buzz of the streets has dimmed. Store crowds  are thin, the restaurants partially filled. The city is not dead, exactly. Just  subdued.  </P> <P> It's the earthquake and its aftermath. San Francisco has not bounced back the  way the city fathers had predicted. The situation has so alarmed the downtown  business establishment that Mayor Art Agnos spent most of last week on a tour  of eastern cities trying to get the tourists back in their wide-bodies and  headed west once again.  </P> <P> This trip was interesting because it made two assumptions. First, that the  collective decision by thousands of tourists to stay away from San Francisco  was irrational. And second, that their return would solve the city's problems.  </P> <P> On the local news each evening, Agnos and his entourage were shown making slide  presentations to travel executives. There were happy shots of cable cars  climbing to the stars and the Fairmont Hotel standing undamaged atop Nob Hill.  This presentation was engineered to correct the image of a city in ruins, an  image that Agnos believes was erroneously stamped into the memories of  television viewers during the quake coverage.  </P> <P> Whether or not press coverage unfairly sullied the city, that issue did not  seem paramount in the minds of the travel officials. In news reports of the  tour, the executives repeatedly raised another fear, one that was not so easily  dismissed. They said their customers were afraid of the next earthquake.  </P> <P> It was an issue that seemed to irritate the mayor, perhaps because it could not  be waved away with a slide presentation. At one point an industry official  asked Agnos just what assessment geologists were making about the possibility  of another quake.  </P> <P> "Geologists talk too much," Agnos snapped.  </P> <P> Notwithstanding the gabbiness of geologists, the travel executives were  probably correct in their sense of the real issue. San Francisco has remained  stunned because Oct. 17 stripped away the pretense that earthquakes are remote  dangers. What's remarkable is that people outside California -- "tourists" --  seemed to have absorbed this lesson more fully than we who live here.  </P> <P> On second thought, maybe it's not so remarkable. People always diminish the  beast that lives next door. Once I was being carted up Sicily's Mt. Etna on a  tour bus, and we passed a town built on the volcanic ash of past eruptions. The  guide said the residents chose to regard the volcano as "their friend," and she  meant to imply they were brave people. Two years later the town was burned away  in a new eruption.  </P> <P> And so with us in California. We see the earthquake strike, we see the pictures  of a freeway clamped shut like a tomb, and then we go back to our lives as if  the earthquake was our friend. For most of us, in truth, there's little choice  in the matter, and denial of the danger is as good a device as any.  </P> <P> But let's not mistake who's being rational, and who's not. The good people of  Iowa and Pennsylvania don't have to diminish this danger; they can afford to  see it clearly. And until enough time passes for them to conveniently forget  about Oct. 17, a certain percentage will probably choose to visit cities where  they can sit in a revolving restaurant, sip a mai tai and not worry about  taking the big dive to the sidewalk.  </P> <P> Even more interesting was the second assumption of the Agnos tour, namely that  the missing tourists were the sum total of the problem. In fact, the city's air  of quiet is more widespread than that, and more mysterious. It seems that San  Franciscans themselves are staying home. You can go to the local joints and see  the same empty chairs that you see in the tourist haunts.  </P> <P> I have a friend here who was standing in her kitchen when the earthquake  struck. Like most people she was not hurt and does not even know anyone who  suffered an injury. But the shaking, the intensity of it, did something to her.  Now, six weeks later, she finds herself going straight home after work, putting  on an old pair of flannel pajamas and crawling into bed by 8:30. She cannot  explain her behavior except to say that somehow it makes her feel safe.  </P> <P> She is not gloomy in reporting this. She intends to continue the flannel  pajamas routine until she feels like going out again.  </P> <P> And the truth is the city does not feel gloomy either. More than anything it  seems like a San Francisco from a slightly earlier time. Say, 1962. After  Dashiell Hammett, before Ken Kesey. People are a little more polite, seem to  have a little more time. It won't last, of course. So if you liked 1962, make  Mayor Agnos happy and get up here quick.  </P></p>

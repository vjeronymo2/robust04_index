			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Names lose campaign to have case heard in US LLOYD'S of London has scored a decisive victory in its legal battle with dissident US Names. In the US district court for the southern district of New York on Tuesday, Judge Morris Lasker dismissed a case brought by some 100 Names  - the individuals whose assets support underwriting at the insurance market. The Names alleged that Lloyd's and the agents had breached US securities laws when they were recruited. The Names started the action - the biggest Lloyd's case involving US Names - last year. Judge Lasker ruled, however, that the proper legal forum for any dispute between the Names and Lloyd's was the English courts. He said: 'Plaintiffs went to England to become members of a distinctively British entity, invested in syndicates operating out of London and entered numerous contracts, all of which stated plainly that Lloyd's affairs and plaintiffs' investments would be administered in England and subject exclusively to English law.' He further found that the transactions into which plaintiffs had entered with Lloyd's were truly international in character, thus making invalid plaintiffs' arguments that such clauses illegally deprived them of the protection of US securities laws. In a 28-page opinion, Judge Lasker also held that while English laws might not provide the same remedies as US laws, they were adequate for plaintiffs to obtain relief. 'The sophistication and fairness of English courts cannot seriously be challenged,' he said. Judge Lasker concurred with findings in earlier cases heard by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals and of the federal district court in Chicago, in cases brought by other US Lloyd's Names. Because of the 'overwhelmingly' English nature of the dispute, the judge concluded that it was likely he would have reached the same decision as those other courts under the doctrine of inconvenient forum - the legal rules under which it is decided where cases are heard.</p>

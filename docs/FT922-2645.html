			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / International Company News: Cycle and Carriage wins control of Malayan Credit CYCLE and Carriage (CCL), the Singapore car distributor, and its partner Hotel Properties (HPL), have acquired 85 per cent of Malayan Credit (MCL), a local family-run property company, Reuter reports from Singapore CCL said that on the expiry of the takeover offer last Friday the two acquiring companies had acquired 274.31m MCL shares, representing 85.31 per cent of its issued capital. The 85.31 per cent stake includes 24.17 per cent held by HPL prior to the takeover. It also includes a 24.42 per cent shareholding which had belonged to Mr Teo Soo Chew, MCL chairman, and his family members. They sold their stake last week to Cycle. Singapore's Teo family, which founded MCL, has had nearly total control of the company. CCL announced the takeover bid on April 10, offering SDollars 2.25 for every MCL share. At midday yesterday, CCL stood 5 cents lower at SDollars 6.60 and MCL had risen 5 cents to SDollars 2.38. CCL, diversifying into property and food businesses to overcome a softer car market, has said it would place all MCL stock in excess of 85 per cent of the issued share capital at SDollars 2.10 per share under placing agreements with two broking houses. Analysts said that limiting the combined CCL/HPL stake to 85 per cent would ensure MCL's listing on the local bourse.</p>

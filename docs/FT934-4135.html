			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Viennese mayor seriously injured by letter bomb Mr Helmut Zilk, the Social Democratic mayor of Vienna, was seriously hurt by a letter bomb last night. He is the third and most prominent victim of a spate of letter bombs in Austria this weekend, targeting people active in supporting refugees. Mr Zilk has played a prominent role in seeking to build bridges with Austria's Jewish community, the target of attacks by extreme right-wingers. The city of Vienna has also made considerable efforts to help immigrants. Two letter bombs exploded on Friday, the first injuring Ms Sylvana Meixner, a Croat-born journalist with Austrian state-owned television. She presents a weekly multi-lingual programme for immigrants. The second injured Father August Janisch, a Roman Catholic curate, who has campaigned for refugees. Another bomb sent to the president of the Austrian branch of Caritas, the Roman Catholic charity organisation, was intercepted by the police on Saturday. Yesterday one addressed to the parliamentary leader of the Austrian Greens party, Madeleine Petrovic, was defused by police. No one has claimed responsibility for the bombs, but all were sent on the same day from different parts of Lower Austria. Mr Zilk was unaware of the danger, having only just returned from a visit to Switzerland when he opened his mail at home. The attack on the mayor will increase fears the bombs are the work of fringe elements on Austria's far right, though Mr Michael Sika, general director for public safety, said on Saturday that investigators were not discounting the possibility the bombs were linked to the war in the former Yugoslavia. There are more than 100,000 refugees, including 40,000 from Bosnia alone, living in Austria.</p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / International Company News: Kanebo sales fall sharply as fibres slump KANEBO, the Japanese fibre and cosmetics maker, yesterday reported a sharp fall in unconsolidated interim sales, due to a slump in the natural fibre market and an increase in costs. For the six months to September, Kanebo posted a 45.2 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y2.8bn (Dollars 23m) on a 0.7 per cent decline in sales to Y262.6bn. Net profits fell 36.7 per cent to Y775m. A 3 per cent rise in cosmetic sales to Y79.2bn was offset by an 8 per cent fall in sales of natural fibres, such as cotton and wool, to Y34.1bn. Sales of foodstuffs and pharmaceuticals remained virtually unchanged at Y25.2bn and Y10.5bn respectively.</p>

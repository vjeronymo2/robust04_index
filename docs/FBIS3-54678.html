			<p>Language: <F P=105>Armenian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Armenian Government in Yerevan; </F> date not given]    [Text] Armenian Deputy Prime Minister Vigen Chitechyan and  Armenian State Minister Gagik Shakhbazyan are in Tbilisi for  talks with Georgian leaders on repairing the bombed gas pipeline  and improving freight transportation.    The Azerbaijani Army used insolent force against the  representatives of the Armenian leadership, the Georgian  experts, and the security forces who had gone to repair the gas  pipeline that was blown up on 24 December in the Azeri-inhabited  region in Georgia's Marneulinskiy Rayon, north of Armenia. In  this way, the Azerbaijani Army virtually prevented the start of  repair work on the gas pipeline.    The Armenian Government views this action as a gross  interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state. Such  interference creates tension that is fraught with new and  unpredictable consequences for the region.    The Government of the Armenian Republic hopes that the  Georgian authorities will take the appropriate measures to  prevent infringements by the Azerbaijani side and that the  Azerbaijani leadership will refrain from carrying out acts of  sabotage in another country that directly affect Armenia's vital  interests.</p>

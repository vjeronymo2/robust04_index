			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Igor Galkin and Igor Ivantsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 24 TASS -- A Russian Government member  reported a "certain economic stabilisation" in the country and  said it is necessary to introduce a fixed rouble exchange rate  to promote investments into the economy.    "A number of measures taken by the government allowed to  stabilise the situation in the economy to a ceratin extent",  Deputy Economics Minister Sergey Vasilyev told a conference in  Moscow on Tuesday.    Among the measures he listed the strengthening of the rouble  in comparison to the national currencies of other former Soviet  republics, curtailing monthly inflation to 8-9 per cent and  cancelling easy-term crediting, import subsidies and export  quotas.    However, Vasilyev believes that it is necessary to introduce  a fixed rouble exchange rate to further strengthen the Russian  currency. To stipulate production it is necessary to attract  finances of the population, he said and added that in order to  stabilise the rouble in general and return to it the trust of  most depositors it is necessary to introduce a fixed rouble  exchange rate.    The fight with inflation remains the main task of the  government this year, according to Vasilyev who said that it is  necessary to decrease the budget deficit to achieve the goal.  The deficit currently amounts to 10 per cent of the gross  national product, according to him. However, he said it is  impossible to cut state expenses. The deficit can be decreased  through restructuring the state spendings which would take some  two-three years.    Vasilyev also urged to improve tax collection which dropped  to 10 per cent of the gross national product last year. He  admitted that tax dodging sharply went up from the middle of  1993. The total amount of collected taxes should reach 16 per  cent of the GNP to stabilise the situation in the sphere,  according to him.</p>

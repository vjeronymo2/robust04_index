			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: Delta registers Dollars 236.8m operating loss for quarter DELTA Air Lines, one of the three large US carriers and the purchaser of Pan Am's east coast shuttle operations and transatlantic routes last autumn, yesterday unveiled a Dollars 236.8m operating loss in the three months to end-December. At the after-tax level, the picture improved slightly, with the net loss for the quarter - the second of Delta's financial year - being Dollars 187.6m, or Dollars 3.89 a share. This was a small improvement on the Dollars 207.8m deficit seen in the same period a year earlier, although the latter half of 1990 was abnormally affected by escalating fuel prices and other Gulf war-related factors. The operating results reflect Delta's ownership of the shuttle operations for the full three months, and the transatlantic routes, together with the Frankfurt hub, during November and December. The carrier did not spell out the impact of these acquisitions on the overall loss, but Mr Tom Roeck, Delta's finance director, admitted 'aggressive growth in operations, along with additional expansion during the year, was a primary cause of increases in operating expenses for the quarter.' During the three months, Delta's operating revenues advanced from Dollars 2.13bn to Dollars 2.62bn. But operating expenses climbed from Dollars 2.44bn to Dollars 2.86bn, despite a sharp fall in aircraft fuel costs, down from Dollars 534.3m to Dollars 394.8m. Delta's passenger/mile yield improved from 13.83 cents to 14.17 cent, but the average load factor stood at 57.2 (55.9) per cent, against a break-even load factor of 62.7 per cent. Pan Am's failed attempt to reorganise - in which Delta was to have been a major player - also weighed on non-operating expenses, affecting pre and after-tax figures. The overall non-operating charge was Dollars 56.6m, incorporating a Dollars 50m write-off relating to Delta's participation in the Pan Am reorganisation effort. Analysts had expected a large loss for the quarter, but the figure was at the bottom end of expectations, and the shares fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 73 1/8 at close of trade. Mr Roeck said the carrier was 'encouraged by recent declines in fuel prices and a move towards a more rational industry pricing structure'.</p>

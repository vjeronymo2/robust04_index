			<p>BFN     [Text] Croatia's President Franjo Tudjman today granted an  interview to a British publicist, Sir Fitzroy McLean, to be  broadcast on Dutch television, regarding affairs in southeastern  Europe and the history of relations between nations in the  former Yugoslavia.    Commenting on the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, President  Tudjman stressed that, through the Washington agreement on the  Bosnia-Herzegovina federation and its confederation with the  Republic of Croatia, Croatian and Muslim interests have been  harmonized with the interests of the Republic of Croatia and  those of the Western world that wanted to link Muslims with  Western civilization.    Speaking about relations between Croatia and Serbia, the  Croatian president said that the mutual recognition will create  the basis for peace and the establishment of a new international  order in that part of Europe. He also said that the area of the  Balkans should undergo a process of Scandinavization, recalling  that the Scandinavian states recognized each other after years  of being at war, then cooperated with each other, and  successfully resolved the question of protecting minorities'  rights.</p>

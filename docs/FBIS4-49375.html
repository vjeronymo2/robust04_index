			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 5 (AFP)--China denounced Thursday U.S.  plans to set up an information office in Tibet to promote  discussion of human rights, caling them a blatant attempt to  undermine Chinese sovereignty. "It is shocking for the US  government to show contempt for the norms governing  international relations and blatantly undermine the sovereignty  of China and try to split China," foreign ministry spokesman Wu  Jianmin told a weekly press briefing.    Provisions contained in the Foreign Relations Authorisation  Act adopted by the U.S. Congress on April 28 instruct the  director of the US Informations Agency "to seek to establish an  office" in the Tibetan capital Lhasa.    The office would promote the discussion of human rights,  promote U.S. private sector involvement in educational and  cultural activities, advise Washington on Tibetan popular  opinion and disseminate information on the United States.    "What the US government is going to do in this connection  must have prior consent on the part of the Chinese Government,"  Wu said, adding: "We will definitely not agree."    Wu slammed the act for "even going so far as to name Tibet  as  a country" and demanded that Washington strictly abide by the  principle that Tibet is an integral part of China.    While President Bill Clinton has agreed in principle with  the  sentiments contained in the relevant provisions, he has  expressed reservations that their formulation may infringe on  the president's prerogative in negotiations with foreign  governments.    U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific  Affairs said Wednesday that Washington was keen to see more  progress from Beijing on the question of Tibet, most notably on  U.S. calls for a meeting between Tibet's exiled leader, the  Dalai Lama, and Chinese officials.</p>

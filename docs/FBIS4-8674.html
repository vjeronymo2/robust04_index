			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Robert Krasowski under the "Analysis" rubric: </F> "Pawlak To Wage a War Against Walesa?"]    [Text] The coalition's decision means waging a war against  the Belvedere. It is also obvious that the coalition had known  from the very beginning that its initiative will cause precisely  these kinds of consequences since Walesa announced a long time  ago that he will respond to attempts to limit his powers by  dissolving parliament. So why did the coalition decide to take  the step?    There is no simple answer to the question and that is mainly  because for the first time, the coalition took a joint position  and that is enough to cause major amazement. Ever since it was  established, the coalition had to deal with various degrees of  disputes and for the last three months, it has been in a state  of permanent crisis. So what could the Democratic Left Alliance  [SLD] and the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] gain by striking at the  Belvedere together?    In SLD's case, the issue is simple. It has become obvious  for the winner in the 19 September elections, that Poland is  just not big enough for SLD aspiring to be the first player, and  Walesa who is getting ready to be reelected. All of the SLD's  political measures were directly or indirectly torpedoed by the  Belvedere. Such was the case with the introduction of deputy  ministers into presidential ministries (recently, the Belvedere  has made a particularly malicious mockery of the SLD's candidate  to the Defense Ministry); it was the same case with pushing  through the electoral law to gmina [small administrative units]  councils, and also with the neo- popiwek [wage-controlling]  legislation.    Blocking Dariusz Rosati's nomination was the most  spectacular  strike by the Belvedere. After that decision, SLD leaders made  a decision that they cannot conduct a common game with Walesa,  and they decided to give up trying to come up with another  candidate. They decided a war with Walesa must take place and  that they will wage it under the banner of Rosati, no less.    At any rate, for a few months now the SLD leadership has  deliberated on what front to wage this war to prevent society  from perceiving it as a battle for posts. In the end, the  leadership made a decision that a campaign for the entry of a  professional into the government will be socially successful.  "What are we to do, if the president interferes with our  day-to-day ruling of the country?" -- this is the kind of  argument which society must like.    This kind of war will surely be supported by the SLD's  anti-Walesa electorate. What is more, the war will strengthen  the electorate which is seriously bitter over the lack of  implementation of the election program. At the same time, the  SLD is exposing an enemy who is making it impossible to  implement the promises soon.    The coalition's war with the Belvedere is extremely  beneficial to the SLD also for the reason that it throws Pawlak  once and for all into the arms of his coalition partner. After  all, it is thanks to a joint game with the Belvedere that Pawlak  was successful in marginalizing the SLD's political influence.  A breaking apart of the Pawlak-Belvedere alliance is -- from  the SLD's perspective -- not just a guarantee of the coalition's  durability, but also a prospect for dominating the PSL which in  the future will be left entirely on its own.    There is also a personal element in the fight. It is no  accident that it was precisely Kwasniewski (along with  Cimoszewicz) who was trying to push through a constitutional  amendment during a meeting of the coalition. It is precisely  Kwasniewski who is the main victim of the Pawlak-Walesa  alliance. By breaking the arrangement apart, Kwasniewski can  hope for a reconstruction of his political authority and also  for delivering a blow to his main political rivals in the  presidential campaign -- Walesa first of all, and second Pawlak,  who is condemned to cooperation with the SLD.    All this leads to just one thing -- the cards will finally  go into the hands of the SLD, which for the last few months has  been watching state politics more than shaping them. And if one  can defeat Walesa in the war, then the SLD's triumph will be  complete. Once Walesa is defeated, it will be easy to push him  out of the political scene. But Pawlak himself must be aware of  these motives of the SLD leaders. Despite that -- and to the  leaders' surprise -- the prime minister agreed to a war being  waged against Walesa. Perhaps Pawlak himself got scared of  being too dependent on the Belvedere and he came to understand  that support for the SLD initiative is a precondition for  maintaining the coalition's coherency. But that still does not  explain why he spoke so clearly in the SLD's favor. It was not  so long ago that he himself explained to PSL Sejm deputies that  he wants to avoid situations where he would be a side in an  SLD-Walesa dispute. He knows very well that once Walesa turns  against him, he will be condemned to cooperation with the SLD  which is stronger in parliament than he is.    But it is quite possible that Pawlak's consent is not final  yet. If it turns out that Walesa regards the attempt to limit  his powers not as a dispute but as a war, then Pawlak may  distance himself from the plan to amend the Small Constitution.  It is no accident that it is a draft coming from Sejm deputies,  and not from the coalition. So it is possible that SLD will be  finally left alone in its fight with the president.    It is also possible that Pawlak felt offended by the  rejection of Rosati's candidacy. After all, from a certain  point in time, Rosati was not just the SLD's candidate but the  entire coalition's. All society could see, was that the prime  minister went to the Belvedere with a motion to have Rosati  nominated, and Walesa refused.    The threat to veto the budget must not have been to Pawlak's  liking, either. After all, it was his government that had  prepared the budget, and the possibility of vetoing it would be  a strike primarily against Pawlak himself. It turned out that  Walesa likes to keep people in suspense and to deliver affronts  not just to the SLD.    It seems that apart from the above, there are just two  explanations for Pawlak's decision. The first one -- and the  least likely -- is that Pawlak became convinced that in order to  win the presidential elections, one must destroy Walesa as soon  as possible. And since Walesa is a difficult opponent, one must  begin fighting him now.    The other explanation is that Pawlak and the SLD have not  declared a war yet but they have set an ultimatum. So Pawlak is  not delivering a strike at Walesa but he is just putting on a  show intended to be a show of force. If Walesa nominates Rosati  and if he stops blocking the introduction of coalition deputy  ministers into the presidential ministries, then the coalition  will reject the Sejm deputies' draft. Then a war will not take  place, and all the parties will be able to present their  decisions as a victory. Pawlak will prove that he is a real  prime minister who does not allow either the SLD or the  president to interfere with his prerogatives. The SLD will  demonstrate that it is not an opponent that anyone can mistreat.  And Walesa will demonstrate that he places responsibility for  the country over personal ambitions.    But if all it is, is just an ultimatum, then it will have a  major flaw from the president's standpoint -- he has no  guarantee that the coalition will not take it as a sign of his  weakness, and that it will not think of ruling the country  without Lech Walesa.    So if all Pawlak meant was an ultimatum, he managed to wage  a  war, anyway.</p>

Staresina report on news conference by Foreign Minister </F> and Deputy Prime Minister Dr. Mate Granic in Zagreb; date not  given: "The Way to the Final Solution"]    [Text] The Washington agreement is a historic one because  it marks a definite geostrategic orientation of Croatia toward  the West, and everything that follows, and the complete  conciliation of the Croats, except certain marginal people,  concerning the concept of Bosnia-Herzegovina and connecting  Croatia to the Bosnia- Herzegovina federation. The current  negotiations in Vienna concern the constitution of the future  federation. In the next few days, the delegations in Vienna  should determine the intercantonal demarcations, especially in  central Bosnia, after which the negotiations on the demarcation  toward the Serbs will follow. Once the relations with the Serbs  are settled, then follow the talks on the model of the  confederation between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, said Dr.  Mate Granic, deputy prime minister and foreign minister, before  leaving for Moscow, where, as he remarked, he was going to  demand a confirmation of the Russian recognition of the  territorial sovereignty of Croatia.    Minister Granic pointed out that the Washington agreement  was  the expression of the continuity of Croatian politics, which has  supported the model of a decentralized Bosnia-Herzegovina and  the proposed peace plans since the beginning -- from Cutiliero's  to Vance-Owen's to Owen-Stoltenberg's -- which offered various  degrees of decentralization. The Croat-Muslim talks on a  confederation started as early as last fall, when several models  of the organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina and its relations with  Croatia were discussed.    "However, there was no realistic force from the outside that  would support one of the peace plans and become involved in  their implementation, until, after the stagnation in the Geneva  talks, the United States signaled that it would implement the  agreement in consultation with Russia and the European Union,"  said Dr. Granic, adding that, following the U.S. decision to  become actively involved in the peace process, U.S. Vice  President Al Gore talked to President Tudjman on the phone,  telling him about the U.S. initiative, which was accepted  immediately, while, in the final stage of the Washington  negotiations, President Clinton talked to the Croatian  president. During the Washington negotiations, the  consultations between Washington and Moscow, Washington and the  European allies, and Granic and Tudjman were practically  constant.    "The reaching of the agreement was welcomed by practically  all the important countries. Many European countries  congratulated President Tudjman. The only country in which the  agreement has been received with some anxiety is Serbia," said  Minister Granic, adding that the Bosniak side also accepted the  agreement very well, that all the members of its delegation  involved in the negotiations were interested in the  confederation between the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation and  Croatia, and that the results on the ground, primarily those  related to the ending of the conflict between the HVO [Croatian  Defense Council] and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, were beyond  expectations.    As far as the special solutions are concerned, Granic said  that western Bosnia would be a canton with the Muslim majority  and one Croat municipality, while its demarcation with the Serbs  is left to be negotiated. Posavina will be a canton with a  Croat majority, considerably extended in relation to the present  territory held by the Croats and Muslims, and will contain a  corridor for the Serbs, but just a corridor.    Talking about the pressures on the Croats regarding the  reaching of an agreement, Minister Granic said that the Croat  delegation entered the negotiations with thoroughly worked-out  models that also contained the proposal of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina federation and its confederation with  Croatia, as the United States had the information that most  Bosniaks also wanted the same and just needed a mighty force  that would support those wishes and give guarantees for their  realization. Regarding the occupied areas of Croatia, Minister  Granic says there are no written guarantees, but that U.S. Vice  President Gore offered U.S. assistance in their reintegration  should the agreement with the Muslims be reached. Croatia, on  the other hand, will offer the United Nations, or rather the  secretary general, its proposal for solving the problem of UNPA  [United Nations Protected Area] zones based on Security Council  resolutions (even on the one regarding the control of borders)  but which would contain the means for their implementation.    Referring to the possible future course of the negotiations,  Minister Granic concluded that the reaching of the Washington  agreement and the active involvement of the United States  crossed the Rubicon on the way to the final solution, for  without coordinating Croat-Muslim relations, the negotiations  could not go forward, and that, for the first time, this laid a  firm foundation for negotiations with the Serbs.</p>

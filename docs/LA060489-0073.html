			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUIT AGAINST OFFICER IS AN 'AGGRAVATION'  </P> <P> Re: "Family Sues Police Officer Who Saved Woman" (Times, May 25).  </P> <P> This was a tragic situation, and I wouldn't put this to pen in such a flip  manner, but Mr. (Lucius) Parkinson opened the door with his frivolous lawsuit  against Officer Devin Chase.  </P> <P> Using Mr. Parkinson's logic of finding someone to fault, he might want to blame  himself and sue himself for not teaching his daughter common sense. Although  this lawsuit will obviously be "tossed," it will probably still be in Officer  Chase's head, an aggravation no cop needs, especially the next time he acts to  save a life.  </P> <P> JOHN M.

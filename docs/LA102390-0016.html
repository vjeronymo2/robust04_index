			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN BERNARDINO;  </P> <P> CREWS GAIN CONTROL OF LYTLE CREEK FIRE  </P> <P> Santa Ana winds subsided, helping more than 750 firefighters gain the upper  hand on a wildfire that burned 550 acres of valuable wildlife habitat in the  San Bernardino National Forest, a U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> The blaze broke out Saturday in Lytle Creek Canyon, north of Fontana, and  briefly threatened a subdivision under construction. Biologists said the fire  posed an unusual threat to deer, bear and Nelson bighorn sheep in the area  because the species' habitat was ravaged by two earlier fires. The cause of the  blaze, which officials initially estimated had charred 1,200 acres, remains  under investigation.  </P></p>

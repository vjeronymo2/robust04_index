			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Heseltine rejects OFT bus advice MR MICHAEL Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has overturned recommendations by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, that South Yorkshire Transport, a Sheffield bus company, should sell four rival bus companies acquired in 1989, Robert Rice writes. The company was ordered to sell Sheffield and District Transport, Sheafline (PSV), SUT and Michael Groves after a 1990 MMC report found the acquisitions were against the public interest. Implementation of the recommendations was suspended pending the outcome of a legal challenge to the report's findings. After the Law Lords ruled against the company last December the Office of Fair Trading carried out a review of bus services in the Sheffield area which concluded that the company should still be required to sell. Mr Heseltine said yesterday he agreed with Sir Bryan's assessment that competition concerns remained, but he had decided on balance to ask him first to try to negotiate behavioural undertakings from the company.</p>

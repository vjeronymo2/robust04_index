			<p>BFN     [Text] According to Seoul KBS-1 Radio, on 21 April the  U.S. imperialists finally began to deploy new-model Patriot  missiles to the central region of the front line in South Korea,  despite strong protest and denunciation by the Korean people and  by a broad range of world public opinion. This is an open  challenge to us and is aimed at threatening us militarily and  carrying out a preemptive strike against the Northern half of  the Republic.    The beginning of the U.S. deployment of new-model Patriot  missiles to the central region of the front line while talking  about a nonexisting offensive threat by someone else is a  deliberate, dangerous military act [uidojogin wihomhan kunsa  haengdong] to make the situation on the Korean peninsula more  unstable [touk puranjonghage hago], and further, to prompt  [yubal] a new war.    The deployment of new-model Patriot missiles in broad  daylight plainly shows that the U.S. authorities can cast any  international agreement away like dirt to achieve their goal of  aggression, taking no regard of the Armistice Agreement or the  armistice organization.    The U.S. imperialists should discreetly act, being well  aware  what grave consequence will result from the deployment of  new-model Patriot missiles, which pose a great threat to the  peace and security of Korean peninsula and the Far East.</p>

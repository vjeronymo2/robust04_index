			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / New index of mortgage lending shows 3% rise A slightly brighter picture of the UK housing market was painted yesterday as a new mortgage lending index showed a rise in advances of more than 3 per cent last month compared with July. The first publication of the Barclays Bank index shows that mortgage lending rose 3.3 per cent in August compared with July, and was 4.7 per cent higher than in August last year. The index, which deals with mortgage advances from a wide range of lenders, is based on the volume of mortgage transactions flowing through the accounts of solicitors who bank with Barclays. The bank has a market share of about 30 per cent of all solicitors' accounts. Mr Garry Skelton, head of Barclays mortgages, said that the bank had tracked the index privately against the monthly lending statistics produced by the Bank of England for almost two years, and had found a very close correlation between the two sets of figures. As well as coming ahead of the official figures, the Barclays index can produce indicators for different regions in England and Wales. For August these suggested that the region with the greatest increase in activity was north-west England, followed by East Anglia. The most marked decline in mortgage lending, according to the index, was in southern England. There was a 9.6 per cent drop in August compared with July. A more encouraging gloss on the housing market in the south-east came , however, from Woolwich Building Society, the UK's third-largest society. Mr Peter Robinson, Woolwich managing director, said he believed the house prices survey published by Halifax Building Society, the UK's largest mortgage lender, underestimated growth in southern England, where Woolwich has most of its branches. Halifax reported that house prices fell by 0.7 per cent last month.</p>

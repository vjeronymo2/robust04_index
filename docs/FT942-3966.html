			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Lille's public transport sets an example for Europe: As others lobby for a single line, this French city is extending its network The first stop for many travellers through the Channel tunnel will be the French city of Lille, a former textile and mining centre which has been given new life by the creation of France's network of trains a grande vitesse. Strategically placed at a junction of the high-speed lines between London, Paris and Brussels, Lille recently completed a new TGV station as part of a FFr5.3bn (Pounds 625m) office development. But civic pride in the TGV connection is matched by Lille's commitment to an integrated public transport system for the city and the neighbouring towns. Lille's approach to running its transport network provides some interesting lessons parallels for local authorities elsewhere in Europe. While on the British side of the Channel, Birmingham, the UK's second largest conurbation, lobbies desperately for government funding for a single high-speed rail line, Lille, a city of 1.1m people, is busily extending its existing underground network, having just completed a FFr1.3bn upgrade of its tram system. It has financed its impressively modern infrastructure with the help of government grants which meet 20 per cent of its investment costs and 25-year to 30-year loans which cover 80 per cent. The loans are repaid in part by a tax on local businesses. Companies which employ more than nine people pay 1.6 per cent of their payroll costs towards the municipality's transport bill. In return, their employees travel for free on public network. Proposals in the UK for a proportion of the business rate paid by London companies to go towards funding the CrossRail project, an underground link between the east and west ends of the capital, found little favour with the Treasury. Central to Lille's public transport network is its underground, the first line of which was built to link central Lille with a new university suburb, Villeneuve d'Ascq. Three years before London's Docklands opened its overground automatic rail system in 1987, Lille began operating its own underground driverless trains. It currently has two lines in operation covering a total of 15 miles and is extending the network to the neighbouring towns of Roubaix, Tourcoing and ultimately the Belgian border, says Mr Bernard Guilleminot, director of operations. Safety on the underground platforms is enhanced by platform barriers which open only when the train is in the station. Stations on London's Jubilee Line extension in 1998 will have a similar feature. The low operating costs of the underground system mean that revenues exceed costs by 10 per cent (including interest charges) though the more labour-intensive bus and tram networks cover only half of their costs. Overall the entire transport network earned revenues of FFr380m against costs of FFr530m in 1993. This deficit is met from city funds with no contribution from the government to operating costs. The creation of a high-tech underground system made Lille's 80-year old tram network look inadequate, so in 1989 a decision was taken to replace track, signals and the trams themselves. Some stations were put underground to smooth traffic flows; station platforms were raised to align themselves with the Italian-built trams, which run at speeds of up to 70kph. To simplify journeys, Lille has introduced a travelcard similar to those in use in London and other large British cities. This allows travellers to switch between metro, trams and buses. But Lille has gone further by extending the availability of its tickets to taxis. This allows travellers from outlying suburbs to take a cab to reach their local underground terminus. This taxi service requires two of the standard FFr7.50 travel cards. As part of its efforts to drive down costs, Socialist-run Lille - its mayor is Pierre Mauroy, a former prime minister - has delegated the management of its transport network to a private company, Transpole, part of the Via GTI group, which runs the public transport systems of several other French cities. Transpole won a five-year contract in a tender competition held in 1993. If the cost of running the system is higher than expected Transpole's profits suffer. But if receipts are greater than forecast, the agreement is re-negotiated to reduce the windfall profit. In many European cities improving public transport has been accompanied by with tough restrictions on the use of the private car. But the new Euralille office and retail complex arising alongside the TGV station and the nearby metro station will provide no fewer than 6,000 car parking spaces. Improvements to Lille's metro and trams have limited the increase in the number of cars driving into the city centre but the city says there has been no overt discrimination against cars.</p>

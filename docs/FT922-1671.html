			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Pilots' union picks former Communist A FORMER Communist has been elected general secretary of the British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa) - a union that has traditionally prided itself on being non-political but which is thought to have a relatively high proportion of Conservative voters. Mr Chris Darke, 42, an official of the MSF general technical union for 15 years, won 57 per cent of the votes in a ballot that attracted a 61 per cent turnout among Balpa's 5,300 members. He will start the Pounds 45,000-a-year job next month. Balpa's national executive had backed Mr Darke, but supporters of Mr David Lebrecht, Balpa assistant general secretary and the only other candidate, said most members were unaware of Mr Darke's political background when they made the decision in March. During the election campaign Mr Lebrecht's supporters enlisted Mr Norman Tebbit, former employment secretary and Balpa member, who warned that the union was in danger of losing its apolitical reputation if it elected Mr Darke. Mr Darke said yesterday he had never tried to hide his former membership of the Communist party. He had left the party in 1985 'because I fundamentally disagreed with what they were doing' and now described himself as centre left in the Labour party. The job of general secretary of Balpa was not about politics, he said. 'If Balpa did subscribe to any political view my first advice would be to isolate from it as speedily as possible.' Mr Darke wants Balpa to play a central role in developing the European Cockpit Association, an embryonic European union for flying crew. 'It has tremendous potential to become the first truly European union,' he said. Mr Darke's election follows the death last year of Mark Young, who was general secretary for 17 years.</p>

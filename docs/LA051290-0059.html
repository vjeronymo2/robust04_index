			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL GUARD ACTIONS IN '65 WATTS RIOTING  </P> <P> Unlike New York, Chicago and other Eastern cities, we Angelenos had not, until  August of 1965, experienced a major riot, and there had been no warning.  </P> <P> No, then as now, we Sunny Southern Californians were more concerned with the  beaches, Disneyland or vacations, and the status quo was truly in force.  </P> <P> Judging by Letofsky's article, writer Michael Lazarou appears to have created  an honest, authentic script. Let's hope the generation born in the last  quarter-century will take heed and learn the lessons of this historic, tragic  event, thereby preventing a sequel!  </P> <P> EDDIE CRESS, Los Angeles  </P></p>

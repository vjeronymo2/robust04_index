			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Starikevich: "Belarus Could Be Left </F> Without Military Counterintelligence"]    [Text] Minsk -- The Belarusian military  counterintelligence could become the latest victim of the  collapse of the country's law enforcement system.    The Belarusian Ministry of Defense is eager to take military  counterintelligence under its wing and turning it into a puppet  special service. It cannot be ruled out that the republican  KGB's military counterintelligence directorate will also be  dissolved.    A development of events whereby the matter will be  restricted  to internal reform of the directorate is also possible. The  question of replacing the leadership of military  counterintelligence is also on the agenda. Its present head  Valeriy Kez, deputy chairman of the Belarusian KGB and a  professional counterintelligence worker with experience of work  in combat situations behind him, is no longer to the liking of  influential persons in the government.    What factors brought about this situation? Matters are in a  better shape in military counterintelligence than in many other  law enforcement structures. Here are just two examples. In May  last year, on the basis of material prepared by  counterintelligence workers, criminal procedures were instituted  against 10 border guards who had been systematically stealing  video equipment and other valuables from trains. It is quite  interesting that a further 68 guardians of the Motherland's  borders are being brought as witnesses in these cases.    A little more than one year ago, thanks to military  counterintelligence work, a trade transaction involving the  sale, with the agreement of the Ministry of Defense, of the  "Igla" portable antiaircraft missile complex by the state-owned  foreign trading firm "Belarusintorg" was thwarted. This weapon,  incidentally, has no counterpart in the world in its combat  qualities and, according to international classification, can  also be a terrorist weapon ("Igla" is highly compact, and  capable of destroying more than just aerial targets).    Military counterintelligence is a structure having  everything  necessary for autonomous existence: intelligence,  counterintelligence, analysis, and investigations subdivisions.  It is quite capable of becoming an autonomous federal organ  under the control of the Supreme Soviet or the government. The  experience of Ukraine, where military counterintelligence was  merged with territorial subdivisions of the security service,  followed by the reverse process, is sufficiently indicative.  Nor did Russia take the risk of handing over military  counterintelligence to the Ministry of Defense.    Belarusian reformers are driven by other motives. Their  complaints against military counterintelligence are political  rather than professional. It is perfectly obvious that  publicizing the negative aspects of the activity of the Ministry  of Defense and the Border Guard Troops is not to the liking of  their leaders, Pavel Kozlovskiy and Yevgeniy Bocharov. The  latter has found an original way out of the situation by  creating, with the tacit consent of the Council of Ministers,  his own special service -- the Special Active Measures Service  [otdelnaya sluzhba aktivnykh mer].    Today high-ranking functionaries are seeking to make the law  enforcement organs not simply an instrument in the struggle for  power, but actually an instrument protecting the interests of  one political grouping or another. The first blow to the MVD  [Ministry of Internal Affairs] and the KGB was dealt in January  this year. Using the arrest and extradition to Vilnius of two  leaders of the Lithuanian Communist Party, who had been hiding  for a long time on the republic's territory, as a pretext for  creating a scandal, the government lobby settled its accounts  with power ministers Vladimir Yegorov and Eduard Shirkovskiy.    They were too autonomous for the Council of Ministers and  permitted themselves unheard-of audacities, such as appealing to  the leaders of the republic in connection with interference in  their activity by Gennadiy Danilov, "[Prime Minister] Kebich's  right-hand man." At that time Danilov occupied the post of  state secretary for combatting crime and for national security.    Following publication of the letter from Shirkovskiy and  Yegorov by the mass media the prime minister promised to abolish  the State Secretariat. But matters went no further than a  change of names: The former State Secretariat is now called  Administration for Coordinating the Activity of Administrative  Organs. Danilov himself took up the post of government  secretary, with undefined duties and unlimited powers. Yegorov  was replaced by Vladimir Danko, who made himself famous by  declaring in one of his first press conferences his membership  of the Communist Party.    At the moment it is hard to say anything definite about  Gennadiy Lavitskiy, the new KGB chairman. But he and Danko are  far more loyal to the Council of Ministers than their  predecessors.    It would appear that military counterintelligence is again  in  hot water. The scandal over the theft of documents from a car  belonging to Iosif Seredich, chief editor of the parliamentary  newspaper, is being used as a pretext for firing Valeriy Kez.  This scandal may not have provoked widespread reaction. But  these documents contained not only information on crimes  committed by the border guards, but also on certain unofficial  links between Border Guard Troops Commander Yevgeniy Bocharov  and Hryb, Danilov, and Lavitskiy.    The evidence was passed to a journalist by a military  counterintelligence officer fired from the State Security organs  on the instruction of the KGB leadership. These documents were  deemed unclassified on the basis of the results of an official  investigation in December. But one month ago the Council of  Ministers instigated a new investigation, whose conclusions  turned out to be diametrically opposite.    The Belarusian KGB Collegium, at its session in the second  half of March, refused to adopt a decree on Kez' resignation.  Now the solution of this question has been left to the  discretion of the relevant parliamentary commission.    According to available information, this commission is  already preparing to replace Kez. It is expected that Colonel  Valentin Simirskiy will become head of military  counterintelligence. For the past five years he has led the  Russian 1st Tank Army military counterintelligence department.  It is interesting to note that, at the time when Simirskiy was  serving in a formation of the Russian group of forces in  Germany, Danilov's daughter was also posted there. A strange  situation, is it not: The daughter of a high-ranking government  functionary serving in the army of another state?    In this case military counterintelligence will evidently  cease to ask unnecessary questions.    Many military counterintelligence officers, tired of the  intrigues developing around their department, have submitted  separation requests. Work in the security services of  commercial structures awaits them. Certain counterintelligence  workers are still hoping for a dignified solution to the  question, but they too will leave if the Ministry of Defense or  anyone else make a "puppet" of the special service.    The collapse of the military counterintelligence service  will  hardly be to the benefit of sovereign Belarus. But when state  functionaries allow considerations of personal benefit to get  the better of state interests, it is hard to expect a different  development of events.</p>

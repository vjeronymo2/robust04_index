			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> FRIENDS OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD DECRY RECENT DISRUPTIONS OF THEIR MEETINGS  </P> <P> The recent efforts to disrupt a peaceful meeting of South Bay Friends of  Planned Parenthood/Los Angeles (May 8) are a tragic commentary on the  unwillingness of anti-choice forces to allow rational and calm discussion of  issues related to choice. These disruptive actions strike at the very heart of  every American's right of free speech and freedom of assembly.  </P> <P> A small but vocal minority of Catholic activists, led by members of St.  Lawrence Martyr Church in Redondo Beach, exerted enormous pressure on the owner  of the facility where our meeting was scheduled. Threats against the owner and  his employees caused the owner to fear for the economic future of his business.  Planned Parenthood has no desire to harm any business enterprise and we  voluntarily agreed to move our meeting site.  </P> <P> Unsatisfied, this radical group attacked HomeFed in Redondo Beach, where we  rescheduled the meeting in the community room. That organization caved in  quickly to the pressure of threatening telephone calls. Planned Parenthood  regrets any inconvenience we may have caused the bank. We believe, however,  (that) every individual and corporate entity has an obligation to support the  right of free speech and freedom of assembly in America.  </P> <P> What the protesters fail to understand is that Planned Parenthood is committed  to low-cost family planning services and reproductive health care for both men  and women. Ninety-two percent of the organization's budget is devoted to  education and the prevention of unwanted pregnancies. We are particularly  concerned about the epidemic of teen-age pregnancies in our community and  across the country.  </P> <P> The South Bay Friends of Planned Parenthood/Los Angeles are outraged by the  actions of those who would prevent the free exchange of ideas. Fear,  intimidation and closed minds are dangerous in a democratic society. We are  committed to continuing our schedule of meetings that provide a valuable source  of information to the community, presented in a thoughtful and intelligent  manner.  </P> <P>  -- Steering Committee  </P> <P> South Bay Friends of Planned Parenthood/Los Angeles  </P></p>

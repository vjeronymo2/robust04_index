			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / National Power backs gas stations NATIONAL POWER, the UK's largest electricity generator, said it is more likely to reduce emissions of harmful substances by switching from coal to gas than by installing clean-up equipment at coal-fired power stations. Mr John Baker, chief executive, said yesterday that the high cost of equipment to remove sulphur from flue gases made it commercially logical to build more gas-fired plant instead. He was launching the company's first environmental report, which shows that National Power is spending Pounds 1bn on power station clean-ups - most of it at the giant Drax station in North Yorkshire where desulphurisation is costing nearly Pounds 700m. Mr Baker said there were no plans to install desulphurisation equipment at other power stations. Instead, the company is investing a further Pounds 1bn in power stations based on fuels such as natural gas. Mr Baker said he was confident the company could meet the government-imposed target of cutting sulphur dioxide emissions from last year's 1.3m tonnes to 660,000 tonnes by the year 2003. Mr Baker said National Power revised and strengthened its environmental policy in 1992. Yesterday's report was intended to be a full disclosure of the company's environmental position, including details of all infringements  -29 at power stations and 10 at construction sites. Mr Baker said he would question the Pollution Inspectorate over its decision to authorise PowerGen, the main rival generator in England and Wales, to burn orimulsion, the controversial bituminous fuel, at two of its power stations. He was concerned that PowerGen was being given five years to install clean-up equipment when National Power had received indications that it would have to install such equipment before it could burn any orimulsion. Environmentalists condemned the decision yesterday. Ms Fiona Weir of Friends of the Earth said no orimulsion should be burnt without pollution controls. The government was 'all over the place' on environmental policy.</p>

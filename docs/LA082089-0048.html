			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE WEEK: ELIZABETH HAILEY: LIFE WITH A PLAYWRIGHT  </P> <P> "People are probably more embarrassed for us than we are for ourselves --  because we know what really happened," said Elizabeth Forsythe Hailey of her  two-character comedy-drama, "Joanna's Husband and David's Wife" (opening  tonight at the Pasadena Playhouse), a semi-autobiographical account of her  29-year marriage to playwright Oliver Hailey. "The truth is, I've taken great  liberties."  </P> <P> She describes her story as "the drama that begins after 'happily ever after.' "  The play opens with David, 25 years married, waking up to find that his wife  has taken off; the only explanation left is a journal she's kept since the day  they met. As he reads aloud from it, "The play unfolds inside his head," Hailey  noted. "So at first it's an older David looking back on Joanna when she was  young, remembering how enthusiastic and naive she was -- before life battered  them.  </P> <P> "At one stage, Joanna is content to be 'David's wife.' Then he has to learn how  to be 'Joanna's husband,' when she writes a book that's successful." Hailey  faced a bit of that herself a few years ago when her first novel, "A Woman of  Independent Means," became a hit -- as a book, then a play. Real-life also  takes a twist with the casting of Kendall Hailey (the author's daughter) as  Joanna. "Seeing her is very Fellini-esque," Hailey admits, "because it's real  enough to make people wonder."  </P> <P> That reality wasn't always easy to work with.  </P> <P> "At first, you wonder if anybody's interested (in your story)," she said. "But  this is my third novel, and I'm getting brave enough to get close to the  material of my own life -- and also have the courage to embroider facts, not be  afraid to invent and heighten the drama. In 'A Woman of Independent Means,' I  found that by using specific incidents from my own life, I could relate to a  lot of people. It's the same with this marriage. I'd say the tone is  bittersweet, finally affirmative -- but a bit ambivalent. It's a hard-earned  happy ending."  </P> <P> Bill Cort directs.  </P> <P> THEATER FILE: David Schweizer, who directed Marlane Meyer's controversial  "Kingfish" last fall at the Los Angeles Theatre Center, will re-team with the  playwright for her Las Vegas-set "The Geography of Luck," opening Friday at  LATC. In the cast: Ennalls Berl, John Considine, Christine Elise, Arliss  Howard, Garrett Morris, Deirdre O'Connell, Tom Rosqui and Susan Tyrrell.  </P> <P> The Beverly Hills Theatre Guild has announced its annual Julie Harris  Playwright Competition.

Richard Jordan directs.  </P> <P> Said Sylvie Drake in The Times: "Havel overcame the detachment of the early  didactic scenes to end his play with a deliberate flamboyant flourish of  jeering and spent emotion. He got it right. The Taper gets it partly right."  </P> <P> From Steve Mikulan in the L.A. Weekly: "Havel's Faustian fable would no doubt  strike many a sensitive chord back home, but in America it leaves us a bit  cold. The main problem is the deliberate vagueness of the script."  </P> <P> Noted the Orange County Register's Jeff Rubio: "Fine director Jordan and a  splendid cast work very hard to milk the play for its theatrical potential,  (which) yields some hearty laughs and moments of insight about state duplicity  and suspicion of non-conformists. But they are disconnected moments."  </P> <P> Said Charles Marowitz in the Herald Examiner: "Jordan's production captures all  the levity of Havel's work but almost none of its gravity. It's as if the  director felt a pill so remorselessly dialectical had to be generously sugared  and sprinkled with jimmies if it were going to be swallowed at all."  </P> <P> And from the Daily News' Tom Jacobs: "Havel is an accomplished playwright. His  technique of having one scene echo another -- key lines and situations get  repeated in slightly different form -- give the play an eerie, neo-absurdist  edge. His characters don't have much depth but a number are amusing."  </P></p>

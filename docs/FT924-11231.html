			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / International Company News: Mazda curtails US expansion MAZDA Motor, the Japanese carmaker, is giving up its ambitious plan to launch a separate sales network in the US to market luxury cars. The decision is one of the most significant retrenchment moves by the Japanese motor industry during the current recession. The company is halting development of a V12 luxury saloon, planned as the flagship of its luxury car range, and pulling out of world sports prototype car racing for at least two years, only a year after winning the Le Mans 24-hour race in France. Mazda said yesterday it had been forced to abandon its luxury car strategy in the US in the face of its worsening financial performance, the strength of the yen, and continuing weakness of the US new car market. The group announced in August last year its long-awaited move to set up a luxury car sales channel in the US under the Amati name, with sales due to begin in spring 1994. It was seeking to emulate its bigger domestic rivals - Honda, Toyota and Nissan - which had set up separate luxury car franchises in the US by the end of the 1980s under the respective brand names of Acura, Lexus and Infiniti. Mazda's retrenchment in North America follows the decision earlier this year by Daihatsu, one of the smaller Japanese carmakers, to withdraw from the depressed US new car market. The moves reflect the growing financial squeeze on Japanese carmakers, which are facing a second successive year of falling sales in their domestic market, while demand is weakening in west Europe and sales remain depressed in the US. Mazda's parent company pre-tax profits in the year to March 1993 are forecast to fall 64 per cent to about Y7bn (Dollars 58m), from Y19.7bn last year, half its earlier estimate. This would be a decline of 86 per cent during the past two years. The Japanese carmaker, in which Ford holds a 24.5 per cent stake, has revitalised its product range in the past couple of years, but in the process its finances have become seriously overstretched and it is losing market share in Japan. Adding to Mazda's present difficulties is its lack of a production base in west Europe, where it is the only leading Japanese carmaker without firm plans for local production.</p>

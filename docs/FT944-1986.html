			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Nine dissidents are jailed for up to 20 years China yesterday signalled a crackdown on dissidents, jailing nine activists for 'counter-revolutionary' crimes, including a 20-year sentence for a university lecturer involved in pro-democracy activities. These are the toughest penalties meted out to political activists since the trials following the Tiananmen Square massacre of June 1989 in which the army fired on demonstrators in and around Beijing's central square. In Hong Kong, Mr Robin Munro of the Human Rights Watch said he was 'frankly appalled' by the severity of the sentences. 'None of those accused were involved in even a hint of violence,' he said. 'They were all engaged in promoting free speech and freedom of association.' Western officials in Beijing said the tough sentences were a sign that the authorities were intent on sending an uncompromising message to dissidents as uncertainty deepens over the transition to a new generation of leaders in place of the ailing Deng Xiaoping. The leadership in this difficult transition phase is grappling with high inflation, incipient unrest among workers laid off from faltering state enterprises, a restless peasantry whose incomes are being squeezed by rising costs and a worrying increase in crime. Those sentenced were involved in various pro-democracy organisations, including the China Progressive Alliance, the Free Labour Union of China and the Liberal Democratic Party. The heaviest sentence was imposed on Hu Shenglun (Hu Shigen), a 39-year-old lecturer at the Beijing languages institute who received 20 years for 'organising and leading a counter-revolutionary group' and 'counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement.' Hu had been held without trial since his arrest on May 27, 1992. This far exceeds the limit of pre-trial detention under Chinese law. Others to receive severe penalties included Kang Yuchun, a 30-year-old doctor who was sentenced to 17 years, and a worker, Liu Jingsheng, 40, who was jailed for 15 years. China seems certain to encounter international censure over the severe sentences, but may well have concluded it has little to lose at this stage. Mr Munro of Human Rights Watch noted that the trials were repeatedly delayed, apparently because of concern about political fall-out. Trials were postponed, he said, while China sought the 2000 Olympics and renewal of its most favoured nation trading status in the US. Mr Munro said the sentences 'gave the lie' to claims by western governments and business that economic reform would lead to improved human rights. 'Beijing feels it is completely in the clear now and can act with impunity against the dissident community,' he declared.</p>

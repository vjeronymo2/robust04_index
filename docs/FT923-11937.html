			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / International Company News: Weyerhaeuser earnings soar by 44% WEYERHAEUSER, the US forest products group, yesterday reported a 44 per cent increase in second-quarter earnings, helped by high timber prices and improved productivity. The company reported net earnings of Dollars 92.9m, or 45 cents a share, up from Dollars 64.5m, or 32 cents, in the same period of last year. Sales were up 2 per cent at Dollars 2.3bn. Mr John Creighton, president, said the figures reflected 'a slowly improving economy and solid accomplishments within our business improvement plans'. The company's forest products division was helped by the controversy over saving the Northern Spotted Owl, which has curtailed the supply of timber from public lands in the western US and sent the price of supplies rocketing. Operating earnings here were up 13 per cent at Dollars 126.5m. The company's pulp and paper business saw profits rise 84 per cent to Dollars 68.3m, helped by better pricing of some products, reduced maintenance spending as well as improved productivity in pulp and corrugated box manufacturing. In the first half the company made Dollars 179.5m, or 88 cents a share, compared with Dollars 51.4m, or 26 cents, a share after a 1991 accounting change which cut 30 cents a share from the total. Sales were up 4 per cent at Dollars 4.5bn. For the second half, Mr Creighton said lower long-term interest rates should produce some improvement in single family home construction, while no resolution of Northwestern timber shortages should also help keep wood product values strong. Weyerhaeuser, the largest exporter of US forest products, would also benefit from the weak dollar.</p>

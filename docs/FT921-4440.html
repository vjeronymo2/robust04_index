			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / BBA blames 33% fall on lower sales volumes BBA, the component maker for the automotive, aviation and industrial markets, yesterday blamed the worst post-war recession for a 33 per cent fall in 1991 profits. All products suffered in all the group's geographical trading divisions as sales volumes and operating margins were hit. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 75.1m to Pounds 49.4m after exceptional restructuring costs of Pounds 8.1m. Earnings per share fell from 15.74p, fully diluted, to 7.22p but the group maintained its final dividend of 5.25p although the total dividend for the year, unchanged at 7.5p, was uncovered by earnings. In the most important automotive parts division, sales fell by 4 per cent but profits were 45 per cent down as the group was unable to pass cost increases through to sales prices. Mr John White, managing director, said the most damaging factor was the fall in volume. However, he said that the market was not getting any worse this year and German sales, which had risen last year, were holding up. A fall in operating profits in the aviation division was cushioned by an acquisition but the industrial division saw profits fall 22 per cent. 'In 1991 we took on the chin a lot that should not be repeated in 1992,' said Mr Vanni Treves, chairman. The fall in sales in automotive and then industrial products led to a number of one-off costs which hit profits above the line. Manufacturing inventories were reduced and the group shed 1,900 jobs which helped lift exceptional costs to Pounds 8.1m. In addition to the exceptional costs, BBA took a Pounds 17.7m extraordinary charge, Pounds 10m of which was related to the cost of closing businesses. The balance related to an adjustment to the fair value on prior years' acquisitions. The company said that if the draft accounting standard on the treatment of extraordinary and exceptional items been in place the company would have had to take some of these goodwill write-offs above the line. Gearing fell from 61 per cent to 42 per cent following last May's Pounds 79m rights issue and the interest charge fell as a result by Pounds 2m to Pounds 19.8m. Mr White said there was no 'present indication' that things were getting worse for the group. 'We have all owned up that this recession has been longer and deeper than we had anticipated,' he said.

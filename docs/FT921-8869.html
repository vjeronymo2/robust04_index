			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Chrysalis chief calls off talks MR CHRIS Wright, chairman of Chrysalis Group, the records, communications and media company, has ended talks on his plan to buy the 47 per cent of the equity which he does not already own and take the group private. He said he was disappointed that one sizeable shareholder had refused to accept his offer of 95p a share, since it had won the support of the remaining shareholders, his bankers and financial advisers. Chrysalis shares were unchanged at 72p. Mr Wright, who founded Chrysalis, announced his intention to take the group private in November, after he sold the group's 50 per cent stake in the Chrysalis Records joint venture to its partner, Thorn EMI, the music and rentals group, for Dollars 30m (Pounds 16.9m). Chrysalis incurred a loss of Pounds 7.85m in the year to August, but Pounds 5m of that was attributable to the record division. The group has net cash of Pounds 16m and Mr Wright intends to develop a records business again some time after December of this year, when he will no longer be tied by Thorn. Chrysalis has been investing recently in televising horse racing for betting shops and its juke box and fruit machines division, which has been hit by recession.</p>

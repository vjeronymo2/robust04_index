			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAD THINGS BREWING AT RAIDER GAMES  </P> <P> There is a popular bumper sticker that reads: "Instant Jerk, Just Add Alcohol."  </P> <P> I feel this bumper sticker explains the problems rowdy Raider fans are causing.  </P> <P> Alcohol has a tendency to make people uninhibited. When you put this  uninhibitedness together with the change that occurs in a large crowd, you are  going to have problems.  </P> <P> Solution? First, try ending alcohol sales at the end of the first half. If that  doesn't work, cut off all sales of alcohol at the Coliseum completely. There  also has to be more of an effort to stop the tailgate parties that dominate the  area around the Coliseum before Raider games.  </P> <P> Perhaps sober fans would be better-behaved fans.  </P> <P> GARY R.

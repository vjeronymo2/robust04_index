If the islands are transferred to Japan, "there will be no  need for us to keep the Pacific Fleet, because it will have no  access to the ocean," Ustinov believes. In his opinion, Russia  has virtually lost the Baltic and the Black Sea Fleets. The  possibilities of the Northern Fleet have been considerably  reduced.    Ustinov suggested that the withdrawal of an aviation  regiment  from the South Kurils shows that "some politicians continue to  pursue the aim of playing "the Kuril card" and selling the  islands to Japan."    The press conference heard the concepts of the State Duma  committees on geopolitics and security regarding state borders.  Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Security Viktor Ilyukhin  believes that normal border demarcation would take 5-7 years and  cost two to three Russian annual budgets. In this connection,  he believes that the CIS countries should have a single external  border and single border troops. And technically they should  reinforce only the border with the Baltic states. Ilyukhin is  convinced that the internal borders between CIS countries should  only be concerned with hygiene control.</p>

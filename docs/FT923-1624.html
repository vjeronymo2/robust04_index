			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Maastricht - After the French Vote: Floating pound not an option, says Pohl A FREELY floating exchange rate is not a realistic option for any European country, according to Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the former Bundesbank president. In a pointed reference to Britain's withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism, he said decoupling an exchange rate from the D-Mark would not allow greater freedom in the conduct of fiscal and monetary policy. The US was big enough to float its currency but any European country trying to float would fall into a 'vicious circle' of depreciation, inflation and more depreciation. After 'the failure of British exchange rate policy last week', the only way forward lay in re-establishing 'near fixed rates' and moving toward a common European monetary policy. He remained optimistic that Europe would move towards a common currency and central bank. However, only a 'multi-speed' approach to economic and monetary union now looked feasible. Mr Pohl, who was delivering the annual Per Jacobsson lecture at the IMF/World Bank meeting in Washington, said the Bundesbank should not bear all the blame for last week's debacle. It was 'generally acknowledged that the UK joined the ERM at too high an exchange rate. DM2.95 was wishful thinking.' He also criticised the timing of British entry into the ERM, arguing that it was predictable that German unification would impose strains on the system. Last week's events reminded him of the breakdown of the Bretton Woods exchange system in the early 1970s. The latest crisis 'was not very well managed'. As in the 1970s there was 'no co-ordination and no leadership'. He was convinced the crisis could have been avoided had European finance ministers agreed a 'credible' package ahead of the Maastricht vote. This should have included a realignment involving more currencies than the lira and a more substantial cut in German interest rates. Mr Pohl said problems had been caused by failing to exploit the flexibility built into the European Monetary System. In the absence of a monetary union, exchange rate adjustments were sometimes desirable and necessary.</p>

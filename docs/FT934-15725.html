			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Travel: Darker side of a dream trip - William Pitt found the back roads of Bali more terrifying than tranquil BALI IS a word that conjures up dreams. So says an old holiday brochure we have lying around the house. Having returned from Bali, I can vouch for its accuracy. Unfortunately, not all my dreams are pleasant. To be sure, some are populated by tranquil Balinese, placing rice offerings for the gods at every door. Men and women are clad alike in bright sarongs and wear flowers in their hair. But there was nothing tranquil about the women from the village of Penelokan who rushed to surround our vehicle and thrust gaudy batik textiles up against the windows. Something close to desperation shone in their eyes. My worst dream features three young men, their leader stripped to the waist and carrying a long stick, on a lonely road in the crater of a volcano. It happened long after dark as we were leaving Toyah Bunkah, a spa village on the shores of Lake Batur, in north-east Bali. On the map the village had appeared the ideal place from which to climb Gunung Batur, the second most revered volcano on the island after mighty Gunung Agung to the south. But the visit had not been a success: Toyah Bunkah (which means holy water) had proved as mean as its setting was magnificent. The batik sellers in Penelokan, up the hill from Toyah Bunkah, had given us a foretaste of the region. We had come from Ubud, a village whose wood-carving emporia and bungalow inns seemed to have crowded out the houses. But at least the people were relaxed. By contrast, the women of Penelokan made the gypsies who flock to wash car windscreens on the outskirts of Spanish cities seem shy and retiring. I later read that some garage attendants in Penelokan pull pieces off visitors' cars and then offer to repair them. The fervour of Penelokan's batik sellers surprised but did not worry us. We were not planning to stay there, despite the splendour of the village's setting on the rim of the huge crater. Our goal was Toyah Bunkah, down a steep and narrow road across an ancient lava flow. At the entrance to the village a uniformed guard demanded 500 rupiah (about 15p) per head 'for the hot springs.' We never saw the springs: litter blew down the streets and along the shore of the lake, sapping our enthusiasm for an outdoor bath. Over the next three hours our disenchantment with Toyah Bunkah grew. The people were alternately surly and aggressive. The pie dogs were just aggressive. Loud rock music blasted from the Under the Volcano Homestay. The food in the only frequented warong (restaurant) was appalling. We returned hungry to our hotel - our guidebook called it the best on offer - to find huge cockroaches clambering over our luggage. We had planned to climb Gunung Batur at dawn. But having shaken the roaches from our possessions we decided to cut our losses and leave town. It was about 10pm. I went in search of the hotel staff, a task made difficult by a sudden power-cut. There was no one to be found. On the road out of Toyah Bunkah, just before it begins to wind, a red mini-van overtook our vehicle. Three men jumped out, their leader brandishing his stick. It seemed unlikely that they wanted to sell us batik. They may have come from the hotel, where we had left a note on the bed saying: 'Too many cockroaches.' Or maybe they were robbers. Either way, I decided not to argue with them. They had omitted to block the narrow road with their mini-van. I drove up to the man with the stick, made as if to lower the window, slammed on the accelerator and drove on up the hill. A crash on the roof registered his annoyance. They pursued us closely for perhaps 10 minutes, during which time our vehicle never got beyond second gear. The bends were very sharp, but the Toyota took them like a seasoned skier tackling a mogul run. My main fear was that a stray dog or pot-bellied pig might wander out in front of us. At the top of the hill our vehicle's speed began to tell against the mini-van's. We high-tailed it back to Ubud where, amid the bungalow inns and sleeping gift shops, we felt secure. Later we learned that the region around Gunung Batur has a poor reputation. For some reason the people did not seem to have come to terms with tourism as comfortably as most Balinese. Or maybe the region had always been lawless. Anthropologists attribute much of the cohesion of Balinese society to the cultivation of rice in terraced paddies, which requires close co-operation among villagers. But around Lake Batur there are no rice paddies. Such explanations are rarely more than guesses. I do not know what made the people of Toyah Bunkah different from the people of Ubud. But I left Bali thinking that perhaps, for once, the beaten track offered the best views.</p>

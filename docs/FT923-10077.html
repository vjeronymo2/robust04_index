			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Barker buy-outs defended THE RECEIVERS to Charles Barker, the world's oldest public relations firm, yesterday defended criticism from creditors at the speed at which two management buy-outs were announced, only hours after the collapse on Thursday of Corporate Communications, Charles Barker's parent company. Mr Ian Bond, a partner with the accountancy firm Cork Gully, which was appointed as receiver, said yesterday that great speed was essential in the sale of a 'people business' to ensure that clients and employees did not quit. Charles Barker said that the board of Corporate Communications passed a resolution on Thursday July 23 to call in the receivers, when it became apparent that the group was about to breach its banking covenants. The two buy-outs - to be named Georgeson International, the financial and investor relations side, and Charles Barker, the corporate, marketing and public affairs operation - took place on the same day that the group passed into the hands of receivers with debts of Pounds 10m. The receivership happened just one day before many creditors were due to be paid. Month-end invoices from Newspaper advertising departments were due to be sent out yesterday. The Financial Times is likely to lose at least Pounds 250,000; The Daily Telegraph is believed to be a creditor to the tune of about Pounds 70,000. Two of Charles Barker's larger clients - Eurotunnel and IBM - said yesterday that, as yet, they planned to continue using its services. Corporate Communications' problems followed an acquisition and expansion spree since 1989, the year it was formed. In April 1989 it paid Dollars 13m for Georgeson, a New York-based investor relations firm, a deal widely reckoned to have been sensible. In October 1989 it bought Charles Barker for Pounds 9m, which a former director of Corporate Communications yesterday suggested was some Pounds 2.5m more than its then market value. In the last two years Corporate Communications has spent an estimated Pounds 13m on internal reorganisations, premises and new technology.</p>

			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: WILSHIRE CENTER  </P> <P> Painter Robin Ryan shows large acrylic-on-aper portraits that look like life  embellished by imagination. Huge, sketchy faces and seated nudes such as "He  Sits, He Waits" take up most of the picture space and look like shadows  embedded behind a colorful gridding. Ryan uses half-inch tape to create a neat  field of vertical and horizontal cross hatching, then peels away tape and fills  in the resulting little squares with variegated color that makes the huge  countenance in "Cold Streak" look as if it coalesces from many small pockets of  pigment. She also shows computer-generated faces or digital paintings limned  directly on the computer screen, then transferred to an enlarged, paper-printed  format. What draws our attention here is the uniqueness of Ryan's techniques;  the amateurish imagery itself -- except for the electric eroticism of "The  Lovers" -- fails to hold our attention. (Ivey/Kaufman Gallery, 154 N. La Brea  Ave., to July 22.) MARLENA DONOHUE  </P></p>

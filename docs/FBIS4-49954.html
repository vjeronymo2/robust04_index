			<p>BFN     [Text] According to the Guangdong Customhouse, our  province was bullish about its import and export trade in the  first quarter of this year. The total value of our province's  import and export trade in this quarter amounted to about $16.2  billion. Both imports and exports increased by more than 20  percent over the same period last year, with a favorable import  balance of $150 million, thus putting an end to last year's  export deficit situation. In export-volume terms, Shenzhen  ranked first among other cities in the province, with an export  volume of $3.1 billion; Guangzhou ranked second, with an export  volume of close to $1.1 billion, and Dongguan City ranked third,  with an export volume of $1 billion. Shenzhen, Dongguan, and  Guangzhou were the three top importing cities in our province.    In Guangdong's foreign trade, exports exceeded imports in  the  first quarter of this year, indicating that after the state  unified exchange rates this year, import demand, which has  remained high for many years, had been initially alleviated.  Meanwhile, as state export encouragement measures, such as duty  refunds, were further implemented, general export trade began to  bottom out and gained upward momentum.</p>

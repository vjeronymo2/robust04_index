			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ABC WILL AIR USC-UCLA AT ROSE BOWL  </P> <P> Although lacking its usual Rose Bowl ramifications, ABC announced today that it  will televise Saturday's USC-UCLA game.  </P> <P> Keith Jackson and Bob Griese will call the 12:30 p.m. game from the Rose Bowl  that will air live on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42 in Southern California.  </P> <P> The game will be shown nationwide, except in most of the Midwest.  </P> <P> Last week, ABC said it would televise either the USC-UCLA or  Washington-Washington State games. However, the latter game lost much of its  luster Saturday when the then-second-ranked Huskies were upset by UCLA, 25-22,  and Notre Dame kept its spot atop the Associated Press poll with a 34-29 win  over Tennessee.  </P> <P> Had ABC opted against showing USC-UCLA, the game could have aired on cable's  Prime Ticket Network, which owns the cable rights to Pacific 10 Conference  games.  </P></p>

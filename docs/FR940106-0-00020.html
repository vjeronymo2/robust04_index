			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One respondent urged that state and local governments and U.S. universities and non-profit research institutes working independently should be eligible to receive individual ATP awards outside of joint ventures. No change has been made to the regulation based upon this comment because eligibility for individual awards is expressly limited to United States companies by section 278n(b)(2) of title 15 of the United States Code. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Effective Date of the Final Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule relating to grants, benefits, and contracts is exempt from the delayed effective date requirement, and accordingly, under section 553(a)(2) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), is therefore being made effective immediately without a 30 day delay in effective date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Classification <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This document was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866. The General Counsel certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration, at the time this rule was proposed that, if it were adopted as proposed it would not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities requiring a flexibility analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This is because there are only a small number of awardees and thus only a small number of awards will be given to small businesses. The program is entirely voluntary for the participants that seek funding. It is not a major federal action requiring an environmental assessment under the National Environment Policy Act. This rule contains collection of information requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act approved by OMB under control number 0693&hyph;0009. The Advanced Technology Program does not involve the mandatory payment of any matching funds from a state or local government, and does not affect directly any state or local government. Accordingly, the Technology Administration has determined that Executive Order 12372 is not applicable to this program. This notice does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 15 CFR Part 295 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Inventions and patents, Laboratories, Research, Science and technology, Scientists. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: December 27, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Arati Prabhakar, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Director. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

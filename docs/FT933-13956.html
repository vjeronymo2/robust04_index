			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Currencies Since the franc got little practical help from yesterday's Bundesbank meeting, speculators must be wondering whether they can force France out of the ERM before the next council meeting. Things look finely balanced, with the all-too evident souring of the French economy in marked contrast to optimism about German prospects. Against that background, the interest rate rises apparently required to support the franc simply do not look credible. Yet all is not lost. The technical shortage of Euro francs limits the speculators' ammunition, and enthusiasm over Germany looks premature. There is also a shift in the markets' focus from short term interest rates as the only prop for currencies and towards a view of good economic prospects as a support. Doubtless the French wish to tread carefully, but they may yet have to consider desperate remedies. A substantial cut in interest rates would certainly call the speculators' bluff. And given the determination of both French and German governments to hold the line, the franc might even stand an outside chance of remaining within the system.</p>

			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IRVINE CITY MANAGER IS REMOVED IN 'TRANSITION'  </P> <P> The mayor doesn't call it a firing.  </P> <P> The city manager won't call it a resignation.  </P> <P> Instead, in classic Irvine jargon, it is a "transition."  </P> <P> But whatever you call it, Irvine's first and only city manager, William  Woollett Jr., will no longer hold that job come Aug. 1.  </P> <P> Despite the pleas of about a dozen residents, the council in a closed session  early Wednesday morning removed Woollett, 60, from the city's top  administrative post, effective Aug. 1, amid criticism that the new council  majority was playing power politics.  </P> <P> Under the "transition plan" that Woollett submitted under pressure, he will  continue on from Aug. 1 to Nov. 1 as "city manager emeritus" to work on special  projects, and the council may vote to retain him beyond that date. The plan was  approved by the council in a 5-0 vote, Mayor Larry Agran said.  </P> <P> "It is not a firing," Agran said. "We could have taken action unilaterally" and  dismissed Woollett immediately, he said. "When you're fired, you don't submit  the terms of your firing." He described the closed session, which lasted until  about 1 a.m. Wednesday, as "friendly and respectful."  </P> <P> But Woollett, who has been city manager since the city incorporated 17 years  ago, said before the closed session that his hand was forced.  </P> <P> The transition plan "is predicated on the fact that the council wants another  city manager. That's very important. They are terminating me. I am not  resigning," Woollett said Tuesday. (He was not available for comment  Wednesday.) "If the City Council said, 'What do you want to do,' I'd like to  stay for the foreseeable future."  </P> <P> In a city known for its pretty street names and bureaucratic euphemisms (the  police chief's title is also "director of public safety"), the term "transition  plan" did not mask the heated feelings at the council meeting Tuesday night.  </P> <P> Calling Woollett's removal a transition "is like asking (executed murderer) Ted  Bundy to participate in an after-life experience," one resident told the  council.  </P> <P> Others charged that Agran and the new council majority are playing power  politics. Woollett helped form the city and is responsible for its growth and  success, they contended.  </P> <P> "You, the new political power gang, are saying, 'It will be our way,' " said  resident Ray Quigley, who was a member of Irvine's first City Council. "What a  chilling message . . . what political arrogance."  </P> <P> Another resident called the mayor a "socialistic dictator."  </P> <P> In a memo 2 weeks ago, Agran asked Woollett to write two "transition plans,"  one that would have him stay on in an "emeritus" position and the other that  would not. Woollett's contract is due to expire July 1, but the city manager  asked for an extra month, Agran said. Agran said in the memo that it was the  "sense of the council" that it was time for a change.  </P> <P> But Councilwoman Sally Anne Sheridan, who is not an Agran ally, pointed out  Tuesday night that the council had never before discussed Woollett's removal,  "formally or informally."  </P> <P> Agran said the City Council began talking about a transition plan 5 years ago,  when Woollett was ill and there was concern that he would not be able to return  to his job. Also, the council wanted to be prepared as Woollett approached  retirement age, Agran said. "This is just a continuation of the process."  </P> <P> But Agran's differences with Woollett appear to be pressing the issue now.  </P> <P> Two years ago, after city elections produced a council majority sympathetic to  Agran's slow-growth leanings, the council sat down with Woollett and "indicated  we wanted to prepare for new city management." Woollett at that time asked for  2 more years, Agran said.  </P> <P> The new council members have brought "a new progressive agenda for the city" on  such issues as open space, traffic concerns and recycling, the mayor said,  adding: "The city is clearly ending one phase of development and beginning a  new phase." City management should reflect that, he said.  </P> <P> "This is a city in transition," Agran said. Irvine has grown from a small  community to a city of more than 100,000 and one of the 200 largest  municipalities in the country, he said. "We are a complicated organism  involving commercial and industrial and an agricultural economy. It's very  clear that we're going to need new approaches to complicated problems, such as  transportation and air quality. That's the evolutionary stage in which the city  finds itself," Agran declared.  </P> <P> Agran added that the council did not discuss specific reasons with Woollett in  the closed session.  </P> <P> The council postponed until its next meeting further discussion on whether to  promote Paul Brady, assistant city manager, to the post or whether to recruit a  new city manager from elsewhere.  </P></p>

The presidential press official [state adviser] Gabil  Guseyinly denied reports to the effect that the Russians will  set up 35 control points as Armenians withdraw from lands they  occupied in Azerbaijan "outside Karabakh."    Guseyinly said: "No agreement to this effect has been  signed. Besides, President Aliyev is completely opposed to it.  Aliyev insists that if the presence of military observers in  the conflict zone is needed, then international observers,  including Turkish troops, should be dispatched under CSCE  direction."    Recalling that the Armenians should have started withdrawing  from the occupied lands in keeping with the cease-fire that went  into effect on 1 March, Guseyinly indicated that so far no  withdrawal has taken place in the region.    In the meantime Jan Eliasson, chairman of CSCE Minsk Group,  who is now in Azerbaijan, left for Nagorno-Karabakh's capital  Khankendi [Stepanakert] for talks with Armenian officials. He  will go later to Yerevan for talks with Armenian government  officials.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) The laboratory shall provide facilities for the effective monitoring, control and recording of environmental conditions as appropriate. Due attention shall be paid, for example, to biological sterility, dust, electromagnetic interference, humidity, voltage, temperature, and sound and vibration levels, as appropriate to the calibrations or tests concerned. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) There shall be effective separation between neighboring areas when the activities therein are incompatible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Access to and use of all areas affecting the quality of these activities shall be defined and controlled. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Adequate measures shall be taken to ensure good housekeeping in the laboratory. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Equipment and reference materials. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) The laboratory shall be furnished with all items of equipment (including reference materials) required for the correct performance of calibrations and tests. In those cases where the laboratory needs to use equipment outside its permanent control it shall ensure that the relevant requirements of this section are met. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) All equipment shall be properly maintained. Maintenance procedures shall be documented. Any item of equipment which has been subjected to overloading or mishandling, or which gives suspect results, or has been shown by verification or otherwise to be defective, shall be taken out of service, clearly identified and wherever possible stored at a specified place until it has been repaired and shown by calibration, verification or test to perform satisfactorily. The laboratory shall examine the effect of this defect on previous calibrations or tests. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Each item of equipment including reference materials shall, when appropriate, be labelled, marked or otherwise identified to indicate its calibration status. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Records shall be maintained of each item of equipment and all reference materials significant to the calibrations or tests performed. The records shall include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The name of the item of equipment; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The manufacturer's name, type identification, and serial number or other unique identification; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Date received and date placed in service; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Current location, where appropriate; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Condition when received (e.g. new, used, reconditioned); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) Copy of the manufacturer's instructions, where available; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vii) Dates and results of calibrations and/or verifications and date of next calibration and/or verification; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (viii) Details of maintenance carried out to date and planned for the future; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ix) History of any damage, malfunction, modification or repair. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Measurement traceability and calibration.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) All measuring and testing equipment having an effect on the accuracy or validity of calibrations or tests shall be calibrated and/or verified before being put into service. The laboratory shall have an established program for the calibration and verification of its measuring and test equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The overall program of calibration and/or verification and validation of equipment shall be designed and operated so as to ensure that, wherever applicable, measurements made by the laboratory are traceable to national standards of measurement where available. Calibration certificates shall wherever applicable indicate the traceability to national standards of measurement and shall provide the measurement results and associated uncertainty of measurement and/or a statement of compliance with an identified metrological specification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Where traceability to national standards of measurement is not applicable, the laboratory shall provide satisfactory evidence of correlation of results, for example by participation in a suitable program of interlaboratory comparisons or proficiency testing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Reference standards of measurement held by the laboratory shall be used for calibration only and for no other purpose, unless it can be demonstrated that their performance as reference standards has not been invalidated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Reference standards of measurement shall be calibrated by a body that can provide traceability to a national standard of measurement. There shall be a program of calibration and verification for reference standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Where relevant, reference standards and measuring and testing equipment shall be subjected to in-service checks between calibrations and verifications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Reference materials shall, where possible, be traceable to national or international standards of measurement, or to national or international standard reference materials. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Calibration and test methods.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The laboratory shall have documented instructions on the use and operation of all relevant equipment, on the handling and preparation of items and for calibration and/or testing, where the absence of such instructions could jeopardize the calibrations or tests. All instructions, standards, manuals and reference data relevant to the work of the laboratory shall be maintained up-to-date and be readily available to the staff. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The laboratory shall use appropriate methods and procedures for all calibrations and tests and related activities within its responsibility (including sampling, handling, transport and storage, preparation of items, estimation of uncertainty of measurement and analysis of calibration and/or test data). They shall be consistent with the accuracy required, and with any standard specifications relevant to the calibrations or tests concerned. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Where methods are not specified, the laboratory shall, wherever possible, select methods that have been published in international or national standards, those published by reputable technical organizations or in relevant scientific texts or journals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

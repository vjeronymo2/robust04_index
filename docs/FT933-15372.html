			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Clarke highlights G7's failure to create jobs MR Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, yesterday warned that the Group of Seven industrialised economies could face rising unemployment even if they achieved 3 per cent a year growth. He said the summit had 'picked up a theme' in the need to tackle structural unemployment. In draft copies of the economic communique that will be released after the summit today, the G7 countries stress that they are concerned about low growth and failure to create jobs and say it is unacceptable that 23m are unemployed in the G7 countries. Reducing unemployment requires prudent macroeconomic policies to promote non-inflationary growth and structural reforms to improve the efficiency of markets, especially labour markets, it says. Mr Clarke said Britain was 'ahead of the game' compared with some G7 partners in deregulating and tackling the problems of its economy. He welcomed US President Bill Clinton's proposal for a further meeting of G7 finance, economic and labour ministers this autumn. The meeting would consider whether labour markets were sufficiently flexible, if benefit and training systems gave the unemployed incentives to take jobs, and would study the phenomenon of unemployment rising in good as well as bad periods in the economic cycle. The draft communique commits Europe to implementing tough budgetary policies with the aim of lowering interest rates. Mr Clarke said Britain was committed to tackling its public sector deficit. That was why it had signed up to the Maastricht treaty convergence criteria which envisage reducing the deficit to 3 per cent of gross domestic product by late in this decade from around 8 per cent now. The chancellor made clear that the government was preparing difficult spending decisions in the forthcoming public spending round. Although he insisted that the government was not planning to abolish the welfare state, every developed country had to ensure that its welfare system operated in a cost effective way. Mr Clarke was careful to draw a distinction between the US and Europe, with their high unemployment and fiscal deficits, and Japan, with its low jobless rate and fiscal surplus. However, he urged Japan to increase its domestic demand to improve the living standards of its people and increase imports. In spite of Japan's greater national wealth, 'the living standards of the average Japanese are not the living standards of the average Brit,' he said. But he was also willing to learn from Japan. Its education and training system seemed not to produce the underclass of underachievers as found in Britain. Mr Clarke disclosed that Britain had pushed its G7 partners to be more generous in writing off the debt of the poorest developing nations that are enacting economic reforms. However, a UK attempt to obtain agreement for countries to write off 80 per cent of poorest nations' stock of debt foundered largely on opposition from Japan. According to the economic declaration that will be issued today Japan has promised 'as necessary' to implement fiscal and monetary measures to ensure strong domestic demand-led growth. This, it says, will contribute to a reduction of external imbalances, but the text adds that Japan must keep in mind the need for medium-term fiscal prudence. In North America, the G7 have agreed to continue policies to ensure a 'substantial and steady reduction in fiscal deficits over the medium term, higher levels of domestic savings and investment and lower long-term rates.' The G7 leaders will insist that a successful and rapid conclusion of the Uruguay Round of trade talks will boost the confidence of investors and consumers and be an important contribution to recovery and growth. They will express confidence that these policies will put their economies back on track for sustainable non-inflationary growth.</p>

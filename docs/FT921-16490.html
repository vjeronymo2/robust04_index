			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Letter: No position for an unqualified assertion on pensions rights Sir, I have not suggested, as Bryn Davies (Letters, December 30) implies, that in the Barber case the European Court of Justice changed the law as opposed to interpreting Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome. The court did, however, conclude that with limited exceptions 'the direct effect of Article 119 of the Treaty may not be relied upon in order to claim entitlement to a pension with effect from a date prior to that of this judgment' (May 17 1990). Although - indeed because - these words are open to further interpretation by the European Court, I certainly maintain my view that Mr Davies is not in a position to make the unqualified assertion that the Maastricht protocol takes away the right of employees to equal pensions from the time when the UK acceded to the treaty (January 1 1973). Michael Elton, director general, National Association of Pension Funds, 12-18 Grosvenor Gardens, London SW1W 0DH</p>

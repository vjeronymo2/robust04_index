			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Madras--The Centre's tactics in announcing a  pre-budget increase in the price of levy sugar distributed  through the Public Distribution System (PDS), from Rs.  8.30[rupees] to Rs. 9.05 per kg, have been condemned by the  political parties in Tamil Nadu.    Describing the hike as "anti-people and anti-democratic,"  CPM  [Communist Party of India-Marxist] state secretary A.  Nallasivan, MP, said on Friday that by increasing the prices of  essential commodities before the budget presentation, the Centre  was trying to create the illusion that there were no new taxes  in the budget. At the same time, the hike in the average  ex-factory levy sugar price from Rs. 670.99 to Rs. 734.08 a  quintal, had helped the sugar mill owners to attain huge profits.    The proposed price hike would severely affect the people, he  said, and asked the Centre to drop the move.    CPI [Communist Party of India] state secretary R. Nallakannu  said the price increase was "unnecessary and not proper."    State Janata Dal general secretary K. Jagaveerapandian said  the government had once again adopted the strategy of hiking the  prices of essential commodities before the budget. Moreover, in  the last one year, the Centre had thrice decreased the quantity  of sugar allocated for distribution through the PDS and thereby  caused an artificial demand for sugar in the open market.  Besides this, the Centre's decision had helped businessmen to  sell sugar at exorbitant prices. "This is a cheap way of duping  the public," he added.    UCPI [United Communist Party of India] state president N.  Nanjappan and secretary K. Manickkam, in a joint statement, said  the decision to increase the sugar price from Feb. 1 would  greatly affect the common man. Moreover, it would pave the way  for increase of sugar prices in the open market. "There is a  wide gap between the Centre's assurances and the reality."    Referring to the increase in the prices of domestic LPG  [liquidied petroleum gas] cylinders and rice, the leaders urged  the Centre to take immediate steps to reduce the prices of  essential commodities.    T. Kumaresan, president, All India Farmers Democratic Party,  said the hike was "unjustified," and would hit the weaker  sections hard.</p>

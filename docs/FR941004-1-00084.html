			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1357.15(e)&blank;State Agency Administering the Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are proposing in &sect;1357.15(e) that the CFSP identify the name of the State agency that will administer the title IV&hyph;B programs under the plan. Except as provided by statute, the same agency must administer or supervise the administration of the programs under titles IV&hyph;B, IV&hyph;E, and XX of the Act. (See definition of State agency in 45 CFR 1355.20.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are further proposing in paragraph (e) that the CFSP include a description of the organization and function of the State agency and organizational charts as appropriate. It also must identify the organizational unit(s) within the State agency responsible for the operation and administration of the CFSP, and include a description of the unit's organization and function and a copy of the organizational chart(s). This information is currently required by 45 CFR 205.101 (see also 45 CFR 1355.30). We are proposing to include the required information here and delete the cross-reference in 45 CFR 1355.30.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1357.15(f)&blank;Indian Tribal Organization Administering the Program(s)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are proposing in &sect;1357.15 (f) that the Indian tribe's CFSP must provide the name of the Indian tribal organization (ITO) designated to administer funds under title IV&hyph;B, subpart 1, child welfare services and/or under title IV&hyph;B, subpart 2, family preservation and family support services. If the Indian tribe receives funds under both subparts, the same agency or organization must administer both programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1357.15(f) also proposes that the CFSP of the Indian tribe must include a description of the organization and function of the office responsible for the operation and administration of the CFSP, an organizational chart of that office, and a description of how that office relates to tribal and other offices operating or administering services programs within the Indian tribe's service area, e.g., Indian Health Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1357.15(g)&blank;Vision Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The new focus on family-based services and community linkages requires changes in vision, philosophy, and in the design and delivery of child and family services. In order for States and Indian tribes to develop a realistic yet forward looking CFSP, we believe that they must first set forth their vision in providing services to children and their families.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Program Instructions encouraged States and Indian tribes to use up to $1 million of the 100 percent Federal FY 1994 funds and the planning period to help articulate that vision. Paragraph (g) proposes that the CFSP must include the vision statement as developed by the State and the Indian tribe.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1357.15(h)&blank;Goals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 432(a)(2) of the Act requires that the CFSP describe the goals to be accomplished in the five-year plan and describe the methods to be used to measure progress toward the goals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are proposing in paragraph (h) that States and Indian tribes build on their vision statement and philosophy and develop goals for the next five years. Goals must be stated in the CFSP and must be expressed in terms of the improved outcome expected for children, youth and families, and for their safety and well-being. Goals also must be stated in terms of the development of a more comprehensive, coordinated, and effective child and family service delivery system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States and Indian tribes should utilize data on the well being of children and families, needs, resources, and other information obtained during the planning process in the development of goals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

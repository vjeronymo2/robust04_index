			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUAYLE OPPOSES 'DEBTOR CARTEL'  </P> <P> Vice President Dan Quayle, arriving Wednesday on his first visit to Latin  America, discussed anti-drug efforts with Colombia's president and declared  U.S. opposition to any Latin "debtor cartel."  </P> <P> The vice president arrived a day before inaugural ceremonies for Venezuela's  new president, Carlos Andres Perez. His met first with President Virgilio Barco  Vargas of Colombia.  </P> <P> Quayle mostly listened as Barco talked about Colombia's fight against drugs and  guerrillas "and how much help they need from the United States," said Quayle's  press secretary, David Beckwith. Quayle told Barco that U.S. resources to help  out are limited.  </P> <P> Entering the busy capital by motorcade, Quayle created a cacophony of  horn-honking when he stopped to buy bananas, guavas and mangoes at a small  market. "Stimulating the economy already," he joked to reporters.  </P> <P> Quayle said on arrival that his primary mission is to be "a cheerleader for  democracy." But the massive debt owed by Latin countries is expected to  dominate the discussion among two dozen heads of state attending the  inauguration.  </P> <P> Quayle indicated the United States is maintaining a hard line on so-called  debtor cartel movements to form a unified organization of Third World nations  that face huge national debts.  </P></p>

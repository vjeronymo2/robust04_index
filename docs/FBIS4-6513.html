			<p>BFN     [Text] U.S. Defense Secretary Perry, who is visiting our  country, held a new conference at Hotel Shilla this morning and  said that the U.S. commitment to security in the ROK remains  firm, and stressed that the war risk on the Korean peninsula is  not so high as the general public fears.    Here is reporter Pak Chan-uk on the telephone in front of  Hotel Shilla:    [Pak] U.S. Defense Secretary Perry said at a news conference  which just ended a while ago that although political tension is  rising on the Korean peninsula, there is no military tension.  Secretary Perry also stressed that the U.S. commitment to the  defense of the ROK remains firm and that the United States would  never make a mistake of provoking or igniting a war on the  Korean peninsula.    As announced by the ROK Defense Ministry on 20 April,  Secretary Perry said the ROK and the United States agreed to  conduct the Team Spirit exercise in November and continue to  make related plans and preparations for the exercise.    Regarding the North Korean nuclear issue, Secretary Perry  stressed that it is certain that North Korea is pursuing the  development of nuclear weapons but that the basic stance of the  ROK and the United States is that the issue should be resolved  through diplomatic and peaceful efforts.    Secretary Perry said an emergency communications network  between the defense ministers of the ROK and the United States  will be installed for close coordination on preparations against  any tension or military threat on the Korean peninsula.    Secretary Perry said he invited ROK Defense Minister Yi  Pyong-tae to visit the United States in the near future to  discuss ROK-U.S. cooperation once again.    After the news conference, Secretary Perry will visit ROK  and  U.S. Army units to check the military readiness posture. He is  scheduled to leave for Japan at 5 PM [8:00 GMT] today.</p>

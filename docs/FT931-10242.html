			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / UK Company News: MTM sells US plant for Dollars 9m MTM, the specialist chemicals company struggling with a bank refinancing and the arrival of a large new shareholder with mysterious intentions, has sold a business in the US. The group said it had received Dollars 9.05m (Pounds 6m) for the sale of its intermediate fine chemicals plant in Columbus, Ohio, to ISF Fine Chemicals, a subsidiary of GAF Corporation of New Jersey. MTM will receive Dollars 7.05m on completion and the balance will be held in escrow pending clarification of the value of working capital and potential warranty claims. MTM is trying to focus its attention on fewer businesses in order to reduce group debt, now standing at about Pounds 120m. Last week AB Hebi, a Swedish company, bought nearly 7 per cent of MTM from Mr Richard Lines, the chairman who built the company and eventually oversaw a precipitate decline in the share price.</p>

			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Blow for US expats AMERICAN expatriates in London will be examining their pay packets with concern this weekend after President Clinton's State of the Union message. Many can expect substantial increases in their taxes and health care contributions because of the new administration's proposal to gather extra income from the middle classes and the rich. Expatriates tend to be higher-paid staff. Most based in the UK are paid by their companies on the so-called 'tax equalisation' or 'tax-at-home' basis, with tax deducted as though they were still resident in the US. Any individual earning above Dollars 155,000, or a couple earning above Dollars 140,000, a year after deductions would see their income tax rise to 36 per cent. Those earning above Dollars 250,000 a year would also face a 10 per cent surtax. Equally important, all these groups could expect their FICA contributions - the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, covering medicare and social security payments - to jump following removal of the present Dollars 135,000 ceiling. Employers would also face an increase in FICA contributions on behalf of employees. Grady Townsend, of Price Waterhouse expatriate tax services in London, has calculated two scenarios. For a married expatriate with two children on a base salary of Dollars 75,000, with housing, cost of living, education and car allowances worth another Dollars 120,000, present tax is Dollars 16,494. That remains unchanged under the Clinton proposals, but their employer's tax bill on their behalf would rise by Dollars 5,640 to Dollars 12,403. For an expatriate on a base salary of Dollars 300,000, with allowances on the same items totalling Dollars 190,000, the tax charge rises from Dollars 89,136 to Dollars 100,794. Their employer's contribution would increase from Dollars 20,979 to Dollars 33,268. But Bruce Lassman, head of the US tax desk at accountants Ernst &amp; Young, points out that the expatriates would be paying at a lower rate than the 40 per cent upper tax band imposed on UK citizens.</p>

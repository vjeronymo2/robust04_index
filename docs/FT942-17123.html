			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Vodafone strength Cellular telephones group Vodafone outpaced the market's other leading telecoms stocks, delivering one of the best individual performances in the FT-SE 100 after announcing a record number of new subscribers. In March 58,500 new subscribers signed up with Vodafone, topping the previous monthly record achieved in December 1993, and giving Vodafone a customer base of 1.17m subscribers. The March sales helped offset the impact of press comment highlighting the threat to existing cellular companies by the imminent launch of Orange, Hutchison Telecom's new mobile telephone service. Vodafone raced up 20 to 536p after good turnover of 4.1m. BT firmed 1/2 to 393p after news that BT's Cellnet attracted 46,900 new customers last month, taking its subscriber base through the 1m mark. Cable and Wireless, whose One-2-One system is seen as most vulnerable to competition from Orange, lost 3 at 452p. News that Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel had settled its long dispute with construction consortium TML turned out to be a mixed blessing. Analysts appreciated the settlement but the stock declined 10 to 505p on fears that the company might make a bigger than anticipated rights issue. The market was also surprised to hear that Swiss Bank Corporation has emerged as one of the lead underwriters of the rights issue. Market watchers were focusing on reports that Eurotunnel's anticipated rights issue, originally intended to raise Pounds 500m before the end of June, may now be in the region of Pounds 750m. The company said it is to seek shareholder approval for the issue of 150m shares should the need arise. A sudden burst of strength in crude oil prices, amid stories that some of the big international hedge funds have been baling out of stocks and bonds and shifting cash into crude oil futures, helped oil shares rise. The biggest impact was on the exploration and production sector, usually more sensitive than integrated oil stocks to swings in oil prices. Enterprise Oil rallied 10 to 408p. The company's stake in the Scott Field has increased from 12.9 per cent to 13.5 per cent. The appointment of Mr Rudolph Agnew as chairman of Lasmo from May 24 was given a good reception. Lasmo, which fell to 118p shortly after the market opened, rallied to end 3 up at 124p. The financial areas of the market were the first to respond to the early afternoon strength in UK equities. Hopes, subsequently fulfilled, of a strong opening on Wall Street, and talk of heavy buying of banks and insurances by funds operating big personal equity plans, drove both sectors sharply higher. The big rise in the dollar boosted stocks with strong links to the Far East, such as HSBC, which moved up 16 to 755p, and Standard Chartered, 14 ahead at 1055p. Marketmakers were caught short of stock in Lloyds Bank, which rose 18 to 577p, Barclays, up 9 at 533p, and Abbey National, 7 1/2 firmer at 473p. Takeover speculation in the wake of last week's news that HSBC had acquired a 6 per cent stake continued to drive Hogg Group higher. The shares settled 17 up at 182p; turnover was 836,000 shares. General Accident was the pick of the composite insurances, the shares surging 24 to 644p after turnover of 1.3m on talk of strong support from Morgan Stanley, the influential US investment bank. United Biscuits, Britain's largest biscuits and snacks manufacturer, performed well on speculation that RJR Nabisco, of the US, is about to sell its tobacco interests and will then be looking to make food purchases. UB shares added 13 at 345p. The rumour was prompted by a weekend press article which said Nabisco was poised to offload its RJ Reynolds tobacco business to BAT Industries for some Pounds 6.5bn. BAT bounced 14 to 472p. Tightly held Associated British Foods jumped 18 to 577p on strong suggestions that the group was poised to sell its retail bakery business to Greggs. The deal would represent a small disposal for AB Foods but double Greggs' outlets. Greggs was steady at 743p. News that Kwik Save, the food discount company, was cutting the price of many of its top brands in its stores restrained the shares after an early bounce. The stock rose 10 in a weak morning market and remained unchanged at 618p as rival stocks rebounded. Engineering and aerospace group Smiths Industries fell 9 to 465 1/2 p, after it announced a Pounds 21.6m acquisition of a US manufacturer of electrical heating elements. The market appreciated an Pounds 18m acquisition by property and transport group P&amp;O. The shares put on 20 at 713p.</p>

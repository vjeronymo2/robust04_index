			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Share prices anticipate the chancellor THE UK chancellor of the exchequer yesterday delivered at least some of the good news which the London stock market had been anticipating. Late trading saw share prices consolidating the widespread gains achieved before Mr Norman Lamont began his speech to the House of Commons. The FT-SE Index had already boiled over after an earlier gain of 37 points, before the chancellor rose to his feet, but after hesitating briefly, responded optimistically to his disclosure that domestic interest rates were being cut by one percentage point to 7 per cent. Very modest profit-taking in the final minutes of the session brought a final reading on the FT-SE Index of 2,726.4 for a net gain of 29.6. The Footsie is now within 12 points of its previous closing high of 2,737.8, reached on May 11 when the UK stock market was still celebrating the re-election of Mr John Major's Conservative government. Some doubts were expressed regarding the likely effectiveness of the chancellor's package to stimulate the flagging domestic economy. 'We think it may not be enough to push the stock market significantly further,' said Mr Ian Harnett of Strauss Turnbull. Nor is the strategy team at BZW, the UK investment bank, expecting the stock market to move to significantly higher levels. BZW's Mr Richard Kersley commented that, with further base rate cuts likely to be less aggressive, financial stocks might now meet profit-taking; engineering shares, on the other hand, would benefit from the unexpected changes in capital allowances. However, the stock market was pleased with the cut in base rates, the abolition of motor car tax and changes in capital allowance arrangements, and the moves to stimulate the housing market. Investment strategists expressed satisfaction with estimates of next year's Public Sector Borrowing Requirement and believed that another one-point cut in base rates would be possible early next year. Mr Trevor Laugharne at Kleinwort Benson Securities said the chancellor had made 'more than the best' of the situation and that he now saw the Footsie challenging the 2,800 mark earlier than previously expected, perhaps within a couple of weeks. The stock market was in good form from the opening of the session, anticipating the chancellor's speech and also responding to good trading results from a handful of blue chip companies. Oil shares moved up strongly in heavy turnover following good trading figures from Shell Transport. Also firm on profits news were BT and Royal Insurance, with the latter helping the financial sector by favourable comment on the mortgage indemnity situation. Confirmation that the Jubilee Line extension to London's Tube rail network will go ahead, together with the release of some local authority housing cash, encouraged building and construction issues. Store and retail shares were more cautious, however, and with the base rate reduction largely anticipated recorded only modest gains. Disappointment with the trading statement from Boots, the high street retailer, turned the shares downwards, and Marks and Spencer and Kingfisher closed only a few pence up after early gains had attracted profit-taking.</p>

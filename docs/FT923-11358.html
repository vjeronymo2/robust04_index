			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / PM gives public support to Mellor THE PRIME minister yes-terday reaffirmed his support for his embattled national heritage secretary, Mr David Mellor, insisting that he would remain at his post. In his Huntingdon constituency, Mr Major said: 'We are absolutely committed to making sure we improve the profile and commitment to the arts, heritage and sport. 'David Mellor is very well qualified to deal with that job. He is doing it extremely well. He is going to go on doing it.' It was the first endorsement in public by Mr Major of the heritage secretary since newspaper revelations last Sunday of Mr Mellor's alleged relationship with a 31-year-old actress. It came as the pressure on Mr Mellor appeared to be easing. Yesterday, the minister made a well-publicised visit to his parents in-law, clearly aimed at projecting a conciliatory impression after press reports of rows within the family. Mr Mellor, asked by reporters whether he would resign, replied: 'Absolutely not'. Ministers now believe Mr Major's backing of Mr Mellor should ensure the political survival of the national heritage secretary, provided there are no further embarrassing disclosures. Mr Mellor also appears to have the backing of most MPs, who are growing increasingly angry at the press criticism. Only one Tory MP, Mrs Ann Winterton, has so far publicly called for his resignation. Mr Mellor's wife Judith has written to The Sun, the Daily Mirror and Today, protesting at some of their reports.</p>

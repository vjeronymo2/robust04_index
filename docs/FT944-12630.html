			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Milk price rises swiftly: First day of deregulation sees some doorstep deliveries up 2p Deregulation of the milk market has already hit consumers with an increase of 2p per pint in some doorstep deliveries yesterday and a similar rise today in some supermarkets. Tesco, the supermarket group, announced that a pint of fresh milk would go up by 2p, or 7.7 per cent, to 28p because of the rise in the cost of raw milk resulting from the new marketing arrangements which take effect today. It said it would keep cheese price increases to 5 per cent in spite of a 20 per cent rise in wholesale milk prices to cheese makers. British cheddar will rise shortly by 10p a pound to Pounds 2.05 and butter by about 8p a pound in a few weeks' time. Tesco blamed the increases on 'inflationary pressure' caused by the new marketing system, which sees the abolition of the statutory Milk Marketing Board and its replacement by a voluntary producers' co-operative, Milk Marque. The dairy trade, which plans to complain to the competition authorities in London and Brussels, says Milk Marque, with 66 per cent of supplies in England and Wales, is abusing its monopoly position by pushing up wholesale prices sharply. However, Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, said yesterday there was no justification for retail price increases of 2p or more on a pint of milk as a result of deregulation. 'I suspect that some dairy companies have been preparing price rises which are unrelated to the cost of milk and are seeking to blame these on the changes,' he said. Deregulation nevertheless continued to attract fierce criticism yesterday, with the Safeway supermarket group saying the changes 'could be catastrophic for some UK dairy product manufacturers', jeopardising jobs and leading to more imported dairy products. 'Although we will continue to buy British where it is commercially sensible, we fear continental producers will become more competitive on price in some product areas', it warned. Safeway expects to raise prices by 2p to 3p a pint. The Labour party said the survival of the doorstep pint was under threat. 'The government's plans will be bad for ordinary families, as the price of milk and dairy products goes up,' said Mr Gavin Strang, agriculture spokesman. Unigate, which delivers to 1.6m households in south and south-west England, raised its prices yesterday by 2p a pint to 40p. It said this covered higher wages and packaging costs and two previous raw milk price rises, as well as higher costs associated with deregulation, which had triggered the overall increase. The government argues the new system will lead to a shake-out of excess capacity devoted to low-value commodity products such as butter and skimmed milk powder. This will create a more efficient industry and benefit consumers in the longer run by reducing Britain's reliance on high value-added dairy imports, it says.</p>

			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> GALLEGLY RULES OUT PRE-ELECTION DEBATE  </P> <P> After being criticized by a debate moderator for not appearing at a candidate  forum Tuesday, Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) said he has no intention of  debating his opponents before Election Day, especially since Congress is trying  to forge a new budget agreement.  </P> <P> The two-term congressman's decision not to participate via satellite from  Washington raised protests from his Democratic challenger and the League of  Women Voters of Ventura County, the event's sponsor.  </P> <P> "Elton Gallegly is scared to death that if he has any appearance he'll be shown  to have no grasp of the issues," said Richard Frieman, an Agoura attorney  running as a Democrat. "He's a backbencher in the House and now he's hiding  out."  </P> <P> "It defeats the election process when voters do not have an opportunity to hear  their candidates," said Grace Bernstein, the league's director for Simi Valley  and Moorpark.  </P> <P> Contacted in Washington by phone Tuesday during a break in budget  deliberations, Gallegly said he feels no need to appear at candidate forums  with Frieman or Libertarian candidate Peggy Christensen because his voting  record in Congress speaks for him. Gallegly also did not debate his opponent in  1988.  </P> <P> "The reason why I don't feel a debate is that critical or is in the public  interest is that my record is a very public one," Gallegly said. "Voters can  call my office and get my record on any issue they want that's important to  them."  </P> <P> KADY-TV staged the forum at its Oxnard offices with a symbolic empty chair for  Gallegly, just as it did last Friday when Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino  (R-Ventura) did not appear at a similar forum. In a concession not made to  Lagomarsino, station executives offered to arrange a satellite broadcast from  Washington for Gallegly, who said the program would require too much  preparation and would take him from the House floor.

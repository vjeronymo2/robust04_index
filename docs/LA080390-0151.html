			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> BEACH NOTES;  </P> <P> SIX TOP PLAYERS WILL MISS LUCRATIVE SEAL BEACH EVENT  </P> <P> When the men's pro beach volleyball tour rolls into Seal Beach this weekend for  the 21st event of this year's circuit, the main question for a change won't be  who is playing with whom.  </P> <P> Instead, it could be who isn't playing at Seal Beach at all.  </P> <P> Despite one of the year's biggest purses -- $100,000 -- six of the tour's top  pros will miss the event, which gets under way Saturday at 9 a.m.. The finals  are scheduled for about 3 p.m. Sunday.  </P> <P> * Tim Hovland and Kent Steffes -- who have a first- and a second-place finish  to show for their first two tournaments -- will be playing in Italy for an  international event.  </P> <P> * Karch Kiraly -- Brent Frohoff's regular partner -- is skipping Seal Beach to  work the volleyball competition at the Goodwill Games in Seattle as a color  analyst for the Turner Broadcasting Network.  </P> <P> * Veteran teammates John Eddo and Sean Fallowfield are also playing in Italy  this weekend.  </P> <P> * And Scott Ayakatubby of Hermosa Beach didn't enter the tournament because of  a sore back -- a recurring injury that has sidelined him several times in the  past three years.  </P> <P> As usual, Sinjin Smith and Randy Stoklos are top-seeded at Seal Beach. Smith  and Stoklos came from behind last weekend in Chicago -- from out of the losers'  bracket -- to topple Hovland and Steffes in a sudden-death tiebreaker for the  championship.  </P> <P> But the depleted field behind Smith and Stoklos means that some new names could  find themselves advancing deep into the tournament.  </P> <P> The second-seeded team is Frohoff and Hovland's ex-partner, Mike Dodd. Frohoff  is Dodd's fourth different teammate in as many weeks, following Hovland, Dan  Vrebalovich and Ayakatubby. Next week Dodd might have to take on a fifth when  Frohoff returns to action with Kiraly.  </P> <P> Defending champion Jon Stevenson -- who won the Seal Beach event last year with  Steffes -- is paired with Mike Whitmarsh this time around and is 10th-seeded.  </P> <P> Of course, Seal Beach wouldn't be an Assn. of Volleyball Professionals event if  there wasn't at least one breakup beforehand.  </P> <P> Larry Mear and Scott Friedrichsen, teammates for the past three years, called  it quits this week, with Mear siding with Wally Goodrick and Friedrichsen  shuffling off with Craig Moothart.  </P> <P> On the Hovland-Dodd scale of volleyball breakups, this news rates about a "3"  -- but it's not entirely insignificant because Mear and Friedrichsen have  consistently been among the top eight seeded teams this season.  </P> <P> The men seem to have taken the reins from the women in the soap opera on the  beach as both seasons wind down.  </P> <P> Amazingly, there wasn't a single major partner change on the draw sheet for  this weekend's ladies' Pismo Beach Open -- a $25,000 event.  </P> <P> That is good news for Manhattan Beach's Patty Dodd, who has had to shuffle  partners this season almost as often as husband Mike.  </P> <P> In last weekend's action in Tokyo, Dodd and new partner Rita Crockett-Royster  placed a respectable third.  </P> <P> Dodd and Crockett-Royster were knocked out in the losers' bracket final, 15-13,  by red-hot Janice Opalinski and Lisa Strand.  </P> <P> Opalinski and Strand had eliminated top-seeded Jackie Silva and Karolyn Kirby  in the previous match, leaving Silva and Kirby with a season-low fifth-place  finish. Opalinski-Strand then swept on to the title with a victory over Nina  Matthies and Elaine Roque.  </P> <P> Chris Frohoff's early round successes at the Op Pro surfing championships in  Huntington Beach left South Bay surf watchers with a local boy to cheer on as  this week progressed.  </P> <P> Ted Robinson of Manhattan Beach advanced to the second round, but was  out-surfed on Wednesday, 82.3-63.5, by Australian veteran Barton Lynch.  </P> <P> Hermosa Beach's Scott Daley was ousted in the trial round.  </P></p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / International Company News: Sharp rise in income seen by Winterthur Insurance Winterthur Insurance, the third largest Swiss insurance group, said its gross premium income in the first half reached SFr10bn (Dollars 8.1bn). The group forecast a double digit rise in net income for the full year, from last year's SFr324.4m. This is the first time the group, which last month agreed to acquire three insurance companies from Swiss Reinsurance for SFr355m, has published a detailed interim report. No comparative figures were given. Gross premiums from non-life business were SFr6.38bn while claims amounted to SFr3.85bn and net expenses to SFr1.59bn. The group forecast that gross premium income would grow 9 per cent in the full year to SFr20bn, helped by a first-time consolidation of DBV Insurance of Germany. Net life premiums were SFr3.7bn and net benefits paid reached SFr2.06bn. Income from the group's SFr50.56bn in investments reached SFr1.5bn. Mr Peter Spalti, chief executive, said Winterthur had no plans to raise new capital to help pay for its recent acquisitions. Swissair, the Swiss national airline group, said the improving business trend recorded in the first half of the year continued in the third quarter, but it added that the airline was still being affected by lower prices and the high Swiss franc. Mr Hannes Goetz, chairman, said about 70 per cent of the airline's costs were in Swiss francs, but only a quarter of its revenues were in its home currency.</p>

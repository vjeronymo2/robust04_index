			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dietrich Menkens report: "Green Grass Roots Rebelling </F> Against Leaders"]    [Excerpts] Berlin -- Among those Greens, who have entered  in a coalition with the Social Democratic Party of Germany  [SPD], resistance is growing against the coalition course with  the SPD set down by the party leaders. At land delegates'  meetings in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Lower Saxony, and Berlin over  the weekend [23-24 April] the "cozying up to the Social  Democrats" was sometimes loudly condemned. The Greens in  Stuttgart announced that they will make their own election  statement, in which they will distance themselves in some issues  from the decisions made by the Mannheim federal congress.  There, prominent party representatives, such as Ludger Volmer  and Joschka Fischer, had persuaded the party to make a clear  coalition statement in favor of the SPD.    The grass roots in Lower Saxony are rebelling most strongly.  In protest against the pragmatic course, the delegates of the  land party congress in Wilhelmshaven elected Gila Altmann, a  representative of the left wing, to place one on the ticket for  the next Bundestag election. She was one of the harshest  domestic policy critics of the red-green coalition in Hannover.  [passage omitted]    Daniel Cohn-Bendit, an "ultraleftist" at the national level,  has even threatened with a party split. The reason: The  pragmatists are pushing the left wing out of the party. The  main addressee of the criticism is the "secret party chairman,"  Hesse Environment Minister Fischer, who wants to maneuver the  Greens to the political center. On the weekend he said for the  first time that for him a coalition with SPD and Free Democratic  Party of Germany would be conceivable. Fischer is propagating  "a feasible reform policy, with which 51 percent of the voters"  can be reached. [passage omitted]</p>

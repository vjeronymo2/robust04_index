			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Paribas sets up unit for derivatives BANQUE Paribas, the French bank, plans to set up a new unit to guarantee its derivatives business. It will be the first separately capitalised derivatives unit created by a European bank, following a trend started by Merrill Lynch and Salomon Brothers. Financial institutions with weak credit ratings have found themselves at a competitive disadvantage to top-rated banks in the highly credit-sensitive but lucrative derivatives market. The crunch comes when their ratings fall to single-A, as many firms are limited by internal restrictions to dealing with credits rated double-A and above. Banque Paribas is rated A1 by Moody's and A by Standard &amp; Poor's. S&amp;P assigned the new unit a preliminary rating of triple-A on Friday. Credit quality is particularly significant in the Dollars 4,000bn (Pounds 2,600bn) over-the-counter market in swaps and options, because exposure to a counterparty is often over a long period. The new Paribas unit, Paribas Derives Garantis SNC, is 99.9 per cent owned by Compagnie Financiere de Paribas. The unit will act as a guarantor, rather than a counterparty. Paribas said the structure had been chosen to allow clients to continue to deal with Banque Paribas, a regulated bank. The Commission Bancaire, the French bank regulator, has approved the structure. The initial amount of capital backing the unit is FFr800m (Pounds 90.5m). The total capital will be adjusted regularly according to the commitments of PDG.</p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> USAIR HIKES EXCURSION FARES  </P> <P> USAir Group Inc. said today it plans to hike its cheapest domestic air fares,  joining the major U.S. carriers in a move that will force leisure travelers to  pay more for their wanderlust.  </P> <P> USAir, the nation's seventh-largest airline, became the last of the major U.S.  airlines to unveil hikes of up to $20 on domestic excursion fares effective  Dec. 16.  </P> <P> But the Arlington, Va.-based carrier said it would raise prices on its shortest  flights by just $6, rather than the $10 hike planned by its competitors.  </P> <P> Excursion fares, highly restricted round-trip tickets that generally require  advance purchase and minimum stays, are used mainly by leisure travelers and  are the cheapest and most popular tickets sold.  </P> <P> The airlines, faced with rising fuel, maintenance and labor costs, are lifting  fares to boost revenues in a period of sluggish air traffic, analysts said.  </P></p>

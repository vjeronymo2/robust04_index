The process had obviously been impeded by problems of  economic reform and the division of Czechoslovakia but, he said,  "it should still be stated what has been done with the  property." He said he had submitted questions to Economics  Minister Karel Dyba, to which he expected answers within 30 days.    In 1990 the KSC property was reckoned to be worth some 30  billion crowns but current estimates rate it at around 13  billion ($433 million). Karas himself believes the value of the  property to be 15 or 16 billion crowns, although no inventory  has been drawn up.</p>

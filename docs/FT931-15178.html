			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Arts: A new era dawns with Barenboim - Opera in Berlin Berlin's oldest opera house, the Deutsche Staatsoper, is in festive mood. This season marks its 250th anniversary, and is the first to bear the imprint of Daniel Barenboim as artistic director. A new era has dawned. After 40 years of isolation in the Communist east of the city, the Staatsoper is re-asserting its position as Berlin's - and possibly the world's - number one opera house. The main anniversary celebration was Carl Heinrich Graun's Cleopatra e Cesare, a long-forgotten opera seria which inaugurated Frederick the Great's court opera on Berlin's Unter den Linden in 1742. There has also been a new Harry Kupfer staging of Parsifal and a successful exhumation of Busoni's first completed opera, Die Brautwahl. Drawing on his extraordinary network of contacts and friendships, Barenboim has acted as a magnet for the top talent in the business. His high-powered cast and production team for Parsifal were all colleagues from Bayreuth, and will form the basis of a complete Wagner cycle extending through the 1990s. Maurice Bejart is to create a new ballet in March, Jonathan Miller will produce Capriccio in May. Next season Patrice Chereau will re-stage his production of Wozzeck. Pierre Boulez has agreed to give the Staatsoper his first opera, and will conduct Boris Godunov there. What the Bastille lost when it parted company with Barenboim in 1989, Berlin has gained. With a salary of DM1m (Pounds 400,000) and enthusiastic support from the German political establishment, Barenboim is doing exactly what his paymasters wanted: transforming the Staatsoper into an upmarket operation, with an international status to match Berlin's upgrading as the future seat of the federal government. The changes have come at a price. The problems and accomplishments of the Staatsoper during the Communist era have been swept under the carpet, leaving some long-serving employees out of a job and others bewildered by the changes. Its orchestra, the Staatskapelle, does not yet match the standards now being set on stage. Seat prices have rocketed to a level which most east Berliners cannot afford. But the biggest loser is the Deutsche Oper in the western half of the city. Throughout the years when Berlin was divided, the Deutsche Oper alone upheld international standards of opera. It had exclusive call on visiting opera conductors and singers. It was a symbol of cultural freedom, benefitting from West Berlin's special funding status as an island in the Communist bloc. Now it finds itself competing with the Staatsoper for audiences, artists, sponsors and subsidy. Morally, the Deutsche Oper feels it should have emerged from unification as the outright victor. Instead, it is battling for survival. The Deutsche Oper's long-established intendant, Gotz Friedrich, and the new leadership at the Staatsoper are trying to play down the rivalry. Joint planning meetings have been held to prevent an overlap of repertoire. Each stresses the benefits of maintaining three opera companies in the city - the third being east Berlin's Komische Oper, which has a tradition, style and public of its own. But as Berlin's historic centre around the Staatsoper is redeveloped, the Deutsche Oper faces an erosion of prestige and income. Its DM79m (Pounds 31m) subsidy for 1993 is virtually the same as last year's. In contrast, the Staatsoper will enjoy a 30 percent increase to DM75m (Pounds 30m), and the Komische Oper a 25 percent rise to DM51m (Pounds 20.5m) - even though they have a smaller wage bill and the Komische Oper employs no star singers. The Staatsoper is expected to cream off the most lucrative video and recording work. And in Barenboim, it has a charismatic leader who is still developing as a conductor, and carries enormous clout and goodwill. The Staatsoper (often referred to as the Lindenoper) also has history, architecture and atmosphere on its side. It was the first opera house to be built in Berlin, and its fine classical exterior has survived the ravages of fire and wartime bombing. This is where Felix Weingartner and Richard Strauss served as Hofkapellmeister before the First World War, where Erich Kleiber conducted the premiere of Wozzeck in 1925, where Wilhelm Furtwangler and Leo Blech held sway in the 1930s, where 'Das Wunder Karajan' was coined in 1938. Faithful postwar reconstruction by the East German government preserved the grand but intimate atmosphere of the horseshoe auditorium, with its pink and gold decor and clear, sweet acoustic. The only disadvantage for the Staatsoper's new clientele is that it is stranded in east Berlin, currently resembling a building site by day and a Communist ghost town by night. For the time being, the Deutsche Oper is still the place where singers earn the highest fees and audiences hear the standard repertoire. Built as a bourgeois opera house in the Charlottenburg district in 1912, the original theatre was destroyed in the Second World War. Its postwar successor - a concrete block with a cavernous 1900-seat auditorium - has seen a steady stream of world premieres, has acted as the Berlin home of Domingo and Pavarotti and staged widely-acclaimed productions of the 19th century classics, not least Gotz Friedrich's time-tunnel version of The Ring. Given Berlin's huge culture budget and growing importance in a united Germany, there seems no reason why three distinctive companies should not thrive. The choice of Graun's opera seria to open the new era at the Staatsoper signals a welcome focus on pre-Mozartian opera, for which its 1300-seat theatre is ideal: Gluck's Alceste and Iphigenie en Tauride follow next season, and there will be Handel after that. Harry Kupfer - spiritus rector of the Komische Oper and a key Barenboim ally  - will help develop the Staatsoper's large-scale German repertory, where duplication with the Deutsche Oper is inevitable. The latter will continue with an extensive popular repertory, interspersed with big-budget new productions. No-one can hope to repeat Berlin's golden era before and after the First World War. Of the city's seven major orchestras, only one today has a German as chief conductor. For all his dedication and versatility, Barenboim is no Furtwangler and he will be absent seven months of the year. But with Claudio Abbado setting new artistic horizons for the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, and Barenboim single-handedly energising the city's opera life, Berlin is emerging as Europe's undisputed musical capital for the 1990s.</p>

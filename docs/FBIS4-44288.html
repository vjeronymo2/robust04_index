			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Bernardo Valli: "The Italian Waltz"] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Prime Minister Silvio  Berlusconi and Foreign Minister Antonio Martino were both making  their debut on the Greek island [Corfu]. This was the first  time that they took part in a meeting of heads of state and  government, and it was only natural that they should elicit a  certain amount of curiosity. Given that this was a European  summit, observers -- and no doubt the main players themselves --  paid special attention to the statements and, even more so, the  behavior of the representatives of the new government in Rome.  It was important to know whether their entry on the European  scene on a particularly significant occasion would change the  balance of forces between free-traders and unionists -- in  short, whether Italy was going to persevere in its Europeanist  position or, on the contrary, align itself with the  Euro-skeptics, as indeed certain clues suggested might happen.  Over [European Commission President] Delors' successor, would  Rome take sides with the Bonn-Paris axis or, alternatively, with  London?    Right from the first day, on Friday 24 June, as the summit  began, it became apparent that Rome was gravitating toward  London. Observers -- whether British, French, or German -- noted  this tendency without however expressing any surprise, since it  confirmed the forecasts that had been made for some time.  However, in the evening of that same day, Italy shifted its  position by performing a magnificent pirouette. The prime  minister could not resist the [German] chancellor's beckoning  and, relinquishing his free-tradist position, came down with his  vote on the unionists' side.    How can he be blamed for that sudden change, considering  that  in the second -- and final -- round, Belgium's Dehaene, whose  candidacy was supported by Paris and Bonn, won 11 votes out of  12, and was only flunked because of [British Prime Minister]  John Major's veto?    The prime minister's common sense probably prevailed over  the  foreign minister's line. Forced to repress his Thatcherite  feelings, Antonio Martino hastened to assuage the irritation  understandably felt by the Britons, who had once again relied on  Italy's support only to be let down as usual. (The turnabout  must have reminded Foreign Office officials of many episodes at  the time of De Michelis, Antonio Martino's predecessor under  Craxi).    However, the Corfu summit has failed to clarify Italy's  position in the European field. It is too early. At present,  priorities lie elsewhere. Above all, the government in Rome now  wants to be accepted by the international political community,  particularly by the European one. After being treated rudely on  so many occasions, Silvio Berlusconi finds comfort in smiles and  handshakes. They are ointments on his open wounds. The German  chancellor's cordiality (and perhaps the prospect of enabling  Forza Italia's European deputies to join the Christian  Democratic parliamentary group in Brussels, from which they have  so far been excluded) weigh more than Foreign Minister Antonio  Martino's Thatcherite leanings.    Smiles also carried much weight in Rome, at the time of  Clinton's visit. The American President flatly turned down  Italy's demand to become a permanent member of the Security  Council, as well as the more legitimate demand to take part in  the "contact group" for Bosnia -- more legitimate in that Italy  is providing bases for the aircraft operating over former  Yugoslavia, and should at least be among the countries involved  in the various political initiatives. On that occasion, too,  smiles counted more than facts. But we have not yet moved  beyond smiles.</p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Concern at state cost of personal pensions THE BURDEN on the Exchequer of people contracting out of the State Earnings Related Pensions Scheme (Serps) is the equivalent of 1.5 pence on the basic rate of income tax, according to a Commons Public Accounts Committee report published yesterday. The cross-party committee expressed concern that the Department of Social Security had focused on its own staffing needs in assessing the impact of personal pensions, rather than the 'potentially much more significant implications for the National Insurance Fund'. It recommended frequent appraisal of the cost of personal pensions to inform future policy-making. The PAC report follows last year's findings by the comptroller and auditor-general that the net cost of encouraging contracting out would eventually reach Pounds 5.9bn at April 1988 prices. Reducing the numbers in Serps would produce a saving for the National Insurance Fund, but this would be greatly exceeded by the cost of the National Insurance contributions rebate (5.8 per cent of relevant earnings), the special incentive of 2 per cent of relevant earnings payable until April 1993 and tax relief on the employee's part of the rebate. As a result of these costs, the National Insurance Fund was in danger of falling below prudential balance, so the government switched three social security benefits from the fund to general taxation. The cost of this transfer for 1990-91 was Pounds 1.8bn, equivalent to a 1.5p rise in the basic rate of tax. In estimating the impact of contracting out, the DSS assumed that 500,000 people would take out personal pensions, perhaps rising to 1.75m in due course. By April 1990, 4m people had taken out personal pensions and the number was thought to be still rising. The Government Actuary had prepared estimates of the long-term savings to the National Insurance Fund based on 500,000, 2m and 5m contracting out. But the DSS had used such estimates only to forecast staffing needs, choosing the lowest figure following the Actuary's advice that there was no basis for a firm estimate. DSS officials told the committee that levels of rebate and incentive had been decisions taken by ministers to cut costs of pensions over the next 40 years.</p>

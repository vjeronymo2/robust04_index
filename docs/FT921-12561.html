			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Books: Intoxicated by the memory of things past MARCEL PROUST SELECTED LETTERS,VOLUME 3, 1910-1917 edited by Philip Kolb, translated by Terence Kilmartin Harper Collins Pounds 40, 434 pages FOR LOVERS of Proust, there can never be too much. His great novel, Remembrance of Things Past, 1 1/4 million words, fills well over 3,000 pages in English translation. Now we have a third volume of letters, selected from six volumes of the comprehensive original French edition which has already reached Volume 16. When the present volume starts, Proust is aged 40. He is an invalid, confined to his room by asthma. Three years earlier, in 1910, he was able to go out all day in a closed car; after a year this had to stop, but he could still go to the beach; then it was evenings only; and by now he can only manage downstairs for an hour or two every few days. In 1912 he is describing his daily fumigations, a largely ineffectual attempt to help his breathing, which last seven or eight hours at a time. His single meal is at five in the morning. Proust had once been an active man. He had even done national service as a soldier and was still on the reserve. Now he lived at second hand through his friends, insisting that they tell him every detail of the parties he could no longer attend. In his letters he pours out his gratitude and affection to the literary men and titled ladies whose lives he had shared, and he carefully husbands his memories of past times. Sometimes he is petty and conspiratorial. Always he luxuriantly relishes the delights of small things: flowers, dress, language, writing at unashamed length about the modulations of his sensibility. There is scarcely a word of self-pity. Many of the letters are about plans for his book. At this time he had in mind two volumes only. The first was published at his own expense, and he conscientiously warned that the second would be a little indecent. When Swann's Way appeared in 1913, it was at once recognised as something entirely new. Publishers vied to offer him money but he insisted that he would keep to the former arrangement and put up the capital himself. The outbreak of war in August 1914 changed everything. Proust, guilty at being too ill to fight, spends much of his strength offering comfort to the bereaved. 'But, and I say this not only for him,' he writes in characteristically tortuous style about one of his many friends killed in the fighting, 'not even as much for him as for others, the dead live in me to such a degree that not being able to find them on this earth seems to me to be somehow devoid of meaning, and I find myself in the state of mind of a madman.' The war ruined the publishing industry and threw all Proust's plans for his book into uncertainty. Patiently the invalid went back to his desk and to his memories, revising and expanding and composing until the novel grew to eight volumes. As Proust himself knew, it was an amazing achievement which could only have happened as a result of a unique combination of disasters - although, with his intense experience of suffering and his acute sensitivity to language, he would have squirmed at the editor's comment that the war was a 'blessing in disguise.' For most readers the main interest of the present volume is likely to lie in Proust's occasional descriptions of what he wanted to achieve in his novel, especially his ambition to catch in words the strange workings of the involuntary memory. The voluntary - intellectual - memory, he writes in 1913, gives us only imprecise facsimiles of the past which no more resemble the reality of the past than paintings by bad artists resemble the spring. 'But if we get a whiff of a long-forgotten smell, we are suddenly intoxicated, and similarly we think we no longer love the dead because we don't remember them, but if by chance we come across an old glove we burst into tears.' The translation is by Terence Kilmartin, who sadly died a few months ago. He had earlier prepared the authoritative version of the complete novel, available from Penguin.</p>

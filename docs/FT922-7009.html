			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo hit by broker revision OIL exploration company Lasmo was the worst performing stock yesterday in the FT-SE 100 Index and one of the weakest in the London market following a sharp profits forecast downgrading by securities house SG Warburg. Warburg argued that unless the company cuts its dividend, halves its exploration budget and takes Pounds 5m off its overheads it will lose Pounds 30m this year. It said Lasmo needed to reduce its total dividend to a nominal penny from 8.5p. Lasmo fell 18 to 199p with more than 8.8m shares traded. The revised forecast follows a similar exercise on Enterprise last week, when Warburg lowered its underlying earnings prediction by Pounds 16m to Pounds 78m, inclusive of Pounds 30m profits from asset disposals. County NatWest followed yesterday with a forecast cut from Pounds 86m to Pounds 72m for Enterprise, and estimated asset disposal profits at only Pounds 25m. It also advised clients to reduce holdings. Enterprise slipped 5 to 421p. Next optimism A healthy trading statement from Next helped sentiment in a positive retail sector anticipating improved official figures today. Next shares rose 4 1/2 to 88 1/2 p in volume of 6.8m. Chairman Lord Wolfson said at the group's annual meeting that retail sales in the first quarter were ahead by 10 per cent from last year's corresponding period. Although some observers pointed out that Next's sales last year were particularly flat, the rise followed similar noises from Burton last week. The market also expects a moderate increase in retail sales figures due today. Burton gained 2 to 50p, Boots 3 to 467p and Kingfisher 2 to 563p. Dixons advanced 6 to 271p and Amstrad rose 3 1/2 to 40 1/2 p, both partly on the back of the BSkyB football deal. Bank approves bid Approval by the Bank of England for Hongkong and Shanghai Banking's bid for Midland Bank prompted renewed support for the UK clearer. The statement triggered talk that Hongkong Bank would launch a dawn raid today for Midland stock in order to take its stake above 15 per cent. However, banking analysts said this was unlikely as Hongkong Bank is not allowed to buy stock in the market at a price lower than the bid price. Midland gained 4 to 397p. The possibility that rival suitor Lloyds Bank - up 8 at 432p - may not get a toehold caused analysts to cast around and look for another likely target for Lloyds. They alighted on Royal Bank of Scotland, pinpointing the value of its Direct Line Insurance subsidiary. Royal Bank climbed 7 to 205p. Figures at the bottom end of expectations prompted profit-taking in BOC, which dropped 15 to 703p. The gases and healthcare group announced half-year profits of Pounds 162.7m, up from a previous Pounds 144.7m but against analysts' forecasts of between Pounds 163m and Pounds 166m. The company said signs of an upswing were patchy and limited to a few segments of its global industrial gases markets. Smith New Court lowered its full-year profits forecast by Pounds 5m to Pounds 355m and was advising clients to switch into ICI which, it said, offers good value up to 1400p. ICI eased 5 to 1361p. Turnover in Hanson was boosted as a number of the conglomerate's directors exercised share options. Lord Hanson reduced his holding to 6m shares after selling 2.5m at 232 1/2 p. In the market, the shares eased 2 1/2 to 231 1/2 p with 10m traded. There were also 9.1m warrants traded. Body Shop retreated 12 to 308p as rumours of a critical television programme circulated. Talk of the sale of Gardner Merchant, Forte's catering subsidary, refused to die away ahead of today's results from rival caterer and potential purchaser Compass Group. The latest talk has the Pounds 500m subsidiary being broken up, with the UK side going to management and Compass taking the European operations. Both Forte and Compass shares were unchanged yesterday. Slightly disappointing results from Allied-Lyons saw the shares marked down 8 to 652p. Worries over the Carlsberg deal and the brewery group's cash flow  -with City anxiety over the possibility of a rights issue refusing to go away - also persisted. Mr Graeme Eadie at County NatWest moved to a buy position on Allied, however, citing solid margins and good recovery prospects. 'The new management team is on course to deliver superior earnings growth over the next two years,' he said. Nervousness ahead of today's results from Bass left the shares down 12 at 619p. Selling in the US was said to have been behind a fall of 21 to 984p for Wellcome. Glaxo recovered 13 to 748p. Figures from Swedish competitor Astra, particularly on Losec, the direct competitor to Glaxo's anti-ulcer drug Zantac, were good but in line with forecasts. British Airways raced up 15 to 302p in brisk trade of 18m shares, making it the best performer in the FT-SE 100 Index. The company reported full-year profits up 119 per cent at Pounds 285m, and a 20 per cent rise in the dividend. Analysts moved quickly to upgrade current year forecasts to around the Pounds 409m mark. P &amp; O benefited from the positive mood surrounding BA and gained 11 to 536p. A gloomy annual meeting at Ocean Group sent the shares tumbling 27 to 311p. British Steel eased 3 to 81p. There was talk in the market that the recent price increases for steel are not holding and that the company is being forced to sell to European customers at pre-April 1992 prices. Williams Holdings added 6 at 360p, with suggestions in the market that the share price was being massaged in preparation for a deal or acquisition. A line of GEC stock that has been overhanging the market was said to have held down the shares, which lost 2 1/2 to 230 1/2 p. However, 8m shares were traded in big blocks at 230 1/2 p a share, suggesting that the overhang had now been largely cleared. Board changes at Southern Water were welcomed by the market, the stock adding 12 at 411p in a positive water sector, where Panmure Gordon advised investors to stay 'overweight'. Building materials group BPB Industries gained 6 to 187p in heavy turnover of 3.6m as BZW moved to a buy stance. MARKET REPORTERS: Christopher Price, Peter John, Joel Kibazo.

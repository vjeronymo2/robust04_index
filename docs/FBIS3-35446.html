			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Senate today completed debate on the hijacking  of a Peshawar school bus. Winding up the debate, Federal  Interior Minister, retired Major General Nasirullah Khan Babar,  said successful commando operation against the hijackers has  saved the country from a national calamity. The minister said  the government had no option but to resort to an operation  against the hijackers who had refused to listen to any reason.  Gen. Babar said the government had made it clear that it would  not bow before any act of terrorism. Earlier, Mr. Abdur Rahim  Mandokhel, Mr. Mohammad Ibrahim Khan, Dr. Mohammad Rehan, Mr.  Shahzad Gul, and Federal Minister for Special Education Dr. Sher  Afghan participated in the debate on the bus hijacking.    In a written statement to the house on the attack of  Pakistan  Chancery building in Kabul by 100 people yesterday, the federal  minister for law, justice, and parliamentary affairs, Syed Iqbal  Haider, told the Senate that Pakistan was astonished that such a  reaction had taken place in Kabul in support of the criminal act  in which innocent children were taken hostage at gun point by  three criminals. He said there was no cause for this reaction,  particularly as the action against the three hijackers was taken  in the Afghan Embassy in Islamabad with the consent and  cooperation of the Afghan Government. The minister said this act  of terrorism has been condemned by the Afghan president and  prime minister.    Syed Iqbal Haider said the reaction of the demonstrators on  the question of food supplies to Kabul was also irrational and  unreasonable. The Pakistan Government had already donated and  dispatched 32,000 tons of wheat to Afghanistan during last year  and was in the process of sending additional relief wheat as  well as other goods to Afghanistan. The foreign minister,  Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali, had only recently undertaken a  humanitarian mission to Jalalabad to secure food supplies to  Kabul through the ICRC by persuading Prime Minister Hekmatyar to  open the route for relief convoys. Pakistan's borders had  always remained open for the transport of relief goods. The  route between Jalalabad and Kabul was an internal matter for the  Afghan leaders. However, Pakistan was urging them to keep all  internal Afghan routes open for humanitarian relief.    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is now going to consider the  question of temporary closure of its embassy in Kabul and the  issue of compensation for damage to our chancery. Decisions  shall be taken after examining all possible aspects of our  relations with Afghanistan. However, the Government of Pakistan  will not allow the acts of criminals to undermine the close  brotherly relations between the two countries.</p>

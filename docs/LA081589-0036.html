			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BID TO LIMIT RISES IN CAR POLICY COSTS IS PROMISED  </P> <P> Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie opened five days of hearings on  Proposition 103-mandated changes in auto insurance pricing methods here Monday  with a pledge to "channel" the law to avoid large rate increases for millions  of policyholders.  </P> <P> Gillespie's pledge may be good news for policyholders in San Diego, the San  Joaquin Valley, rural Northern California and the Inland Empire who, under the  new law, might have found themselves subsidizing lower prices in Los Angeles  and San Francisco. But for policyholders in the largest urban centers, it means  there is likely to be little price relief.  </P> <P> Faced with deciding what to do about the present system of basing prices  largely on where a policyholder lives, Gillespie indicated that she may direct  that the residency factor be applied only on a regional or countywide basis.  </P> <P> "I will try to channel the law to make sure it does more good than harm," the  commissioner said.  </P> <P> As an illustration, Gillespie said that if there is a flat regional rate  applied in San Diego and the Inland Empire, the average auto insurance rate  would rise by 3% in Imperial County and 2% in San Diego County, but decline by  1% in San Bernardino County and 4% in Riverside County.  </P> <P> If, by contrast, countywide rates were applied, she said the average rate in  San Diego County would rise by 14% in La Mesa and 8% in Vista, but decline by  2% in San Diego and 5% in La Jolla.  </P> <P> At a hearing to be held in Los Angeles today, Gillespie may reveal estimates  for what the possible alternative systems would do in Los Angeles, Orange and  Ventura counties.  </P> <P> Gillespie's estimates are based on averages, and there could be greater  fluctuations in individual rates if either of the new systems were used to  replace the present sharp neighborhood-by-neighborhood variations.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Factors  </P> <P> Proposition 103 says that a driver's safety record, miles driven and years of  driving experience should be used, in that order, as the most important  criteria for setting rates. But it allows Gillespie to employ other factors as  well -- such as place of residence, marital status, sex and age, as long as  they are shown to have an influence on claims costs.  </P> <P> Gillespie declared Monday that to apply this literally and impose a flat rate  statewide, rate increases in some areas of up to 60% could result. In only  three of the state's 58 counties -- Los Angeles, Orange and San Francisco --  would rates go down.  </P> <P> On Monday, as the hearings opened, positions of the various parties had not  changed since June, when earlier hearings were held.  </P> <P> Insurance industry representatives warned that doing away with or subverting  neighborhood-based pricing would result in enormous price increases for most  Californians, and save money only for those who reside in the highly populated  counties.  </P> <P> On the other side, Proposition 103 author Harvey Rosenfield charged that  Gillespie is engaged in "fraud" and "propaganda" in warning that implementing  Proposition 103 could mean large increases for many.  </P> <P> Rosenfield charged that the insurance industry is withholding from Gillespie  data about what would happen if the new law's rating criteria were used, and  said she should not make up her mind what to do until the companies provide the  data.  </P> <P> Gillespie had a mild response, remarking that she wished Rosenfield would work  with her rather than against her. But she did say that she would like more  pricing data from the companies.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Calmly" column by Ibrahim Nafi'] </F>   [Excerpt] Based on highly trustworthy sources and confident  of the accuracy of my information, I can say that Egyptian  security has now succeeded in completely containing the  terrorism phenomena and in accomplishing what has not been done  by previous security efforts throughout the past years, that is,  to fully penetrate the secret terrorist organizations that have  tried to destabilize Egyptian society and distort the image of  the Islamic religion in the eyes of the world.    This penetration, which is long overdue and succeeded by  virtue of the current wise security policy, has achieved  tremendous results in the past few months in liquidating one  terrorist ring after another and uncovering all their leaders,  financial sources, and lines of communication. What remains are  only sporadic pockets that will be liquidated one after the  other and no day will pass without the arm of security and  stability uncovering one of them. This does not mean that we  should belittle the danger of the hidden fingers that are still  moving terrorism from inside or outside our country. This also  does not mean that we must relax the policy of firmly  confronting terrorism, which is being pursued by all sectors of  the state, until this destructive wave that has undermined our  domestic life and affected our economy and the livelihood of  large segments of our people has receded completely.

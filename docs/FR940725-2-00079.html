Brown, M.D.; Revocation of Registration <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On May 26, 1989, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to James H. Brown, M.D. (Respondent), of New Orleans, Louisiana, proposing to revoke his DEA Certificate of Registration, AB3370967, and deny any pending applications for renewal of such registration. The statutory basis for the Order to Show Cause was that Dr. Brown's continued registration would be inconsistent with the public interest, as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondent, through counsel, requested a hearing on the issues raised by the Order to Show Cause. Following prehearing procedures, a hearing was held in New Orleans, Louisiana, on March 31 and April 1, 1993. On January 25, 1994, in her findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommended ruling, the administrative law judge recommended that Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration be revoked. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On February 11, 1994, Respondent filed exceptions to Judge Bittner's recommended ruling pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.66, and on February 28, 1994, the administrative law judge transmitted the record to the then-Acting Administrator. The Deputy Administrator has carefully considered the entire record in this matter and, pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67, hereby issues his final order in this matter based upon findings of fact and conclusions of law as hereinafter set forth. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The administrative law judge found that the Respondent is a psychiatrist who graduated from medical school in 1947. Respondent, as of the date of the hearing, maintained a private practice as a psychiatrist in New Orleans, Louisiana. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The administrative law judge found that in November or December 1986, an informant told DEA that Respondent issued prescriptions for controlled substances in exchange for money. Consequently, on several occasions between December 3, 1986 and February 26, 1987, the informant and an undercover police officer purchased controlled substance prescriptions from Respondent for no legitimate medical reason. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the first visit on December 3, 1986, the informant advised the Respondent that she wanted to purchase Valium, a Schedule IV controlled substance, to use with her boyfriend. The informant did not provide the Respondent with any medical problem or condition, and paid the Respondent $80.00 in exchange for a prescription for 60 dosage units of Valium. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the second visit on December 12, 1986, the informant told the Respondent that her boyfriend had swapped some of the Valium Respondent had prescribed for Seconal, a Schedule II controlled substance. The informant then asked for some Seconal, telling Respondent that she and her friends liked to use the drug. The Respondent issued a prescription for 30 Seconal in exchange for $80, and told the informant to destroy the pill bottle. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On January 8, 1987, an undercover police officer accompanied the informant to Respondent's office, posing as her boyfriend. The Respondent wrote both the undercover officer and the informant prescriptions for 30 Seconal in exchange for $160. The officer testified at the hearing that Respondent did not perform any physical examination on either of them, nor was there any discussion of any medical problems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On February 10, 1987, the informant returned alone to Respondent's office. Respondent issued two prescriptions, one in the informant's name, and one in the name of the undercover officer. Each prescription was for 30 Seconal and informant paid the Respondent $160. On February 26, 1987, the undercover officer went to Respondent's office alone,and received two prescriptions for Seconal, in exchange for $160, again with one prescription in the name of the undercover officer and the other in the informant's name. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On August 3, 1987, a search warrant was executed at Respondent's office which revealed handwritten notes regarding the informant and the undercover officer in a file, and prescription bottles of various controlled substances which bore the names of other physicians. Respondent stated that the bottles were brought in by patients who no longer used those drugs, and that he dispensed them to other patients as needed. Respondent did not maintain an inventory of the drugs nor did he know the expiration dates of the medication. Respondent testified at the hearing that patients sometimes gave him medications they they had been prescribed by other physicians, and that he sometimes gave small quantities of these drugs to other patients as a trial before issuing prescriptions for the patients. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

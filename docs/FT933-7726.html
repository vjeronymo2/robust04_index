			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / International Company News: Commerzbank to raise DM880m share capital COMMERZBANK, Germany's third largest bank, is raising DM880m (Dollars 519m) through an issue of Genussscheine profit-participating certificates which count as supplementary capital under European Community capital adequacy rules. The move, which follows a DM500m rights issue earlier this year and an issue of Genussscheine last autumn, is designed to boost the bank's capital position following growth in the balance sheet during the course of the current year. It will take the bank's total capital to DM14.5bn, of which DM3.2bn is made up of profit-participating certificates. The new certificates will pay 7.25 per cent interest and will be issued at a price of DM1,100. The certificates, which will be offered to shareholders between September 1 and September 15, come with warrants attached: each nominal DM1,000 certificate contains four warrants. Two warrants offer the right to buy one Commerzbank share at DM300, exerciseable between January 1994 and December 1997. Commerzbank said profits in July and August followed the first-half trend when net operating profits rose 16.3 per cent.</p>

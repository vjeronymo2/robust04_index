			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WASTE REDUCTION CONSULTANTS IN DEMAND AS CITIES RACE TO COMPLY;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: GETTING A JUMP ON CUTTING TRASH MAY COST MORE IN THE LONG RUN THAN  SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS EXPECT.  </P> <P> The official title of a new law aimed at reducing the amount of trash going to  landfills is the Integrated Solid Waste Management Act. But privately,  California bureaucrats have dubbed the state statute the "Consultants' Full  Employment Act."  </P> <P> Local governments, lacking the staff and expertise to comply with the law's  required paperwork, and aware that noncompliance could result in daily fines of  $10,000, have stampeded the handful of environmental consulting firms with  experience in the field.  </P> <P> The statute is "a consultant's gold mine," said Leslie Legg, an analyst for the  National Solid Waste Management Assn., a Washington-based trade group  representing trash haulers, recyclers, landfill operators and consultants.  </P> <P> Already, consulting firms have added new divisions, opened new offices and  hired new employees to meet the skyrocketing demand for their services. The  danger, many officials and industry experts warn, is that inexperienced  consultants will provide cities with costly but superficial plans that fail to  meet the state's requirements.  </P> <P> The market for consultants is lucrative. Fees for drafting a city's plan for  complying with the law's goal -- reducing the amount of garbage going to  landfills 25% by 1995 and 50% by 2000 -- can range from $50,000 to $200,000,  officials and consultants said. For groups of cities that join together to hire  a single consultant, fees can reach $900,000.  </P> <P> "The price of not having developed a cadre of trained municipal officials is  paying through the nose for consultants who may or may not be able to give you  the best advice," said Joan Edwards, who is coordinating recycling for the city  of Los Angeles, which expects to hire several consulting firms. "There's a lot  of gambling going on."  </P> <P> Cities around Los Angeles County are rolling the dice. The city of Glendale in  January agreed to pay $200,000 for services related to the waste law to a San  Francisco-based consulting firm that already was working for the city, said  Kerry Morford, the city's assistant public works director. He said he expected  the preliminary draft of the plan to be before the Glendale City Council later  this month.  </P> <P> In June, the city of Palmdale hired a Santa Rosa-based firm at a cost of  $173,000, in an attempt to beat the rush to hire consultants. "A lot of cities  are panicking," said Leon Swain, the city's senior civil engineer.  </P> <P> Agoura Hills is considering teaming with Westlake Village to hire a consultant.  The two cities have begun shopping for firms and have gotten estimates ranging  from $75,000 to $190,000. "Some of the estimates are staggering," said Agoura  Hills City Planner Mike Kamino.  </P> <P> But some consultants cautioned that cities ought not cut corners on drafting  the plans, which are supposed to analyze the composition of the city's garbage  and propose ways of reducing its volume. Governments which try to save now may  be confronted with far greater costs later, they said.  </P> <P> In a practice known as "low-balling," consulting firms sometimes offer to draft  waste reduction studies at fees far below the average, said Eugene Tseng, a  private consultant and executive director of EcoSource, a nonprofit group that  develops waste management training programs.  </P> <P> The practice allows new companies to "get their foot in the door" and helps  established firms "build up relationships for long-term work," said Tseng,  whose students at UCLA are drafting a waste reduction plan for the city of  Azusa.  </P> <P> But the "low-balled" contracts often leave out necessary services that confront  cities later in the form of additional consultants' fees, Kamino said.  </P> <P> "The cities that haven't done this kind of work don't know necessarily what the  right balance of work is," said Richard Hertzberg, a senior consultant for  Resource Integration Systems, a nationwide firm that opened a Los Angeles  office Sept. 10.  </P> <P> Accurate counts of the number of waste management consulting firms are  difficult to come by, but a 1989 survey by Legg's organization found no more  than 10 nationwide with experience in drafting the kind of waste studies  required under the California law, she said.  </P> <P> The statute, authored by Assemblyman Byron D. Sher (D-Palo Alto), was signed by  Gov. George Deukmejian on Sept. 29, 1989.  </P> <P> One of the companies seeking to seize the opportunity presented by the new  state law is R.W. Beck and Associates, a nationwide environmental consulting  firm in business since 1942. The company has 30 workers in California -- 25  hired since the statute, said Gregg Foster, a recycling specialist for the  firm. "I can't say that that was totally a result of the bill," he said. "But  certainly it played a major role."  </P> <P> Cities could comply with older waste management statutes simply by burning  their trash more efficiently. But the new law requires them to produce less  garbage, and to do that they must persuade the public to change its wasteful  ways.  </P> <P> The shift in legislative focus has caused consulting firms to hire people  trained in politics and public relations rather than engineering.  </P> <P> Among the new breed of waste reduction consultants is Foster, 25, who majored  in public administration in college and spent a year writing guidebooks and  organizing conferences on recycling before he was hired by R.W. Beck.  </P> <P> The shift away from hard science, some in the field said, has made it tougher  for municipal officials to distinguish between qualified and unqualified  consultants.  </P> <P> "Recycling is a people-oriented kind of thing, not so much a technical-oriented  kind of thing," said Bill George, recycling coordinator for the Los Angeles  County Sanitation Districts, which operates area landfills. He has organized  consortia enabling a number of cities to jointly hire a single consultant. In  addition to consultants who have marketing and waste management experience, he  said, "I want to see people who are activists -- who have experience at the  grass-roots level."  </P> <P> Some question the value of such generic political skills. "I absolutely think  there is such a thing as recycling expertise," Edwards said. "I just think  consultants are going to be hard-pressed to fulfill the high expectations that  municipalities have for them because the consultants are stretched very thin."  </P> <P> The California Integrated Waste Management Board, the agency created by the  legislation to oversee its implementation, included in its May newsletter a  warning to city officials that the board "accepts no responsibility for the  accuracy of the information provided by others or in forums not endorsed by the  board."  </P> <P> The state is compiling a list of waste reduction consultants for distribution  to government officials, said Steven Ault, acting manager of the waste  generation analysis branch of the board's local planning division. But  inclusion on the list does not imply endorsement by the state, he stressed.  </P> <P> If history is any indication, some consultants said, the current demand for  consulting firms will subside in a few years.  </P> <P> "The boom that you see now in the solid waste management area is the same type  of boom you saw in the early '80s in hazardous materials," said Tseng,  referring to federal legislation involving the Environmental Protection Agency.  </P> <P> Other consultants are more confident that the good times are here to stay.  </P> <P> "These solid waste problems that we're dealing with today are only going to get  worse," said Fred Kisner, program manager for contracts dealing with the  statute for EBA Waste Technologies, the firm that was awarded Palmdale's  contract. "If you're in the solid waste business, that certainly would suggest  that there's work on the horizon."  </P></p>

			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Cookery: Join a real jam session THERE IS something irresistible about Seville oranges. The name of them, and the heady scent released when a fingernail is run across the skin, are as brilliant as summer sunshine, just the spirit-lifter needed to dispel the gloom of dank-dark January. At this time of year, unlike high summer, the idea of holing up in the kitchen for a jam session is not unappealing. The cosy warmth is inviting and there is an undeniable glow of satisfaction to be gained from making your own preserves. What has become my standard marmalade recipe - one which is made with a little less sugar than traditional marmalade - is given below. If time is short, it may make more sense to buy marmalade and to enjoy more immediate returns from the purchase of a few Seville oranges by turning them into a sharp and zesty pudding for Sunday lunch. Wendy Brandon is an ace marmalade maker, from whom I am as happy to buy as to make my own. Her range is wide, using citrus fruits of all kinds and a variety of additional flavourings. They include spiced lemon, orange with ginger, grapefruit and elderflower, satsuma, kumquat, orange with molasses and rum, pink grapefruit with campari, and lime with tequila. Her marmalades come with a choice of sugar content (the traditional ratio, reduced sugar, and with no added sugar at all). They are stocked by a few select shops and can be bought by mail order: Wendy Brandon, Felin Wen, Boncath, Dyfed SA37 0JR. Tel: 0239-841568. Fax: 0239-841746. Another commercial offering of which I am especially fond is Twinings' 'Earl Grey' marmalade. Although high in sugar, this is delectable, made with bergamot, that most aromatic of bitter fruit. Its zesty oil gives good-quality Earl Grey tea its characteristic fragrance. It is a marmalade I will go a long way to buy, which is just as well, since it involves a pilgrimage to central London - it isavailable only to personal shoppers at Twinings shop in the Strand, London WC2. Nowhere near so distinctive but chunky, dark and good is Duerr's extra thick-cut, traditional marmalade, which has the advantage of being stocked by grocers and supermarkets countrywide. REDUCED SUGAR MARMALADE (makes enough to fill eight jars) Organic fruit, or at any rate unsprayed, is desirable for marmalade-making and any other recipe that uses the zest or peel. 4 lb Seville oranges; four lemons; 6 lb granulated or preserving sugar. Squeeze the juice from all the fruits into a preserving pan. Put the pips and the membrane remaining in the citrus shells into a loosely-tied, butter muslin bag. Shred the peel coarsely or finely as you like it, and add it to the pan with the bag of pips and 8 pt cold water. Cook over very low heat for two to three hours until the peel is so tender that it can be squashed between finger and thumb, and the liquid has reduced by about half. Remove the bag of pips and membrane (squeeze it with a wooden spoon in a sieve so all the pectin-rich juices drip back into the pan) and discard it. Add the sugar and stir over very low heat until it is fully dissolved, then cook at a rolling boil until setting point is reached - when a thermometer will read 220'F (104'C). This usually takes 10 to 15 minutes. Skim, let the marmalade stand for 10 minutes or so, then stir to distribute the peel evenly in the jelly, and pot in the usual way. LITTLE SEVILLE PUDDINGS (serves 6) For those who want to enjoy the zesty scent and lovely taste of bitter oranges without the labour of marmalade-making, here is a good pudding for Sunday lunch. How many oranges you will need depends on their size and juiciness: six is a fair average. 8 fl oz freshly-squeezed Seville orange juice and several pinches of finely grated zest; 6 oz caster sugar; 3 oz softened butter; four large eggs; 2 oz flour; 8 fl oz milk; fromage frais or whipped cream for serving. Beat the butter and sugar with an electric whisk until creamy. Beat in the orange juice, gradually, then the egg yolks, one at a time. Do not worry if the mixture looks curdled. Beat in the flour, then the milk, adding it slowly. Whisk the egg whites to snowy peaks and fold the Seville orange juice mixture into them, adding pinches of zest as you do so. Ladle the mixture into six individual souffle dishes which have been lightly buttered. Stand them in a roasting tin and add enough hot water to come halfway up the sides of the dishes. Bake at 350'F-375'F (180'C-190'C) gas mark 4-5, for about 40 minutes until puffed up, coloured and softly set. The surface of the puddings will crack as they cook and the mixture becomes light and spongy on top and creamy underneath. Little Seville puddings are best to eat about 10 minutes after they come out of the oven. They sink a little as they cool, so dress them with dollops of fromage frais or cream and a pinch of zest just before bringing them to table.</p>

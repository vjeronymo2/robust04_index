			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY SPOTS: YOU CAN HAVE A WHALE OF A TIME AT FIESTA TODAY  </P> <P> Whale toys, whale stories, whale films, sand whales, stained-glass whales --  and watermelon. It's all part of today's annual Whale Fiesta, 10 a.m. to 4:30  p.m. at the Cabrillo Marine Museum, 3720 Stephen White Drive, San Pedro. Most  of the offerings and museum admission are free.  </P> <P> The big event of the day is the 60-foot humpback whale that will rise out of  the sand on the beach in front of the museum. Everyone is welcome to help  because the huge sand creation must be finished by 2 p.m. -- in time for the  official picture-taking. There's watermelon for all helpers.  </P> <P> Back at the museum, youngsters may step up to the arts-and-crafts tables to  make whale visors, whale wind socks and origami whales. For 25 cents each,  there are educational, carnival-type games: feed the squid to the sperm whale,  whale migration and more.  </P> <P> Marine-life experts will be on hand to answer questions. In the auditorium,  films on sharks and the Channel Islands will be screened throughout the day.  </P> <P> The entries in the Great Cetacean Creation Sensation will be on exhibit and  judged. These are whales done in wood, papier-mache, stained glass, brass and  other media, created by children and adult artists.  </P> <P> There will be a how-to-draw-whales workshop at 12:30 p.m., sea chanteys from 11  a.m. to 1 p.m. and a concert by the Black Label Story Band from 1 to 3 p.m.  </P> <P> Food will be available for sale or bring a family picnic and picnic in the  nearby park or on the sand, within view of the 60-foot humpback, of course.

			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / BBC offers rise below inflation THE BBC HAS angered unions by offering more than 25,000 staff an annual pay rise below the current rate of inflation. The corporation's offer for the year from the beginning of August is 3.7 per cent, with a guarantee that nobody will receive a rise worth less than Pounds 300. There is also a Pounds 75 increase in the London allowance, bringing it to Pounds 2,190. The deal would cost Pounds 21.5m a year on the BBC's pay bill of Pounds 590m. The pay offer, which applies to members of the Bectu broadcasting union, the NUJ journalists' union and the AEEU electricians' union, comes on the eve of a BBC governors and top management conference to consider the corporation's future role. Bectu, which represents about 14,000 BBC staff, asked for 3 percentage points more than inflation - at present 4.3 per cent - and a minimum salary of Pounds 7,500. Mr Neil Fraser, head of BBC Radio Scotland, is leaving the corporation after 24 years 'to pursue other programme interests', it was announced yesterday.</p>

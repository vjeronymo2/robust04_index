			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, January 12 (KCNA) -- The South Korean  puppets on January 8 worked out what they call "timetable for  establishing an agricultural policy" regarding rice market  opening and are making quite a noise as if the "committee for  the development of rural and fishing villages" which will be  formed by the end of this month would "increase the competitive  power of agriculture and fisheries" and "improve living  conditions in the rural and fishing villages."    Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says:    What they are doing is a disgusting act of a political  charlatan who causes illness and then administers medicine.    Since the puppets declared rice market opening, they must  take measures to block the unrestricted flooding of American  agricultural products such as building a higher customs barrier,  if they want to prevent losses from it. But a "meeting of  ministers concerned" of the puppet administration did not  discuss such active measures but put on the order of the day  "support" to agriculture through the collection of a new  "special tax" and establishment of an "advisory body". What  effect would such "measures" of the puppets have? In fact, this  is an act to cut the lifeline of the 6 million peasants by  market opening and kill all the people by forcing a "special  tax" on them under the pretext of "support" to them.    It is impossible that the traitor Kim Yong-sam, a top- class  flunkeyist who did not hesitate to open the rice market of South  Korea to win the favour of his U.S. master, takes a measure to  defend the South Korean peasants and agriculture in disregard of  the interests of his master.    The Kim Yong-sam group's talk about "measures" and the like  is aimed at creating the impression that it is concerned over  the peasants suffering losses and thus lulling their  ever-growing grievances and bridging over the worsening crisis  of its rule.</p>

			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Guardian Royal jumps to Pounds 751m - Investment gains, underwriting and lower UK claims boost insurer Increases in insurance rates, a reduction in claims in the UK, and investment gains, helped lift Guardian Royal Exchange, the smallest of the five composite insurance companies, to a pre-tax profit of Pounds 751m for 1993 against Pounds 150m last time. Excluding investment gains, the pre-tax figure came out at Pounds 183m against Pounds 3m in 1992. Earnings per share leapt from 13.2p to 74.5p. A 4.95p recommended final makes a full year payout of 7.6p, an 8.6 per cent increase. However, hints from the company that rates in some sectors of the UK market could soon begin to fall were badly received by investors, who marked the shares down 16p to close at 218p. Other insurance companies - which report their 1993 results over the next month - were also caught in the fall-out. 'The increase in worldwide premiums written from Pounds 2.24bn to Pounds 2.61bn indicates the success achieved in retaining a large quantity of business while increasing premium rates substantially,' said Mr Sid Hopkins, chief executive. GRE's three main overseas markets - Ireland, Germany, and the US  - all produced better results, but the improvement centred on the UK, from where GRE derives 43 per cent of its non-life premium income. Underwriting profits were achieved on a number of lines - including motor, home insurance and commercial property, and underwriting losses fell to Pounds 29m (Pounds 170m). Mr John Sinclair, head of UK operations, said: 'The improvement demonstrates the consistency of our approach in assesing risks, charging adequate premiums and scrutinising all claims carefully.' GRE would 'maintain its stance' even though 'regrettably there are signs of the market softening.' Mr Hopkins later reiterated GRE's determination not to 'follow the market down', stressing that the company had considerable scope to maintain or increase its premium income without reducing rates. A new direct insurance company - selling both motor and home insurance  - will begin operations later this year. GRE could also make further reductions in the amount of personal lines business it cedes to reinsurers by way of a quota share reinsurance treaty. Shareholders' funds at the end of 1993 amounted to 193p per share, a 47 per cent increase over the year. The solvency ratio - which measures shareholders' funds as a percentage of non-life premium income - amounted to 64 per cent (51 per cent). See Lex</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Arif Useynov: "Azerbaijan: Martyrs Needed"] </F>   [Text] Baku -- Former Azerbaijan President Abulfaz  Elchibey has once again loomed up on the political scene.  Admittedly, now as a national martyr. To put it bluntly, this  has been accomplished in a fairly original manner: Leading  opposition publications have submitted for the public verdict a  grand dedicatory anthem urging the nation not to stone  yesterday's idol.    The idea of his being stoned is a patent exaggeration. The  purpose of the article is simple: A People's Front leader with  a tarnished reputation makes the opposition unappealing, and  without that appeal there is every indication that it will be  hard to revive its lost image. Especially since parties and  their leaders do not currently enjoy popular support. That is  why they are trying to draw public attention to their "own  persona." This is the light in which one should view the rumors  of the alleged attempt on Elchibey's life, as well as opposition  newspapers' articles against President Geydar Aliyev.    Numerous articles are targeting the president's team. They  interpret the failures on the Karabakh front as demonstrating  the head of state's inability to ensure the people's safety and  the hard lot suffered by the 1 million refugees is presented as  the inevitable consequence of the "new Aliyev's" political  course.    According to one observer, the "newspaper war" is equal to  the Karabakh war. The president's meeting with the leaders of  political parties revealed an extremely dangerous trend:  Parties have become isolated from the masses and gotten carried  away by what is just political intrigue in the newspapers. In  an attempt to shout one another down 200 newspapers are vying in  denouncing the authorities for the most grievous offenses and  trying to outdo their opponents in terms of "perspicacity."    The hopes that Gaydar Aliyev would close down the political  publications in anger have not been realized. In this respect  the statement by a U.S. State Department spokesman, who rushed  to shout menacingly across the ocean about alleged violation of  press freedom in Azerbaijan, can only be compared to a "false  alarm." No one in the republic intends to ban opposition  newspapers.    Things banned by the law on the press have been banned.  Newspaper publishers and editors have been given strict  warnings: Wartime conditions have to be taken into consideration  -- they must not spread panic, engage in disinformation, or  divulge military secrets. To that end the National Assembly has  introduced military censorship. Georgia, incidentally, has done  the same in the past.    The law says that any fabrication may cause a publication to  be suspended for a month. If they do not like various actions  taken by the authorities, they can go ahead and criticize  individual points and individuals based on facts, but not on  fabrication.    However, there is nothing mysterious about the articles  carrying various rumors. There are definite forces behind each  "custom-made" article: Some are dying for power, some are  afraid of taking responsibility for crimes committed. After  all, a number of the recent denunciations in the republic relate  to thefts on a particularly grand scale: the illegal export of  hard currency, machinations with grain and food purchases, arms  dealing.    In a word, the "newspaper war" is least of all to do with an  upsurge in political activity. Many political scientists think  that the "unmasking" of every smart operator is accompanied by a  "newspaper fusillade." But this time the opposition has  miscalculated. The concentration of fire on "headquarters" has  failed to hit its target: The authorities have not flinched,  and the people have not rushed off to rallies.    As for the dedicatory anthem to the ex-president, "Don't  Stone an Idol," this work has disappeared without trace. A  popular singer has translated it into English and sings it  country-and-western style with a saxophone and flute  accompaniment. It has been a real hit. As they say, it is just  one step from the sublime to the ridiculous.</p>

This shows that the central  authorities will further speed up the pace of peaceful  reunification of the two sides of the strait by strengthening  the roles of international contacts.    The source said that when talking about the work concerning  Taiwan affairs some days ago, a high-level central leader  emphasized the necessity of gaining a realistic understanding of  the new changes in Taiwan's current situation, such as the  resignations of senior party, government, and military leaders  of the older generation and the fact that the second generation  of leaders are in power. The new generation of leaders are  different from the senior leaders of the older generation in  their relations with the mainland. The leaders of the older  generation have a thousand and one links with the mainland but  have a stronger anti-communist sense. The leaders of the second  generation have fewer links with the mainland and also a weak  anti-communist sense. Instead, they have a stronger sense of  being content to exercise sovereignty over a part of the  country. We cannot say that they are all advocating "Taiwan  independence."    The high-level central leader held that under the new  situation, work concerning Taiwan does not mean mere contacts  with the Kuomintang [KMT]. It is necessary to contact various  political parties and factions in Taiwan, including the  Democratic Progressive Party. The central leader reiterated the  following three principles will never change in work concerning  Taiwan: The principle that there is only one China; the  principle of resolving the Taiwan issue in a form of "one  country, two systems"; and the principle of not promising to  give up forces in resolving the Taiwan issue, especially under  the situation that foreign powers are interfering in Taiwan's  internal affairs or when separation or independence issues  appear in Taiwan.    Referring to the development of cross-strait economic  relations and trade, the central leader said: Judging from  current developments, as some big projects invested by Taiwanese  businessmen are not coordinated with the planning and deployment  of the central authorities and the relevant departments in  charge do not have effective coordination mechanisms and  corresponding policies, making the approval procedures rather  complicated and time-consuming, there are still difficulties for  Taiwanese businessmen to come to invest in the mainland. These  are also problems to be resolved.    The following are decisions made by a recent joint meeting  of  various central departments concerned, which was presided over  by the high-level central leader:    1. A national conference on economic work relating to Taiwan  will be held this coming spring to work out special documents on  some special subjects, the substantive contents of which have  been discussed many times.    2. It is proposed that a coordination group for economic  relations and trade with Taiwan is established under the State  Council.    3. To adopt "preferential and special policies on special  issues" toward Taiwanese businessmen. In comparison with the  existing policies on foreign investment, more preferential  treatment will be given to Taiwanese investors. In some spheres  the policies can be further relaxed, and there will be no  restrictions on some projects regarding their distribution and  planning.    4. To work out laws to protect Taiwanese investors.    5. To agree in principle to the establishment of  Taiwan-funded banks; to satisfy as far as possible the needs of  Taiwan-funded enterprises for funds in terms of the renminbi.    6. To make positive efforts to promote cross-strait  cooperation in the fields of science and technology and  agriculture and encourage Taiwanese businessmen to invest in  mainland agricultural production. For example, when they have  invested in establishment of farms to produce grain, the  issuance of export licenses will be taken into consideration.    7. On the issue of export of labor to Taiwan, a unified  policy will be worked out by the State Council's Taiwan Affairs  Office and the matter will be taken care by the Ministry of  Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation [MOFTEC] in a unified  way. The ARATS [Association for Relations Across the Taiwan  Strait] will be authorized to consult and sign contracts with  the other side, and concrete affairs will be handled by  qualified labor companies. MOFTEC [Ministry of Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation] will not handle concrete affairs  concerning labor exports to Taiwan.</p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Market testing to be accelerated THE GOVERNMENT is to introduce legislation to speed up its market testing initiative designed to open government services to bids from the private sector. Mr William Waldegrave, public services minister, said the legislation would end anomalies that have prevented market testing from being applied to a wider range of services. Under current law, a range of government functions - including pension administration, the processing of trade statistics and various prison and local authority functions - cannot be delegated by ministers to anyone but a civil servant. The government is expected to include the proposals in the deregulation bill it is planning for the next parliamentary session beginning in November. Mr Waldegrave confirmed that the second tranche of the market-testing programme will affect close to Pounds 1bn of services and not up to Pounds 2bn as originally intended. At least a third of the first programme, covering Pounds 1.5bn of services, was not completed by the deadline last week. Mr Waldegrave said the government had not embarked on its market testing programme because it doubted the abilities of public service personnel but because it was 'only through the benign magic of comparison and competition that we can get the best services and the best value'. He also echoed chancellor Kenneth Clarke's recent warnings of a tough public spending round ahead. 'The government and its supporters face an absolutely crucial test over the next six months,' he said. Mr John Selwyn Gummer, the environment secretary, said yesterday that he was revising the criteria by which local authorities can judge applications for planning permission, with the aim of improving architectural standards in Britain's cities and rural areas. Mr Gummer gave no specific details, but he was particularly scathing of the building of out-of-town shopping centres.</p>

			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UCLA'S YOUNG SHOULD HAVE ACTED HIS AGE  </P> <P> The televised picture of UCLA Chancellor Charles Young running along the  sideline and ranting at the officials during last Saturday's football game with  Arizona defined his mission and his campus more clearly than all the publicity  releases and promotional films that the school can ever issue. The list of  great university educators now includes Woody Hayes, Bob Knight, Bo  Schembechler, Barry Switzer, Jerry Tarkanian and Charles Young.  </P> <P> RONALD L.

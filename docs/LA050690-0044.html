			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROS AND CONS OF 'DR. GRIMES' BITTER PILL'  </P> <P> Regarding the very long article on Dr. Grimes, what a sad commentary on our  civilization that such a talented and accomplished doctor is using his medical  knowledge to extinguish life rather than save it.  </P> <P> It was especially disturbing to read that the doctor and his wife couldn't  stand to see his first hospitalized pediatric patient die, but that it doesn't  bother them to see a life snuffed out with the use of the RU-486 pill or other  means.  </P> <P> EMMA P.

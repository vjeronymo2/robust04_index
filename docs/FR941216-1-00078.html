			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (4) Locations, with or without lightning protection, where operations involving unprotected electro-explosive devices or circuitry are being performed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) A qualified person in authority should make the final decision about evacuation. When special warning is required for shutdown, volunteer observers or a detector (lightning detection system) may be used. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) All personnel shall evacuate to locations identified in the SOP. These locations shall be at unbarricaded intraline distance or greater, or in a shelter providing equivalent protection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;184.26  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Explosives in process during shutdown. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When electrical storms cause evacuation of explosives buildings, operations requiring constant attention shall be manned by the minimum number of personnel consistent with safety requirements. Once the process has reached a condition in which it is considered safe to leave, the building shall be completely evacuated. Explosives processes requiring constant attention should not be started when an electrical storm threatens. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;184.27  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Maintenance and repairs to equipment and buildings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) All new or newly repaired explosives processing equipment shall be examined and tested to ensure that it is in safe working condition before being placed in service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Before repairs can proceed on equipment exposed to explosives, a decontamination tag, signed by supervisory personnel, shall be placed on the equipment. The tag shall certify all explosives have been removed from the equipment or identify parts that could not be cleaned, and shall provide maintenance personnel with instructions on safe handling. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Major repairs or changes shall not be undertaken in a building during regular operations until the hazardous material has been removed and the employee in charge of the building informed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Repairs cannot start in an explosives location until all explosives have been removed from equipment, crevices, areas beneath floors, within walls and pipes, and under fittings where explosives could be ignited. The entire area should be wetted or washed down thoroughly. An inspection of the immediate vicinity shall assure no explosives remain. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) After repairing, maintaining or adjusting machines and equipment, an inspection shall be made to assure all tools used for the work are removed. Before work resumes, operators should check their own equipment to ensure its safe operating condition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Electricians shall not wear conductive shoes while working on electrical equipment. Exposed explosives and other static-sensitive hazardous material shall be removed before work begins. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Safe practices specified elsewhere in this part shall also apply to maintenance employees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Maintenance and tool rooms in an operating line should be separated from explosives by intraline distance. Protection equivalent to that afforded by a suitable barrier shall be provided when this proves impractical. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;184.28  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Safety hand-tools. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Hand tools constructed of wood or materials such as bronze, lead, and ``K'' Monel metal shall be used for work in locations that contain exposed explosives or hazardous concentrations of flammable dusts, gases, or vapors. While safer, the nonferrous metals used in so-called non-sparking tools may produce sparks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) If their strength makes the use of ferrous metal hand tools necessary, exposed explosives and other highly combustible materials shall be removed from the area as required in &sect;184.27 (b) through (d). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;184.29  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Operational shields. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The purpose of operational shields is to prevent propagation of explosions from one explosives operation or location to another, to protect facilities and equipment and to provide personnel protection. Therefore, all A&amp;E operations and processes shall be assessed prior to work performance to determine the type of hazard involved, the level of risk associated with the A&amp;E material or item, and the corresponding level of protection normally provided. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The primary hazards that accompany explosions and deflagrations are potential blast overpressure, fragmentation (primary and secondary), and thermal effects. These hazards and the following factors shall be considered, as a minimum, during the above assessment: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Initiation sensitivity, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Potential ignition sources, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Quantity of A&amp;E, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Rate of burning, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) A&amp;E and personnel resource exposures, and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Protection capabilities of shields. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) When analysis of these factors indicates an unacceptable probability of explosion or deflagration, resources shall be dedicated to additional protection for personnel and equipment. If operational shields are selected for this purpose, they shall be tested prior to installation to assure compliance with the following criteria: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Prevent propagation due to blast overpressure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Contain all fragmentation or direct fragments (primary and secondary) away from areas requiring protection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Contain thermal effects to prevent propagation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

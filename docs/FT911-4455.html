			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Trusthouse Forte Trusthouse Forte has clearly been wondering how to restore its reputation. Last year's trading performance was somewhat better than expected, even if earnings were slightly worse. For trading profits from the hotels division to fall by only 5 per cent was impressive and occupancy rates are recovering steadily. But this was not enough to reverse the downward drift of its shares, which in relative terms are where they were five years ago. The group is shortly to begin a branding exercise on its hotel chains, suggesting that even after the success of the Crest acquisition, it has finally recognised its domestic limitations. But while THF might improve its act at the detailed level, it is too early to say that long-standing strategic questions have been answered by the Pounds 700m invested over the last three years. The recent deal with Repsol in Spain will eventually strengthen THF's continental portfolio, but it is still feeble compared with that of Queens Moat. It is small comfort to know the Gulf profits effect was only Pounds 12m in December and January. The figure could be as much as Pounds 30m for February-March, so this year will not be one to remember. The group could conceivably make Pounds 175m before tax, putting the shares at 268p on a demanding rating of 16. As with so many other stocks, the market is looking two years out, where the rating is more tolerable assuming a profits bounce to Pounds 220m. But on the evidence so far, Ladbroke and Queens Moat are better recovery plays.</p>

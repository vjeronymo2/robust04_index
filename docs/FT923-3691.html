			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / International Company News: Hughes Aircraft restructuring to cut 4,000 jobs HUGHES Aircraft, a unit of GM Hughes Electronics, said it would cut at least 4,000 production jobs and relocate 2,000 others, Reuter reports from California. The consolidation, which involves mainly missile production lines recently acquired from General Dynamics Corp goes beyond the 9,000 job reduction the company announced in June. Mr David McPherson, a Hughes vice-president, said an undetermined number of engineering jobs would also be cut. He would not comment on whether the new round of consolidations would result in extra restructuring charges. Southern California will lose at least 6,000 jobs in the consolidation, as all missile production is consolidated in existing plants in Tucson, Arizona. LTV Corporation, the large steel group, confirmed it would relocate its corporate headquarter operations to Cleveland and close its Dallas headquarters at the end of the year.</p>

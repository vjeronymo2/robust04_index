			<p>Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] The parliamentary delegation now in Washington,  does not have an official mandate from the parliament.  Therefore, it cannot in any way commit the institution in its  consultations or in any plans or proposals for a solution to the  crisis, assert the legislators from the Alliance for  Parliamentary Cohesion, ACP, notably Senators Dejean Belizaire,  Ebrane Cadet, and Thomas Eddy Dupiton. Neither can this  delegation discuss the country's future, according to Senators  Belizaire, Cadet, and Dupiton. Daly Valet filed a report:    [Begin recording] [Valet, in Creole] The parliamentary  delegation which is holding negotiations in the United States on  Haiti's political crisis, has no mandate to negotiate on behalf  of the parliament. This is the position of some senators of the  ACP, who indicate that the Senate never met in a formal session  to give a mandate to some senators to negotiate for the purpose  of making a commitment on the nation's future. Furthermore,  Senator Firmin Jean-Louis is no longer the Senate's president,  according to Engineer Dejean Belizaire. Senator Thomas Eddy  Dupiton maintains the same thing. According to him, it is on  their own behalf and not on behalf of the parliament that the  legislators went to discuss national politics in Washington.    [Dupiton, in Creole] I am reacting once more regarding the  delegation. In the parliamentary practices that we observe  here, any delegation traveling receives a mission from the  assembly.    Several times, even in the case of President Sansaricq, when  you asked if he traveled on an official trip, we said no, he  traveled on private visit.    That means there can be no formal decisions that commit the  parliament, because the assembly had no knowledge of the trip.    [In French] The entire assembly had no knowledge of the  trip. The senator spoke with some other senators, telling them  that he was traveling. We recognize that he is an eminent  political personality who has the right to establish some  political contacts during this trip abroad, some contacts that  could be beneficial for the Senate and Haiti. But he will  return to share that with the parliament before any deeper  commitment. One should believe the same thing for the other  delegations. They cannot return with a solution that commits  Haitian sovereignty.    [Valet, in Creole] Ebrane Cadet, first secretary in the  office of Firmin Jean-Louis office and also first secretary in  that of Bernard Sansaricq, goes further in his thoughts. Along  with the fact that no one was mandated to negotiate on behalf of  the parliament, he adds that those talks and travels here and  there will not bring any positive results for Haiti. Senator  Ebrane Cadet cited as examples the failure in Cartagena, the  failure of the Washington agreement, and the failure of the  negotiations resulting in the Governors Island accord. The  senator is very pessimistic. [passage omitted]. [end recording]</p>

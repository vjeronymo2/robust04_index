			<p>BFN     [Text] A Russian Government official has denied media  reports that Russian Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets,  during his recent visit to Syria, had discussed writing off part  of that country's debt to Russia.    The matter was not brought up at all at the Damascus talks,  Sergey Sidorkov, head of the Russian Government's Department for  Defense Industries and Defense Conversion, who accompanied  Soskovets on his Syrian trip, told INTERFAX. Moreover, Syria  agreed to pay for its orders to Russian enterprises in advance,  he said. But all such matters -- the volume of, and schedules  for, supplies to Syria, including those of spares for armaments  already sold to Damascus, payment procedures, etc., -- will be  handled by a special intergovernmental commission, he said.    Sidorkov said no concrete plans for Russian arms sales to  Syria had been negotiated during Soskovets's visit.    The bulk of Syria's $10-billion debt to Russia is in arrears  for weapons bought from the Soviet Union in the 1970's and  1980's. Syria is willing to pay the debt to Russia as the  Soviet Union's legal successor.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Maintaining peace and security is the biggest  challenge faced by countries in the region. The defense  minister, Dr. Yeo Ning Hong, made this point at the airpower  conference held in Australia today. He said the ability to  manage tensions could prevent the Asia-Pacific from turning into  a basin of turbulence and conflict. Dr. Yeo pointed out that  the outlook in the region is not an entirely rosy one, with  North Korea's nuclear ambition and the dispute over the  Spratlys. With the uncertainties ahead, having a strong defense  capability is important for each country. Dr. Yeo stressed that  the relationship between the U.S., Japan, and China are  instrumental to regional stability.</p>

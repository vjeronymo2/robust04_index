It said that the act was especially offensive as it  was committed in a mosque.    "We hope the United Nations will conduct a full  investigation  and deploy a peacekeeping force in order to preserve peace and  protect the Palestinians who are vulnerable to armed Israeli  settlers." The perpetrators should be tried, said the party in  the statement signed by acting president Atan Rafie.    The statement comes in the wake of internal divisions and  power struggles within the party. [passage omitted]</p>

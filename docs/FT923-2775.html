			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / People: Stevenson to replace Stormonth Darling Peter Stormonth Darling, the chairman of Mercury Asset Management, is retiring in November after 14 years in the post. He is to be replaced by Hugh Stevenson (right), one of three directors in SG Warburg's investment banking division and the mastermind of MAM's public flotation in 1987. Stormonth Darling says that having reached 60, the 'normal' retirement age of MAM directors, he will relinquish his post but intends to remain a non-executive director. His retirement has been planned since the turn of the year and, he says, is not in any way connected with the well-publicised departure several weeks ago of Leonard Licht, deputy chairman and a star of MAM's fund management team. Stevenson becomes the first chairman of MAM, Britain's largest fund management group, never to have worked as a fund manager. 'I would say that on the whole, fund managers are not very good at managing businesses,' he says. He had been a MAM board member and a member of its policy committee since 1986. His main priority will be to 'maintain the continuity of the business in terms of staff and strategy'. Despite widespread press speculation of unhappiness within the ranks of MAM senior executives, Stevenson says that the group's entire management team is unchanged from that at flotation five years ago and that more senior executives have joined in recent months than have left. Stevenson will be assisted by a new executive committee, consisting of deputy chairmen David Price and Stephen Zimmerman, Carol Galley, Nigel Hurst-Brown, David Rosier and Lord Cairns.</p>

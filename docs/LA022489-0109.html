			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH COURT BANS USE OF BAR'S MANDATORY DUES FOR BALLOT RACES  </P> <P> The California Supreme Court ruled unanimously Thursday that the State Bar may  not spend the compulsory dues paid by lawyers on election campaigning for the  justices or other candidates and measures on the ballot.  </P> <P> However, the court also ruled in a separate 4-3 vote that the Bar may use such  funds for a broad range of other, non-election activities -- such as lobbying  for legislation, filing advisory briefs in court and adopting stands on  political issues. Such activity is permissible so long as it promotes "the  improvement of the administration of justice," Justice Allen E. Broussard wrote  for the court majority.  </P> <P> The ruling came in a widely watched test of the constitutional rights of the  state's 110,000 lawyers, all of whom are required to join the Bar in order to  practice law in California and now pay $417 a year in dues.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Partial Victory  </P> <P> The decision was a limited victory for a group of 21 prosecutors and lawyers  who filed suit seven years ago contending that the Bar was violating their  First Amendment rights by using their money to support candidates and causes  they oppose.  </P> <P> The justices agreed with the attorneys that the Bar improperly used their dues  in a "public education" program in support of four high court members who  successfully sought voter confirmation in the 1982 general election.  </P> <P> The court cited the widespread distribution of a speech made three months  before the election by Los Angeles attorney Anthony Murray, who was Bar  president at the time. While Murray did not mention the justices by name, he  denounced what he called the "idiotic cries of . . . self-appointed vigilantes  and unscrupulous politicians" who were opposing retention of the four jurists.  </P> <P> The "nature and timing" of the speech's publication indicated it was meant to  "assist in the election campaign on behalf of the justices," Broussard wrote.  </P> <P> The Bar, with special power to regulate the legal profession, is closely akin  to a "governmental agency," and thus by law cannot spend money on election  campaign ing, he wrote.  </P> <P> Ironically, it was Broussard -- along with then-Justices Frank K. Richardson,  Otto M. Kaus and Cruz Reynoso -- who were candidates for retention in the 1982  election. The Bar did not participate in the 1986 election in which Reynoso,  Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird and Justice Joseph R. Grodin were defeated by  the voters.  </P> <P> Broussard's opinion was joined by Justices Stanley Mosk and John R. Arguelles  and Appellate Justice Clinton W. White, sitting by special appointment.  </P> <P> In dissent, Justice Marcus M. Kaufman agreed that the Bar's involvement in the  1982 election was improper but said the majority was wrong in concluding that  its other political activities posed no threat to the rights of free speech and  association of dues-paying Bar members.  </P> <P> "Resistance to coerced association and intolerance of government-enforced  support of philosophical, religious, political causes animated the founding of  our nation and the drafting of its Constitution," Kaufman wrote in an opinion  joined by Justice Edward A. Panelli and Appellate Justice Nat A. Agliano,  sitting by special appointment.  </P> <P> Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas and Justice David N. Eagleson did not  participate in the case.  </P> <P> State Bar President Colin W. Wied of San Diego welcomed the decision, saying  the court had recognized "the important public purpose of our administration of  justice functions."  </P> <P> The Bar remains free to take stands on any issues related to the administration  of justice, Wied said. "But if it's on the ballot, we can't talk about it," he  said.  </P> <P> Wied noted that the ruling will not prevent lawyers from individual  participation in the political process, nor will it prohibit local bar  associations, with voluntary memberships, from endorsing candidates for  judicial office.  </P> <P> Anthony T. Caso of the Pacific Legal Foundation, an attorney representing the  lawyers who challenged the Bar's use of dues for political activity, said he  was "very pleased" the court banned Bar involvement in election campaigning.  But he expressed dismay with that part of the decision allowing a wide range of  other activity.  </P> <P> "In the past, the Bar's Conference of Delegates had taken positions on a  nuclear freeze, handgun control, prison conditions and environmental concerns,"  Caso said. "Now, with this decision, they're not going to feel at all  restrained . . . about furthering their own political and ideological concerns  at the expense of the members."  </P> <P> State Deputy Atty. Gen. Eddie T. Keller, the lead plaintiff in the suit against  the Bar, said it was likely the ruling would be appealed to the U.S. Supreme  Court. "The constitutional issues in the case may be ripe for a decision up  there," he said.  </P> <P> The case arose when Keller and the other attorneys filed suit in Sacramento  Superior Court against the Bar and its Board of Governors, a 22-member group  that supervises the Bar and its testing, licensing and discipline of  California's lawyers.  </P> <P> A trial court dismissed the suit. In 1986, however, a state Court of Appeal in  Sacramento reinstated the action, finding that the distribution of Murray's  speech and other material amounted to election campaigning and thus violated  the rights of members whose dues were used to finance the education program.  </P> <P> Broussard, in the 35-page majority opinion, ruled that because the Bar was more  like a governmental agency than a labor union, it was free to use any of its  funds for lobbying, public education or other activity so long as it does not  engage in election campaigns.  </P> <P> Ruling on another issue in the case, the court held that members of the Bar's  Board of Governors may not be held personally liable for reimbursement of the  unauthorized expenditures made in the 1982 election.  </P></p>

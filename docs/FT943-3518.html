			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Clinton calls for campaign 'to roll back tide of violence' President Bill Clinton yesterday signed into law the anti-crime bill that finally passed both houses of Congress last month after a protracted and partisan battle. The bill will provide federal money to help hire more police officers, stiffen sentences for a variety of offences and tighten controls on some assault guns. But it also offers money for community development corporations, improvements to city parks and recreation facilities and studies on sexual assault on college campuses and 'battered women's syndrome'. 'Let us roll up our sleeves and roll back this awful tide of violence,' Mr Clinton said in a White House ceremony to mark the signing. He called the bill 'a big step toward bringing the laws of our land back in line with the values of our people'. However, the legislation is expected to damage US efforts to comply with its obligations under a number of international human rights conventions by increasing prison overcrowding and by placing the US further outside international norms for treatment of juvenile offenders. The bill coincides with the publication yesterday of a compliance report for the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, which the US ratified in 1992, 15 years after it was first signed by President Jimmy Carter and 26 years after its unanimous adoption by the United Nations. In the preface to the report, Mr John Shattuck, assistant secretary of state for human rights, acknowledges 'areas of concern' including police brutality, the treatment of prisoners and the death penalty. The US maintained a reservation to the covenant's ban on the execution of juvenile offenders and joins only Bangladesh, Iran, Iraq, Nigeria and Pakistan in continuing to apply the death penalty in some states for crimes committed by juveniles.</p>

This has  been achieved as the result of the competent, dedicated work of  the expert satellite and optical-link researchers at the Jose  Antonio Echeverria Superior Polytechnical School in Havana City.    A relevant fact was that at the first interactive conference  in February, outstanding experts of the Medical Sciences  Institute received a live satellite signal, enabling them to  observe three top scientific-level surgeries.    During the Hispasat satellite transmissions, a doctor  observing one of the complex surgeries was able to answer  questions on the patient's health condition.</p>

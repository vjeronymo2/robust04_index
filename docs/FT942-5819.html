			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Platinum market moves into balance The platinum market, having suffered a supply surplus for some years, is now moving back into balance. Prices should show strong gains during the next 18 months and consolidated in a range between Dollars 450 and Dollars 500 a troy ounce, according to analyst Ms Rhona O'Connell in a special report for T Hoare and Co. Platinum closed last night in London at Dollars 401.90 an ounce. Ms O'Connell points out that there is an estimated 700,000 ounces of annual platinum production capacity in South Africa alone that could be brought into operation if prices were right. But she suggests prices will not go high enough to trigger all of this. Nevertheless, she would 'not be at all surprised to see Impala reinstate shelved expansion plans and Rustenburg implement its Lebowa expansion or, more importantly, expand output at the low-cost PP Rust mine.' Mr O'Connell suggests, however, that even higher prices will not save Gold Fields of South Africa's new Northam mine which is likely to be closed because of technical mining problems. If Northam does remain open there would be a platinum supply surplus of 136,000 ounces this year, she forecasts, and one of 54,000 ounces in 1995. Ms O'Connell points out that investment activity over the past six years has accounted for 328,000 ounces annually and the lowest level in 1989 was 160,000 ounces. 'In theory, therefore, the market should start to see above-gound, industrial stocks drawn down during this year and, all other things being equal, for that drawdown to be relentless.'</p>

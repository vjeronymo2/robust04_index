			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S., AUSSIES FIRE ON AND BOARD IRAQ SHIP  </P> <P> U.S. and Australian naval ships fired warning shots and halted an Iraqi tanker  in the Gulf of Oman today as part of the effort to enforce trading sanctions  against Iraq, the Pentagon said.  </P> <P> A joint boarding party from the two ships -- the United States' Brewton and  Australia's Darwin -- boarded the tanker Al-Fao to identify its cargo before it  was permitted to proceed to its destination.  </P> <P> "A joint boarding party . . . boarded the tanker, conducted a coordinated  investigation and determined that the ship contained no prohibited cargo," the  Pentagon said in a statement.  </P> <P> The Iraqi ship was permitted to proceed to its destination -- the Iraqi port of  Basra -- nearly five hours after the first shots were fired, the Pentagon said.  </P> <P> President Bush confirmed that the incident occurred but gave few details during  an impromptu session with reporters at the White House.  </P> <P> Bush said the action was taken "in accordance with the United Nations  resolutions, in accordance with the sanctions."  </P> <P> The President said the shots were fired because "it required a bit of a warning  before the captain pulled over and permitted the boarding party to have a  look."  </P> <P> Asked if today's events placed the United States any closer to a war with Iraq,  Bush said:  </P> <P> "I wouldn't put it closer to a war situation. I still hope that this matter can  be peacefully resolved. And the way for that to happen is for Iraq to comply  with the sanctions."  </P> <P> The incident was the third in the effort to put a stranglehold on Iraqi  shipping.  </P> <P> The first shots were fired on Aug. 18, when U.S. Navy ships attempted to halt  two Iraqi tankers from departing the Persian Gulf region. However, neither of  those ships was boarded.  </P></p>

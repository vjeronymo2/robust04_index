			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DAVID STIRLING; STARTED BRITAIN'S WWII SPECIAL AIR SERVICE UNIT  </P> <P> David Stirling, who founded Britain's elite Special Air Service in World War  II, a unit that relied on stealth and skill to kill Germans and, years later,  to free hostages, has died, his biographer reported.  </P> <P> Stirling was 74 when he died Sunday night in the London Clinic after what Alan  Hoe, a former SAS major and Stirling's biographer, described only as a long  illness.  </P> <P> The SAS, whose motto is "Who Dares Wins," has maintained its reputation for  swift, clandestine and effective action. One of its more recent exploits was  its assault on the Iranian Embassy in London on May 5, 1980, to end a siege by  gunmen holding hostages.  </P> <P> Born Archibald David Stirling, the son of a Scottish brigadier general, he  joined the Scots Guards at the outbreak of World War II. Six months later he  transferred to No. 3 commando group of the Brigade of Guards and went with them  to the Middle East.  </P> <P> He persuaded military authorities that "an army within an army" was needed to  make swift, secret raids against the enemy. They gave him six officers and 60  enlisted men to try out his theories in the Western Desert.  </P> <P> Stirling became known as the "Phantom Major" among the German troops of Field  Marshal Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps after destroying 250 enemy aircraft and  scores of fuel and ammunition dumps in attacks on the enemy rear.  </P> <P> His tactics of operating so far behind German lines that his men could  virtually walk into their targets -- and then "retreating" even farther into  enemy territory against all expectations -- helped gain him legendary status.  </P> <P> In 1943, Stirling was taken prisoner in Tunisia. He escaped, was recaptured and  was transferred to Colditz Castle prison camp, where he remained for the rest  of the war.  </P></p>

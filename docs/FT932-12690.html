			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: Societe Generale de Belgique raise stake in Generale de Banque SOCIETE Generale de Belgique, Belgium's largest holding company, has raised its stake in Generale de Banque, the country's largest bank, from 21 to 26 per cent, writes Andrew Hill. The purchase of 750,000 of the bank's shares from Fortis, the Belgian-Dutch financial services group, is another step in La Generale's attempt to dilute its exposure to Europe's weak industrial economy. Fortis, which groups the activities of AG of Belgium and Amev of the Netherlands, sold almost all its stake in Generale de Banque at the end of last week at below market price, cutting its holding from 14.7 per cent to 1.77 per cent. Smith New Court placed 1m shares - the largest part of the stake - with 30 international institutional investors. A further 140,000 were acquired by Sofina, a Belgian investment holding company, which now owns a 1.5 per cent stake.</p>

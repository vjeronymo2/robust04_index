			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(3) appears to grand discretion to the State regulatory authority regarding the provision of training assistance that is now allowed by section 507(c)(2) of SMCRA. However, section 507(c)(2) specifically references only ``the Secretary.'' OSM currently interprets ``the Secretary'' to mean the Secretary of the Interior, and not State regulatory authorities. Therefore, North Dakota's proposed statutory language at NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(3) is acceptable and it is unnecessary for North Dakota to revise proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(3) to be substantively identical to section 507(c)(2) of SMCRA. However, if North Dakota ultimately decides to adopt the responsibility to provide or assume the training costs and inform qualified coal operators of the availability of assistance under SOAP, NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(3), because of its discretionary nature, will be less stringent than section 507(c)(2) of SMCRA. North Dakota will then be required to amend its program to mandate that the Commission ``shall'' provide or assume the costs of training and inform qualified coal operators of the availability of assistance under SOAP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, on the basis of the discussion above, proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(3) is no less stringent than section 507(c)(2) of SMCRA. For the reasons discussed above, the Director is approving proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(3). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> i.

Since the North Dakota proposal only refers to services provided under NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2), it does not encompass any training assistance that may have been provided under NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(3). By comparison, the Federal provision at section 507(h) of SMCRA requires operators, under such circumstances, to reimburse the regulatory authority for the cost of any training assistance provided by the regulatory authority, as well as for the cost of other services provided or funded by the regulatory authority under the SOAP program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> North Dakota, in a letter dated December 3, 1993 (administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;15), acknowledged that proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(4) does not require the reimbursement of training costs in accordance with section 507(h) of SMCRA, and stated that it will propose the necessary statutory change in the next North Dakota legislative session. Moreover, North Dakota stated that if proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(4) were approved, as submitted, the State would not provide or assume the cost of training any small operator until such time as the statutory revisions are made. As discussed in Finding No. 3(h) above, OSM currently interprets section 507(c)(2) of SMCRA to require that the Secretary of the Interior, and not the State regulatory authority, provide or assume the cost of training coal operators and, in accordance with that interpretation, North Dakota is not obligated to do so. However, should North Dakota decide to provide training as a result of revising proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(3) discussed above, and use SOAP funds to do so in accordance with 30 CFR 795.5, the failure of proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(34) to require the reimbursement of training costs to the Commission will be less stringent than the requirements of section 507(h) of SMCRA. Nevertheless, since North Dakota has stated that it will not provide or assume the cost of such training until full reimbursement of the cost of all SOAP assistance is statutorily required, the Director finds that NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(4), as proposed, is no less stringent than section 507(h) of SMCRA, and is approving it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

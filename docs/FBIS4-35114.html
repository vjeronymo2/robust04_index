			<p>BFN     [Text] About 30 light planes were reportedly detected or  intercepted during the time U.S. radar installations to help  drug enforcement were operating, but clandestine drug flights  allegedly total over 10,000 per year.    This was announced by Congressman Julio Castro Gomez (MDI)  [Democratic Left Movement], who presides over the subcommittee  that investigates this crime.    The U.S. radars were installed in Yurimaguas and Andoas  about  two years ago.    Castro Gomez said the military chief of the Upper Huallaga  emergency zone had stated that 10,000 trafficking planes enter  the country every year.    He added that the capture of trafficker Demetrio Chavez  Penaherrera, aka "Vaticano," has not decreased the flow of drugs  despite the belief that Chavez controlled the trafficking  industry.    Castro Gomez said: "The quantity of cocaine base and cocaine  hydrochloride leaving the country has not changed."    He announced the arrival of U.S. State Department officials  who will meet with local officials and explain the suspension of  the U.S. cooperation provided by the radar installations.    He recalled that this support ended on 1 May when the  Yurimaguas and Andoas radar installations stopped sending  information to the Peruvian Air Force on planes entering  Peruvian airspace.    [EL COMERCIO] Have trafficking flights increased since the  radar stopped operating?    [Castro Gomez] Obviously, the lack of a means to detect  flights makes it easier for trafficking gangs to operate, taking  drugs out and bringing weapons and dollars in. The U.S. State  Department officials should have come here first before making  the decision to ended the cooperation. I believe the time has  come to evaluate that mechanism for drug enforcement in the  country.    [EL COMERCIO] How many tonnes of drugs are transported?    [Castro Gomez] We believe between 1,500 and 2,000 tonnes  leave the country every year.    [EL COMERCIO] How much does that represent in money?    [Castro Gomez] A very large amount. About $1.3 to $1.5  billion enters the country for the sale of cocaine base and  byproducts.    [EL COMERCIO] Does that enter our free exchange market?    [Castro Gomez] Yes. It enters the free exchange market where  the Central Bank and the commercial banks also operate. We have  a narco dollar-ridden economy which depletes the competitivity  of our exports and keeps the dollar rate low.    Castro Gomez recognizes that the radar installations forced  traffickers to change their behavior.    [EL COMERCIO] How did they change?    [Castro Gomez] They stopped flying during the day and began  flying at night even though night flights are also detected by  radar. Now the actions of our Air Force are restricted because  it does not have the night flying equipment for its Tucano  planes.    [EL COMERCIO] Has an investigation been carried out about  the  alleged support given to traffickers by some officials?    [Castro Gomez] Some Air Force personnel in charge of  airports  in the emergency zone provided support. They have been charged  with trafficking. They allowed light planes to land and take off  after receiving their "share" from the traffickers.    [EL COMERCIO] Are we facing an endless problem?    [Castro Gomez] It is a problem. Traffickers corrupt because  of their large profits and huge recourses. Overall formulas to  deal with it and defeat it must be sought.</p>

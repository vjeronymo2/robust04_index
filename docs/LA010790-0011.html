			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC'S CORNER  </P> <P> CBS began the '80s as the No. 1 network and begins the '90s as No. 3. The way  things are going for the feisty Fox network, CBS could end the century as No.  4. It's been a decade of humiliation for the one-time Tiffany's of television.  "There is now no part of the CBS program schedule that is not hemorrhaging,"  notes Daily Variety, the show-biz trade paper.  </P> <P> As a result, you may be seeing more obits for CBS than cover stories about  Arsenio Hall -- and that's a heap o' press. But Howard Stringer, president of  CBS Broadcast Group, claims a lot of the doomsaying about CBS is mere  "mythology" and that prosperity is just around the corner.  </P> <P> "We're thinking pretty sneakily confident at the moment that we've got things  under control," Stringer says.  </P> <P> What's his ray of hope? One of them is Jeff Sagansky, the Hollywood big shot  who's just left the presidency of Tri-Star Pictures to take over CBS  Entertainment. "I am thrilled with him," says Stringer. "I couldn't be  happier."  </P> <P> Hollywood seems to be happy too. Sagansky's predecessor, Kim LeMasters, was  unpopular with some producers, industry sources say. Sagansky, 37, is a  well-liked take-charge guy.  </P> <P> In early interviews, Sagansky, 37, sounds like a man who knows precisely what  the network's problems are. A "sense of showmanship" has been lost, he told one  reporter. "Everything is too low-key here. The shows are too safe. There's no  excitement," Sagansky said.  </P> <P> Stringer concedes he's right. CBS already has canceled a third of its new fall  lineup. One of Sagansky's first official acts was to kill "Snoops," the Friday  night snooze. "Some of the shows were too traditional," Stringer says. "We  didn't take enough risks. We didn't reach out the way we should have."  </P> <P> CBS has not introduced a big hit series since "Murder, She Wrote" in 1984. And  that is a show that appeals mainly to viewers over 34, when it's the  18-to-34-year-olds that are most desirable to advertisers.  </P> <P> Not only does CBS claim better days are just ahead, but executives say things  are not quite so bleak as they appear.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to sit here and try to sell you the idea that this is a great  year for CBS," says David F. Poltrack, the CBS vice president in charge of  research. "We came into the year in third place and our goal was obviously to  get out of it. While we have not made a major change, we have improved our  position."  </P> <P> Poltrack says that CBS is actually the only one of the three networks to have  improved its ratings over the same period last year. NBC is down a little, ABC  is exactly the same, and CBS has inched up a teeny-tiny notch. Further, the  biggest woe at CBS had been the lack of successful 8 o'clock shows -- programs  that air in the first hour of prime time and can serve as building blocks for a  healthy night's programming.  </P> <P> On six out of seven nights each week, CBS has improved on the 8 o'clock ratings  it got last year.  </P> <P> "Major Dad," on Monday nights, does about 10% better than "Newhart" did in that  time slot a year ago. On Tuesday nights, "Rescue 911" registers a startling 90%  increase over the low-rated "TV 101" of last season. On Wednesdays, "Peaceable  Kingdom," lowly as it was, got 16% better ratings than "The Van Dyke Show" of  1988. "Kingdom" came -- and went. It has now been replaced by the revised  "Beauty and the Beast."  </P> <P> Friday night was the weakest link in this chain, and with "Snoops" gone,  Poltrack and Stringer think that will improve too. The replacement show is "Max  Monroe: Loose Cannon," an action-adventure starring Shadoe Stevens, one-time  "Hollywood Square."  </P> <P> Of course, one might ask (and I did), if there's all this improvement, why  isn't Kim LeMasters still in his job? "If you look at this year versus last  year, you would say Kim basically played even with the other guys," says  Poltrack. "The problem is, obviously, when you're in third place, parity is not  acceptable. You have to outperform the other guys to catch up. And that we  didn't do."  </P> <P> So Jeff Sagansky has come down the chimney to save the day -- greeted as  eagerly by CBS executives as kids welcoming Santa. It remains to be seen just  what goodies he'll be leaving under the tree and in all those forlorn empty  stockings.  </P></p>

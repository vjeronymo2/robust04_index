			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, April 10 (AFP)--PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat  pressed the United States Sunday to step up efforts to ensure  the successful launch of Palestinian self-rule as Israel and the  PLO resumed talks in Cairo, the official Palestinian news agency  WAFA reported.    'Arafat urged US Secretary of State Warren Christopher to  make "the maximum effort" to ensure the success of the  negotiations, during a telephone conversation.    The PLO leader stressed the importance of meeting the April  13 deadline set for Israel to withdraw from the occupied Gaza  Strip and West Bank town of Jericho.    Under the Israeli-PLO Declaration of Principles signed in  September Israel was due to complete its troop withdrawal by  April 13, but implementation of the deal was delayed by  disagreements over security arrangements and the February 25  Hebron massacre.    'Arafat said any Israeli failure to respect the timetable  set  out in the autonomy deal "will have negative repercussions on  the whole peace process and threaten its credibility," WAFA  reported.    The PLO leader also called for the rapid deployment of an  international presence in the occupied territories, in line with  UN Security Council Resolution 904 of March 18, which condemned  the Hebron massacre and allowed for international protection for  the Palestinians.    Israel and the PLO agreed last month that 160 lightly-armed  observers from Norway, Denmark and Italy would be deployed in  Hebron, where a Jewish settler shot dead 30 Arab worshipers in a  mosque.    The two sides began a new round of talks in Cairo on Sunday  in a bid to resolve remaining differences, including a timetable  for Israeli withdrawal and the deployment of a Palestinian  police force.    'Arafat and Christopher also discussed the escalating  violence in the occupied territories, and the harm it could  inflict on "the entire Middle East peace process and the  (Israeli-PLO) negotiations," WAFA reported.    'Arafat discussed the same issues by telephone with US civil  rights leader Jesse Jackson, currently visiting Israel, the  agency said.    The PLO leader thanked Jackson for his "worthy efforts to  support the just cause of the Palestinian people and the peace  process."    Jackson, who arrived in Israel Thursday, has held talks with  Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and Palestinian leaders  in East Jerusalem.</p>

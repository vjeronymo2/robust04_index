			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / International Company News: US deal takes Murdoch into new TV sector MR Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation has joined forces with Tele-Communications, the largest cable television operator in the US, to buy majority control of Reiss Media, one of the biggest US pay-per-view television distribution and programming companies. The deal represents a diversification into pay-per-view for News Corp, which already controls the Twentieth Century Fox film studio and the Fox network of television stations. Mr David DeVoe, chief financial officer of News Corp, said the relationship with Reiss first began in the mid 1980s when Fox was involved in the development of Request Television, a pay-per-view network. Financial terms of the the Reiss deal were not disclosed, but it is understood that News and TCI will jointly pay more than Dollars 25m to own equal equity stakes totalling two thirds of the unquoted company. The Reiss shares are being bought by News and TCI from a group of investors including Warburg, Pincus, the investment firm. The complex deal features the simultaneous purchase by Reiss of a 50 per cent stake in Request Television and Request 2, two pay-per-view networks. Reiss, which will have 100 per cent of the networks following the purchase, is buying back the 50 per cent it originally sold in 1989 to Group W Satellite Communications, a division of Westinghouse Broadcasting.</p>

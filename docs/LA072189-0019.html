			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Los Angeles artist Barbara Carrasco, who has been involved in a battle over her  latest work "Pesticides!" that is being exhibited in New York's Times Square,  will give her views on why artists and entertainers need to become "more  socially conscious" at a press conference this morning in Santa Monica.  Carrasco designed a 34-second computer-animated film about pesticide use on  grapes, but had to change three frames of her original piece when the owners of  the Spectacolor billboard in Times Square refused to show it. "They felt the  three frames were a little too harsh," Carrasco said Thursday. The  controversial frames showed children about to eat pesticide-sprayed grapes.  Carrasco changed the ending to show the mother throwing the grapes away. "I was  willing to alter the images because I thought the total message of the work was  important," the 34-year-old muralist and first-time animator explained.  "Pesticides!" will continue to run every 20 minutes for the rest of the month  on the Times Square light-board. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

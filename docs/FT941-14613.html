			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Markets Report: Dollars slips in volatile trade The dollar failed yesterday to build on recent rises against the D-Mark and the yen, retreating against both currencies in fairly volatile trading, writes Philip Gawith. The dollar and most other leading currencies were firmer against the D-Mark in early trading. Analysts and dealers said the tone of the Bundesbank's latest monthly report, which held out little hope of an early cut in German interest rates to speed growth, had not helped the German currency. But dollar sales by European central banks and worries about US-Japanese trade tensions sapped the dollar's strength in afternoon trading. The dollar finished London trading at DM1.7487, down from an earlier high of around DM1.7540 and Monday's close of DM1.7553. In New York it ended at DM1.7465. Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan (Europe), said the dollar, after breaking through last year's high of DM1.7480, might have been expected to attract new investors at this level. He cited two main reasons for its failure to rise further. First, the sale of dollars by European central banks for reserve management purposes: banks had to repay by the end of January heavy borrowings they made from the Bundesbank in the ERM crisis of last August, Mr Persaud said. They were taking advantage of recent dollar strength to buy cheap D-Marks. A second factor was the weakness over the past few days of the dollar against the yen which may be capping the advance of the dollar in other markets. The dollar closed in London at Y110.75, down from Y111.08 on Monday. In New York it finished at Y110.79. Mr Mark Austin of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking said this was a function of the apparent lack of progress between the US and Japan in talks aimed at curbing the trade deficit with Japan, particularly in relation to the US. The latest indication of discord on the trade front came on Monday evening when US Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen expressed concern about lack of progress in ongoing framework talks on trade. At the start of the new year, many operators were betting on strong dollar gains against the yen. However, the Bentsen comment and those of other US officials expressing dissatisfaction with trade developments have prompted a number of them to turn bearish on the dollar. Some dealers suggested that the US would now try to talk up the yen. Moreover, as Mr Adrian Cunningham, currency economist at UBS in London, pointed out, market expectations were that Japanese trade figures later this week would show an increase in Japan's surplus. This was putting upward pressure on the yen. However, this was expected to be short-lived if the Japanese government announces a stimulatory fiscal package later this week. The market will look to tomorrow's US November merchandise trade figures for direction on the dollar and yen. The US trade gap is expected to have edged up slightly to Dollars 10.55bn in November from Dollars 10.5bn in October. Market participants took a bearish view of the D-Mark in spite of yesterday's gains. 'The longer they delay cutting rates, the deeper the German recession will get,' said Mr Cunningham of UBS, referring to the Bundesbank. 'The D-Mark is in a lose-lose situation at the moment.' Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, commented: 'I do not think we will see any big moves until Thursday when the Bundesbank council meets. Everybody accepts that German interest rates have still got a lot further to fall this year, but nobody is quite sure when.' Although the market is not expecting a rates cut, Mr Hannah said he would not be surprised if there were a cut since there had not been a reduction in official rates since October and some movement was becoming overdue. 'I do not think it would be inconsistent for them at this stage to cut rates. I think it is quite possible,' he said. Denmark's central bank yesterday said it would lower its discount and key deposit rates to 5.75 per cent from 6 per cent, effective today. Mr Austin of HK Bank said the cut followed recent comments by the central bank governor that he saw no reasons why Danish interest rates should not fall as low as 3 per cent. However, Mr Austin added that it was unlikely that any other European countries would follow the Danish lead. The D-Mark's rebound left sterling slightly easier at DM2.618 after a quiet day, against Monday's DM2.6184. But the pound rose to Dollars 1.4972 from Dollars 1.4918. On the London money market, the Bank of England forecast a liquidity shortage of Pounds 950m early in the day, later revised upwards to Pounds 1.1bn. The Bank did not operate in the early round and its overall assistance was only Pounds 782m, of which about Pounds 510m was late assistance at unspecified rates. The rouble fell to a new low of 1,504 to the dollar from 1,402 on fears of economic turmoil after the weekend resignation of the reforming minister Yegor Gaidar. A dealer from Stolichny Bank in Moscow was quoted as saying: 'The rouble has nowhere to go but down. The economy is already in a mess, with or without Gaidar.' In the German money markets yesterday, the Bundesbank confirmed the repo at a fixed rate of 6 per cent, a clear signal, said Mr Hannah, that monetary policy is on hold.  --------------------------------------         POUND IN NEW YORK  -------------------------------------- Jan 14         Close    Prev. close  -------------------------------------- Pounds spot      1.4960      1.4935 1 mth            1.4929      1.4903 3 mth            1.4881      1.4853 1 yr             1.4745      1.4715  --------------------------------------</p>

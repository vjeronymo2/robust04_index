Japan has become one of the nations of  the world where commodity price levels are the highest as a  result of the rise in the value of the yen.    2. The domestic-foreign price differential issue is a  problem which is deeply intertwined with the structural problems  of the Japanese economy and there is a need for resolution of  the structural problem from the standpoint of the consumer  through actions such as elimination of agricultural protection  policies, wholesale alteration of the indirect tax system,  stricter enforcement of antimonopoly laws, promotion of  competition through relaxation of economic controls, reform of  social controls, increased efficiency in the consumer sector,  and increased support for policies that encourage business  efforts at improving efficiency and productivity.    3. These measures will not only lower domestic  commodity prices, but can be expected to have the effect of  shrinking the domestic-foreign price differentials caused by  excessive foreign exchange valuations.]  <H5>  Cause Lies With Import Quotas and Price Supports </H5>   The value of the yen against the dollar is currently  fluctuating around 105 yen to the dollar, increasing in value  3.4-fold in 20 years since the inception of the floating  exchange rate. The impact has been the placement of Japan in a  status where it has one of the world's highest commodity price  levels.    During the days when the dollar was valued at 360 yen,  Japanese commodity price levels were low compared to Europe and  the United States, and Japanese tourists and officials stationed  overseas were surprised by the limited buying power of the  dollar in the United States compared to its value outside the  United States. However, today, the situation has been completely  reversed.    As reflected in the following table, an Economic Planning  Agency [EPA] survey of domestic-foreign price differentials  revealed that commodity prices as viewed from an overall  combined living expense perspective were relatively higher in  Tokyo than they were in New York, London, Paris, or Berlin.  Currently, the yen has risen in value in relation to all other  foreign currencies, and it is anticipated that the  domestic-foreign price differential will continue to expand  during 1993.

Brands were not specified, but the survey covered items  which traded in higher volumes. Whenever quality and standards did not  match strictly, strict comparisons of individual items was difficult and  attention should be focused on the fact that data on foodstuffs reflect  differences in dietary habits. (3) Data on foreign urban areas were  obtained from surveys conducted by the Price Bureau of EPA and the Japan  External Trade Organization. Data on Tokyo were obtained from the  Management and Coordination Agency's "Survey of Retail Commodity  Statistics" and survey by the Price Bureau. Prices reflect retail prices  which include taxes. (4) Foreign currency exchange rates reflect averages  for 1992 as a whole.      The question is, how was this domestic-foreign price  differential created? The following three factors are  conceivable, if we exclude temporary factors such as delays in  making adjustments for changes in foreign currency exchange  rates.    The first factor concerns the issue of foreign trade goods  which are exposed to international competition through export  and import actions. Prices of foreign trade goods should  stabilize at international price levels, unless they are exposed  to special situations. However, in Japan such goods are isolated  from international price competition because of import quotas  and price support systems and despite efforts to lower prices  through productivity improvements, the major rise in the value  of the yen has caused a very sizable differential in domestic  and foreign prices of such items as agricultural commodities.    High tariff rates for such commodities as raw sugar ranging  at fixed rates of thousands of yen per ton do not isolate  specific commodities from price competition such as in the case  of import quotas, but the rising yen effectively boosts the  tariff rates and even if the benefits of the higher yen are  passed on to the consumer, the end result is a considerable  increase in the multiple of the domestic and foreign price  differential. Other commodities such as textile products and  liquor and petroleum products are similarly impacted in a major  way in terms of tariffs and related taxes.    Oligopolistic price formations by manufacturers also serve  as  cause for domestic-foreign price differentials. In those  instances where major domestic-foreign price differentials exist  despite the lack of obvious import barriers, conceivable are  such actions as prevention of parallel imports by exclusive  import agents, actions which restrict competition through the  formation of marketing affiliations by domestic manufacturers,  and the difficulties faced in arranging for parallel imports  under government controls imposed on cosmetics.  <H5>  Lagging Productivity in Non-Foreign Trade Goods Sector </H5>   The second factor concerns the problem with non-foreign  trade  goods which are not exposed to international competition. In the  case of Japan, the differential in productivity between the  manufacturing industries and other industries is conspicuously  large compared to other nations. When one considers that foreign  currency exchange rates are based primarily on international  competitiveness in the manufacturing sector, this differential  causes a disparity between purchasing parity relative to overall  living expenses and the real foreign exchange rates. Further,  since foreign trade goods are passed to the consumer after  adding distribution costs, high marketing costs translate into  high domestic retail prices.    This sector is affected by dropping foreign trade goods  prices, but since it is not exposed to direct price-lowering  pressures from price drops by competitors, there is a lack of  actions to enhance productivity through such movements as  increased manufacturing efficiency, enhancement of products by  high-value-added measures, and withdrawals from unprofitable  sectors as seen in the foreign trade goods sector, thus leading  to expanding productivity differentials between foreign trade  and non-foreign trade goods sectors.    The non-foreign trade goods sector is composed of many  regulated industries which are subject to market controls  relative to new market entrants and pricing. Such restrictions  are a strong probable cause for delays in enhancing long-term  productivity. Further, excessive profits accompanying controls  in such industries are conceivably distributed to workers as  part of their wages providing for wage levels that are higher  than other industries and a situation in which such costs are  transferred to the consumer in the form of higher prices.    The third factor concerns the issue of production factors  such as land which cannot be moved on an international basis and  labor whose movements are restricted. Generally speaking,  requisite prices such as for land and wages and commodity price  levels have a tendency to rise in economies that enjoy high  growth rates based on increased productivity accompanying  economic growth. The relationship between per capita gross  domestic product (GDP) as converted into gross national product  and purchasing parity, and commodity price levels based on GDP  have been in considerable turmoil since the foreign currency  exchange adjustments agreed upon in the 1985 Plaza Accord, but  it is obvious that commodity price levels tend to be higher in  nations with a higher per capita GDP.    A considerable portion of high Japanese commodity prices can  be explained by the high income levels, but they still exceed by  12 percent the levels that can be covered by such an  explanation. However, the recent rise in the yen is deemed to  have caused an expanding disparity in Japanese price levels  which is equal to or in excess of that of the North European  nations where the degree of disparity from regression lines is  the largest.    When the foregoing situation and findings of the living  expense survey are combined, the structure--wherein a major  domestic-foreign price differential is aggravated on a living  expense basis in excess of the overall economic cost basis in  the form of high consumer prices for food, clothing, and  footwear which are highly weighted in terms of consumer  goods--becomes obvious. Additionally, high land prices in Tokyo  have a conspicuous impact relative to principal urban areas  throughout the world.  <H5>  Call for Bold Policies Emphasizing Consumer Interests </H5>   A review of domestic-foreign price differential factors in  this manner enables us to understand that the differentials are  deeply intertwined with various structural problems. The issue  of domestic-and foreign price differentials cannot be resolved  through clever manipulations and requires work on solutions to  structural issues from a standpoint which emphasizes the  consumer. Keywords applicable to such an approach are promotion  of competition and enhancement of efficiency and productivity.  If I were to present a self-styled approach to reducing the  domestic-foreign price differential, it would be as follows:    First, I would convert the current agriculture protection  policy from one of maintaining prices to one of direct aid.  Current policy merely serves to expand the disadvantages  suffered by consumers relative to advantages enjoyed by farmers.    Second, I would completely reform high tariffs such as for  textile products and the indirect tax system for petroleum and  liquor. We should also study the feasibility of converting  current indirect tax liabilities hidden in the prices of such  necessities as foodstuffs to a tax system where the liabilities  are clearly and broadly indicated.    Third, I would promote competition based on stricter  implementation of the antimonopoly laws and relaxation of  economic controls. Especially desirable would be the  establishment of a surveillance system by the Fair Trade  Commission to oversee import prices and foreign prices.  Relaxation of controls should include not only flexibility in  price controls, but lowering of barriers to new market entrants  through abolishment of restrictions on new market entrants  because of excess supply and easing of restrictions relative to  market entry as well as withdrawal.    Fourth, I would revise societal regulations concerning  safety. I would revise the contents of regulations which are  excessively strict, introduce product liability laws on matters  which can be covered by the principle of self-responsibility and  simultaneously abolish regulations which can be covered by the  new laws.    Fifth, I would reinforce policies which support business  efforts in the area of enhancing the efficiency of  consumer-related sectors and promoting productivity. Policies  which were previously concentrated on export industries and  leading-edge technologies must be expanded to circulation,  marketing, and other services.    These measures should lead to lower domestic commodity  prices  and expanded imports through improved market access and expanded  domestic demand, alleviate high-yen pressures occasioned by  structural distortions and can be expected to have the effect of  reducing domestic-foreign price differentials caused by  excessive currency valuations.</p>

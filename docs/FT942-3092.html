			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Voters fed up with Westminster too? Sir, Kevin Brown ('PM under pressure as Tories fear disaster in Euro-poll', June 11/12) reports my friend Sir Teddy Taylor as remarking that the voters had 'shown in the astonishingly low turnout for the Euro-polls that they are fed up to the teeth with Brussels rule'. The facts do not support him. In the Kent East seat which I shall alas be vacating next month the Westminster constituencies of Dover, Ashford, Folkestone, Canterbury had higher turnouts in the Euro-election than in four out of the five Westminster by-elections held on the same day. Should I conclude that the voters are 'fed up to the teeth' with Westminster? Christopher Jackson, MEP for Kent East, constituency office, 8 Wellmeade Drive, Sevenoaks, Kent TN13 1QA</p>

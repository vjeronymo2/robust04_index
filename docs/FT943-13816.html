			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / People: Checking in, and not checking out - Robert Peel, the head of Britain's second largest hotel chain, tells Katharine Campbell why he has stuck with it In what line of business would a suave and successful Old Etonian be labelled 'a rough diamond' and 'a Gerald Ratner who can count'? The British hotel business, apparently, where the four star hoteliers speak only to the five star hoteliers, and the five star hoteliers speak only to God. Robert Peel, chief executive of Mount Charlotte Investments, has no patience with such nonsense. Hating 'pretentiousness and bullshit', this chain-smoking, workaholic iconoclast, who tucks himself away most of the week in Leeds, and relaxes equally happily at the Savoy and Tramps, is a bit of a puzzle to his stuffier rivals. With a portfolio of 112 hotels ranging from the no star to the five star, Mount Charlotte Thistle is Britain's second largest chain after Forte. Yet it is hardly a household name, not least because Peel, 47, sees no need to court publicity. 'You get a fair hearing if no-one knows you.' Peel is likely to be forced into the news rather more in the next few years. The group has just embarked on a sweeping modernisation programme, concentrating on the four star business market; its boss is confident that finances will improve as Britain emerges from recession. Rumours of a stock market flotation will consequently never be far away. An intuitive hotel-keeper who betrays a passion for service while brandishing a sharp knife in the direction of the most modest outlay, Peel is an eccentric existing outside both the hotel establishment and the City - his pukka upbringing notwithstanding. It was at home that he first learned to love the business. Early childhood was spent in Egypt, but the family lost its cotton fortune in the aftermath of Suez and his father returned to London, turning his hand variously to the restaurant trade, pig farming and antiques. After Eton, Peel headed for Paris, and a series of menial jobs in grand hotels. Back in London, his formative apprenticeship was at the Hyde Park Hotel, acquired in 1968, while he was there, by Trust Houses (which merged with Forte in 1970). Passing through the Grosvenor House Hotel as conference and banqueting manager, and the old Quaglinos restaurant as general manager, Peel was poised to go to Johannesburg for THF when his elder brother made a suggestion. Then at stockbrokers Fielding Newson-Smith, Charles Peel was acting for a group of institutions acquiring Mount Charlotte Investments from the rubble of the Slater Walker empire. Originally established to mine gold in Rhodesia, the company was by 1976 a curious collection of seaside hotels, pubs and nightclubs in search of a manager. Peel liked the idea, and swapped his luxury hotels for the 'serious shock' of a headquarters in Leeds and some months living in a group-owned old people's home. From there he embarked on just over a decade of helter-skelter expansion, turning a loss of around Pounds 1m to profits of Pounds 38.8m by 1989. Then he made what many would claim was his biggest mistake: he bought Thistle Hotels from Scottish &amp; Newcastle. The attraction was a branded chain to bolt on to the mish-mash of properties already accumulated. 'I effectively lost my company because of that deal,' Peel acknowledges, but reminds me that he was under 'enormous pressure' from his banks and shareholders to make a move because they thought his gearing too low. 'With the benefit of hindsight, I bought at the top of the market, yes,' he says. A year later, however, up to his ears in debt, Peel was forced to sell out to Brierley Investments for just Pounds 644m; the New Zealanders later sold on 30 per cent to the Singaporean government. Did he consider leaving? 'It's the same as if you consider leaving your family; it's a big decision,' muses Peel, who has never married. As it happens, he gets on famously with Paul Collins, Brierley's chief executive, and feels a seat on the main board in Wellington has expanded his horizons. Reaching for the positive spin on having a boss, he says New Zealand has proved an important new market, too. But the Gulf War and deep recession put a severe strain on the relationship. Even now the group's financial performance is far from impressive. Peel dismisses recently released 1993 post-tax profits of Pounds 10.4m, on sales of Pounds 214m, as 'peanuts' compared with what he thinks the group is capable. That is why he denies persistent rumours that Mount Charlotte is ripe for flotation. Collins adds, in cricketing style: 'What we need is runs on the board. Any price at which we might float now would severely undervalue future prospects.' It also needs to attend to gearing; even in last year's favourable rate environment, 88 per cent of trading profits were absorbed in interest payments. Financial travails delayed until early last year plans to upgrade many of the Mount Charlotte properties into Thistles, but by 1996, the aim is to have almost two thirds of the hotels with that branding. Even Peel realised he would need to make a bit of noise about this 'repositioning', so he hired the well-regarded Peter Bates, previously at the Savoy, as his new sales and marketing director. 'He needed more people who could stand up to him,' remarks one observer. Bates, who arrived last November, says there are regular slanging matches. Yet the entrepreuneurial gifts that carried him through the 1980s will not be enough to take the group much further. With its 14,300 rooms, Mount Charlotte needs more structured management. Instead, Peel still carries most of the company around in his head, and, aside from his senior operations director Norbert Petersen, there have been very few he has really trusted. He will still get involved in the tiniest detail. 'I like to know this pipe goes from there to there. I'm annoying like that,' he agrees. He has even taken to tape-recording staff as they negotiate discounts so that he can improve their technique. But there are limits even to his energy, and his extraordinary involvement has its impractical side. 'He complains that he can't keep up with me. I tell him, you don't have to keep up,' Bates observes. Peel has, of course, heard the criticism many times. 'I see margins go with every act of delegation. If I can do it quicker, I'd rather do it,' he says simply. One can see he frets about his much-prized cost-controlling abilities being compromised by building an infrastructure. In his personal life, he 'never has a clue' what he spends, but at Mount Charlotte he signs every cheque over Pounds 300, and worries about such things as whether he can catch his own water on those acres of roofing. Necessary though he knows it is, he winces when he mentions that the salesforce has doubled from 40 to 80 in the past six months. As and when Thistle Hotels plc - as it is likely to be renamed in the next year or two - comes to the market, investors will look for greater management depth, and strategic brain. They will ask questions both about the debt and Peel's unsinkable optimism that business spending will bounce back more or less to pre-recession levels. And, while they will applaud the fact that Peel recognises he lacks the infrastructure to expand into European hotels, they will point out that that is where his competitors think the growth will come from. He will not pass comment on last year's rumour that Rocco Forte offered him the position of chief executive at his former stable. But he would presumably just hate having to knuckle under in a huge organisation of that kind. That is why the man who at 30 wanted to run the biggest hotel chain in the world is not the next Charles Forte.</p>

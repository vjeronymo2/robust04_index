			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> KEEPING WATERFRONT VISION CLEAR  </P> <P> Much progress has been made recently in developing a promising plan for San  Diego's downtown waterfront.  </P> <P> An ad hoc group, representing 13 organizations, has produced a conceptual plan  that, if adhered to, should preserve views of San Diego Bay and protect several  parcels of open space along the water, including a 10-acre park at the foot of  Broadway.  </P> <P> The plan is a testament to what can be produced through cooperation and  coordination. Five government entities have jurisdiction over the land from  Laurel Street to just south of the new Convention Center and inland to Harbor  Drive: the city, the county, the Centre City Development Corp., the San Diego  Unified Port District and the Navy. The agencies were able to subordinate some  of their individual interests to the greater goal of an inviting waterfront. As  with all conceptual plans, however, the proof will be in the execution. The  design principles still have to be incorporated into the city's master plan for  downtown, and the Navy and the Port District, both of which have considerable  autonomy on development matters, will have to apply the principles to their  plans.  </P> <P> The first test of the cooperative spirit will come in a few weeks when the Port  District considers a "memorandum of understanding" passed by the City Council,  which covers several points of the conceptual plan.  </P> <P> At least one port commissioner has questioned some of the building restrictions  affecting port properties and voiced concern that the city is trying to preempt  the port's authority.  </P> <P> We hope the commission is able to move beyond such concerns. Turf wars will  serve no one's interests and could jeopardize a vision for the waterfront that  would serve everyone's interests and the interests of future generations.  </P></p>

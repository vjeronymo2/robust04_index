			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRITISH ELECTIONS  </P> <P> Having fought and won, with ever increasing majorities, 10 parliamentary  elections in Britain, may I intrude into the debate in your letters column  between Matthew Shugart (Jan. 1) and Tony Oakes (Jan. 9)?  </P> <P> Mr. Oakes is evidently a supporter of the fragmented Social Liberal Democrat  alliance that the British electorate has rejected every time it has had the  opportunity to do so. Your readers should not take too seriously his moans  about "pendulum politics" and the "divide between north and south." Britain,  like America, has its problems but the vast majority of British people, in all  parts of the island, today earn more, keep more, and invest more than at any  time in their history; while their government, especially the prime minister,  enjoys more international respect than at any time since the Second World War.  </P> <P> Mr. Shugart makes more sense than Mr. Oakes. He recognizes that under  proportional representation a candidate's chance of getting elected depends  hardly at all on his or her appeal to his constituents but largely on how high  up his name appears on a "list," drawn up by his party, usually behind closed  doors. And the result, as I can testify from having seen proportional  representation at work in parliaments all over Europe, is that minorities all  too often impose their wishes on the majority -- damaging, not strengthening,  democracy.  </P> <P> For years, I served as a member of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg.  Weekends, I had to fly back to England to attend to my constituency duties. Not  so the members from proportional representation countries. They took their ease  in Strasbourg because proportional representation made them far less dependent  on keeping the folks back home happy about what they were doing.  </P> <P> The other advantage of "first past the post" voting is that it helps to elect  strong governments. A clear swing among the voters is translated into an even  stronger swing in the legislature, so that the party winning power, more often  than not, can get its legislation passed.  </P> <P> Winston Churchill, as always got it right. "Ours" he said, "is the worst system  of election there is -- except for all the others."  </P> <P> SIR ELDON GRIFFITHS  </P> <P> House of Commons  </P> <P> London  </P></p>

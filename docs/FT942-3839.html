			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Europe slips to the east The European Union looks better from outside than from inside, to judge by the events of the last week. Inside, the fourth direct election of a European parliament stirred little positive enthusiasm, and was treated in most countries as a chance to protest against incumbent governments. One might think that a visiting US president, coming from a world power whose economy is growing strongly, with much lower unemployment in spite of steadily increasing productivity, would find little in the EU to admire or encourage. And one might think that a small European country like Austria - which as a member of the European Economic Area already enjoys access to the single market and has weathered the recession better than most - would think twice about choosing this moment to sign up for full membership. Yet Mr Clinton used his trip to give the EU a ringing endorsement, even in the field of defence from which his predecessors had been anxious to exclude it; and the endorsement given by two-thirds of the Austrian voters perhaps counts for even more, since they have to put their money where their ballot-paper is. If anything should jolt the EU out of its recent despondency it is that, for the first time in 20 years, a country with a higher standard of living than its existing average, and one which will be a net contributor to its budget, has actually decided to join, ignoring attempts to scare it with a veritable barrage of Euro-nightmares from drained reservoirs to floods of poisoned yoghurt. Should the Austrian example be followed by Nordic countries later in the year, January 1 1995 will indeed mark a hopeful new beginning. Austria's vote By their vote, the Austrians have already moved the EU in a direction Mr Clinton was urging it to go, namely eastward. In a literal sense, they have moved its eastern frontier from the 15th to the 17th meridian, while waiting for Finland to take it to the 31st. More significantly, while Finland (and indeed Norway) would give it a common border with Russia, Austria gives it one with Slovakia, Hungary, and Slovenia, and brings it within 20 km of Croatia. Austria, even more than Germany and Italy, has felt itself involved in the Yugoslav tragedy, and in proportion to its population has absorbed larger numbers of refugees. Historically, its links are with the Magyars and Slavs of the former Habsburg empire. It will use its membership, without doubt, to incite the EU to play a bigger and more creative role in eastern and south-eastern Europe. Open markets That is also where Mr Clinton put his emphasis. In his speech to the French national assembly last Monday he said nothing about the single currency or the single market. Instead he dwelt on 'the development of a European defence identity', and on the importance of 'a broader Europe', open to the east. He mentioned with particular pleasure that 'Nato recently approved an American proposal to allow its assets to be used by the Western European Union' (the EU's 'defence component'), and reiterated his call, uttered in Prague last January, for western markets to be open to goods from eastern Europe. The Austrians would surely agree with the latter point. They may have reservations about the former one. Neutrality, originally imposed on them in 1955 as the price of Soviet withdrawal, has become since the 1970s an important element in their national identity, and their government felt obliged to reassure them, during the referendum campaign, that this status would not be affected. It would have been more honest to say frankly that with the end of the cold war this concept has become an anachronism, that Austria was proposing to join a union with a developing defence identity, and that as the member-state closest to an unstable and war-ravaged part of Europe it would have a stronger interest in that development than any other. At least the Austrian chancellor, Mr Franz Vranitzky, has said that he contemplates joining the WEU in due course. The next step, not only for Austria but for its new partners, should be to weigh Mr Clinton's words carefully. He is offering to stand by Europe, but only if Europe stands militarily on its own feet.</p>

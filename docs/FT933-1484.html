			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / UK food manufacturers concerned over continued freeze in 'green currency' changes UK FOOD manufacturers yesterday reacted with frustration and dismay to the European Commission's decision to continue the freeze on changes in 'green' currency rates until the next farm council on October 20, writes Alison Maitland. The Food and Drink Federation, which complained about the September 9 freeze to Mr Rene Steichen, EC agriculture commissioner, said it was disappointed with the decision to continue it. 'We're very apprehensive about what the commission might propose at the October council, particularly if it involves any extension of the switchover mechanism,' said Ms Helen Williams, EC and international policy executive. 'There are agrimonetary rules that are up and running and we don't see why there's a need to change them the first time that German and Dutch farmers are faced with a cut in their support prices.' Mr Paul Williamson, external affairs director for Cadbury Schweppes and president of Caobisco, the European chocolate, biscuit and cake association, said the continued freeze meant even more uncertainty for manufacturers. Since the start of the year, 'green' currency rates had tracked real exchange rates and companies had been able to hedge against changes in currency. The freeze left them unable to protect themselves. 'Prices should be varying,' he said 'That's what we planned for and if you've taken protection against that then you're faced with a risk now.' Mr John Bradbury, group buying director for United Biscuits, said: 'The best thing of all would be if we could all get agreement to price everything in Ecus. I optimistically carry five Ecus around in my pocket'.</p>

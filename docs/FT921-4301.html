			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / US bankers to aid Russia on debt MR Gerald Corrigan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, is leading a delegation of senior US bankers to Moscow this week to advise the Russian government on financial reform and direct foreign investment. The visit marks an intensification of Mr Corrigan's informal role in helping President Boris Yeltsin and his advisers to restructure and modernise Russia's banking system and financial markets. The New York Fed chief will take part with 15 executives from banks such as JP Morgan, Citibank, Bank of America, Chemical Banking and Chase Manhattan in the latest in a series of symposiums aimed at finding new ways to stimulate more direct foreign investment in Russia. Although Mr Corrigan cannot act as an official adviser to Mr Yeltsin, the two men are understood to have developed a close personal rapport that is resulting in growing assistance for Moscow from New York Fed officials. Meanwhile, Mr Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve Board chairman, has been invited back to Moscow on March 21 to discuss with Russian officials his possible role as an adviser on banking and economic reform. It is understood he may help the Russian government in its relations with the Group of Seven industrialised nations, and in particular advise on the restructuring of Russia's external debt. Mr Corrigan is expected to open the Moscow meeting on Thursday. Among the issues likely to be covered will be mergers and acquisitions, debt trading, privatisation and the raising of funds on international capital markets. Leyla Boulton adds from Moscow: Representatives of the former Soviet republics are due to meet in Moscow in Thursday to try to hammer out a compromise for repaying a foreign debt exceeding Dollars 60bn. Such a compromise is aimed essentially at reconciling Russia and Ukraine. Editorial Comment, Page 20</p>

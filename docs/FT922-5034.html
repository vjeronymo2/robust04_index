			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / People: Hanson to groom its media image Hanson, Britain's eighth biggest company, has recruited Aviva Gershuny-Roth, who made her name as a property marketing whiz, to improve its lacklustre media image. The 34-year-old Gershuny-Roth will report to vice-chairman Martin Taylor who has been the group's principal spokesman to date. Unlike most large companies Hanson has not spent much time grooming its media image because it felt its financial performance spoke for itself. Lord Hanson did hire Michael Shea, a former press secretary to the Queen, as director of public affairs in 1987. However, Shea has spent most of his time cultivating Hanson's contacts with Westminster rather than the City. As a consequence, when Hanson took a near 3 per cent stake in Imperial Chemical Industries last year, it was unprepared for the level of media attention - and criticism - that it received. It has been known for some months that Hanson has been seeking an in-house professional to handle its corporate communications. Nevertheless, Gershuny-Roth's appointment will surprise some Hanson watchers. For the last 15 months she has been involved in the marketing of Olympia &amp; York's ill-fated Canary Wharf development in London's docklands and before that she spent nine years with Savills, the up-market firm of chartered surveyors. Although she is well regarded, her expertise in marketing property is not exactly an obvious qualification for looking after the image of a company such as Hanson which employs a workforce of more than 70,000 worldwide. ***** Steve Tibble, former director of research at Valin Pollen, has joined Richard Pollen &amp; Co as a senior consultant.</p>

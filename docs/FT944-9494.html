			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Stora raises pulp charges still further Stora, Europe's leading pulp and paper group, said yesterday it planned to increase long-fibre pulp prices by a further Dollars 50 a tonne from January 1, the sixth price rise in a year. The increase, which will lift the price of northern bleached softwood kraft pulp to Dollars 750 a tonne, means pulp prices will have nearly doubled from their Dollars 390 at the end of last year. The rebound from 1993's exceptionally low levels has been driven by wood shortages, rising demand, and inventory build-ups. A number of North American and European pulp producers have recently announced price rises as part of a general industry drive to take advantage of rising demand and economic recovery. The weaker dollar helped to trigger the latest increase. Mr Lennart Holm, president of Stora Cell, the group's pulp unit, said he expected pulp prices to continue rising next year, although at a slower pace. 'We think that the price will climb to Dollars 840 to Dollars 850 per tonne by the end of next year,' he stated. Prices peaked during the last cycle at Dollars 840 a tonne in 1989. Stora is also increasing the price of bleached short-fibre birch and eucalyptus pulp by Ecu30 to Ecu580 (Pounds 455) a tonne.</p>

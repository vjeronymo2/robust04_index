			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yang Shuang (2799 3642): "Futures, the Most </F> Attractive Investment Hot Point"]    [Text] On entering the futures exchange, one sees only a  crowd of people moving about with various types of demeanor and  a long smooth color display screen that keeps displaying  information from the London and Chicago futures exchanges.  Bustling brokers even more frequently shout at the telephone,  "cocoa, buy three; coffee, trim!".... And in the hall, one tense  heart after another repeatedly stews over the fact that whether  the "10,000 dollar words `buy' and `sell'" make a profit or a  loss all depends on making a prompt decision. In the blink of an  eye, some people become suddenly wealthy or fall into poverty.  This is the current futures exchange, full of challenge,  stimulation, and risk.    So-called futures, are the opposite concept from spot  transactions. In spot transactions, one side hands over money  and the other side hands over merchandise with the object of  acquiring the ownership or use of the commodity. Futures  transactions are a type of business with advance payment and the  transfer of merchandise after a certain period. In this, the  commodities themselves by no means enter the futures market.  What are exchanged are only what are commonly called futures  long-term forward contracts. In futures exchanges the vast  majority of investments are by no means for buying and selling  commodities, but for transferring profits or shifting risks in  price changes through agreements. So, futures exchanges have a  strong speculative flavor. But this is legal speculation. Some  experts have predicted that futures exchanges will become the  most attractive current new investment hot point.    I. Unstoppable Tide    In a bumper harvest season more than 100 years ago, farm  owners from the southern United States overjoyed drove wagons  full of corn and wheat to Chicago prepared to sell it. But the  city was full of sellers and supply far exceeded demand. They  could only anxiously watch the prices of agricultural products  fall sharply. But a few months later, by the spring and summer  seasons of the following year, when there was a temporary  shortage, grain prices again rebounded and skyrocketed. Watching  the market changed by a strange combination of circumstances,  these farm owners could only despair and sigh. But astute  American businessmen took inspiration from this and in 1848  proposed the formation of a brand new orderly managed  market---the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT). Here buyers and  sellers traded fairly, and agreed on long-term forward  contracts. Buyers and sellers agreed on the price at the time of  the exchange and determined that after a year or several months  at a designated point to buy up or sell off a specified amount  of a certain type of agricultural product. The prices fluctuated  up and down with changes in the seasons and the markets, and  contracts could be transferred. That day they discovered the  embryonic early stage of the futures exchange. Now it has become  the world's largest futures exchange. People can see the top of  the building like the Roman goddess Cereus soliciting grain and  bumper harvests.    More than 100 years later, with the market's enormous  strength and economic demand, more than 80 nations have now  established futures markets linked to the United States. Futures  exchanges are approaching 100 and more than 100 types of  commodities are exchanged on the market. Among them are mainly  agricultural products, grains, cotton, cocoa, and rubber, as  well as metals. Since the 1970s, formerly popular material  commodities such as grains and metals have gradually withdrawn  to a secondary position and such financial products as gold,  currency, and stocks and securities have extremely actively  poured into the commodities futures exchanges. There are  numerous types of financial futures, the same things in  different guises. Receiving the market's favor, they become  major futures commodities.    In the United States, futures exchanges are extremely  mature.  In 1993 when a Nobel prize-winning economist learned that the  prize that he would be receiving in a few months would be in  Swiss francs, his first reaction was that at that time the  comparative value of the Swiss franc was constantly declining  and the prize money that he would receive in three months would  no longer be the present amount. So, he immediately instructed  the futures market to sell off Swiss francs and buy up United  States dollars, thereby compensating in futures for his cash  losses.    II. Futures Fever Quietly "Lands"    Perhaps it is a historical coincidence that in 1848 when  European communists were issuing their political manifesto,  United States farm owners were organizing the world's first  futures exchange---the Chicago Grain Futures Exchange. Today,  after nearly 150 years of change, the communist struggle and  market economy development are constantly blending, as reflected  in China. Comrade Deng Xiaoping on his southern tour affirmed  the socialist market economy and the unrelenting surge of the  commercial tide, the frequent hot points, the tempestuous  stocks, the unabated real estate investment fever, and the  futures exchange quietly landed on the mainland. Its ardor  overwhelms people far more than stock and real estate investment  trends.    But futures exchanges appeared in Shanghai, China, as early  as the 1930s and 1940s. But the planning system formulated for  several decades caused the Chinese to have no reason for such  things as futures and stocks for more than thirty years after  New China was established. This must be said to be an historical  pity.    By the 1980s, China's economy had grown by leaps and bounds,  laying a firm foundation for "restoring the position of  futures." Especially with reform and opening up, China clearly  proposed the socialist market economy theory and the scope of  market adjustment in the overall economic life expanded more and  more. With the supply and demand of some commodities such as  grain, live hogs, steel, and coal, sometimes tight and sometimes  relaxed, and prices suddenly rising and suddenly falling, it  brought extreme risk to the vast majority of farmers and  business people. Rising and falling of the comparative values  of foreign exchange brought even greater risks to Chinese  enterprises. So, futures could effectively avoid or lessen these  risks. For example, in 1985 U.S.$1 could be exchanged for 3.42  German marks. In 1993 U.S.$1 could only be exchanged for 1.68  German marks. If mainland enterprises exported to Germany at the  quoted price of the U.S. dollar, it would mean that half the  value would be lost to the 50 percent exchange advantage of  German merchants. If at this time the mainland enterprises  bought up mark futures at the same time as they made the  exports, they could be used as a countermeasure to avoid the  risk of devaluation of the U.S. dollar, compensating for the  foreign exchange losses in the exports on the futures market.  So, in 1987 Mr. Yang Ching-yu [2799 4552 5038] from Hong Kong,  in accordance with the development and characteristics of the  Chinese market, proposed "the development of a futures market"  to relevant mainland leaders. At the beginning of 1988, the  State Council Development Research Center established a Futures  Market Policy Research Group. In October 1990, the first  commodity exchange market in New China with futures  characteristics, the Zhengzhou Wholesale Grain Market, opened.  In March 1991, that market signed the first long-term forward  contract for which it did not receive wheat, suddenly opening  the curtain on Chinese futures exchanges. After that, futures  companies sprang up all over like bamboo shoots after a spring  rain. According to incomplete statistics, China presently has  more than 360 futures companies and more than forty futures  exchanges. In addition, there still are a considerable number of  "underground futures brokers."    Unconsciously, a futures fever gradually rose in the  economic  life. Especially with the first wave, foreign exchange markets  cooling, real estate sliding, and the fascination with the  stockmarket lowered, the opening and development of the futures  market seemed to find an avenue for the funds withdrawn from the  stockmarket and the real estate and foreign exchange markets.  Some people even chanted slogans like, "One hundred thousand  yuan households set up individual enterprises, million yuan  households open companies, 10 million yuan households speculate  on stocks, and 1 trillion yuan households engage in futures."  Although the saying is a little fantastic, the futures market  has temporarily exploded. Especially after China enters the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the market will  open to the world and mainland enterprises will truly enter  international circles. Opportunities for economic development  will be numerous for persons in charge of the government economy  and enterprises, but risk factors also will be great. So,  whether from the perspective of developing the national economy  or abiding by the laws of the market economy, cultivation and  development of the futures market is an inevitable trend.  <H5>  III. Playing Makes the Heart "Jump" </H5>   Last year from 26 February to 5 April, the quotation for red  bean [ormosia] futures quotation dropped abruptly 3,150 points  on the Tokyo grain exhange. The information was that worldwide,  during this period, people lost a total of more than U.S.$700  million on this variety. A number of investors took deep losses.  This is just one of the most recent examples among unpredictable  futures market risks.    In doing business, there are profits and losses, and with  futures exchanges, there is even more of this. Transferring  risks and acquiring investment profits coexist. The money itself  does not propagate. If there are profits, there must be losses.  It is nothing more than bills changing pockets. If  decisionmaking is accurate, someone can make a large profit. If  decisionmaking is faulty, the risk naturally could fall on one's  own head, and it is difficult to avoid losses. The futures  market can be summarized as half profits and half losses.  Strictly speaking, the losses are greater than the profits,  because the brokers take some in commissions. Regarding U.S.  futures exchanges, losses generally make up about 80 percent of  the business. Only those large companies and people with ample  experience can make money. China's futures business has just  begun. The vast majority of brokers still cannot measure up to  the masters on international futures markets in skill and  experience. So, it could be inevitable that there be greater  loss of money on the part of investors. Last April nearly 180  customers played the Tokyo April red bean futures market through  the Nanjing Jinzhongfu [6855 0022 1381] International Futures  Corporation. As a result, 90 percent of the customers were  trapped. After the recognized losses were trimmed, total  customer losses were figured at about 35 million renminbi,  causing more than 100 customers to be impacted by the  "Jinzhongfu" incident and shocking the whole country. Although  there are a great many reasons for this, one can clearly see the  great risk of futures.    But as a mature investment tool, futures exchanges have the  capability of "getting a thousand jin for four taels" [getting  much for little]. Investors often need only pay 5 percent to 10  percent cash deposit and they can transact business worth scores  more than their money. Exchange regulations of the Shenzhen  Nonferrous Metal Exchange (SME) even specify earnest money at  only 3 percent of the value of the transaction. If traders are  speculating on the rise and fall of prices, unlike people  engaged in spot transactions, they need not even consider such  diverse procedures as storage, transport, and settlement.    "Using a little to gain much" even more provides investors  with the opportunity to acquire high profits. But high profits  must have high risks. Small fluctuations in market prices are  enough to cause investors' profit and loss rates to reach  several tens percent or even several hundred percent. But for  those who are bold enough to brave the risks, can endure  enormous mental pressure, and attempt to get rich quickly, this  is an enticing and challenging paradise.    Although futures have more or less been carried off to the  dustbin of history, they have after all come to us and they will  inevitably be looked upon favorably by more and more investors.</p>

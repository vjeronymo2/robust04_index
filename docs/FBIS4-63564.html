			<p>BFN     [Text] An official Kazakhstan delegation, led by President  Nursultan Nazarbayev, arrived in Tashkent today. It includes  Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko, parliament's Speaker Abish  Kekilbayev, and other senior officials.    Presidents Islam Karimov and Nursultan Nazarbayev had a  meeting today, then they attended the opening of Kazakhstan's  exhibition "Science, New Technology and Conversion" at the  exhibition center. The head of our state laid flowers at the  memorial to Alisher Navoi.    Members of the Kazakh delegation met with their Uzbek  counterparts. Both presidents and members of the official  delegations attended the opening ceremony of Days of Kazakhstan  at the Torkeston center. It was followed by a concert of Uzbek  music. The Days of Kazakhstan will last until 27 May and will  contribute to closer integration between the economies of two  countries.    The two presidents were interviewed at the airport today.    [Begin Nazarbayev recording] Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have  not held an event like this since 1977. Earlier, such events  were mostly political. This is the first event of its kind  since the two countries gained their independence and  sovereignty. Around 600 people from various regions of  Kazakhstan have arrived in Tashkent. Among them are scholars,  businessmen, leaders of enterprises and farms, and others.    The aim is first to familiarize them with the reforms in  Uzbekistan and their progress. Second, as you know, [Uzbek  President] Islam Karimovich and I have signed an agreement on  encouraging cooperation between the two countries. We want the  economies of the two countries to compliment each other --  Kazakhstan has certain things which are not available in  Uzbekistan and vice versa. I hope that a commission, which has  been set up by the two presidents will contribute to  encouraging closer economic cooperation without bureacratic  hurdles. A similar event will be held in Kazakhstan at the  beginning of winter this year.    Such events are important in strengthening ties between the  two countries. Through them the two nations will get to know  each other better, will learn about the market reforms in the  respective countries. Kazakhs and Uzbeks were once considered  as one nation. We have common roots, similar languages, and a  common mentality. There is nothing that can divide us, and there  never has been. We have always been together and all we have to  do now is to revive these ties. [end recording]</p>

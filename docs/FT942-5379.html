			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / How to Spend It: Tiny golden chimes - Lucia van der Post listens to a Pounds 100,000 wristwatch The world of horology is not one with which I am overly familiar, largely for the extremely good reason that developing an interest in fine watches seems like a hobby I cannot afford. I already have more than enough expensive hobbies to keep my bank manager irritable. But not everybody, fortunately for the (mainly) Swiss watch industry, thinks like me. There is, it seems, a thriving clutch of collectors who are enamoured of horology and who have the funds the hobby requires (and believe me as funds go this is well into the polo-playing, yacht-owning class). Indeed, so convinced is Asprey of the market for these rarified pieces that it is next week launching what it calls a 'world first' - a Grande Sonnerie wristwatch made by Audemars Piguet. If you are new to these things you may be wondering exactly what a Grande Sonnerie wristwatch is. It is a watch that strikes the hour and the quarter every quarter hour while if set to petit sonnerie it strikes just the hour on the hour. In addition it has a quarter repeater so that at any time the hour and the quarter can be struck by simply pressing a button. It can also, those who believe in sleeping quietly, will be happy to hear, be set to be silent. Not, of course, that these watches get worn a great deal. Most of them reside in drawers or fancy cabinets for, as Asprey points out, 'the sort of people who will buy this watch are bound to have several others and certainly never wear a single model all the time.' In this rarified world one can spend thousands and thousands of pounds on a watch and then let it pass much of its life between velvet pads, which I suppose, is much the same as happens to expensive jewels. There is, however, real technical achievement behind this watch - until now all the Grande Sonnerie features have only been found in a few pocket-watches and it has taken four years to develop the miniaturisation of so many complicated mechanical parts necessary to produce a wrist version. The watch itself will sell for about Pounds 100,000, it is entirely hand-made and, for a watch that is so vertiginously expensive, it is surprisingly understated. A simple 18 carat yellow gold case on a leather crocodile strap would mean it could pass almost unnoticed in all but the most horologically sophisticated of company. For most of us, of course, these sums are mere doodlings on a page but Audemars Piguet does have a few more accessible treats. For instance its offers the ultimate sturdy stainless steel sports watch, what it calls its Royal Oak model, for just Pounds 3,000 and to celebrate the launching of the Grande Sonnerie wristwatch it has brought some of its most original and beautiful museum pieces to Asprey at 165-169 New Bond Street, London W1 where they can be seen and admired. A few special pieces will be for sale and a master watchmaker from the Audemars Piguet workshop will be showing what precision watchmaking is all about. The Grande Sonnerie wristwatch has to be ordered - each one takes many months to make - and the exhibition runs from June 8 to Saturday June 18.</p>

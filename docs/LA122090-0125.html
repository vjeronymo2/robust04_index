			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CAL GETS HOT EARLY, TOPS USIU  </P> <P> Billy Dreher of California scored all of his team-high 17 points in the first  half and the Bears romped to a 121-97 victory over U.S. International Wednesday  night in the highest-scoring game ever played at 58-year-old Harmon Gym.  </P> <P> Dreher, who leads the nation in three-point shooting percentage, made his two  three-point shots.  </P> <P> He has not missed in eight attempts from three-point range.  </P> <P> The 218 points topped the old record of 209 set in 1977 by Cal and Oregon.  </P> <P> Ryan Drew scored 16 points for the Bears (3-2), and Roy Fisher added 15 points  and seven assists. Kevin Bradshaw led USIU (1-11) with 25 points.  </P> <P> The Bears led 63-40 at halftime, then extended their lead to 80-50 less than  five minutes into the second half. The Soaring Gulls never were within striking  distance the rest of the way.  </P> <P> In the first half, Cal took a 39-24 lead on a Drew three-pointer with 7:50  remaining before the Soaring Gulls made a comeback, rallying to within 45-37 on  the second of Matt Tuite's 3-pointers. But then Dreher and Drew heated up and  put the game away.  </P> <P> With 2:11 left in the half, Dreher sank a three-point shot and was fouled on  the play. He hit the free throw and the 4-point play gave Cal a 56-39  advantage. The Bears led 63-40 at halftime.  </P> <P> The 63-point half set a new Cal record for points in a half, eclipsing the old  mark of 57 points against Stanford March 7, 1970.  </P></p>

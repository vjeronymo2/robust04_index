			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Hopes rise on HK airport finance The prospect of a settlement to Britain and China's long-running dispute about financing Hong Kong's multi-billion-dollar airport project brightened significantly yesterday after what British officials described as 'useful and constructive' talks. British officials gave an upbeat assessment of the talks, the first since August last year, describing the atmosphere as 'positive and friendly'. They said China's attitude demonstrated it wanted to settle the issue of airport finance. China has attempted to use the airport as a lever to influence the British government in its row with London over Hong Kong's political development. With the recent failure of bilateral talks on the colony's forthcoming election, Beijing may have decided that holding up progress on the airport served no further useful purpose. An early test of this will come next week. On Wednesday, the government introduces into the local legislature the second of Governor Chris Patten's bills for democratic reform. The following day, China's National People's Congress, or rubber-stamp parliament, convenes in Beijing for its annual meeting. A year ago, a similar conjunction of events produced a furious response from China. The airport and its connecting railway are estimated to cost the public sector about HKDollars 84bn (Pounds 7.3bn). Earlier this year, the Hong Kong government acquiesced in China's demand that the project be funded by HKDollars 60.3bn of equity and HKDollars 23bn of debt. Mr Alan Paul, the UK team leader, said the attitude of the Chinese side showed China wanted to move to a full meeting of the airport committee. The committee would meet in full session only if it were to agree a financial plan. The Chinese side had yesterday asked a number of technical questions concerning the latest financial plan, he added. These would be responded to within the week and the timing of another meeting discussed. It is vital both sides agree financing before the summer. If not, delays in opening the airport of up to a year or more may be unavoidable.</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / UK Company News: Shield Diagnostics buys Porton offshoot Shield Diagnostics, one of the new wave of UK biotechnology companies, is making an acquisition from Porton International, the sector veteran. Shield, which came to the market in September, is buying Porton Cambridge, a similar business which makes in-vitro diagnostic tests for human diseases, including syphilis. Shield is paying a nominal Pounds 1 for the share capital and providing funds for the repayment of Pounds 2.2m to its parent. An additional Pounds 200,000 is payable in the event of US regulatory approval for one of the company's diagnostic products. Mr Gordon Hall, managing director, said: 'This acquisition will add substantially to our turnover. The synergy between the businesses will allow considerable overhead savings to be made.' However, the company warned the savings would only be achieved after incurring significant restructuring costs. Porton Cambridge incurred an operating loss of Pounds 448,000 last year, after Pounds 333,000 of management charges which will not recur under Shield's ownership. Turnover was Pounds 1.82m. In the year to March 1993 Shield reported a loss of Pounds 653,000 on turnover of Pounds 1.68m. Shield's shares added 3p to 76p, compared with the 112p flotation price. Porton International has proved a disappointing investment for the institutions which put up Pounds 76m during the 1980s.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 15 (XINHUA) -- South Korea announced  today that it has withdrawn unconditionally its demand for  exchange of special envoys with the North as a condition for  Pyongyang to hold further high-level talks with Washington.    The announcement was made by Yi Yong-tok, deputy prime  minister and head of the National Unification Board (NUB), after  a cabinet meeting on reunification and national security policy  here.    The move will likely increase pressure on the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to allow additional inspection  of its nuclear sites by the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA), analysts here said.    Seoul and Washington said earlier that a third round of  U.S.-  DPRK high-level talks could be held if Pyongyang honored an  agreement reached with Washington in New York on February 25.    The agreement set two preconditions -- acceptance of IAEA  inspections and resumption of inter-Korean dialogue on the  exchange of special envoys.    However, the DPRK insisted that the third round of U.S.-DPRK  talks should be held since it has already met the two conditions.    The South Korean government has determined that it is  impossible to resolve DPRK's nuclear issue only through an  exchange of special envoys since the DPRK has "clearly shown  that it has no intention of doing so," Yi said.    Consequently, the government has decided against setting the  envoy exchange as a condition for a third round of U.S.-DPRK  high- level talks, he explained.    However, Yi said, there is no change in the government's  position that "the nuclear problem will have to be resolved  above everything else."    South Korea and the DPRK have held eight rounds of  working-level talks on the exchange of special envoys at the  truce village of Panmunjom since last October, but failed to  reach any agreement due to differences on the issue.    "Inter-Korean dialogue must go on for mutual and  simultaneous  inspections of each other's nuclear facilities based on the  joint declaration for denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,"  Yi said.    Today's cabinet meeting also decided that South Korea will  accept all DPRK's "escapees from Pyongyang-run logging camps" in  Siberia, Russia, who wish to settle in the South.    Some 170 escapees, out of an estimated 25,000 loggers at  Siberian logging camps, are said to be "seeking asylum" in South  Korea, according to official sources here.    On Thursday, Russia expressed its willingness to help South  Korea resettle DPRK's loggers in Siberia. Seoul and Moscow will  soon hold working-level discussion on this question.</p>

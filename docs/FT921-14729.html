			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries fall amid doubts over cut in interest rates US TREASURY prices fell across the board yesterday as doubts spread over whether the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates again. In late afternoon trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 15/32 at 105 27/32 , yielding 7.500 per cent. The short end of the market also weakened considerably, the two-year note easing  3/16 to 100 3/32 , to yield 4.931 per cent. The downturn in prices yesterday was a follow-on from last Friday's testimony to Congress by Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman. Although Mr Greenspan said the Fed would be ready to ease monetary policy again, he also said he felt policy had been loosened enough already, and that by historical standards there was enough monetary stimulus in the pipeline to spur a recovery in the struggling economy. The Fed chairman's comments came after the release of another set of bad employment figures, which suggested to bond investors that the weak December jobs data was not bad enough to prompt further easing. Given that prices, especially at the short end, have risen steadily recently on hopes of interest rate cuts, yesterday's setback was a logical correction. UK government bond prices weakened yesterday on concerns about future supply of gilt-edged stock and following the US Treasury market's lead. An announcement by the Bank of England on Friday that it would auction gilts in the 1998-2002 maturity range on January 29 helped to push down prices, particularly of medium-dated issues. The 10 per cent gilt due 2001 fell from its opening of 102 1/2 to 101 15/16 by late afternoon. Long-dated gilts were less severely hit, while short-dated gilt prices slipped on worries about sterling weakness. Final retail sales and consumer credit figures for November released yesterday had little impact on gilts. GERMAN government bonds ended little changed on the day as worries about a possible steelworkers' strike, the Bundesbank's commitment to high interest rates and an increase in supply held the market in check. News that German steelworkers were preparing to go on strike following the breakdown of pay negotiations on Sunday night, deterred many investors from buying bunds yesterday. Traders saidinvestors may be waiting to see whether the strike goes ahead and pushes bund prices lower so they can buy more cheaply. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 88.04 and traded at 88.03 by late afternoon after trading in a range of 87.92-88.17. JAPANESE government bond prices closed almost unchanged on the day as yen weakness against the dollar and the drop in Tokyo stock prices contributed to the market's slightly bearish mood yesterday. The yield on the benchmark No 129 ended at 5.35 per cent, after moving in a range of 5.335 per cent to 5.355 per cent on a relatively low volume of Y358bn. The dollar strengthened against the yen in New York on Friday after stronger-than-expected US jobs data for December dampened expectations of a further ease in US monetary policy. The overnight unsecured call money rate was ended at 5 3/8 per cent, down 1/8 .</p>

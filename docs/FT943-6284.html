			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Survey of Malaysia (8): Pique, pride and pragmatism - The impact of the trade measures against UK and Australia It has not been a good year for British/Malaysia relations. Then again Britain has not been the only one on Kuala Lumpur's blacklist: Australia also has problems. Businesspeople have come to realise the considerable opportunities in catering to the needs of such a fast growing and ambitious country as Malaysia. They have also had to grow used to the risks involved in dealing with a government which is often extremely sensitive to outside opinions or criticism. For Britain, the trouble started with the controversy in London over the granting of a Pounds 234m aid package to Malaysia for the building of the Pergau dam and its linkage to a 1988 Pounds 1bn defence contract signed between the then British prime minister, Mrs Margaret Thatcher, and Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister. Malaysian officials angrily rejected allegations that the Pergau project was an unsound one or that it was too expensive. On top of this came an allegation in a British newspaper that a British company had tried to offer bribes to Dr Mahathir. Though the newspaper did not allege that Dr Mahathir had accepted bribes or had been involved, the prime minister interpreted it in broader terms - a personal insult and an attempt to undermine the integrity of Malaysia's leadership. 'We believe the foreign media must learn the fact that many developing countries, including a country led by a brown Moslem, have the ability to manage their own affairs successfully,' said a government statement at the end of February. As punishment for the actions of the British press, Kuala Lumpur imposed a ban on giving government contracts to British companies. Malaysia clearly felt that the British government had the power to censure the press. The official British reaction to the ban only seemed to add to the confusion: on the one hand, Mr Major described the Malaysian action as being 'not remotely justified': on the other, Mr Major's ministers - in public at least  - joined with the massed ranks of British business in laying the blame for the Malaysian action squarely on the British media. There have been some perplexing aspects to the ban. From the beginning it has been difficult to gauge exactly what Malaysia has wanted in order for the ban to be lifted. 'All I want is the truth,' said Dr Mahathir. 'But then the British media is incapable of telling the truth.' The Malaysian government insisted the ban only applied to public sector contracts. But the line between the public and private sector in Malaysia is blurred. Arbitrary rulings have been made on who is and who is not affected by the ban. Some British companies have found they have lost contracts with Tenaga Nasional, the semi privatised electricity utility. Others have continued to work with Petronas, the state oil and gas conglomerate. For British companies the main casualty of the ban has been work on a new international airport being built south of Kuala Lumpur - at present southeast Asia's biggest infrastructure project with a price tag of between MDollars 9bn and MDollars 12bn. An Anglo Japanese consortium which included Balfour Beatty, GEC and Trafalgar House, charged with managing the project, has now been disbanded and several years of preparatory work has been aborted. However, British/Malaysia trade has not been reduced. Rather the reverse. Britain's exports to Malaysia went up by more than 80 per cent in the first six months of 1994 to Pounds 666m while Malaysia's exports to Britain dropped 24 per cent to Pounds 581m. Ironically, part of the reason for the increase in Britain's exports to Malaysia is thought to be the delivery of defence equipment associated with the controversial 1988 defence deal between the two countries. Australia's problems with Malaysia began after Dr Mahathir decided not to attend a meeting of leaders of the Asia Pacific held in Seattle late last year. In an off the cuff remark to reporters, Mr Paul Keating, Australia's prime minister, described Dr Mahathir as a recalcitrant for his non attendance. The dark clouds of Dr Mahathir's anger burst, not for the first time, on Australia. Various retaliatory actions were threatened. Australian business was warned that it could lose contracts. A great deal of diplomacy was needed before relations improved. Recently both countries have been in trouble again with Kuala Lumpur. The Malaysian leadership objected to British press reports concerning alleged illegal banking payments in Malaysia. Kuala Lumpur has reacted angrily to remarks made by Mr Keating about Malaysian logging companies practising 'environmental piracy' in the South Pacific. Dr Mahathir has always put himself forward as an economic pragmatist. 'I'm sometimes nasty to government, never to businesspeople,' he said earlier this year. However, there are those who feel that Malaysia's actions have done it more harm than good. The country is still dependent for its growth on outside investment and technology. Business does not take kindly to being used as a punch bag in arguments it has no part in. There have been rumours that the British ban will be lifted soon. However, no one is holding his breath. In 1981 Dr Mahathir, piqued at what he perceived to be British highhandedness on issues ranging from trade to high fees for Malaysian students in Britain, instituted a 'Buy British Last' policy. It took several years of careful diplomacy in order for that directive to be changed.</p>

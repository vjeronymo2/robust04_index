			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 26 KYODO -- The Social Democratic  Party [of Japan's, SDPJ's] (SDP)'s breaking of ranks with the  ruling coalition early Tuesday [26 April] threw Japan into  political chaos, raising the specter of an early snap general  election. The prospect loomed after the Diet voted Monday  afternoon to sweep Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] leader  Tsutomu Hata, 58, to power to replace Morihiro Hosokawa, 56,  with the help of the SDP.    The SDP, the largest contingent in the coalition, was  subsequently angered at an abrupt move by the Shinseito-led  conservative mainstream to form a new 130-legislator unified  parliamentary bloc in the House of Representatives, excluding  the SDP.    The SDP's pullout from the coalition, if it goes ahead,  would  strip the new Hata administration of a governing majority,  rendering it to a fragile minority government.    SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told reporters at a predawn  news conference it "cannot forgive the rest of the coalition,"  which he said pushed the moves toward convergence while keeping  the SDP in the dark.    The new five-way parliamentary bloc, called Kaishin  (Innovation), comprises Shinseito, the Democratic Socialist  Party (DSP), Hosokawa's Japan New Party, the Liberal Party and  the Kaikaku no Kai, both breakaways of the major opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Murayama criticized the  formation of the new parliamentary bloc as destroying the  coalition structure and a "betrayal" of the SDP.    The Liberal Party was established in mid-April by seven  rebels who left the LDP to support veteran LDP politician Michio  Watanabe's aborted attempt to seek the premiership. The party  did not sign a policy platform agreed upon last Friday by the  coalition heads for forming a new government.  "It is outrageous for a certain political party or individual  to have destroyed the current combination of coalition parties  while ignoring the process of accord-building," Murayama said  apparently referring to Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro  Ozawa, the chief coalition strategist.    The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) urged the ruling  coalition  to hand over power to the opposition camp led by the LDP.    "The LDP, as a similar parliamentary political party, can  understand the SDP's firm stand to bloc high-handed political  management," the statement said.    LDP President Yohei Kono hinted that the party is ready to  step up cooperation with the SDP and new party Sakigake  [Harbinger]. Sakigake, a 15-legislator coalition party in the  Hosokawa government, has pledged not to take a cabinet post in a  new government so as to distance itself from the dominant  Shinseito and Komeito.    The strength of the coalition without the SDP stands at 182  seats, compared with the 206 held by the LDP in the 511-seat  lower house. The SDP, which had six cabinet posts in the  Hosokawa government, has 74 members in the lower house.    Leaders of the ruling coalition agreed that Hata should urge  Murayama to hold talks, coalition officials said. However,  Murayama failed to respond to Hata's call, party officials said.    The leaders also agreed to maintain the present coalition  framework and not to exclude the SDP from the coalition,  coalition officials said. DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi said he is  ready to ask other coalition partners to disband the new  parliamentary bloc if that could convince the SDP to reverse its  decision.    The SDP endorsed the decision by top executives to walk out  of the coalition at an emergency meeting of its Central  Executive Committee on Tuesday morning and SDP members of both  houses of the Diet backed the decision.    At the meeting of SDP Diet members, Murayama called for  unity  among the party members. Shinseito and some other coalition  partners "want to see the SDP split up. Let us unite to guard  against that," he said.    Murayama said in a news conference early Tuesday his party  will cooperate to pass the state budget for fiscal 1994, which  started April 1, through the Diet. Parliamentary budget debates  have not begun since the government submitted it in early March.    Murayama, however, said his party will no longer be bound by  the policy platform, which includes tax system reform.    A weak coalition government could face upheavals after the  budget's passage, paving the way for a possible general  election, political analysts said.    In a TV program, Murayama did not rule out the possibility  of  a lower house snap election, while sounding cautious about the  move.    The Diet enacted in January a package of political and  electoral reform bills that replaces the lower chamber's  multiseat constituency system with a combination of single-seat  constituencies and proportional representation to clean up the  political system.    A bill to demarcate single-seat electoral districts under  the  new system has not been drafted, and if a general election is  held under the current multiseat system, the coalition's efforts  in political reform will be damaged, political analysts said.    The SDP withdrawl from the coalition is also expected to  undermine Japan's efforts to soften its trade dispute with the  United States, political analysts said.    The policy platform vowed the government will decide by the  end of June on thorough tax reform that emphasizes an indirect  tax rate hike and reduced direct taxes. The government has also  pledged to unveil an additional package of market-opening  measures before the Group of Seven (G-7) major industrial  nations meet in Italy in July.    Japan's often-stated readiness to take fiscal measures to  boost demand for imports is deemed a virtual international  promise to cut income taxes to give consumers greater purchasing  power.</p>

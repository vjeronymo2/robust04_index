			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LET MARCOS COME HOME, AQUINO TOLD;  </P> <P> PHILIPPINES PRESIDENT TURNS DOWN REQUEST BY LEGISLATIVE LEADERS  </P> <P> Leaders of both houses of the Philippines Congress urged President Corazon  Aquino today to reverse herself and let Imelda Marcos come home after her  acquittal in New York on charges of looting the nation's treasury.  </P> <P> But Aquino refused to relax the ban and accused Marcos of supporting a coup  attempt in December.  </P> <P> The president found herself politically isolated, with longtime supporters  joining Marcos loyalists in calling for the former First Lady's return. The  constitution prevents her from being tried by a Philippines court in absentia.  </P> <P> On Monday, a jury in New York cleared Marcos of allegations that she used $222  million in government funds to buy real estate, art and jewelry.  </P> <P> "The acquittal does not alter the national interest and security grounds on  which we have premised our decision not to allow the return of Mrs. Marcos at  the present time," Aquino said.  </P> <P> In a second statement later, Aquino said intelligence reports also showed that  Marcos "encouraged and supported those who wanted to grab power" during the  Dec. 1-9 coup attempt. The fighting left 113 people dead and more than 600  injured.  </P> <P> "The return of Mrs. Marcos would enable her to mobilize the underground network  of the Marcos dictatorship, which is designed to overthrow this government and  endanger our democratic gains and economic momentum," Aquino said.  </P> <P> In a telephone interview with Manila radio station DZBB, Marcos said: "I am not  opposing Mrs. Aquino.  </P> <P> "I am not going to fight her. What I will do is just pray to the Lord that I be  allowed to come home. I know that he will grant me this, just like my  acquittal," she added.  </P> <P> The Aquino government claims the late President Ferdinand E. Marcos and his  associates stole $10 billion before he was ousted in 1986.  </P> <P> The issue of Imelda Marcos is, however, especially difficult for Aquino because  they share such a long and bitter history.  </P> <P> Marcos' husband was toppled by the 1986 popular revolt that brought Aquino to  power. He died in September in Hawaii.  </P> <P> Aquino's husband, Benigno, was slain upon returning home in 1983 to challenge  Ferdinand Marcos.  </P></p>

			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chromium price fall hits Albanian revival plan ALBANIA'S ATTEMPTS to attract foreign investment into its chromium industry, which until 1990 accounted for about 5 per cent of world production, are being frustrated by a collapse in the metal's price. A dozen companies, including some from Germany, Italy, Japan, and South Africa, have shown interest in joint venture proposals to revitalise the industry, according to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which is advising the country. But, when the deadline for bids passed at the end of January, some asked for more time in view of the uncertainties caused by the price dropping by half in the past year because of a surge in exports from Kazakhstan. Samancor of South Africa, the world's biggest chromium producer, which held talks over two years with Albania, no longer seems interested because of present market conditions, which have forced it to consider cuts in its production and workforce, according to Mr Mario Gobbo, a member of the European Bank's merchant banking team. Also Ilva, the Italian steel group, has asked for more time because of its own financial problems. Mr Gobbo said Albania was still open to new approaches. He hoped to see more from Japan and some from Taiwan. Albania's government was pressing for a decision by the end of this month but the European Bank is recommending that a deadline at the end of April would be more realistic. Albania, a country not quite as big as Belgium, has a population of about 3.5m. Some 13,000 are employed in the chromium industry - at chromite mines scattered across the country and the two smelters, at Elbasan and Bureli. Independent observers estimate the industry could operate with one-third of its present workforce if modern equipment and methods were employed. However, labour costs are low, equivalent to Dollars 30 a month for each miner. The smelters, each capable of producing 35,000 tonnes of chromium a year, are of an old North Korean design with exceptionally poor working conditions and they cause tremendous pollution. Albania envisages a joint venture in which it would contribute assets while a foreign partner put up capital, particularly to modernise the smelters.</p>

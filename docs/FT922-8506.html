			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Expanding network for GWR GWR Group, the USM-quoted independent radio contractor, is to add Isle of Wight Radio (Holdings) to its growing roster of local commercial radio stations in the south of England, with a recommended Pounds 257,000 bid. GWR is offering 10 new ordinary shares for every 56 IoW Radio shares. That values each IoW Radio share at 50p, based on GWR shares at 288p, up 3p yesterday. IoW Radio has net assets of Pounds 205,800 and tax losses of Pounds 290,000. In the year to October 31 it achieved turnover of Pounds 494,326, and Mr Ralph Bernard, GWR chief executive, said it was 'close to break-even'. IoW Radio's advertising will be wrapped up in, and will extend by 25 per cent, 2CR's (Two Counties Radio) marketing area around Bournemouth. It is estimated that it will contribute about Pounds 500,000 to GWR's turnover and Pounds 100,000 to profit.</p>

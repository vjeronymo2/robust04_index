This expert system serves as a support tool for use in  dealing with these issues, and can quickly and easily prepare  basic manufacturing data for work management, such as assembly  work sheets and standard-time tables, in the production  preparation stage before the start of manufacture.  <H5>  1. Introduction </H5>   Fujitsu is a data-processing and communications equipment  manufacturer with a wide range of products--from integrated  circuits and semi-conductor products to large computers and  communications equipment. Over the last few years, Fujitsu's  product line-up has been expanded to include items such as  personal computers and workstations. This expansion reflects the  trend toward downsizing in computers, and, as a result, has  greatly changed the production environment. In addition, product  life cycles are becoming shorter and design changes are  occurring more frequently. This is because, until recently, the  main users of computers have been companies, but the market is  now shifting toward individuals, whose tastes are more likely to  change. These factors are making demand forecasting more and  more difficult. Furthermore, conventional methods are  insufficient for managing factories successfully.  <H5>  2. Issues of Assembly Factories </H5>   Given the above situation, the most important issues facing  assembly factories are the design and construction of the most  suitable manufacturing line, total work management, and  production stability from the start of mass production. Figure 1  shows the relationship between product life cycle and  production. The dotted lines indicate the relationship curves of  conventional products, and the solid lines indicate those of new  personal products. For conventional products, the flow of the  manufacturing line is checked for any problems after production  has started and the standard time is estimated using industrial  engineering (IE) techniques, such as the stopwatch method, after  production stabilizes. A work is managed and upgraded based on  the standard time to facilitate cost reduction. This procedure  is inappropriate for new products, however, because even if the  standard time is estimated the production model may change  before proper management can be applied. In this state, the  management accuracy gradually deteriorates, and, if no measures  are taken, a work may eventually be left to operators at the  factory and carried out without management.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-48A>      Fig. 1. Changes in production environment. </FIG>     To cope with the above problems, manufacturing standards for  work management must be established in the production  preparation stage before the start of manufacture. As shown in  Fig. 2, the basic data consists of design criteria such as work  and the standard time, and is used widely in product design,  planning and estimation.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-49A>      Fig. 2. Uses of basic data. </FIG>     However, estimating the standard time brings about the  problems shown in Fig. 3. Fujitsu has therefore developed a new  expert tool for IE that tackles these problems. The new tool  uses both conventional IE techniques and artificial intelligence  (AI) so that work can be managed at the same level as for  conventional products even in a complicated production  environment.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-49B>      Fig. 3. Current problems in estimating the standard time </FIG>     This paper presents the new system in detail.  <H5>  3. Aims in Development </H5>   During our study of system implementation we set the  following development goals to solve the above-mentioned  problems:    1) Time    The system enables production preparations to be made before  the start of production.    2) Speed    The system can quickly process data on new products and  products whose design has changed.    3) Consistency    The system enables any supervisor, manufacturing engineer,  or  designer to estimate and use standard time consistently.    4) Generality and adaptability    The system can be used by divisions dealing with different  products, and is adaptable to changing conditions.    Details of the system are presented below.  <H5>  4. System Outline </H5> <H5>  4.1 System Features </H5>   As shown in the system outline in Fig. 4, the new system  uses  a Fujitsu FM-R personal computer, and automatically creates  product assembly flowcharts and estimates the standard time  based on the component data input from the engineering database.  This system is called the standard-time estimating expert  system, or STEIN.    STEIN has the following features:    1) Can be linked with CAD    2) Adaptable, and allows manufacturing expertise to be  stored  in databases    3) Enables creation of the basic data    4) Has a wide range of applications and is easy to use.    With the first feature, data entry by the operator is  minimized through the use of component data created by CAD, such  as part names and drawing numbers included in design  information, and the equipment assembly sequence produced by the  designer. In addition, parts data can be processed in the  trial-manufacture stage, where the parts data is made complete,  and design changes reflected quickly.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-50A>      Fig. 4. System outline. </FIG>     The second feature means that the expertise on manufacture  possessed by manufacturing engineers and technicians is stored  in the knowledge database in the form of rules and tables, so  expertise can be added or updated easily and the system can be  reorganized to meet user specifications.    The third feature is a database containing data in a  standardized format called "basic data," which has been  established for use in a wide range of applications.    The fourth feature comes from the system's modular  structure,  which minimizes the modification required for manipulating parts  data and specifications peculiar to the user. Moreover, the  system uses a mouse as an input device to prevent operation  errors and to improve operability in processing jobs.  <H5>  4.3 System Module Configuration </H5>   Figure 5 shows the system module configuration. STEIN  consists of the main module, which performs work analysis and  standard-time estimation and six other modules.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-50B>      Fig. 5. System module configuration. </FIG>     Among the six modules, data conversion (STEIN _P_), data  editing (STEIN _P_ and STEIN _g_), manufacturing base data  conversion (STEIN _t_), and matching (STEIN _ch_) are the  preprocessing modules of the system. If the format of the parts  data prepared by the user differs from the basic data format  when the system is installed, the format conversion section in  STEIN _P_ can be modified so that the data can be input easily  into the system. CAD might not be used by all the design  departments of each user. For a department not using CAD, the  system can be operated by creating an input file using a  data-editing module (STEIN _P_ or STEIN _g_).    If design changes are made frequently, using STEIN _ch_  enables a previous version of data for which conditions have  already been established to be used in a new data which doesn't  estimate standard times and work conditions, thus allowing the  design changes to be reflected quickly. Figure 6 shows the  system operating environment.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-50C>      Fig. 6. System operating environment. </FIG>     In addition to the FM-R mentioned earlier, at least 8 Mbytes  of RAM, a hard drive with a minimum storage capacity of 40  Mbytes, a mouse, and a printer are required.    The required software includes the MS-DOS[.sup]TM[/]  operating system, the GCLISP language, and the expert system  construction support tool ESHEEL/FM. If data is exchanged with a  higher-level system, an emulator board and emulation software  are also required.  <H5>  4.3 Work Analysis and Standard-Time Estimation (STEIN </H5> _a_)    Figure 7 shows the processing steps for routing and  standard-time estimation. The knowledge databases required for  routing and standard-time estimation are the database for work  analysis (knowledge 1) and that for standard-time estimation  (knowledge 2). Knowledge is discussed in detail in section 4.4.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-51A>      Fig. 7. Processing steps. </FIG>     First, component data is read. Then, the hierarchical  structure of the equipment configuration is structured without  alteration, and the results are converted into data grouped into  frames.    Figure 8 shows the data grouped into frames. Grouping data  into frames enables the data to be connected by a semantic  network, which facilitates the retrieval of necessary  information and structure-related changes.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-51B>      Fig. 8. Data grouped into frames. </FIG>     For each component, knowledge 1 prepares information such as  the component classification shown in Fig. 9 based on the  component name and drawing number. Classifying components  entails grouping them into aggregates for the determination of  their characteristics and attributes. Components are put into  groups, such as a group of components for fastening a certain  component or a group of components to be mounted in the first or  last work, so that the work to be done can be easily determined.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-52A>      Fig. 9. Component classifications. </FIG>     Consider the classification shown in Fig. 9 as an example.  If  the names of components contain the word "screw," all those  components are classified as being screw components and  fastening components. Then, routing is done according to the  rules about the component-mounting order included in knowledge  1. As shown in Fig. 10, if the rules specify that the screw is  the component to fasten the immediately preceding component,  namely the metal fitting, and that a stick-on component called a  label must be used in the last work, the mounting order is  determined and work is done for each component. Once routing is  completed, each work step is assigned a work item name based on  the work item names defined in knowledge 2 and the rules  provided in knowledge 1.  &lt;graphic&gt;   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-52B>      Fig. 10. Process determination and work item name </FIG>     In the example shown in Fig. 10, the work step that involves  the component classified as being a metal-fitting component and  the component classified as being a screw component is  automatically assigned the work item name, metal-fitting  mounting. Lastly, the standard time is estimated for each work  item. In this step, the working conditions for estimating the  standard time, such as the distance the components are moved,  the weight of the components, and the tool used, are determined  based on knowledge 1, and the time values are calculated from  expressions defined in knowledge 2. If working conditions have  not been determined according to the rules provided in knowledge  1, manual alteration is required.    STEIN _a_ has an alteration function that enables  error-free  alterations to be made easily. Figure 11 shows the screen for  editing the work, and Fig. 12 shows the screen for editing the  working conditions. Most editing operations can be performed  using the mouse. In the editing of work, work item names can be  changed and added, and the order of work steps can be changed.  The operator selects the appropriate function key command menu,  then specifies the work item to be changed with the mouse. All  operations are performed interactively as instructed by  messages. In the editing of working conditions, the working  conditions and set values registered in the time estimation  table provided in the knowledge for standard-time calculation  are displayed. If a set value differs from the corresponding  actual value, the operator corrects the set value. Selection is  performed by selecting choices at the bottom of the screen with  the mouse. Operations are very simple, and can be mastered  quickly. The assembly flowchart, shown in Fig. 13, is explained  below.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-52C>      Fig. 11. Screen for editing work. </FIG>    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-52D>      Fig. 12. Screen for editing working conditions. </FIG>   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-53A>      Fig. 13. Printed output. </FIG>      Print processing outputs component assembly flowcharts  showing component names, drawing numbers, quantities, work  items, and the standard time. If notes or memorandums on a  component or work step are entered on the screen shown in Fig.  11, the entered information is also printed in the flowchart. A  version management list showing the version numbers of data and  knowledge databases in the system is also printed out. This list  enables engineers to manage processing results version by  version.  <H5>  4.4 Knowledge Editing (STEIN _O_) </H5>   Knowledge maintenance is important for the operation of  expert systems. It is inadvisable to edit knowledge frequently  after system operation has started. Therefore, knowledge must be  fully extracted and incorporated into the system before system  operation is started. Even if sufficient knowledge is extracted  and incorporated in advance, however, the system cannot remain  complete forever. Changes in knowledge often occur in the early  stages of system operation, and still occur after operation has  stabilized. For this reason, it is more efficient to improve the  quality of knowledge while the system is being used. In this  case, knowledge is changed after the user starts operation, so  the user must be able to edit knowledge without modifying the  system during operation. The STEIN _O_ module is provided so  that knowledge can be edited easily through an improved  human-machine interface (HMI). This module has the following  features:    1) Experts can edit their expertise into easily  understandable information because all knowledge is expressed in  Japanese sentences, and no expertise on artificial intelligence  is required for editing.    2) Changes in knowledge are reflected in the system  immediately.    3) The module has a print function that can print knowledge  in a form that enables the printed output to be filed  immediately and a function that automatically checks knowledge.  These functions facilitate the checking of knowledge and ensure  correct editing of rules.    Details of knowledge editing are explained below.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-53B></FIG>   <H5>         4.4.1 Knowledge for Work Analysis </H5>   Knowledge is organized in the hierarchical structure shown  in  Fig. 14, and classified and arranged in four categories:  knowledge for component information specification, knowledge for  process information specification, knowledge for work item  specification and knowledge for working condition specification.  Each type of knowledge is defined in the IF ...  THEN[.sup]1)[/] format in Japanese.    1) Knowledge for component information specification.    This type of knowledge is used to classify components,  change  component names, or specify information about components such as  component size. Examples of this type of knowledge are "if the  name of a component contains the word connector, then the  classification of that component is connector," and "if the  component classification is screw, then read the screw length  from the drawing and set the read data."    2) Knowledge for process information specification    If a screw is tightened on a unit during assembly work, that  unit and screw are used in a single work step. Knowledge for  assembly sequence editing is used to identify work steps and  group components for each step. An example of this kind of  knowledge is "if the classification of the component is screw  and the classification of the preceding component is unit, then  these components are used in the same work step."    3) Knowledge for work item specification    This type of knowledge is used to specify necessary work  items based on the information about components grouped on a  step basis. An example of this type of knowledge is "the work  item of a work step involving a connector and screws is  connector mounting, and a connector connection work is added."  With this type of knowledge, as many work items as required can  be specified for each work step. Notes on work can also be  specified; for instance, "The work item of a work step involving  only connectors is connector connection. The memorandum on the  work is `connect the connector in correct direction'."    4) Knowledge for working condition specification    When the standard time is estimated using a time estimation  table, working conditions are defined as work state variables.  This type of knowledge is used to adjust working conditions to  reflect the actual state. Examples of this type of knowledge are  "the working condition `number of screws' is the value of the  `quantity' of a component of which component classification is  screw" and "if the component classification is power unit, the  working condition `component weight' is `considerably heavy'."  Basic information required for specifying working conditions can  be copied automatically from any place in the work information  area.  <H5>  4.4.2 Knowledge for Standard-Time Calculation </H5>   To calculate the standard time for each activity shown in an  assembly flowchart, the time estimation table is required. Work  is defined as a combination of several work elements. Work  elements[.sup]2)[/] are the basic unit of work; they cannot  be further subdivided. Defining work as a combination of work  elements simplifies and ensures the maintenance and management  of work items. Because work elements are used commonly in  various types of work, working conditions are defined so that a  certain degree of generality is kept, and work elements are  defined by expressions having the defined working conditions as  variables. A working condition is defined as a pair: a choice  and its corresponding time value.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-54A>      Fig. 15. Organization of standard-time calculation </FIG>     As shown in Fig. 15, knowledge for standard-time calculation  is organized in a three-level structure: work item, work  element, and working condition. For example, the work called  mounting consists of three work elements: component pickup,  component setting, and screw tightening. Each work element is  further defined using working conditions such as component  pickup area and component weight. In the example of mounting  work shown in Fig. 16, the standard time is calculated as  described below.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-54B>      Fig. 16. Example of mounting. </FIG>     First, working conditions are specified for each work  element. Examples are shown below.    Component pickup area = component shelf (1),    Component weight = less than 1 kg (0),    Unpacking = none (0),    Number of insertions = 1 (1),    Concurrent work = none (0),    The number in parentheses is the value corresponding to the  choice selected as the working condition.    The time value for each work element is as follows:    Component pickup = 0.004    X component pickup area    X component pickup area + 0.004    X component weight + 0.0555    X unpacking + 0.016 = 0.02.    Component setting = 0.01    X number of insertions + 0.01    X concurrent work + ... = 0.08,    Screw tightening = ... = 0.344.    The standard time value for the mounting work is then  calculated from the following expression:    (Component pickup + component setting + screw tightening) X  number of components = 0.888 (minute)    This hierarchical structure simplifies work specification  and  enables the time estimation table to be edited easily.  <H5>  4.4.3 Operating Procedure </H5>   This subsection describes how to edit knowledge. Figure 17  shows the screen for editing work item information. Every  operation can be performed using the mouse. If the user  specifies the data to be changed with the mouse, the necessary  choices are displayed in the selection field at the bottom of  the screen. The user then selects a choice with the mouse. If  input from the keyboard is required, this request is displayed  in the selection area at the bottom of the screen.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-55A>      Fig. 17. Screen for editing work item Fig. 18. Screen for editing knowledge for standard-time </FIG>     Figure 18 shows the screen for editing knowledge for  standard-time calculation. The system always grasps the linkage  relationship between work items, work elements, and working  conditions. Therefore, the user does not have to remember that  relationship and merely needs to make required changes. The  system has a function for printing knowledge for work analysis  and standard-time calculation in an easily readable layout on  A4-size paper. These functions ensure correct editing.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-55B>      Fig. 18. Screen for editing knowledge for standard-time </FIG>     The program for editing the time estimation table can be  activated as a separate system. If the editing program is  installed in a laptop computer, the user can edit the time  estimation table while measuring work at the factory and can  input editing results immediately to STEIN _a_ for execution.  Thus, people who know nothing about programs can edit knowledge.  <H5>  5. Improved Efficiency </H5>   Using STEIN[.sup]3)[/] greatly improves the efficiency of  process design and standard-time estimation. Figure 19 shows a  comparison of the processing time required when a manufacturing  engineer did routing and estimated the standard time in the  conventional way (that is, based on actual measurements and  drawings), and when he used STEIN. A total processing time of  one year has been estimated for both cases based on the time  required for routing, the standard-time estimation for a new  model and the time required because of design changes, and the  estimated total processing time for both cases has been  compared. If the time required for processing in the  conventional way is expressed as 100 percent, the time required  to perform processing with STEIN is 20 percent, or only  one-fifth. The new system can not only improve the working  efficiency, but can also immediately update already estimated  standard times whenever necessary and improve the accuracy of  time values.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-56A>      Fig. 19. Improvement in working efficiency. </FIG>   <H5>  6. Conclusion </H5>   With the new system, STEIN, we were able to quickly prepare  basic data necessary for managing an equipment assembly factory,  and achieved our original goals.    We have also developed another application based on STEIN,  which is capable of determining the most suitable work sequence  for a factory line. This application is now ready for use.  Future work includes the development of a system that uses the  technology applied to distributed processing performed in a  network, uses shared basic information more effectively, and is  linked with a planning system such as a scheduling system or a  component delivery planning system.    In the manufacturing sector, the use of computer-integrated  manufacturing (CIM) is becoming increasingly widespread. Some of  the problems inherent in this technology have been solved, but  many problems including unsuccessful transfer of expertise on  manufacturing, still remain. Even when a factory is built with  CIM, the factory cannot be expected to expand production without  further human effort. The goal is to create a production system  that can be supported and operated by experts posted at  important points. We firmly believe that STEIN can support CIM  and further develop into a vital tool for assisting these  experts.

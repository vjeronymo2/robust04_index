			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Council venture capital rises LOCAL-AUTHORITY pension funds have become the largest source of venture capital available in the regions, according to a survey. Over the past two years to the end of last year they have increased their investment in venture capital by 51 per cent, according to Pensions Investment Research Consultants (PIRC). While the venture capital industry has experienced a general slowdown in rates of growth, the pension funds increased their investment by Pounds 92m to Pounds 271m. PIRC, which advises local authorities on investments, found that a total of 62 local-authority pension funds, 63 per cent of the total, had made venture capital investments. Of the pension funds surveyed, 41 per cent said they expected to increase the sums allocated for venture capital. Forty-two pension funds had allocated up to 1 per cent of their assets to venture capital; 10 had allocated up to 2 per cent; five had allocated up to 5 per cent and one had allocated more than 5 per cent. The legal maximum for pension funds is 10 per cent. Local Authority Pension Fund Venture Capital Investment. PIRC, 40 Bowling Green Lane, London EC1R 0NE.</p>

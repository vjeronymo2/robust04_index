			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Australia driven to six-year high by offshore-buying BARGAIN hunting by overseas investors supported share prices, and the Nikkei average was led higher by a rise in large-capital stocks, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei rose 178.32 to 20,500.25. Arbitrageurs bought shares as futures firmed and margin traders, who sold stock in April, bought back stocks to clear their positions. The index saw a low of 20,312.93 in early trading, but gained ground as foreign buying came in, and rose to an afternoon high of 20,529.55. Volume totalled 332m shares against 229m, helped by rumours of good economic figures coming next week. Advances led declines by 700 to 320 with 167 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks advanced 18.85, or 1.2 per cent to 1,653.78. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 4.34 to 1,284.99. Traders said that investors switched from small capital, high growth stocks to large capital issues on the main market. 'The pessimism has been overdone. Not a lot of people want to sell at these levels,' said Mr Alan Livsey, a strategist at Kleinwort Benson. Large-capital issues such as steels and shipbuilders gained ground. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day, rose Y19 to Y339, Kawasaki Steel advanced Y17 to Y339 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries gained Y23 to Y668. Investors were also encouraged by reports of liquefied natural gas tanker orders from Qatar. Arbitrage buying linked to the Topix index supported financials. Industrial Bank of Japan rose Y20 to Y3,240 and Sumitomo Bank by Y30 to Y2,260. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone firmed Y21,000 to Y889,000. Utilities issues were higher on the higher yen, lower fuel costs and hopes of higher profits. Tokyo Electric Power rose Y150 to Y3,520 and Tokyo Gas Y20 to Y535. The latter expects its pre-tax profit for the first six months to September to have tripled. Video game makers and amusement equipment makers continued to decline following Nintendo's downward earnings revision earlier in the week. Sega Enterprises fell Y200 to Y10,500 and Namco lost Y40 to Y3,380. In Osaka, the OSE average gained 181.18 to 22,455.81 in volume of 16.2m shares. Nintendo fell Y130 to Y8,530. Roundup SEVERAL Pacific Rim markets continued on their winning ways. Karachi is closed until Sunday as general and provincial elections take place. AUSTRALIA broke through chart resistance to close at a second consecutive six-year high. The All Ordinaries index rose 20.3 or 1.0 per cent to 2,018.8 driven by offshore investors, especially from Asia. The index is now less than 300 points below its all-time high of 2,306.2, set on September 21, 1987. HONG KONG continued its run, a further influx of foreign investment taking the Hang Seng index up 172.09 or 2.19 per cent to 8,041.47, its fourth consecutive peak. A round of profit-taking pared half of a 130-point early gain by late morning but renewed buying emerged after Mr Chris Patten, the governor, began his annual policy speech during the afternoon. Heavy demand from US and European funds gave the index its late surge, carrying it above the 8,000 level. A number of strategists have increased their weightings for the Hong Kong market in recent days. BANGKOK surged 3.8 per cent to a three year high on continued strong demand from foreign and local institutions which has seen the market climb 9.6 per cent in the last five trading days. The SET index added 38.79 to 1,058.24 on the back of Tuesday's 2 per cent gain, in high volume of Bt18.35bn. NEW ZEALAND was encouraged by sharply lower government deficit predictions announced late on Tuesday, and a broadly based wave of buying took the NZSE-40 capital index 26.92 higher to 1,982.53. TAIWAN saw late selling in some speculative shares cut earlier gains which were sparked by hopes of a further credit easing in reaction to September's low inflation rate. j The weighted index closed 1.36 ahead at 3,814.62, off an intra-day high of 3,832. Turnover remained thin at TDollars 10.9bn against Tuesday's TDollars 10bn. SINGAPORE closed higher in record volume of 661.95m shares, underpinned by continuing buoyant interest in Malaysian speculative shares. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 5.61 to 2,039.12. KUALA LUMPUR saw heavy profit-taking drag share prices down from their day's highs, and the composite index closed 7.79 higher at 865.77.</p>

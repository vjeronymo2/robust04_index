			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Survey of Rhone Alpes (4): Veritable top model - Grenoble Whenever France's local politicians ferret around for urban development role models the city of Grenoble is almost always at the top - at the very least, near the top - of the list. Grenoble is home to many of the world's largest and most dynamic high tech companies. With its strong artistic tradition and stunning setting amid snow-capped mountains, it had for years enjoyed a stream of inward investment and a level of unemployment well below the national average. But all that has changed. 'We enjoyed an artificially high rate of growth for many years,' says Guy Morens, deputy mayor and head of Grenoble-Isere Developpement, the local economic development agency. 'Even when our traditional industries were affected by the economic recession, we continued to find growth in the electronics sector. But that sector is now in crisis and Grenoble has suffered like everywhere else.' The cutbacks at local electronics companies - such as parts of the Thomson group's activities and Bull, the troubled computer concern - have had an immediate effect on the Grenoble economy. The rate of job losses in the city rose more rapidly than for the rest of France last year and now stands at over 11 per cent, roughly in line with the national average. Grenoble, once the envy of every investment-hungry French town, is now desperately trying to find ways of replacing its lost jobs. Mr Morens and his colleagues have responded with a switch in economic development strategy. Grenoble, the city that led the rest of Europe in its quest for high tech investment, is now turning its attention to more traditional areas such as old-fashioned manufacturing businesses which tend to be more labour intensive and thus more effective at reducing unemployment. The catalyst for the city's growth was the work of the scientists at its ancient university, notably that of Louis Neel, the Nobel prize winning physicist who arrived there during the second world war. The government decided to base the CNRS, national scientific research centre, at Grenoble in the late 1940s. Bull, Thomson and the other famous names in French electronics have long had operations in the region. The first significant tranche of international investment arrived 21 years ago when Hewlett Packard, the US company, began an investment programme that culminated three years ago in the decision to relocate its micro-computer headquarters from California to Grenoble. The flood of high-tech investment into the city and the surrounding area, dwarfed more traditional businesses such as the local foundries, paper mills engineering factories and even chemical plants such as the huge Rhone-Poulenc complex at nearby Le Pont-de-Claix. Alain Carignon, the mayor, and his colleagues have for some time been concerned about the subsequent imbalance in local employment. 'We have been very successful at creating new professional jobs in the city and that's wonderful,' says Mr Morens. 'But we do have a problem in that there are too few unskilled jobs.' This problem has been aggravated by the recent contraction in the once-thriving electronics sector. The number of people out of work in Grenoble rose by 43 per cent from 1990 to 1993, according to Jacques Champ, head of research at GID, far faster than the 30 per cent increase for the whole of France over the same period. The emphasis of investment is now on housing. There has been a similar shift in its cultural and leisure policy. The main project of the early 1990s, the construction of a FFr210m museum to house Grenoble's huge art collection, was completed earlier this year. The next important scheme will be the FFr200m renovation of the Maison de la Culture, legacy of Andre Malraux's reign as France's culture minister, opened in 1968 and now in a sorry state of disrepair. 'One reason why Grenoble has been so attractive to new investors is because it's such a pleasant place to live,' says Mr Morens.</p>

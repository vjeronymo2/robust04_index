			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FERMENT IN GRAPE COUNTRY;  </P> <P> OUTSTATE GROWERS, ANGRY OVER SUPPORT OF UNION BOYCOTT, PUT SQUEEZE ON S.F.  </P> <P> Boycott San Francisco?  </P> <P> As political protests go, it seems a bit extreme even by California standards.  Who would think up an act of such exquisite self-denial?  </P> <P> Farmers. Furious about San Francisco's official decision two months ago to  endorse a 4-year-old boycott of table grapes, farm groups across the country  have decided to fight fire with fire. First, the American Farm Bureau announced  it would take its 8,000 members and $18 million in convention business  elsewhere. The Produce Marketing Assn. and the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable  Assn. quickly followed suit.  </P> <P> "There is something about San Francisco that has always waved a red flag to  farm folks around here," said a Fresno journalist recently. "San Francisco  epitomizes the liberal, urban indifference to the farmer."  </P> <P> San Francisco is one of at least a dozen major American cities, including Los  Angeles, to endorse the table grape boycott, but so far it's the only one the  farmers have targeted for retaliation.  </P> <P> In San Francisco, officials disagree over the effect the counter-boycott is  having. The mayor's office predicts that the lost revenue will amount to a  small fraction of the city's overall convention proceeds.  </P> <P> However, the city's Convention and Visitors Bureau reports that the farmers'  action is on the way to costing San Francisco $60 million in lost convention  business over the next several years -- equivalent to roughly 25% of a single  year's convention spending by visitors.  </P> <P> Robert Begley, executive director of the Hotel Council of San Francisco, said  the boycott already has led to $29 million in cancellations over the next three  years. He said many of the canceled bookings will be difficult to replace  because they were scheduled during winter months when business is slower.  </P> <P> Besides canceling conventions, farm groups up and down the San Joaquin Valley,  where most of the state's fruit and vegetables are grown, have persuaded local  officials in Fresno, Madera, Tulare and Kern counties to support the  counter-boycott and, in some cases, to stop scheduling meetings in San  Francisco and in Alameda County, where the grape boycott also has official  support. Several city councils in the Central Valley have also endorsed the San  Francisco boycott but stopped short of banning official meetings in the Bay  Area.  </P> <P> San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos recently backed out of an appearance at a Fresno  reception after local growers loudly proclaimed that he was not welcome. Agnos  signed the San Francisco resolution endorsing the grape boycott, which was  organized by the United Farm Workers union. The city's resolution also bans  grapes from meals served in city commissaries.  </P> <P> The counter-boycott signals a new militancy by farmers, who have been  contending with periodic ostracism of their products by the UFW and its allies  since the mid-1960s.  </P> <P> "The whole idea of the San Francisco thing is to hit them where it hurts the  most, in the city's pocketbook," said Fresno County Supervisor Deran Koligian,  who is also a grape farmer.  </P> <P> "We're just not going to lie down and take this crap any longer," said A. J.  Yates, president of the Fresno County Farm Bureau.  </P> <P> "The (grape) boycott is a hot-button issue around here, like abortion or gun  control," said John Hicks, a Fresno political consultant.  </P> <P> Up to now, the grape farmers' most conspicuous gesture of defiance was to  arrange for a photograph of then-President Richard M. Nixon eating a handful of  grapes.  </P> <P> The latest grape boycott was launched in 1985 by UFW President Cesar Chavez to  protest growers' use of five pesticides suspected of posing serious health  risks. Unlike past boycotts, however, this one appears to have made little  impact on the soaring sales of table grapes -- now a $1.3-billion retail  business in the United States. The value of the California table grape crop has  tripled during the last decade, according to the California Table Grape  Commission.  </P> <P> Officials of the UFW insist that their boycott has made a dent in grape sales.  </P> <P> "We've had a very significant impact. They've had to reduce prices and they've  actually dumped a lot of grapes," said Dolores Huerta, a co-founder of the UFW.  </P> <P> So far, the boycotters have not built a definitive case that all five of the  pesticides pose a present danger to farm workers and consumers. One of the five  was taken off the market three years ago, and research on the other four is  incomplete, although there is strong evidence that at least one of the  pesticides still in use does cause cancer.  </P> <P> Farmers argue that the grape boycott has more to do with politics than  pesticides. They say that Chavez seized on the pesticide issue in a desperate  attempt to boost the standing of his union. Membership in the UFW has declined  by about 50% over the last 20 years.  </P> <P> Moreover, farm groups say that cities like San Francisco, with strong ties to  organized labor, are joining the boycott more out of solidarity with the UFW  than out of concern over pesticides.  </P> <P> "This (grape boycott) is strictly the last gasp of a dying union. It has about  as much to do with health and pesticides as the man in the moon," said Yates of  the Farm Bureau.  </P> <P> Still, farmers worry that the pesticide issue could cause problems for them.  They fear what could happen if big-city politicians like Agnos, with media  access to millions of consumers, go on saying that certain farm products are  dosed with deadly chemicals.  </P> <P> "You can scare the wits out of Americans with this pesticide talk. It doesn't  matter if it's true or not. It's like Goebbels (Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's  minister of propaganda) and the big lie. If it's allowed to continue unchecked,  people will believe it," said Bruce J. Obbink, president of the California  Table Grape Commission.  </P> <P> At the same time, there are some in the Central Valley -- people with ties to  agriculture -- who are critical of the counter-boycott, arguing, in effect,  that two wrongs don't make a right.  </P> <P> "I disagree with both boycotts. They get away from the real issues, which are  examining pesticides and selling more grapes," said Fresno County Supervisor  Doug Vagim, who cast the lone vote against the county resolution supporting the  San Francisco boycott.  </P> <P> The grandson of farmers, Vagim argues that the counter-boycott is particularly  silly in light of the working relationship that Fresno and San Francisco have  developed over the years.  </P> <P> He noted that Fresno County operates a teaching hospital that is partially  staffed by the University of San Francisco Medical Center -- an arrangement  that calls for close cooperation between the two institutions.  </P> <P> "Hospital business requires some 30-odd visits a month to San Francisco. Now,  we have a resolution saying there will be no more business meetings held in San  Francisco. It doesn't make any sense," Vagim said.  </P> <P> The boycott of San Francisco imposes other hardships. Farmers in the San  Joaquin Valley may not like San Francisco politics, but they like San Francisco  sports, and they will have a hard time tearing up their Giants tickets if the  boycott is still going on when baseball season starts.  </P> <P> Recently, officials of the Table Grape Commission were asked if they planned to  boycott a speech scheduled in Fresno later this month by Bill Walsh, who  coached the 49ers to a Super Bowl victory last month.  </P> <P> "Boycott Bill Walsh? Don't be ridiculous," Obbink said.  </P></p>

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / International Company News: DSW calls for investigation at German group The DSW, Germany's small shareholder organisation, has called for a special investigation into the role of the supervisory board at Metallgesellschaft, in addition to that of the management board. If shareholders reject an investigation at the special shareholders' meeting of the troubled metals, mining and industrial group next Thursday, the DSW would consider going to court to force such a measure, it said yesterday. At the meeting, Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, the supervisory board chairman, is to defend the supervisory board's role in the events leading up to the dismissal of Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, the former chief executive, and other boardroom colleagues in December. Mr Schimmelbusch was sacked for allegedly not informing the supervisory board of developments at MG Corp, the group's US commodities trading subsidiary. Losses there triggered a liquidity crisis which forced the group to turn to bankers for a DM3.4bn rescue package last month. While the supervisory board is likely to agree to an investigation into the management, it may not want to subject its own decisions to scrutiny. Last week the DSW said it wanted to examine whether lack of internal controls at Metallgesellschaft meant it was impossible for the supervisory board to fulfil its responsibilities.</p>

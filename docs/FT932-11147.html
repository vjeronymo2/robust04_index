Mr Wolf later rejected the charges as the potentially-explosive trial opened in a small basement room of the North Rhine Westphalia court, writes Ariane Genillard in Dusseldorf. The man who for three decades masterminded one of the most successful spy networks of the cold war era, is accused of treason against West Germany and of corrupting West German officials. But in a well-crafted speech, Mr Wolf argued that the courts in West Germany could not judge actions committed under the laws of a then East Germany, which was a sovereign state.</p>

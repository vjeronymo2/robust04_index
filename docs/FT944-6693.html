			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Tapie tries to avoid riches to rags ending: The French courts will soon decide the fate of the populist tycoon-politician For Mr Bernard Tapie, France's populist politician, tycoon and one-time pop star hopeful, it is time to face the music. A spate of legal and financial wrangles accumulated over the past few years are now before the courts. They threaten his political aspirations and could lead to a decline from riches to rags for the French deputy and Euro MP. The most important ruling is due within the next few days. A Paris commercial court is set to decide whether the remaining indebted companies in Mr Tapie's business empire should be wound up. The case focuses on the financial health of FIBT, the holding company which owns Mr Tapie's home in Paris, on ACT, the management company for his luxury yacht, and on Groupe Bernard Tapie, which controls his commercial interests, principally his weighing machine businesses and health shop chain. Despite the complexities of the case, Mr Tapie's ordeals have captured public interest. For some, his image as an anti-establishment champion has been fuelled by his clashes with the law courts and Credit Lyonnais, the state-owned bank which is his principal creditor. As one Paris politics professor puts it: 'There is a disillusionment with the political class, and a sense that it cannot respond to the big problems of the day such as unemployment. So mavericks like Mr Tapie can play an important political role.' His ability to do so is now in the balance. FIBT and GBT are unlimited liability companies, owned by himself and his wife. Should they be wound up, it could spell bankruptcy for the Tapie couple. And, under French law, bankruptcy would mean that Mr Tapie would be ineligible for elections to public office. This would present a serious reverse for Mr Tapie. He has made no secret of his intention to run for mayor of Marseilles in elections next year and has also indicated that he might take a tilt at presidential polls due next spring. 'If there is no one to represent the interests of my supporters then I will do so,' he says, referring to the 2.5m who voted for his Radical Energy list in June's European elections, supporting his pro-European, anti-racist and full employment ticket. The ineligibility of Mr Tapie could also hold implications for France's other presidential hopefuls. The 12 per cent of the vote garnered by his list in the European polls presents Mr Tapie as a significant power broker. By running in June, he drew support from the Socialist party, prompting a disastrous result and the ejection of Mr Michel Rocard as its leader. Mr Tapie argues that he should not be blamed for this. Rather, he claims: 'They should congratulate me. I rid them of a candidate who was a sure loser.' As for Mr Jacques Delors, the head of the European Commission and widely touted as the Socialist standard-bearer in the presidential elections, the considerations are more complex. According to Ifop, the polling institute, Mr Tapie and Mr Delors could complement each other because they draw support from different age and social groups. In the absence of a Tapie candidacy, Ifop estimates that only one-third of his supporters would vote for Mr Delors in the first round of the two-round poll. At the same time, the populist businessman could garner support for the left from his electoral strongholds. 'The danger of splitting the vote of the left may not be a problem, particularly if Tapie was to support Delors in the second round,' says one political analyst. To Mr Tapie, however, such calculations, are premature. For amid his complex legal tangles one thing is clear; he is not going to relent without a fight. 'The match is not over until the whistle goes, and we are not even at half-time,' he says, using one of his frequent football metaphors. Mr Tapie, however, has just conceded two goals. Last week, a Paris court ordered him and his wife to pay FFr339m (Pounds 40.3m) to Credit Lyonnais, which funded Mr Tapie's business expansion in the 1980s. In a separate case, the Paris police tribunal ruled that Mr Tapie must repay FFr66.7m to the French customs office because he illegally registered his luxury yacht, the Phocea, as a commercial vessel. Mr Tapie's rearguard action is based on a host of appeals against his adversaries. 'There is no sanction which is not susceptible to appeal,' he told L'Express magazine. He is already contesting last week's rulings and is suing Credit Lyonnais on the grounds that it is partly responsible for the management of the companies he controlled. Mr Tapie's prospects may also be helped by the reluctance of the commercial court to move rapidly to wind up his businesses, partly because of the implications for the hundreds of employees involved and the political sensitivity of unemployment in France. As a result, a possible outcome is the opening of a process of judicial redressment for Mr Tapie's companies. This involves an exhaustive study of the possibilities for the rescue or sale of the businesses - both of which are described as feasible solutions by Mr Tapie's lawyers. The process can last up to six months, buying time for the embattled businessman. A more aggressive stance by the court, however, would mean that Mr Tapie's time is running out.</p>

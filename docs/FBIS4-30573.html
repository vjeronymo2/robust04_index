			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News conference" by Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime minister for </F> national unification, with unidentified reporters on 28 June;  place not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Deputy Prime Minister Yi] Today the North and South  held a preliminary contact in Panmunjom for holding their summit  talks. After 10 hours of negotiations, both sides have reached  an agreement. The main contents of the agreement are as  follows: The North and South agree to hold their summit talks  in Pyongyang from 25 to 27 July, and the next summit talks will  be decided during the meeting of the top leaders of the two  sides in Pyongyang.    We need various preparations -- such as honor guard and  secret service issues -- to hold the summit talks, but these  working-level matters will be discussed during the working-level  contact between the North and South which is scheduled to be  held at Tongilgak in the North side's area of Panmunjom on 1  July. One delegate and two associates [suhaengwon] from each  side will decide on the matters after their discussions.  Finally, the two sides agreed that they would make joint  efforts to create a good atmosphere for the success of the  North-South summit talks. The contents of the agreement are  comparatively concise, but it is clear that they have reflected  the firm will of the leaders of the two sides to make an  important political decision and to create a new phase on the  Korean peninsula, judging from various events that have taken  place on the Korean peninsula -- such as the heightening of  tensions on the Korean peninsula -- or from the long history of  national division.    Although the negotiations lasted a long time, the two sides  made endless efforts, with their patience, to reach such an  agreement. Therefore, I believe North-South relations will  literally enter a new phase when the previously mentioned  preparations proceed well in the future.    [Reporter] What was the most difficult matter of discussion  in reaching the agreement?    [Deputy Prime Minister Yi] Of course, we wanted to hold the  North-South summit talks in Seoul. The North side demanded from  the beginning, however, that it hold the summit talks in  Pyongyang. At the same time, it has expressed the will to hold  it on the occasion of the 15 August event [1945 liberation from  Japan]. Such positions by the North side have run counter to  our side. Therefore, we had many difficulties coordinating each  other's position during the contact.    [Reporter] Before you took part in the contact, you said  that  the place for the summit talks had been proposed based on the  principle of reciprocity. Then, will the next summit talks  satisfy the principle of reciprocity based on the will of the  leaders of the two sides? What is your judgment?    [Yi] North-South talks have been held on many occasions in  various fields and levels. However, in general, we have  observed the principle of reciprocity. Therefore, we have  proposed it this time as our principle. It is the position of  the North side that both sides do not need to stick to past  events, because it seems to believe that the time has come to  hold summit talks between the leaders of the two sides, and the  summit talks are different from the North-South talks which were  held in the past.</p>

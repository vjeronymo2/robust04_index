			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> POLISH COMMUNISTS JOLTED  </P> <P> Poland's Communist rulers were jolted when a traditionally allied party said it  will join the Solidarity movement in voting against a Communist-led government.  The parliamentary leader of the United Peasants' Party, Alexander Bentkowski,  said his deputies will vote against Premier Czeslaw Kiszczak when he presents a  Cabinet to the National Assembly in two weeks. The Peasants' Party controls 16%  of the 460 seats in Parliament. Solidarity controls 161 seats, or 35%, meaning  that the two groups could defeat Kiszczak's efforts to form a government if  they vote as a block. Meanwhile, Solidarity leaders in Gdansk said they will  stage a one-hour stoppage in 470 factories Friday to protest food price boosts  of up to 500% that the government imposed last week.  </P></p>

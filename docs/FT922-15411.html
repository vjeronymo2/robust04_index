			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: Opposition buoyed in Southampton SOUTHAMPTON's Labour supporters yesterday displayed quiet jubilation over an opinion poll giving the party a seven-point lead in one of the city's two seats. The two Tory MPs in the south-coast marginals, though clearly thrown on to the defensive, derided the survey as 'maverick' and out of step with reality. Mr Alan Whitehead, the ambitious leader of the city's Labour-controlled council, who is fighting in the Southampton Test constituency, said the city was 'like another planet' compared with the 1983 and 1987 elections. Mr Whitehead stood and lost in both those battles. 'Now, we're confident of winning,' he said. Evidence of a swing to Labour - given 45 per cent of the vote in Test against 38 per cent for the Tories in an ICM poll for Today newspaper - was supported by a sampling of street opinion yesterday. Five out of 10 people in Shirley High Street, a residential area of Southampton, said they would vote Labour, including two who backed the Tories last time. Three declared Conservative allegiances, with one opting for the Liberal Democrats and one undecided. A young mother pushing her baby said her high mortgage payments would make her vote Labour. A matronly volunteer in an Oxfam shop supported the Tories because of fears about a Labour government. 'I'm not very happy with either of them,' she confided. An unemployed youngster starting a training course, opted for Labour 'because the Tories have demolished the country'. Such defeatism was dismissed yesterday by Mr James Hill, the veteran Conservative MP for Test, defending a 6,954 majority. To capture Test and the twin constituency of Itchen, Labour will need a 7 per cent swing. Mr Hill said the poll would make his supporters try harder. A Labour government would cause a run on the pound and have to be bailed out by the International Monetary Fund. Comparing Labour with a 'blusterer' bragging about his driving prowess, Mr Hill said it might be salutary for Mr Neil Kinnock to have 'a turn at the wheel'. Mr Christopher Chope, the Conservative incumbent in Itchen with a 6,716 majority, refused to think the unthinkable. Support was holding up well, he said. Mr Chope said he had even taken his campaign to London's Wembley Stadium at the weekend to see Southampton play Nottingham Forest in the Zenith Data Systems Cup Final. Furiously plugging the anti-Labour line, he said Mr Kinnock, if elected, would kow-tow to the unions. 'His paymasters will be wanting a pay-back,' he declared. This was not, Mr Chope admitted while shaking hands with mothers at a local school yesterday, an election where there was much to be positive about.</p>

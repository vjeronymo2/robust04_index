			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (o) At KRS 350(15), Kentucky is requiring that the application include certain identifying information for the generating facility, a listing of each of the component materials the coal combustion by-products will contain, and the approximate volume in cubic yards and the approximate tonnage that will be received from the generating facility annually and for the term of the permit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (p) At KRS 350(16), Kentucky is requiring that the application include the results of representative sampling and laboratory analysis of each component of the coal combustion by-products for contaminants listed in Kentucky's administrative regulations. The analysis must test for certain metals and address neutralization potential and potential acidity and a demonstration must be made that each component of the by-products does not contain any contaminant at a concentration that equals or exceeds specified regulatory levels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (q) At KRS 350(17), Kentucky is requiring that the application describe the proposed methods of by-product handling and disposal, including methods of record keeping. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (r) At KRS 350(18), Kentucky is requiring that the application include appropriate maps and drawings of all areas and facilities to be used in the permit area for by-product handling and disposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (s) At KRS 350(19), Kentucky is requiring that the application contain a determination of the probable hydrologic consequences of the disposal of coal combustion by-products for the permit and adjacent area and contain a description of the measures to be taken to assure that the disposal will not pose a threat to human health or the environment, to minimize disturbances to the hydrologic balance, and to prevent material damage to the hydrologic balance outside the permit area. Certain protective and preventative measures must also be described, including measures to be taken to prevent coal combustion by-products from becoming airborne. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (t) At KRS 350(20), Kentucky is requiring that the application include baseline data to characterize the quality of ground and surface water in areas that may be affected by disposal of the by-products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (u) At KRS 350(21), Kentucky is requiring that surface and ground water baseline data collection and monitoring stations be established, as appropriate. In determining the number and locations of monitoring wells, the Cabinet shall recognize the distinct differences between disposal of coal combustion by-products under this section and the disposal of coal combustion by-products for which a special waste formal permit or a special waste registered permit-by-rule is required under KRS Chapter 224. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) At KRS 350(22), Kentucky is requiring that the characterization of ground water include certain specified parameters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (w) At KRS 350(23), Kentucky is requiring that the characterization of surface water include certain specified parameters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (x) At KRS 350(24), Kentucky is requiring that the minimum number of sampling events for ground and surface water for parameters beyond those usually required be in accordance with Kentucky's administrative regulations promulgated pursuant to KRS Chapter 224, pertaining to special waste landfills used solely for the disposal of coal combustion by-products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (y) At KRS 350(25), Kentucky is requiring that the application include a plan for the monitoring and reporting, until final bond release, of the quality of ground and surface water in areas that may be affected by disposal of by-products and for the monitoring of contaminants in the ground and surface water. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

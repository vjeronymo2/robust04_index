			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FOR WILL, THERE'S A WAY TO ENJOY THIS TOUR;  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK: THE POLITICAL COLUMNIST STOPPED BY THE BALLPARK TO SAY HELLO TO TONY  GWYNN AND OREL HERSHISER, TWO OF THE SUBJECTS IN HIS LATEST BOOK.  </P> <P> Men at work:  </P> <P> Political columnist George Will was sitting on the bench in the Padre dugout  before Tuesday's home opener, dressed in a sport coat and necktie.  </P> <P> Padre pitcher Mark Grant walked past, stopped and looked.  </P> <P> "You're out of uniform," Grant said. "You don't have a bow tie on."  </P> <P> They both laughed.  </P> <P> It has taken six attempts, but Will finally is enjoying a book promotion tour.  </P> <P> He was in San Diego Tuesday pushing "Men At Work," his sixth book. He was able  to get to San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium by late afternoon to say hello to Tony  Gwynn and Orel Hershiser -- two of the book's four main subjects, along with  Cal Ripken Jr. and Tony La Russa -- and appear on Jerry Coleman's pregame radio  show.  </P> <P> "This is fun," he said. "Most book tours are a grind."  </P> <P> While several players sat in the clubhouse and watched Will on Roy Firestone's  ESPN talk show (taped earlier), Will was in the Padre dugout talking to Gwynn  and then watching him hit.  </P> <P> On a local radio talk show earlier in the day, Will said Gwynn was the best  all-around player in baseball.  </P> <P> At the stadium, Will continued his praise.  </P> <P> "Put Tony in Fenway Park, and he'd bat .440," Will said.  </P> <P> Gwynn, whose first hit of the season was a single to right off Dodger starter  Tim Belcher Tuesday, said he has a copy of the book but hasn't read it yet.  </P> <P> "I'll probably read it on the (upcoming) road trip," Gwynn said. "I guess it's  good. George is a really good writer and a good person. I had a lot of fun  working with him."  </P> <P> Hershiser said he had started the book but had not finished.  </P> <P> "I think he's outstanding," Hershiser said. "I admire the man for his  analytical talent and the way he expresses himself. He has an amazing  vocabulary and a knack for using all of the right words in all of the right  places.  </P> <P> "I've learned a lot about a game I thought I knew a lot about. It will be  interesting for people to learn so many things about baseball that they have  taken for granted or maybe never knew existed."  </P> <P> Will is scheduled to travel from San Diego to the Bay Area today for more  promotional work. So far, he said, he has received good reaction.  </P> <P> "Jack Clark said he's even going to read it," Will said.  </P> <P> He was smiling.  </P> <P> "I like the way it sounds," Clark said. "He's writing it from a different arena  that people haven't been tuned in to. Some people say baseball is too slow, but  it's a fast game relative to everything that happens."  </P> <P> Add Will: Gwynn said he has already been kidded about being in the batting cage  in the early morning hours, something Will wrote in the book.  </P> <P> "That's not exactly true," Gwynn said, laughing. "Ten-thirty or 11, maybe. . .  . "  </P> <P> Will on home openers: "All the real baseball fans come on the second day, after  all of the suspenders and yuppies have gone."  </P> <P> Gwynn's obsession: Will's 16-year-old son, Geoffrey, has attended Gwynn's  hitting school over the Christmas holidays the past two years.  </P> <P> "You get so many names and faces that you don't remember them," Gwynn said.  "You remember swings."  </P> <P> Swings?  </P> <P> "We worked with (Geoffrey) on the angle of his bat," Gwynn said. "He was  wrapping the bat behind his head. We tried to straighten it out. He'll probably  be a pretty good little hitter."  </P> <P> Book tour mania: The ceremonial first pitch was thrown by former Padre and  Giant pitcher Dave Dravecky, who is also on a tour promoting his new book.  </P> <P> Dravecky, whose comeback attempt from cancer ended last season, was supposed to  sign books before tonight's game. That has been rescheduled because Dravecky's  wife, Jan, is ill.  </P> <P> That didn't prevent some warm reunions between Dravecky and some former  colleagues, though. He and Padre Manager Jack McKeon embraced in the hallway  outside the San Diego clubhouse an hour before the game. Then, McKeon kidded  Dravecky about throwing out the first pitch.  </P> <P> "If you look good, I might sign you," McKeon said.  </P> <P> Dravecky: "Well, I don't have an agent."  </P> <P> McKeon: "If you need an agent on your books, let me know."  </P> <P> How-soon-they-forget-dept.: Early in Tuesday's game, a note was flashed on the  scoreboard referring to the Cubs' victory over Philadelphia. Former Padre  Marvell Wynne singled home the game-winning run. The scoreboard referred to  "Marvelle." Coincidentally, former Padre John Kruk was also included in the  note -- he doubled home Philadelphia's only run.  </P> <P> Boo: You know Tony Gwynn received the loudest cheer during pregame  introductions. But the loudest boo? It went to Dodger Manager Tommy Lasorda.  Second-loudest went to Dodger outfielder Hubie Brooks, whose eighth-inning home  run Monday sent the Padres to a 4-2, opening day defeat.  </P></p>

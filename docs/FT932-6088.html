			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: Who wants to be a millionaire? - Many people, says Philip Coggan. But, short of inheritance or winning the pools, there is no easy way / Seriously Rich NEVER MIND how to invest a million. What most people would like to know is: how to get one. The prosaic answer is that most people become millionaires by one of two routes. They either inherit the money, or they work hard to build a business and create it. For most individuals, accident of birth has denied them the first option and the second seems like too much effort. This article is designed for those who would like to make a million without stirring far from their armchairs. There is no low-risk way of making a million, except to start with Pounds 900,000. All the following options assume the investor has modest savings. Accordingly, the rules of risk and reward come forcefully into play. If you want to make your million quickly, you have to risk losing your initial investment and the chances are that you will do so. There is precious little difference between some of the more 'serious' options considered and those which involve straight gambling. None of them should be considered unless the investor is willing to kiss goodbye to the money. So, with tongue firmly in cheek, and fingers crossed, here are some potential million-makers. THE FAST WAY Football Pools The pools companies altered the scoring system recently to try to encourage more jackpot winners. This year, Littlewoods says it has had five entrants who scooped more than Pounds 1m, including two who won more than Pounds 2m. That indicates the company might turn a dozen people a year into millionaires. Littlewoods has around 7.5m coupons a week so, if you do the pools every week, you have (very roughly) a 1/625,000 chance of becoming a millionaire within a year. Casino If you went in with Pounds 100, and bet consistently on red on the roulette wheel, you would need red to come up 10 times in a row for your initial stake to multiply into Pounds 1,024,000. (Provided, of course, that house limits, let alone your nerve, allowed you to bet Pounds 512,000 on the 10th spin). Ten consecutive reds might not seem too stiff a requirement. But since the house wins on zeros, you have an 18 in 37 chance of winning each time, so the chance of such a streak is the fraction 18/37 to the power 10, or around 1,346/1 against. Warrants A warrant gives the right to buy a security at a set price. It can normally be purchased for a fraction of the price of the underlying security. Say that the warrant gives the right to buy shares in Widget plc at 100p, and the share price of Widget is 110p. The warrant should obviously be worth at least 10p, and will be worth more the longer the time available for it to be exercised. Say the warrant costs 20p. If the share price increases to 500p, then a Widget shareholder would almost have quintupled his money. But the warrantholder will have seen the value of his holding increase from 20p to 400p, a 20-fold increase. If he had invested Pounds 50,000 to start with, he could have made his million. That is a fictional example. In his book, An ABC of Warrants, Professor John Pick cites the warrants on shares in the Burton Group, which reached a low of 0.5p in 1976 and a high of 312p in 1986. An investor with perfect timing could have turned Pounds 1,600 into Pounds 1m over those 10 years. But warrants can be dangerous investments. They pay no income and can expire worthless. Fortunes were lost in the Japanese equity warrant market late in the 1980s. As for the UK market, Pick cites how warrants in WPP, for example, dropped from 134p to 4p within a year. And the chances of finding another Burton are very small. Options Options behave very like warrants, only on a shorter time scale. They grant the right, but not the obligation, to buy a given commodity at a set price within a set time. Options are available on a wide range of commodities such as foreign currencies, gold or shares. While options can be used for very conservative, insurance-type purposes, budding investors will be attracted to them by their 'geared' nature. If the commodity's price rises, the right option will rise in value at a considerably faster rate; if the commodity's price falls, or even stays the same, the wrong option will expire worthless. There is one point about which investors should be very careful. If you buy an option, at least you can only lose what you have put in. But if you speculate in the market by selling an option, known as 'writing' in the jargon, your potential losses are virtually infinite. Penny shares. Polly Peck was for a long time the pride and joy of penny share tipsters. If you had invested Pounds 800 in the stock in 1980, it would have grown to Pounds 1m by the end of the decade. But an investor would have seen his million disappear quickly in the 1990s. It is a mistake to assume that a share is cheap because its nominal price is low; that, for instance, shares in Ratners at 40p are necessarily better value than shares in Glaxo at Pounds 6. What matters are the profits and the assets of the company concerned - and what proportion of those profits and assets each share represents. If there were just two shares in Glaxo, each would be a bargain at Pounds 1bn. Where penny shares can be profitable is when they represent either 'shells'  -companies with few assets which are transformed by a go-ahead entrepreneur or recovery stories. But such success stories are hard to spot and this week provided, in Speyhawk, a good example of a recovery stock that did not recover. Add in the fact that dealing spreads tend to be very wide on penny stocks, and the odds are loaded heavily against an investor picking another Polly Peck. All the above are high-risk ways of trying to make a million. What about more conventional investments? THE SLOW WAY Equities You can become a millionaire by investing in ordinary equities, but it could take you a long time. Had you invested Pounds 10,000 in shares in 1945, BZW figures show that you could have turned that into more than Pounds 1m by the end of 1989. Mind you, your performance would have had to match the index and you would have had to re-invest the net income. Nor do BZW's figures allow for any dealing costs. Furthermore, someone with Pounds 10,000 in 1945 would have been very well off - that sum is the equivalent of Pounds 185,000 today. Cash If equities are slow, an investment in a building society deposit is the real plodder's way of making a million. Assume you put Pounds 10,000 in a deposit which earned 7.5 per cent net a year. It would take you 64 years to become a millionaire. Even if you deposited Pounds 5,000 every year, and earned the same return, it would take you 38 years to reach Pounds 1m.</p>

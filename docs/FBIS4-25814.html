			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 15 (XINHUA) -- South Korea staged a  civil defense exercise, including an air-raid drill, for 20  minutes across the country this afternoon.    The drill involved all civil defense corps members, whose  job  is to organize evacuations and provide first aid for air-raid  victims.    South Korea has conducted monthly civil-defense drills in  the  past. But in view of "the tensions" over the nuclear issue of  the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), this month's  training was expanded nationwide and included more personnel and  equipment.    Today's exercise took place at a time when South Korea, the  United States and Japan are stepping up their effort to seek  U.N. sanctions against the DPRK since Pyongyang reportedly  banned inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) from testing samples of nuclear fuel in its reactors to  determine whether the fuel has been diverted to making atomic  weapons.    Pyongyang insisted that its nuclear program is strictly  peaceful and warned that any sanctions aimed at forcing it to  accept inspections will be regarded as a declaration of war.</p>

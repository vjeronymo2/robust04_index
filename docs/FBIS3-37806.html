His meeting with Russia's President Boris Yeltsin took  place in the Kremlin. Among the matters discussed was a  proposal for resolving the problem of the emigration of the  Russian-speaking population from the republic. Akayev put  forward an initiative to conclude an agreement on the protection  of the ethnic minorities within the framework of CIS. In the  afternoon Kyrgyzstan's president held a news conference. It was  attended by our correspondent Roman Babyan.    [Babayan] At the meeting with journalists, Askar Akayev  stated that many problems now facing the new sovereign states  have been brought about by the disintegration of the USSR,  including the problem of the non-native population, such as the  Russian-speaking population in these states. The Kyrgyz leader  said the emigration of the Russophone population from the CIS  countries to their historic homeland has reached a critical  dimension. Akayev voiced his concern about the outflow of  Russian speakers from Kyrgyzstan. Of late, some 100,000 people  had left the republic. Among the reasons causing the Russophone  population to emigrate from the CIS countries and, in particular  from Kyrgyzstan, Askar Akayev noted the following: the language  problem, the socio-economic problem, and the so called  discomfort problem connected with interethnic conflicts.  Speaking of the specific measures being taken by the Kyrgyzstan  leadership to contain emigration, Askar Akayev said in  particular:    [Begin Akayev recording] We are doing everything to preserve  the role and place of the Russian language in Kyrgyzstan. We  have preserved teaching in the Russian language in schools,  institutions of higher learning, the training of specialists in  Russian philology in the same volume as existed prior to 1990.  We have opened the Kyrgyz-Russian Slavonic University, the  first in our region and indeed perhaps the only one in the CIS  countries, which will become the center of Russian culture, so  as to impart promise to them, so that they will have confidence  and not tackle the problem by emigrating. [end recording]    [Babayan] Continuing, Kyrgyzstan's president called on all  leaders of the CIS countries to pool their efforts and to take  all necessary measures to contain emigration flows.</p>

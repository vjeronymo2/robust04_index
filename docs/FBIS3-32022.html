			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] FRAPH [Revolutionary Front for Haitian Advancement  and Progress] asserts that it is preparing a huge mobilization  for 4 February. The organization denounces the return to the  country of the UN/OAS civilian mission. The party led by Louis  Jodel Chambelain also asked for the lifting of the embargo:    [Begin recording in Creole] There is one group of people  making money on the embargo and another team fighting for power.  Meanwhile, the population is dying of hunger. There are no  health services or education.    Haiti is about to become a reservation on which all Haitians  are locked. The private sector asserts that it has provided  supplies to the people. Watch out for crooked dealers. The black  market will stop. Respect yourselves. For two and a half years,  the foreigner has realized that there is no worthy,  nationalistic Haitian, and who is defending Haiti because  Aristide alone is too small to make the foreigners humiliate  Haitians and Haiti [as heard]. There are still many more  Aristides in Haiti.    FRAPH firmly supports Senator Sansaricque's statements  regarding the UN and the OAS. They have started coming in in  another way. FRAPH, on behalf of the Haitian people, states that  it does not want all those foreign settlers from the civilian  mission who are the avant-garde of foreign intervention in  Haiti. The people are asking the country's authorities if they  are not in charge of the country's situation. Who gave the  authorization? Haitian people, keep calm, be alert.    On 4 or 5 February, FRAPH will stamp its foot, will ask all  the country's social classes, the youth, and all Haitians to  join together in a revolution. Forward, Haitian people! Forward,  Haitian people! [repeats] We are going to tell the foreigners:  Down with the embargo, down with hunger, down with misery, down  with unemployment! [end recording]</p>

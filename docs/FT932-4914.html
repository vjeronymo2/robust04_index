			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Letter: Price to pay for clearer roads Sir, I fully endorse your editorial, 'For whom the motorway tolls' (June 2). There should be two reasons for road pricing and fuel taxes. The first is to encourage more energy-efficient transport and a switch from road to rail. The second is to relieve urban congestion and pollution in Britain. As you suggest, there may be a third reason in the government's mind, namely to raise revenue for the massive budget deficit. This has nothing to do with the environment, any more than the VAT on heating bills does. To encourage more energy-efficient transport, taxes must be raised on fuel. In fairness, Mr Lamont, the former chancellor, indicated in his last Budget that the government would do just that over a period of time. There is plenty of scope for tax increases. The price of petrol is around 20 per cent cheaper in real terms than it was 10 years ago. A Pounds 3 gallon of petrol would not be out of order. There is no easy way of combating urban congestion. Fuel taxes will not significantly affect it, though they will longer journeys. Road pricing or severe restrictions on parking are the only solutions. However, as David Howell MP suggested (Letters, June 2), it is important to provide attractive alternatives for motorists, not just pocket the cash. I'm glad the FT is promoting this debate.

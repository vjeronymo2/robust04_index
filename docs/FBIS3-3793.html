			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Xie Zuan (6200 9449) ] </F>   [TEXT] Beijing, 17 March (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Today,  attending a discussion to solicit opinions with a delegation of  deputies from the Hong Kong and Macao region of Guangdong  Province who are attending the Eighth National People's Congress  session, Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs  Office, delivered a speech on the Hong Kong issue. When dealing  with the question of China-funded enterprises in Hong Kong, he  pointed out: China-funded enterprises should play their due  role in Hong Kong while refraining from involvement in some  activities. They should not do everything they wish to. They  should make contributions to the maintenance of Hong Kong's  prosperity and stability.    When discussing the question of constituencies in the first  legislature of the special administrative region government, Lu  Ping said: When the Preliminary Work Committee discussed this  question, participants suggested in a relatively powerful way  that China- funded enterprises should be counted as a  constituency, because they play a certain role in Hong Kong's  economy. He said: China-funded enterprises should undertake a  mission of maintaining Hong Kong's long-term stability and  prosperity.    Meanwhile, Lu Ping emphatically pointed out: China-funded  enterprises should play their due role in Hong Kong while  refraining from involvement in some activities. They should not  do everything they wish to. He said: Some people say that as  Hong Kong is a free economic society, why should China-funded  enterprises not do things that others can do? He pointed out:  China-funded enterprises should not get involved in certain  activities, because they have their own mission. They should  not just make economic contributions to the state. More  importantly, they should maintain Hong Kong's stability and  prosperity.    Lu Ping stated: By playing their due role, we mean that  China- funded enterprises should do things which are conducive  to Hong Kong's prosperity and should refrain from doing things  detrimental to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.  Illustrating this with examples, he said: They should not  engage in real estate trading, and we do not allow them to do  so. He pointed out: I hear some China-funded enterprises are  also involved in trading real estate at a profit. This brings  no good to Hong Kong. The price of real estate in Hong Kong has  been pushed up too high. He said: When they lose money in real  estate transactions, there is no need for some China-funded  institutions to pay for the losses. This means they compete  with other enterprises on an unequal footing. At the same time,  as there is no need for them to take responsibility for their  losses, they can push up real estate prices very high. He said:  This way of doing things must be opposed. He maintained: If  China-funded enterprises participate in the legislature as a  constituency, they will pay a positive role in various aspects  of endeavor, because they shoulder the glorious historical  mission of developing Hong Kong's economy and stabilizing Hong  Kong society.</p>

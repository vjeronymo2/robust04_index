			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 16 (CNS)--Stability should be  maintained in five sectors in a bid to ensure smooth reform set  for this year, according to authoritative sources in economic  circles.    First, commodity prices should be kept stable. Intensive  restructuring of means of production is now underway while price  reform for coal, electricity, oil, food and cotton covers a wide  field which will surely have an impact on prices for consumer  goods. The state plans to keep the price rise under ten percent  this year in line with the actual situation. Other measures for  the sake of steady prices will gradually come into force.    Second, economic growth should be kept under control. The  central government has set the gain at nine percent which is  better for China at this stage. Economic growth should not go  beyond the financial and material strength nor should it exceed  the capability of society to stand such a burden. Comparisions  among departments or regions on the pace of economic development  and the number of items to be exploited have to be avoided.    Third, agriculture should maintain steady development.  Judging from a certain period in the past when economic  austerity was seen, agricultural problems first of all surfaced  and the central authorities paid much attention to this sector.  Rural work meetings and agricultural work meetings and those on  food and oil work have since last year been held. Important  documents were issued on several occasions to call for relations  of the heavy burden shouldered by peasants. Priority should be  given to the interests of peasants and agriculture this year.    Fourth, the currency should be kept stable with the  stabilizing of the currency value the main issue. The central  bank has had a strong grip on the money supply and having  control on the amount of currency in circulation, the central  bank can regulate the general demand for currency. Whether the  amount of currency in circulation and the value of currency are  kept stable is directly related to the stability of prices,  society and economic development.    Fifth, social stability is considered a must for reform as  well as economic development.</p>

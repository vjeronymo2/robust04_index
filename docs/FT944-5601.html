			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Job cuts end revamp at AA Insurance AA Insurance yesterday more than halved its headquarters staff, completing an eight-month reorganisation which has cost 1,500 jobs and has been prompted by fierce competition in the UK insurance sector. Staff numbers at the Basingstoke headquarters of AA Insurance, which sells policies on behalf of insurance companies by telephone and in 257 shops, have been cut by 59 to 42. AA Insurance is 25 per cent owned by Eagle Star, the insurance company. Mr Mark Wood, managing director, said efforts would be made to find alternative jobs within the AA motorist organisation. 'The actions that we have taken are essential to make us more competitive with brokers and direct writers alike,' he said. Over the past year AA Insurance has lost about 300,000 motor policies, though it still has about 1.1m policyholders on its books and 2.5m general insurance policies in issue. Mr Wood was appointed in March with the brief to counter the threat posed by 'direct' insurance writers - which cut out brokers and their commissions. In September, AA Insurance announced the closure of a processing office in Cheadle, Cheshire, with its work being transferred to Newcastle and Cardiff. In total, the staff numbers have fallen to 3,700 from 5,200 in May. Mr Wood is attempting to match the operating efficiency of direct writers by improving electronic links with AA Insurance's panel of 40 insurers and by cutting overheads, particularly on claims handling. UK motor premiums have fallen by at least 5 per cent this year. It also hopes to work more closely with other parts of the organisation and is attempting to compete on quality - offering, for example, courtesy cars and transport home for motorists involved in accidents. Mr Wood said that by using a panel of insurers, AA Insurance was able to offer better prices for a wider range of customers than the direct writers.</p>

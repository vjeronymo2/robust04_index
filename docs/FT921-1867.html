			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Yugoslav foes become brothers in arms sales THE Serb-controlled Yugoslav army and the republic of Croatia, until recently at war, have joined forces to produce weapons for export, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade. Djuro Djakovic, a weapons factory in Croatia, will honour a Dollars 300m two-year contract for delivery of 200 M-84 tanks to Kuwait. The Yugoslav federal office which oversees arms sales said the outbreak of war had prevented Yugoslavia from fulfilling the contract. Croatia will get Dollars 300,000 of the Dollars 1.5m price of each tank. Factories from all Yugoslav republics contribute parts for the M-84s. General Antun Tus, chief of staff of Croat forces, admitted it may 'sound paradoxical that warring countries are in this joint business of production and export of weapons to a third country'. But he insisted there was no danger because the tanks were entirely under Croatian control.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Viktor Sergeyev report: "President `X': Whom to Back? </F> Results of a Sociological Poll"]    [Text] Despite the fact that it is almost two years until  the next presidential election, a number of politicians have  already started to prepare energetically for it.    Some are creating new parties, like Ye. Gaydar; others are  developing the infrastructure of already existing parties and  movements at regional level, like S. Shakhray and A. Rutskoy's  team; still others, like Yu. Skokov, are strengthening  influential all-Russian multisectoral associations, for example  the Federation of Commodity Producers, or are actively gathering  money, like Zhirinovskiy.    All this varied activity, aimed at creating positions to  give  them a spurt at the imminent presidential election, is filing  past B. Yeltsin's vigilant eye, as he himself put it, or else  the eye of the numerous Russian special services now subordinate  personally to the president. However, they are scarcely capable  of presenting an objective picture of the real influence of  potential candidates for Russian president in various social  groups today, since the leaders of the special services want to  please their Kremlin master too much.    Some food for thought is provided by a poll, conducted in  March by the "Vox Populi" service, of the eight most important  groups in the Russian elite: the State Duma deputies, leaders  of Russian ministries and departments, leaders of political  parties, directors, captains of business, top officers in the  Armed Forces, mass media editors, and also eminent figures in  science and culture -- 50 people per group.    When they were asked: "Which of the famous politicians is  now more capable than the others of leading Russia out of the  crisis?" -- the following curious data was obtained. B. Yeltsin  still occupies first place (21 percent), and second place is  occupied by G. Yavlinskiy (13 percent). Over a period of seven  months, starting with August of last year, when G. Yavlinskiy  was the undoubted leader with 28 percent (B. Yeltsin only had 17  percent), his rating has been falling inexorably. This is  evidently connected with his lack -- as a politician, and now  State Duma deputy -- of any specific results which the people  could evaluate in a positive fashion. Society has grown tired  of fruitless declarations, statements, and promises.    Third place, according to the Russian establishment, is  occupied by Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin (10 percent). At the  same time, during the past three months, since the  pseudo-reformers Ye. Gaydar and B. Fedorov left the government,  assessments of its activity have been fairly stable.    Yu. Skokov and Ye. Gaydar, who share fourth place, (9  percent  each) are breathing down the premier's neck. However, the  trends in the change of influence of these famous politicians on  the people who shape Russian public opinion are diametrically  opposed.    Since November of last year, when Ye. Gaydar (20 percent)  was  even ahead of B. Yeltsin (19 percent), his rating has been  falling constantly, and indeed particularly sharply since his  resignation from the post of first vice premier. Evidently this  rapid fall in Ye. Gaydar's personal popularity will not increase  the chances of success of the party he created under the trite  name of "Russia's Choice," which, in the eyes of the majority of  the electorate, is clearly associated with the defeat of the  democrats at the December elections.    Yu. Skokov, chairman of the Russian Federation of Commodity  Producers, who does not occupy any official state posts and does  not make showy statements, has conversely been steadily gaining  points during the six months. This can primarily be attributed  to his increasing practical work with leaders of enterprises,  labor collectives, trade unions, and entrepreneurs, aimed at  alleviating the consequences of the rampant fall in production  and restraining the growth in unemployment.    Among the top echelons of our society, V. Zhirinovskiy (3  percent) and S. Shakhray (2 percent) received low assessments as  figures able to lead the country out of the crisis. As can be  seen, Vladimir Volfovich's great popularity among the people  does not affect the cold reaction toward him in the top echelon  of our society.    It is interesting that S. Shakhray, who literally never  comes  off the television screens and the pages of newspapers and  periodicals, is experiencing a disastrous fall in influence in  the eyes of the people who shape our public opinion and who know  the people's real worth. In August 1993, he received 13  percent, in October only 4 percent, and in December only 3  percent.    Of course, any public opinion polls are of an approximate  and  subjective nature. People in the top strata of society are more  aware of the genuine professional qualities of people with whom  they often come into contact. But at the same time, those of  them who have a vested interest in the personal [favorable]  disposition toward themselves of specific statesmen and public  figures and above all the president and the prime minister, who  ensure their interests, can scarcely be objective.    The majority of the population is on the one hand strongly  subjected to the influence of targeted propaganda by the mass  media, and is inclined to believe in illusions connected with  simple solutions to complex problems which demagogues promise.  But on the other hand, ordinary people, who have felt at  first-hand the consequences of Ye. Gaydar's reforms (it is  enough just to mention the mass plundering of savings in the  savings banks), as well as of the state activity of politicians  such as S. Shakhray, are beginning to draw their own impartial  conclusions.    Of course the picture of public opinion obtained is clearly  not a complete one. People who have been put forward by the  left-wing (and possibly left-centrist) forces are not  represented in it at all. Meanwhile their influence in society  is very noticeable and it may grow in the future.</p>

			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MEASURE M'S APPROACH TO TRAFFIC WOES  </P> <P> In a practical sense, there's not one among us who cannot afford the half-penny  sales tax in Measure M that would help finance the construction and  installation of expanded freeways, better interchanges, transit systems and the  myriad of other improvements dated to occur during implementation of the  20-year transportation improvement plan.  </P> <P> Not approving the half-penny to clean up the transportation mess that this  county has gotten itself into simply means that conditions will become worse  and worse, with all of the negative impacts heaping atop one another.  </P> <P> Obviously, we should have passed such a transportation sales tax measure much  earlier. Have the politicians and the bureaucrats come up with the right  solutions this time? Are the transportation improvements that are so carefully  spelled out in the 16-page Sample Ballot Measure M description the right ones?  </P> <P> The answer is yes. This particular plan was written under the guidance of a  20-Year Master Plan Citizens Committee that represented all of Orange County.  These same people, and many others, also insisted that a Citizens Oversight  Committee should be mandated to watchdog the full 20-year transportation  improvement process.  </P> <P> Will the dollars be shifted around at the pleasure of officials? Not a chance.  Bucks can't budge from the allocated slot for which planned unless you approve  it by a separate vote. That's keeping the control where it belongs -- with the  citizens.  </P> <P> Last June, California voters approved Propositions 108, 111 and 116 that fund a  lot of transportation and transit improvements statewide. The urban counties  that have passed "self-help" sales taxes will be the ones that get virtually  all of the funds.  </P> <P> Of the major urban counties in California, Orange County is the only one to not  have passed at least a half-penny tax. The other counties don't really mind  that much. San Diego, Riverside, San Bernardino and Los Angeles counties will  split our funds among them if we let Measure M lose this time. While we wallow  in our traffic woes, they'll be laughing all the way down the widened freeways,  or as they grab trolleys instead of the keys to their cars.  </P> <P> We owe our youngsters a decent place to become grown-ups. We also owe it to  ourselves to do what we can, at extremely small individual cost, to make  Measure M happen. It's time to start fixing Orange County.  </P> <P> LELAND OLIVER, Santa Ana, Chairman, Orange County Chamber of Commerce  </P></p>

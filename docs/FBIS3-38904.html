			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The government maintains an extremely reserved  position on Rauf Denktas' sincerity and believes that its fears,  which have already been conveyed to the UN secretary general,  should be erased by the Turkish Cypriot leader himself during  the talks. This came out in a statement this morning by the  government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis, who stressed that  President Kliridhis is still awaiting clarifications he  requested through his letter to the UN secretary general.    Mr. Kasoulidhis recalled that in the past too, Denktas  appeared to have accepted some things, while in practice it was  established that this had not been the case.    Mr. Kasoulidhis further noted that at the president's  private  meetings with the political leaders, DISI [Democratic Rally],  AKEL [Restorative Party of the Working People], and DIKO  [Democratic Party] maintained that the Greek Cypriot side cannot  refuse to go to the talks.</p>

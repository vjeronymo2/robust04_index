			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORHOOD PROFILE: WESTERN YORBA LINDA: FOCUS;  </P> <P> YORBA LINDA KEEPS PAST ALIVE  </P> <P> Western Yorba Linda is keeping its past alive. Among its claims to fame is the  birthplace in 1913 of our 37th President, Richard Milhous Nixon.  </P> <P> The former President's family home (until 1922, when they moved to Whittier) at  18061 Yorba Linda Blvd., just off Eureka Avenue, has been a museum since 1959.  Today, what stands only as a wooden skeleton immediately outside the house will  be the Richard Milhous Nixon Library and Birth Place once construction is  completed. The library is scheduled to open July 20 and Nixon is expected to  attend.  </P> <P> In addition to documents and excerpts from the White House tapes, the library  will feature a video-image exhibit where visitors will be able to have a few  words with the former President. A questioner may touch a screen and trigger an  answer (from one of 400 video clips) that appears on the former President's  lips.  </P> <P> Visitors may hear Nixon's apology for the scandal that drove him from office:  "That the way I tried to deal with Watergate was the wrong way is a burden I  shall have to bear for every day of the life that is left to me." The city of  Yorba Linda isn't one to hold a grudge, however. The former President's  birthday, Jan. 9, is a local holiday and was celebrated this year for the first  time.  </P> <P> The neighborhood still looks like an equestrian haven. South of Yorba Linda  along Eureka Avenue stands a blue farmhouse and stables. The scent of horses  emanates from the area.  </P> <P> Even the development announced at the corner of Yorba Linda Boulevard and  Eureka promises equestrian lots and trails. The Buena Vida Estates will one day  grace the crest of the hill along Eureka Avenue with "4,100-4,150-square-foot  homes on spacious equestrian lots," the sign promises, in this "quiet and  secluded Yorba Linda setting."  </P> <P> Vestiges of the old frontier are in evidence here in western Yorba Linda.  Horses stand in a paddock along Lakeview Avenue toward Bastanchury Road and  stables announce their offerings. Three or four pumps dredge for oil.  </P> <P> The city's past is recognized with architectural landmarks. One of the original  red railroad cars stands prominently behind a yellowish engine along Imperial  Highway. The red railroad car, which reads MJB Pacific, once housed a  mini-museum but has been closed for many years because of vandalism.  </P> <P> Oranges were once the city's big cash crop. "Fruit was shipped out by the  carload while fertilizer, lumber, machinery and other supplies were delivered  here," reads a historical plaque at 18132 Imperial Highway. Here stands the  original depot built by the Pacific Electric Railroad in 1911 for the Yorba  Linda stop. This "big, red car," representing the first means of public  transportation, took townsfolk to Los Angeles nine times a day. The plaque even  includes a bit of folkloric whimsy: "As passengers approached," it reads,  "conductor Ben Foss would shout 'Yorba Linda, capital of the world!' "  </P> <P> Today the building's front door announces a restaurant, "Maloney's Station." On  the rear is a sign designating the saloon entrance. A recent fire closed the  restaurant and its reopening is as yet undetermined -- a modern-day variation  on the shoot-out in a saloon and other casualties of a frontier town.  </P> <P> The area demonstrates a curious mix of history and new construction. At 18200  Yorba Linda Blvd., a sign announces the site of the Yorba Linda Packing House,  built by the Yorba Linda Citrus Assn. in 1929. Today, the building houses  offices and a retail center.  </P> <P> At 4688 Olinda Street, the first schoolhouse built in Yorba Linda (in 1911) now  houses Pudmuckle's, A Tole-Painting Cottage. A plaque reminds visitors that the  craftsman-style structure was a one-room school. In 46 years, this public  building housed such public forums as the Chamber of Commerce, citrus  association, women's club, community church and a Sunday school. At one time,  the Yorba Linda Mutual Water Company also had its headquarters there.  </P> <P> Times past live on in Yorba Linda.  </P> <P> Population  </P> <P> Total: (1989 est.) 7,264  </P> <P> 1980-89 change: +17.2%  </P> <P> Median Age: 32.7  </P> <P> Racial/ethnic mix:  </P> <P> White (non-Latino), 76%; Latino, 11%; Black, 1%; Other, 12%  </P> <P> By sex and age:  </P> <P> MALES  </P> <P> Median age: 32.2 years  </P> <P> FEMALES  </P> <P> Median age: 33.1 years  </P> <P> Income  </P> <P> Per capita: $17,257  </P> <P> Median household: $49,799  </P> <P> Average household: $52,699  </P> <P> Income Distribution: Less than $25,000, 19%; $25,000-49,999, 32%;  $50,000-74,999, 28%; $75,000-$99,999, 13%; $100,000 and more, 8%ELENA BRUNET  </P></p>

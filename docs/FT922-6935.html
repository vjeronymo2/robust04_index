			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / International Company News: Mitsubishi Petrochemical falls heavily MITSUBISHI Petrochemical, a joint venture between Mitsubishi and Royal Dutch Shell, suffered a 35.6 per cent drop in pre-tax profits, to Y30bn (Dollars 225.56m), for the year ended March. The economic slowdown in Japan and abroad, and inventory adjustments cut petrochemical demand, the company said. Lower product prices were also accompanied by higher operating expenses. Sales at Mitsubishi Petrochemical, Japan's industry leader, were off 6.4 per cent to Y407bn, while net profits declined 40.2 per cent to Y15.4bn. By sector, sales of resins were up 1.6 per cent to Y167bn and fine chemicals 34.8 per cent to Y27bn. Sales of plastics, however, fell 18.6 per cent to Y161.5bn and special chemicals 1 per cent to Y50bn. The company's current assets declined 31 per cent to Y348bn, including a fall from Y186bn to Y118bn in cash holdings and from Y42bn to Y35bn in investment securities.</p>

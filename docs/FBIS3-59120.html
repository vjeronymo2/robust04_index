			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Taking Politics Back to the People"] </F>   [Text] So it is Back to Basics with Bill Clinton too: and  the echoes are instructive. Yesterday morning's State of the  Union was back to the basic pledge of health care reform -- back  to the basic conundrum of welfare provision; back to the basic,  visceral fear of crime. A driving domestic agenda from a leader  who against a backcloth of burgeoning economic recovery, has  staked his future on profound change to the U.S. body politic.    The parallels with B to B British-style are there to be  drawn. On crime, legislation that pours 15 billion pounds a year  extra into tougher, broader policing (Michael Howard, eat your  heart out) and catches headlines for its "three strikes for one"  proposal to lock up violent offenders for life on their third  conviction. (A frothy wheeze since, because it applies only to  federal territory, is most likely only to affect reservation  Indians and serially-violent sergeants on army bases). On  welfare (eat your heart out Portillo) the blending of training  and workfare grows ever closer, with the Michigan model of  safety nets snipped away after a finite term ever more dominant.  These are not the ways of J.K. Galbraith. Bill Clinton may be  a Democrat, but he is not a liberal Democrat -- and the  policies, mixing tough and tender in new ways, may turn to dust.  Remember, for instance, that California already spends more on  its prison system than it does on education.    But Clinton cannot be conventionally described in the old  categories of American politics, any more (much though John  Smith might wish it) than he can be translated to a British  context. His approaches to health care reform--the one,  inescapable mountain he must climb to succeed on his own  test--have scant ideological connection to his crime policies:  one a complex revolution involving government expertise, the  other an abdication of such philosophy. Yet, if there is  incoherence, it stems directly from the America he leads.  Clinton won the election, but on a minority of a split vote. He  is having, in practice, to forge a new coalition: and that means  building the interest blocs, the things that ordinary people say  and want, together. Leadership by reconciliation, balance and  distillation. That has all manner of weaknesses, if only  because the policies ordinary people want sometimes don't work.  But it is a process that engages enthusiasm rather than repels  it. Something active rather than think-tank passive.  Crucially, it looks to a better future rather than invoking a  golden past. And when Clinton yesterday openly acknowledged the  limits of government action, when he set "family, school, church  and community" far ahead as agents of change, perhaps he defined  why his B to B stands more chances than the Downing Street  version. He knows American government is distrusted and often  reviled. He preaches passionately--but not from personal  example. The message is people-based, not politician- based:  because those are the hearts and minds he must capture.</p>

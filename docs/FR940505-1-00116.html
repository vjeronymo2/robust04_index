			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (e) Vehicle Coverage and Test Frequency. The proposed FIP I/M program would cover all model year 1966 to 1998 gasoline-fueled vehicles, excluding motorcycles but including heavy-duty vehicles to 19,500 pounds Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR), including vehicles with engine-based certification. The proposed FIP I/M program would also cover all model year 1999 and newer vehicles of all fuel types, excluding motorcycles, but including heavy-duty vehicles to 14,000 pounds GVWR (except for 8,500 to 14,000 pound vehicles with engine-based certification). The IM240 tailpipe emission test would be performed on all vehicles including the heavier trucks for administrative simplicity. Model-year based cutpoints for pre-1983 light-duty vehicles are included in this proposed rule, as are cutpoints for heavy-duty trucks, although these latter cutpoints are subject to possible amendment prior to program implementation, based upon the experience of state-adopted enhanced I/M programs that begin operation prior to the scheduled implementation date for the proposed FIP I/M program. The purge, pressure, and visual inspections would be performed on all model year 1971 and newer vehicles. Older model years were not equipped with the evaporative control systems subject to the purge and pressure tests. EPA will also study the sales and in-use performance of pre-1999 diesel and alternatively fueled vehicles, to determine if significant, additional emission reductions can be achieved by testing such vehicles as part of the FIP I/M program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA proposes to require I/M testing biennially in the California FIP areas, with new vehicles being exempt until the second anniversary of the initial registration date. Notification of scheduled testing times would be through regular mass mailings conducted by the test provider(s), with individual motorists receiving notification no less than 45 days prior to the individual's testing deadline. The test provider(s) would use mailing lists obtained from the Department of Motor Vehicles to conduct the test notification mailing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has chosen to retain biennial testing for the California FIP's I/M program due partly from an interest to minimize the disruptive impact of the new program, but mainly because biennial testing is simply more cost effective, especially when conducted within the context of a high-technology I/M program such as the one proposed. Simply put, the IM240, purge, and pressure tests are so effective that a biennial test program will yield almost the same emission reduction benefits as an annual program. In its research on the relative benefits of test accuracy versus test frequency, EPA has found that doing the test right is far more important than doing it more often. Furthermore, the types of repairs needed to pass these high-technology tests are substantive and durable_something which is not always the case with repairs aimed at passing an idle-based I/M program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Waivers and Special Warranty Protection. The FIP I/M program would include the opportunity for owners of failing vehicles to apply for a cost waiver once they have spent at least $450, adjusted annually for inflation, in relevant emission control repairs. The $450 figure is required by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 for state-adopted, enhanced I/M programs. While EPA is not required to include such a waiver limit in this FIP, EPA is proposing this waiver limit because it is practical, ensures repair of virtually all failures, and will simplify the transition once California adopts its own program. The $450 figure will be adjusted annually, based upon the difference between the Consumer Price Index for the current year and that of a 1990 base year, and would not include costs related to the repair of tampering-related defects or emission control components the servicing of which are covered by an unexpired warranty. The test provider(s) would be responsible for issuing such waivers and for conducting a visual inspection to confirm that all claimed repairs have, in fact, been made. Motorists on public assistance would be able to apply for a one-time, non- renewable time extension on making repairs, not to exceed one full test cycle. Only one such time extension will be granted per the lifetime of a vehicle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The California Motor Vehicle Control Program provides for warranties similar to those included under Federal law. These warranties would be available to owners of failed vehicles up to the specified age and mileage limitations which vary depending on the model year of the vehicle. Special warranty protection would be available to owners of vehicles certified under the proposed enhanced in-use compliance program for model year 1999 and newer vehicles (see Section III.D.2.d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Enforcement and Oversight. Under the FIP I/M program, it would be a violation of Federal law for the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), its employees, or any other representative of the State of California to register any vehicle subject to the FIP's I/M requirement for which a valid certificate of compliance or waiver (either paper-based or electronic) has not been presented. DMV employees or other State representatives suspected of violating the FIP I/M requirement would be subject to prosecution under Federal law and, if found guilty, could be subject to civil penalties up to $25,000 per violation. Each instance of unlawful registration would be considered a separate offense.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Motorists who were late for either regularly scheduled tests or who failed to comply with an out-of-cycle test required because the vehicle was identified by a remote sensing unit (see below), would be assessed a late fee at the rate of $10 per week late. EPA requests comments on other means of enforcing program requirements, including the possibility of tying penalty fees to the length of violation multiplied by the level of excess emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Convenience Issues. EPA would make customer convenience an important criteria in entering into any legal agreement with a test provider(s). Minimum convenience requirements would be established and addressed. For example, EPA intends to require in any such agreement that test stations be sited such that 80 percent of all subject motorists are within a 5 mile radius of a test station, with 95 percent of all motorists within a 10 mile radius. Wait times between entering a test station queue and the initiation of actual testing would be tracked and would not be allowed to exceed 15 minutes on average. Scheduling individual vehicles for tests would be required to be done on a weekly basis, as opposed to monthly, to help reduce the impact of the end-of-the-month rush. To avoid being assessed a late penalty, motorists would have to report for testing sometime during the scheduled testing week, with the week beginning on Sunday and ending on Saturday. The test provider(s) would be allowed to use late fees paid by motorists who do not show up during the specified test week to either create an incentive program to stimulate off-peak test lane usage or to expand capacity. The test provider(s) would also be required to offer ``valet testing'' for a reasonable fee. Such an option would allow motorists to have their vehicles picked up for testing from their homes, work places, etc., and returned.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

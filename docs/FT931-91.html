			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / International Company News: Italian retailer rises to L102bn LA RINASCENTE, Italy's biggest retailing group, which is controlled by Fiat, raised net profits before minority interests slightly to L102.2bn (Dollars 63.5m) last year, from L100.9bn in 1991. Mr Giuseppe Tramontana, managing director, said the increase was significant in view of the substantial improvement in the quality of earnings, with fewer extraordinary items and higher profits from the core business. Profits before extraordinaries rose to L98bn from L72.4bn in 1991. Rinascente, which raised sales by 9.7 per cent to L5,040bn, marked the improvement in its earnings with a L10 a share dividend increase to L190 for ordinary shares and L250 for savings stock. The company has been the subject of widespread takeover speculation, but Mr Tramontana said he was not aware of any negotiations for a sale. Rinascente has spent heavily on new stores, particularly out-of-town shopping centres, to boost sales. This year's plans envisage 20 new stores, further expanding the chain from 743 units at the end of last year.</p>

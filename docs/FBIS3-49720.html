			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Janos Ader, deputy executive chairman of the </F> Federation of Young Democrats, by Attila Farkas; place and date  not given: "One Should Not Dramatize Viktor Orban's Statement"]    [Text] [Farkas] Preparation for the elections was the  major subject at the party conference at Sitke. From this  viewpoint, how do you evaluate the situation of the Federation  of Young Democrats [FIDESZ]?    [Ader] The preparation for the election campaign should be  evaluated from various viewpoints. One of the essential factors  is whether the party has the necessary infrastructure and  personnel conditions for a successful campaign. In my opinion,  the infrastructure and apparatus development that began in 1992  has now come to its last phase, and this process will be  finished by the beginning of the election campaign.    [Farkas] The other important factor is obviously the  selection of candidates. To what extent is this work ready?    [Ader] There are two branches of political preparations, and  in one of them, namely in nominating candidates, the preparation  is slowly coming to an end. We will hold a national committee  meeting on the first weekend of February, when we will approve  the list of candidates running in individual districts and the  territorial lists, and the meeting will also decide on the  national list. In addition, it is also important to formulate  the political program and the messages to the voters. Actually,  we are talking here about the expansion of the program elements  adopted at the FIDESZ congress in Debrecen, and formulating this  program in a language understandable for broader strata of  voters.    [Farkas] Regarding the nomination of candidates, to what  extent did the events that took place since the meeting in  November affect this activity?    [Ader] Fortunately, these events did not affect the  nomination of candidates at all; I do not know of any candidate  who withdrew from representing the FIDESZ at the elections  because of those events.    [Farkas] However, this process must have probably caused  problems politically....    [Ader] No party, including the FIDESZ, benefits from  personnel conflicts emerging on the eve of elections.  Naturally, this did us no good either, but I think the FIDESZ  has already overcome this period. The relevant debates in the  FIDESZ ended in November 1993, and now everyone is focusing on a  successful campaign.    [Farkas] The fact that the FIDESZ deputies in Gyongyos left  the party at the end of last week seems to slightly contradict  this....    [Ader] This is a fact, but I would not attribute particular  importance to this, because Gabor Fodor originates from Gyongyos  and the group of people there were connected to him. I am sure  that Gyongyos remains an isolated event, and I would be  surprised to see similar events in other areas.    [Farkas] Did the possible future coalition ideas affect the  nomination of candidates?    [Ader] This was not a factor in selecting candidates; the  decisive principle is to seek persons who are trained in a  certain professional area, are known and appreciated by the  locals, and accept the political values and goals of the FIDESZ.    However, a possible coalition formation did not emerge at  all  because there are a lot of uncertainty factors here....    [Farkas] Did Viktor Orban's recent statement and its various  interpretation cause any disturbance in the preparation for the  elections?    [Ader] This did not affect the preparations for the  elections. Besides, I find the coalition speculations rather  useless and a waste of time, even if I know that this becomes a  national pastime with the approach of the elections. We must  accept the fact that the future coalition will be determined by  the election results and the previous programs and political  orientations. Consequently, it is possible that a political  constellation emerges, which no one expects. In this respect,  our previous position continues to be valid, namely that the  FIDESZ is ready to cooperate with every party that accepts the  basic political values and the rules of democracy. The  compatibility of various party programs will basically affect  cooperation after the elections. We do not have any reason to  change our current position.    [Farkas] Is Viktor Orban's temporary silence connected with  the aforementioned statement? Are there any consequences of  this statement in the FIDESZ?    [Ader] I do not think that the aforementioned statement  should be dramatized, and it is also useless to add any  political combinations.</p>

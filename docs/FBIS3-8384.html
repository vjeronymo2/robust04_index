			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "km": "Diplomats Will Apparently Not Permit </F> Arms Manufacturers To Sell on the Iranian Market"]    [Text] The possibility that the RDP Group of Czech arms  manufacturers could negotiate exports to Iran of repair  technology for the T-72 tank is apparently not very likely.    RDP Group Director General Jan Vlcek asked Industry and  Trade  Minister Vladimir Dlouhy to make the political decision whether  his company may enter the Iranian market. Minister Dlouhy,  according to his spokesman Kamil Cermak, is awaiting, however,  the stance of Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec and Defense  Minister Antonin Baudys.    A source from diplomatic circles, who does not wish to be  identified, told MLADA FRONTA DNES yesterday that the Foreign  Ministry intends to honor international obligations and, on  principle, not export arms to high-risk regions. Although Iran  is not among the countries to which the sale of arms is banned,  many countries consider Iran a very high-risk region. "After  all, the situation in Iran is not calm and clear. It is in the  interest of the Czech Republic not to support armament in this  region," the diplomat added.    "The RDP Group does not want to export tanks to Iran; it has  never even considered it. The consortium discussed the  possibility of supplying repairs technology for these tanks,"  RDP Group press spokesman Jiri Vich specified. The planned deal  with Iran should revive some stagnating enterprises. The  expected financial volume of this order, which should be filled  over five years, allegedly amounts to $0.5 billion.    The RDP Group even founded its own bank, TOPFIN. By means of  this consortium of small and medium-sized banks, the  arms-manufacturing company should finance its production and  business transactions.</p>

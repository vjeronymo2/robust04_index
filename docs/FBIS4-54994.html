			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Pascal Barollier] </F>   [Text] Sarajevo, May 7 (AFP) -- The UN Protection Force  [UNPROFOR] Saturday [7 May] again appeared out-manoeuvred by  Bosnian Serbs after losing sight of a Serb tank on the slopes  above Sarajevo, little more than a kilometre (mile) from the  city centre. UN sources admitted late Friday that the tank, the  last of seven to pass through the Sarajevo exclusion zone as a  concession by UN envoy Yasushi Akashi, had escaped the  surveillance of UN military observers (UNMO) as it approached  the Serb-held suburb of Lukavica.    The disappearance of the tank was "intolerable," UNPROFOR  spokesman Eric Chaperon said at a morning briefing. Another UN  military official, speaking unattributably, said: "This is  farcical, to put it mildly."    The UNMOs lost track of the tank around 7:30 p.m. (1730 GMT)  three kilometres (two miles) south of the inner suburb of  Grbavica, Chaperon said. The tank's escape was "a clear  violation" of the February 9 ultimatum by the North Atlantic  Treaty Organisation ordering Serb heavy weapons to a distance of  20 kilometres (12 miles) of the city centre.    "The exclusion zone is still in force and the tank  represents  a threat to the city," Chaperon said. The military official  said the UNMOs had "seen the tank-transporter travelling empty  in the return direction and deduced that the tank had been  unloaded at Grbavica." "What is certain is that the tank did  not go through the checkpoint at Grbavica and that it is  therefore somewhere inside the city," the official said.    The ongoing fiasco over the Serb tanks was triggered by  Akashi's concession to Serb leaders in Pale last Tuesday  allowing them to transit through the exclusion zone under  UNPROFOR escort. The deal has "embarrassed" UN officials here  and exposed serious disarray in the UNPROFOR operation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Failures of communication between UNPROFOR  headquarters in Zagreb and officials in Sarajevo led to  conflicting statements by UN spokesmen as the Serbs exploited  the situation by sending their tanks into the zone without prior  notification.    Early Friday, as spokesmen in Sarajevo announced the  scheduled transit of two more tanks, the last of those initially  announced, Akashi in Zagreb said he was reversing his decision  as he felt he had been "deceived by the Serbs." The Serb tanks  proceeded anyway, without notification. One was blocked at  Lukavica and the other, which left from Pale late Friday,  escaped the attention of the UNMOs "somewhere near the bobsleigh  slope" that overlooks the city, Chaperon said. He blamed "poor  visibility" and said the UNMOs were slowed by the Serb escort  that was following the tank. "This is a problem of  communications relating to the UNMOs. It's the UN system taken  to absurd lengths, since they don't report to UNPROFOR but  directly to New York," a UN officier said on condition of  anonymity. "In addition the UNMOs move in groups of two, they  are a mixture of nationalities, and sometimes they don't  understand each other."    Akashi's initiative has allowed Serb military commanders to  expose serious communications problems between Sarajevo, Zagreb  and now New York. It has angered the Bosnian Government, which  considers the UN envoy has given a military advantage to the  Serbs and is demanding Akashi's resignation.    It also prompted a rare public rebuke Friday from the U.S.  State Department, which said the Japanese diplomat had erred  and that Washington had made down "our very strong concerns" to  the UN secretariat.    The Serbs now have four tanks within the NATO exclusion  zone,  two known to be at Hadzici and one at Osijek, in Sarajevo's  outer suburbs, and a fourth near the city centre which, Chaperon  said, "we cannot locate."</p>

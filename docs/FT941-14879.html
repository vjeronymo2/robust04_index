			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Vardy buys Swithland sites Reg Vardy, the multi-franchise motor retail group, has acquired three sites from KPMG Peat Marwick, the administrative receiver for Swithland Motors, the failed Midlands-based group. The sites - in Woodgate and Blackbird Road, Leicester and Hall Green, Birmingham - are to be extensively redeveloped before opening as franchised dealerships in the spring. Fiat and Alfa Romeo will be represented at Hall Green and one of the Leicester locations, while Vardy may relocate its Audi Volkswagen dealerships to the other newly acquired site. The deal takes Vardy's dealership total to 29 - of which 26 are operational  -and comes two weeks after it acquired a sizeable Toyota/Lexus franchise in Newcastle upon Tyne.</p>

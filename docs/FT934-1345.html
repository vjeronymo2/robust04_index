			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Israel, PLO end talks on deadlock: Dispute over Middle East border controls unresolved in Norway discussions Israeli and Palestinian officials ended two days of closed-door talks in Norway last night without any signs they had broken the deadlock over implementation of the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord. A draft statement issued by a Norwegian Foreign Ministry official, said: 'The two delegations went home for consultations and will meet again in the next few days.' The Norway talks were supposed to resolve differences between the two sides which have held up phase one of implementation of the peace agreement: an Israeli military withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and West Bank area of Jericho. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, said before the end of the talks in Norway that he would only attend a critical summit scheduled later this week with Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, if progress was made in Norway. Cabinet ministers who met in Jerusalem stressed that the government was united in refusing to make any compromise with the PLO over control of borders - the issue at the hear of the disagreement between the two sides. Officials said Israel wanted Mr Arafat to withdraw his demand for joint control and joint patrols on the borders between the Gaza Strip and Egypt and between the West Bank area of Jericho and Jordan. In return Israel, would allow a substantial Palestinian presence at the borders and would be more conciliatory on the other outstanding differences: the size of the Jericho area and the role of the Israeli army in protecting settlers who will continue to live in Gaza-Jericho. Officials say that behind the differences is a misunderstanding between the two sides, with Mr Arafat trying to win symbols of sovereignty from Israel in an effort to portray the interim self-rule period as the embryo of a Palestinian state. 'There is a basic gap in positions,' Mr Benjamin Ben Eliezer, housing minister, said. 'Yassir Arafat thinks that this is a process to establish a Palestinian state. We are talking only about a transitional period of autonomy to test whether co-existence is possible.' The gap between the two sides appears not to have been bridged in Norway, and the announcement that both sides were returning home for further consultation before another round of talks was seen in Jerusalem as meaning an inevitable further delay in the summit meeting. Both sides fear that further delays will fuel spiralling Arab-Jewish violence by extremists bent on sabotaging the peace agreement. Officials said the decision to resume talks at a country mansion in southeastern Norway, site of the secret talks which produced the Israeli-Palestinian agreement last September, was taken as both sides trusted the Norwegian brokers and had failed to make any progress in bilateral talks.</p>

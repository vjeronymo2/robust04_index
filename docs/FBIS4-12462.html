			<p>BFN     [Text] Our military correspondent reports that a  terrorist cell opened fire on an Israeli army post in 'Ali  al-Tahir area yesterday afternoon. Immediately afterward, the  Israeli army carried out a wide-scale combing operation in which  helicopters and tanks took part.    Meanwhile, South Lebanese Army personnel [SLA] manning a  tank  positioned in Kafr Rumman discovered the cell as it was entering  a red stone villa in the town. The SLA soldiers shelled the  cell, killing three elements from the Popular Front for the  Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] and wounding three others.</p>

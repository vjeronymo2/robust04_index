			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Cabinet Approves Italian Presence in </F> Hebron"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, 14 April -- A law decree authorising  the deployment of Italian observers in Hebron in the Israeli  occupied territories was approved in a cabinet meeting today,  Education Minister Rosa Russo Jervolino said.    The decree states that 35 Italian Armed Forces members and  technical experts will be sent to Hebron in response to an  agreement on the issue reached by Israeli and Palestinian  authorities March 31, on the basis of United Nations Resolution  904.    The scope of the mission, in which Italians will join 60  Norwegians and 35 Danes, will be "to provide all necessary  guarantees for the Palestinian people of the occupied  territories," a cabinet office communique said.    The observer mission, dubbed Temporary International  Presence  in Hebron (TIPH), will last a minimum three months, and was set  up after a Jewish settler shot at least 30 Palestinians dead in  a Hebron mosque February 25.</p>

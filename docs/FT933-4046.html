			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Markets do not destroy values Sir, Once again the market has come under attack for promoting the destruction of values that are the bedrock of social institutions. The dynamic within Lord Lawson's recent speeches may be 'yesterday's battle' to Mr Cleaver (Letters, September 8), but I must disagree. Mr Cleaver points to an array of the market's effects upon the social system, expressly focused on the ills of freedom. The result, he says, is the disincentive for long-term relationships and, in the end, broken or non-existent families. If one accepts Mr Cleaver's arguments wholesale, then maybe the answer should be an endeavour to create a 'valued' economic system which would dovetail with the accepted boundaries of social and moral spheres. Those spheres would presumably include a strong family centre around which their members' lives could find meaning and comfort. A daunting task indeed. Socialism was an outcrop of such general notions. It had its roots in the idea that the failures of a laisser faire market could be corrected by constricting it with specific social ends. It progressed, if that is the proper term, to forsake the market altogether and the results are plain to see. I wonder how far the well-being (however one might define that expression) of Mr Cleaver's family would degenerate after 70-plus years if we heed his warning by limiting those freedoms and ignore the more familiar remarks of Lord Lawson?

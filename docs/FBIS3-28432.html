			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Civilian Warmongers Must Be </F> Overthrown"]    [Text] Recently the South Korean puppets have been  frantically running wild with maneuvers of a Northward war of  aggression more than ever before, thus further aggravating  tension.    According to a military source, the puppet Army's tank  corps,  which was deployed in areas around Chomwon-ri, Paju County,  Kyonggi Province, near the Demilitarized Zone of the Military  Demarcation Line on 4 February, staged a ground offensive  operation exercise intended for Northward aggression under  coordination between mechanized units and infantry troops. In  addition, the puppet Army's large-caliber gun troops, which  advanced to the area in Kajon-ri, Imje County, Kangwon Province  in South Korea, took a posture of firing at our side, thus  gravely irritating us.    That day, armed hooligans of the puppet Army, who occupied  combat positions in areas around Nosang-ri, Ogum-ri and  Yongsan-ri in Paju County, fired at random more than 1,000  bullets of large-caliber machine guns and automatic rifles, thus  reeking of gunpowder. In addition, more than 10 armed  helicopters and transportation helicopters of the puppet Army,  which were mobilized in the air above Yonchon and Pochon in  Kyonggi Province and Chupa-ri, Chorwon County in South Korean  Kangwon Province, staged exercises of supporting ground troops,  dropping special units and transporting operational equipment,  while making low-altitude and super low-altitude flights.    In parallel with exercises of a Northward war of aggression,  the puppets are running amok with arms buildup maneuvers. It is  a fact already exposed to the public that the puppets are  scheming to bring Patriot missiles to South Korea in collusion  with the United States. In addition, the puppets recently  decided to buy three more German-made submarines.    Bellicose and violent remarks, such as preparations for a  combat posture, fostering combat capabilities and so forth, were  put forward during the recent conference of the puppet Marine  Corps commanders.    War exercises and arms buildup maneuvers, which have been  further strengthened in South Korea, clearly show how  frantically the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is running amok with  maneuvers of preparations for a Northward war of aggression.  The puppets justify their arms buildup and war exercises by  saying they were prompted by the threat of someone else.  However, this is a brazen-faced sophism.    The danger of war on the Korean peninsula comes from the  South, not from the North, therefore, the one who is subject to  threat is not South Korea, but our Republic. The United States  and South Korean puppets always keep in combat posture tens of  thousands of U.S. Forces in South Korea, who are armed with  modern war equipment, and nearly 1 million of the puppet Army.  They are also scheming to bring dark, dangerous clouds of war by  attempting to stage, by all means, large-scale exercises of  Northward aggression, including the Team Spirit joint military  exercise.    Moreover, the United States has recently forced brigandish  full-scope inspection [kangdojogin chonmyon sachal] on us on the  pretext of our nonexistent nuclear problem. By designating even  a deadline, the United States assumed a final notice-like  attitude [choehu tongchopsiguro naoda] by raving about sanctions  and the like.    Despite this fact, the puppets made gibberish about someone  else's threat and so forth. This is no more than a sophism  designed to mislead public opinion and to justify their  adventurous maneuvers of Northward aggression.    All fellow countrymen in the North, the South, and overseas,  who designated this year as the year of great national unity,  are hoping that a breakthrough is opened for reconciliation and  unity in conformity with the nation's enhanced zeal for  reunification. Therefore, the North and the South should discard  war exercises and arms buildup that go counter to the nation's  aspiration and demand.    As long as war maneuvers continue, reconciliation and unity  between the North and the South cannot be achieved nor can peace  and reunification of the nation be realized. Instead, tensions  will be aggravated and only confrontation and war will be  brought about.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is frantically running amok  with maneuvers of a Northward war of aggression to attack fellow  countrymen in collusion with outside forces. This is indeed an  intolerable antinational and antireunification criminal act that  challenges fellow countrymen's aspiration to reunification,  which goes against the nation's reconciliation and unity, and  which leads the situation to the brink of war.    It became clearer that the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime, which  is running amok with war maneuvers against fellow countrymen  under a veil of a civilian government, is the separatist regime  opposing reunification and a group of national traitors who  pursue only confrontation and war.    As long as the Kim Yong-sam group, which is not interested  in  peace, reunification, and fellow countrymen; remains in power,  our nation cannot avoid suffering disaster of nuclear war. There  is nothing to increase hope and expect from the traitorous Kim  Yong-sam regime.    It is natural for the South Korean people to call for  overthrowing the civilian warmongers. The South Korean people,  who want the nation's reconciliation and unity and who aspire to  peace and reunification, absolutely will not pardon the Kim  Yong-sam clique, a group of warmongers.</p>

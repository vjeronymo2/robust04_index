			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Shake-up for Welsh health bodies Health authorities in Wales are to be cut from 17 to five in a reorganisation which Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, claims will eventually save Pounds 3m a year, Roland Adburgham writes. The changes, which will need legislation, are planned for April 1996. They will involve the merger of district and family health service authorities. Mr Redwood said he aimed to reduce expenditure on management and administrative costs in favour of spending on direct patient care. The reorganisation follows consultation which Mr Redwood said showed a broad consensus on amalgamating the district and family health service authorities. The boundaries of the new authorities would be compatible with those of the planned unitary councils in Wales.</p>

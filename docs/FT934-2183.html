			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Few havens in stormy seas: FT writers on the effects on European exporters of exchange rate instability European business has had a rough ride into the new world of floating currencies. After the succession of crises in Europe's exchange rate mechanism over the past 15 months, hopes of a smooth transition to a single European currency have been dashed. Companies have been affected differently by the exchange rate upsets, which started with the ERM withdrawals of sterling and the lira in September 1992 and culminated in the forced widening of fluctuation bands in August. The overall effect, however, seems to have been a deepening of Europe's recession, now the most severe since 1974-75. Mr Rutbert Reisch, treasurer at Volkswagen, the German car group, says: 'We look upon European currencies as a freely floating exchange rate system. We treat the pound, the lira, the peseta and the French franc just like the US dollar, the Canadian dollar or the yen.' In recent days the Belgian and French currencies, underpinned by firm domestic monetary policies, have returned to the narrow bands of the ERM's 'hard core' that preceded the July-August shocks. But European governments and central banks reject any possibility, for now, of formally re-introducing narrow bands, as this would encourage fresh disruptive speculation. Although the downturn is bottoming out in the continent's two largest economies, Germany and France, gross domestic product across industrialised countries in Europe is likely to grow only 1.5 per cent next year after contracting 0.2 per cent this year, according to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development forecasts. Exporters from countries with devalued currencies, such as Italy, Britain, Spain and Sweden, have gained competitiveness - helped by the success of these states in holding down domestic wage costs. Yet for the whole European economy, these benefits have been outweighed by the negative economic impact of currency appreciation in Germany and in ERM members still linked to the D-Mark. Since Germany is the destination for 20 per cent of the total exports of its EU partners, this year's estimated 1.5 per cent contraction of the German economy has hurt Europe. The effect of low growth on the Continent on British export prospects will be spelt out on Friday in the Confederation of British Industry's latest monthly survey. Mr Andrew Sentance, the CBI's economics director, says UK exporters have often failed to realise hopes that devaluation would produce sales gains in the rest of Europe. 'The increases in export volume have come mainly from non-EU areas like North America, Japan and the Far East. The problem with Europe is that it is not growing.' Britain's Imperial Chemical Industries, which registered a 15 per cent increase in exports in the third quarter this year, is one of the few big European manufacturers to see the currency changes as an unalloyed blessing. 'Increased export competitiveness after the depreciation of the exchange rate has been our saving grace,' says Mr Richard Freeman, ICI's chief economist. German companies, by contrast, have registered sharp declines in competitiveness. While production costs in Germany have been rising faster than in most of its trading partners, the D-Mark has registered a real revaluation of about 9 per cent on a trade-weighted basis over the past two years. German exports have become cheaper in the US and other countries linked to the dollar, thanks to a general fall of all European currencies against the dollar since summer 1992. But Germany conducts only a small share of its trade with the dollar area. A senior Bundesbank economist notes that this is the first postwar German recession in which increased exports will not be able to lead the recovery. The revaluation squeeze is the main reason for large job cuts and vigorous restructuring throughout the German motor, chemicals and engineering sectors, says Mr Hans-Peter Frohlich, an economist at the Cologne-based IdW economic institute. 'German industry can cope with the crisis. The big problem is how society will cope with the effects,' he says. Amid the general gloom, there are some bright spots. Among the companies to have profited from exchange rate turbulence, Italian exporters head the list. The lira's decline has allowed them to draw maximum benefit from a fall in wage inflation following last year's abolition of the scala mobile system, under which wage rises were linked directly to inflation. Mr Stefano Micossi, research director at Confindustria, the Italian employers' federation, says: 'Devaluation has been extremely beneficial to Italian industry. Companies with a big export component in their total turnover are already seeing an upturn. The crucial part was devaluing while having dismantled wage indexation.' Italian sales have risen especially sharply to non-EU countries, led by Asia and Latin America, with exports to China expected to double to more than L4,000bn (Pounds 1.56bn) this year, representing almost 3 per cent of Italy's total sales abroad. But industrialists in countries still linked to the D-Mark have more sober stories to tell. KNP BT, a big Dutch paper and packaging group, is feeling the negative effects of the exchange rate changes in its graphics and information systems businesses in Spain and Italy. It must compete with big Scandinavian-based paper companies, which have profited on export markets because of declines in the Swedish and Finnish currencies. France has maintained a tight monetary policy since the ERM crisis to keep as close as possible to the D-Mark. The franc's success in regaining its narrow-band ERM trading range ranks in Paris as a minor victory for the government. Some French executives say, however, that the price of maintaining a firm franc - the slow pace of interest rate cuts since the August ERM squalls - has been too high. The chief executive of a leading French industrial conglomerate complains that France's interest rates are still too high to allow satisfactory growth. 'Today we are experiencing the most serious crisis for 50 years,' he says. In Denmark - where the National Bank, like the Bank of France, has tried to maintain a close link to the D-Mark - the strong krone has put pressure on corporate profits. Carlsberg, the breweries group, reported a 29 per cent increase in the volume of beer sold worldwide (most brewed abroad) in the year to September 30. In terms of Danish krone, however, net sales (excluding excise taxes) increased only 10 per cent, and operating profits were almost unchanged. In countries with devalued currencies, too, the corporate picture is far from rosy. In Spain, the peseta's devaluation has benefited exporters as well as some domestically orientated companies, such as cement groups, which have seen foreign competitors forced to increase their prices. But the peseta's decline has had a negative effect on companies with large foreign currency debts. Casualties include the electrical utilities as well as Seat, the Spanish subsidiary of the Volkswagen car group, which has been hit by heavy losses on its borrowings - almost all in D-Marks. In view of Sweden's large devaluation since it severed its link with the European Currency Unit in November last year, Swedish economists reckon the country's industrial competitiveness has risen by 20 per cent over the last year. But Swedish exporters have yet to reap the expected rewards. 'The main reason we haven't benefited as much as we could have done is the recession in Europe, particularly in Germany,' says Mr Magnus Lemmel, head of the Federation of Swedish Industries. Another restraint is that many of Sweden's big multinationals made heavy investments in the rest of Europe during the 1980s. In many cases, key elements of production are now based in hard currency countries such as Germany and France. For European companies' exports, the integration of the single market can bring drawbacks as well as benefits. Most members of the EU and the European Free Trade Association now conduct between 65 and 80 per cent of their trade with each other - a degree of interdependence which can prove counter-productive when Europe's economies suffer simultaneous downturn. According to Ms Frauke Neumann, a trade specialist at Germany's Munich-based Ifo economic research institute, many German companies are trying to correct what they see as their 'over-dependence' on the European market. Ifo says recent indications of brighter German export prospects are based especially on expectations of revived demand in East Asia, the US and eastern Europe. The dollar's strength has been an additional factor prompting German companies to switch their export efforts. But sales to such regions can give only sporadic hope to exporters trying to escape recession and currency uncertainties in Europe. Most European business leaders instinctively favour currency stability as a means of improving their corporate fortunes. But a precondition for more settled exchange markets is that governments maintain tough measures to increase economic convergence. In view of the unpopularity of these measures, there are doubts, in a number of countries, on how long they will be maintained. As Europe heads for another year of low growth, there is little sign that currency stability is about to make a comeback.

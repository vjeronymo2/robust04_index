			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Last tin mine in Pounds 1m battle for survival Five hours before the midnight deadline last night, Britain's last operating tin mine, South Crofty near Redruth in Cornwall, was still fighting to raise the Pounds 1m it needed under the terms of a survival package agreed with the government. By yesterday afternoon Pounds 475,000 had been promised by local people and private investors and Mr Kevin Ross, managing director, was said to have spent all day on the telephone in final negotiations with unnamed parties for the other Pounds 525,000. 'We remain confident,' said a South Crofty official. Mr Ross on June 29 made an emotional appeal to investors to provide up to Pounds 1.8m for South Crofty, which can trace its roots back for 400 of the 2,500 years tin has been mined in Cornwall. He revealed that, if the mine could raise the minimum Pounds 1m to ensure its survival for another 18 months, the government would write off loans totalling Pounds 23.4m. Also the RTZ Corporation, which sold South Crofty and its sister mine Wheal Jane to management and employees in 1985, would forgive loans of Pounds 7.7m. These loans are interest-free but their presence on the balance sheet make it very difficult for South Crofty to raise more money. South Crofty employs 260 people - most have taken regular cuts in pay to help the mine survive so far - and produces about 2,200 tonnes of tin a year in concentrate (an intermediate material), which is all sent for refining to the DKS smelter in Malaysia. The mine needs a tin price of about Pounds 4,000 a tonne to make a decent profit. The price peaked at Pounds 10,021 in February 1985 and fell to a 20-year low of Pounds 2,946 in September 1993. At present the price is about Pounds 3,400 a tonne.</p>

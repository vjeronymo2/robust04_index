			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Counselor Muhammad Sa'id al-'Ashmawi, </F> "retired" court president and Islamic writer, by Majdi Hasanayn;  place and date not given]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Hasanayn] How would you  explain Saudi criticism of you and your books, especially as the  control of media organs by some Saudi circles raises questions?    [Al-'Ashmawi] Saudi Arabia, in the Arab and Islamic  countries, follows the same method that Zionism used to control  the economy, media, and press of the United States and Europe.  With this, Saudi Arabia seeks to control the minds, eyes, and  ears of the Arab nation, with particular interest in Egypt. So  it buys people to use against Egypt, whether directly or  indirectly, particularly to promote the Wahhabite doctrine in  Egypt.    [Hasanayn] Does this mean we are living the Saudi era and  that Egypt's role and leadership have shrunk?    [Al-'Ashmawi] I cannot say that Egypt has lost its role. But  we notice this Saudi trend of trying to control the affairs of  the Arab world, particularly Egypt, whether by buying writers or  exploiting institutions and maneuvering them from behind the  stage.    [Hasanayn] We seek to establish sound inter-Arab relations  that can enable us to face world challenges. But are Saudi  hands financing terrorism in Egypt?    [Al-'Ashmawi] No question. Clearly, some Saudi circles and  individuals finance terrorism in Egypt and support some  preachers here and there. I believe the Egyptian Government  knows of this and occasionally tries to draw Saudi officials'  attention to the issue calmly. But Saudi Arabia tries to clear  itself of this charge by claiming that the financing comes from  the private sector. Some people wonder about this because in  Saudi Arabia there is no private or public sector. A recent  announcement regarding a Bin-Ladin family member who lives in  Sudan and who is accused of financing terrorism and the naming  of three Ladin sons who work in a private security firm that  tried to infiltrate Egyptian security are the best proof that  what I am saying is true.    I could confirm that there is covert cooperation among Saudi  Arabia, U.S. intelligence, and Israeli intelligence--whether  Saudi Arabia knows of the consequences of this or not--to  finance terrorism in Egypt and throughout the region. Foreign  magazines have published reports that U.S. intelligence financed  over 100 Islamic conferences attended by extremists. In  collaboration with the Mosad, U.S. intelligence encouraged the  extremist movements, which are called Islamic, to promote  Islamic nationalism to counter pan-Arabism. Some continue to  encourage extremists in Egypt with a view to weakening it for  the next 10 years. From their point of view, this will be  enough to virtually freeze its role as a leading country in the  region for over a century. [passage omitted]    [Hasanayn] Some people believe the confrontation with  Israel as the main enemy of the Arab nation must be based on the  religious state, as is the case with Israel itself. How do you  view this issue?    [Al-'Ashmawi] I mentioned before in my book Political  Islam that the establishment of the State of Israel was one  of the most important causes behind the spread of extremism in  Egypt and the Arab world. But I hope it is now understood that  Islamic extremism serves Israel's goals by distorting the image  of Islam and weakening the Egyptian state, the natural leader of  the Arab nation. The cultural way is the right course for  confronting the State of Israel. The struggle between us and  Israel is not a fundamentalist one. It is a cultural one. If  we do not master every factor of culture, then Israel will win.  I stress that Islamic extremism is enhancing Israel's position  in the world and giving it the golden opportunity to distort  Islam and make Egypt backward.    [Hasanayn] What is your view of the slogans of freedom and  democracy that some of political Islam's groups are raising and  that are demanding that authority be rotated through free  elections?    [Al-'Ashmawi] They claim this because most Arab and Islamic  governments are totalitarian. These groups seek to attract the  ordinary people and the opposition to their ranks. They also  want to address foreign circles and international human rights  organizations. But they want democracy to destroy democracy  through democracy and spoil freedom through freedom. For these  groups, democracy means one voice for one man and once only.  When they attain power, they will eliminate every democratic  movement, because their nature is totalitarian, not democratic.  They believe sovereignty does not belong to the people and that  the people have no right to legislate for themselves. These are  antidemocratic views. This was declared by Ali Belhadj, the  second man in the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] in Algeria,  after the first round of elections, when he said democracy is  blasphemy. This compelled the Algerian Army to confront the FIS  outside the framework of democracy, which the FIS believes to be  blasphemy. In Egypt, the religious extremist leaders have often  said that democracy is blasphemy. Dozens of leaflets are found  on the pavements confirming this. When they talk of democracy,  they are voicing that which they do not believe in and following  the method of al-Taqiyyah, which is one of the pillars of the  Shiite sect [allowing followers to hide their religion to escape  persecution], to which the groups of political Islam resort.

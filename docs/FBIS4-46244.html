			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 27 May (EFE) -- Otilia Polay, mother of Victor  Polay Campos, head of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement  (MRTA), today asserted that her son is subject to a prison  regime that is "inhuman, and destructive to his physical and  mental health."    Polay was sentenced to life imprisonment, which he is  serving  in a prison at the naval base of the port of Callao, where  Shining Path [SL] leader Abimael Guzman is serving a similar  sentence.    Otilia Polay voiced concern over her son's health, and said  she was worried about the "physical deterioration and  psychological strain" under which she found him during a visit  she paid on 24 May.    Mrs. Polay added that this was the first time in 14 months  she had been allowed to visit her son, whom she believed was  "being illegally maintained in complete isolation, as according  to the law he can be maintained in isolation for a maximum of  one year."    Otilia Polay said her son told her he is completely isolated  in a cell measuring two meters square with a skylight 15  centimeters square, and that at night the very poor artificial  light does not even allow him read the Bible, "the only book he  is allowed to read."    She added that her son told her that for months he was  allowed out into the daylight for only five minutes a day, and  that now he is allowed 15 minutes a day "when according to the  law he should be allowed 30 minutes."    The mother of the terrorist leader stated: "He is completely  isolated and not allowed to speak to anybody." She said she  believes that "the only purpose of all this is to destroy him  physically and mentally with a system that violates minimum  human rights."    Polay told his mother that Abimael Guzman and other SL  leaders who are in the same prison "receive numerous visits, and  are able to assemble freely and go out in groups into the  daylight for much longer" than he is allowed.    Otilia Polay today held a news conference at the Democratic  Constituent Congress (CCD), where she appeared to request an  audience with the members of the Human Rights Commission to  explain her son's situation and lodge a formal protest, she said.</p>

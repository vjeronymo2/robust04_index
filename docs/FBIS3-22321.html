This was the consensus  arrived at during the two-day international conference of  environment ministers. At a joint press conference in Agra,  they advocated expanding trade in such a way that it would  reduce poverty in areas where it exists and at the same time  address environmental concerns. They said the implementation of  the forest principles adopted at Rio should be given special  attention. The ministers recommended that a special task force  be set up in all countries for the sustainable development of  forests. The ministers also expressed the hope that the  differences of opinion on restructuring and replenishment of the  global environment facility should be quickly resolved.  Environment ministers from 10 countries including Brazil,  China, Malaysia, Germany, and Britain attended the conference  along with representatives of leading environmental agencies.</p>

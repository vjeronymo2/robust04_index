			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 30,000 GALLONS OF MILK TAINTED WITH ANTIBIOTIC RECALLED  </P> <P> Santa Ana-based Adohr Farms on Friday recalled more than 30,000 gallons of milk  and other dairy products contaminated with an antibiotic, but as much as 5,000  gallons of the tainted product may have been sold, officials said.  </P> <P> The milk contains beta-lactam, an antibiotic residue of penicillin that could  cause an allergic reaction in some people but does not pose a general health  risk, state health officials said.  </P> <P> A company spokesman said the milk was shipped to 80 7-Eleven stores in Orange,  Riverside and San Bernardino counties and 40 of the convenience stores in San  Diego County. Officials said they do not know how the penicillin got into the  milk products.  </P> <P> The products affected by the recall are one-gallon containers of whole milk  dated Sept. 10, half-gallons of nonfat milk dated Sept. 9 and pints and quarts  of Nestle's chocolate milk dated Sept. 12.  </P> <P> An Adohr spokeswoman said the recall is a "voluntary precaution" and no  illnesses had been reported.  </P></p>

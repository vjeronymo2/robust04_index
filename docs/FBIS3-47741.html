General Doan Khue, member of the  party Central Committee Political Bureau and minister of  National Defense attended the seminar.    The TAF commander delivered a report on the activities of  the  force during the past few years. He pointed to its great  efforts in improving its organization and personnel to meet the  requirements of localities, military regions, and key strategic  areas.    Despite numerous difficulties in equipment, budget, and  facilities, the TAF has closely coordinated with the army corps,  military regions, and localities to build and strengthen its  units, improve training, and maintain combat readiness. The  force has also striven to recruit and train new cadres,  specialized personnel, and workers. Various units of the force  have consistently improved training and fulfilled all their  assigned tasks. They have closely combined the task of building  firm and comprehensively strong units with that of modernizing  and standardizing the army.    The seminar provided ample time for delegates of the army  corps, military regions, and military units to discuss and  exchange experiences on training and maintaining the spirit of  combat readiness, military and joint operations, and other tasks  related to national defense.    Speaking at the seminar, the minister stressed: In building  and training, the TAF should implement the motto: firmly  maintain basic principles and effectively apply past combat  experiences. Cadres of the force must carefully study the  enemy's capabilities while formulating concrete plans and  projects to enhance the quality of training at various units.  They must also strive to fulfill their tasks in order to attain  standardization, build comprehensively strong units, set up firm  and strong defense zones, and step by step advance toward  modernizing the army. These are essential tasks for making the  TAF units strong and firm so that they can fulfill new tasks and  meet the requirements under all circumstances for the cause of  national defense and construction.</p>

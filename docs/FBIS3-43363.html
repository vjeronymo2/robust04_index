The Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party  [MPLA- PT] provided the Riot Police with such equipment. A FALA  officer, who was part of the Joint Political and Military  Commission, said the Bicesse Accord is quite clear when it says  that no country or government may supply lethal equipment to any  of the signatories of the accord.    Yesterda, ABC, which is published in Madrid, reported that  the Spanish opposition demanded explanations about the sale of  weapons to the MPLA-PT when the Bicesse Accord was still in  force. Felipe Gonzalez' government refused to comment, alleging  that the equipment delivered to the MPLA was a state secret.    Meanwhile, ABC says the Spanish Government has confirmed its  participation in training the MPLA's riot Police. Our FALA  sources said Spain should be condemned by the UN Security  Council for its involvement in the violation of the Bicesse  Accord.</p>

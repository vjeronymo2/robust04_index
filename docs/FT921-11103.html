			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / The Week Ahead RESULTS DUE NEWSAGENT and retailer John Menzies comes out with interims today expected to show pre-tax profits of about Pounds 3m. This is good or bad, depending on how you look at it. Last year's Pounds 4.2m profit was depressed by exceptionals of Pounds 4m due to the losses at Hammicks. This year, there should be no exceptionals and proof will have to be shown that Hammicks losses have been stopped. Analysts will also want to hear about Menzies' Christmas trade after after WH Smith's encouraging news this past week. Last but not least, some idea should be given on the fate in the US of the Early Learning Centres, the supplier of books and toys to young children. Forecasts for the year ended April 30, bolstered by Christmas turnover, run between Pounds 27.5m and Pounds 29.5m against Pounds 21.5m a year earlier. A modest 15 per cent growth in pre-tax profits to around IPounds 30m is being predicted for Fyffes' year-end results due tomorrow. Market analysts believe that the Dublin-based fruit and vegetable wholesaling group has had a reasonable year, despite the recession in the UK market. Although banana sales may have been down, there has been buoyant growth in other fresh produce sales. The market continues to hold expectations of a link-up with a distributor in continental Europe to expand the group's operations, and the company's share price has risen substantially in recent months.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Valerian Advadze, the Georgian Republic's </F> Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Ambassador to the Russian  Federation: "To Our `Well-Wishers'"]    [Text] For several months, someone in Tbilisi has been  deliberately spreading rumors that Georgia's embassy in Russia  is idle; they have practically implanted this notion in the  minds of people who don't know the real situation. Their  principle is that a lie that is told fourteen times becomes more  convincing than a truth that is told once--but they forget that  the truth is a sharper sword than a lie.    The embassy's work has a closed and unseen side which, like  an iceberg, is much bigger than what is visible. I will not say  anything about it here; diplomacy does not like to be  advertised. Its results will speak for themselves.    The main object, the embassy's prime task until now, has  been  accomplished: two sovereign states--Georgia and Russia--have  concluded a major agreement and other agreements; we have  created the juridical base for cooperation on an equal footing.  This is an historic event in the life of Georgia, and our  embassy has made its own contribution.    Now I will say something about the visible part of the work  of our embassy and myself as the ambassador. For more clarity, I  will cite some comparisons:    The ambassadors of 166 countries are now accredited in  Moscow. I can affirm that all of them together in the past 10  months have not held as many press conferences as Georgia's  ambassador and embassy have, or given so many interviews to the  mass media as Georgia's ambassador and embassy officials have.  All of the 166 ambassadors together have not appeared on Russian  television as often as Georgia's ambassador has. Those embassies  have not made as many statements to the media or sent as many  notes (verbal or written) to Russia's Foreign Affairs Ministry  as the Georgian embassy has, concerning our country's most  urgent questions.    No other ambassador has done more than Georgia's ambassador  to contact, negotiate, and talk with Russia's and Moscow's  leaders about our country's economic, political, military,  social, and other issues--leaders such as Yeltsin, Chernomyrdin,  Soskovets, Shokhin, Shakhray, Kozyrev, Grachev, Kolesnikov,  Gromov, Luzhkov, members of Russia's former Supreme Soviet, and  other high officials of the Foreign Affairs Ministry.    No other ambassadors and embassy diplomats in Moscow have  had  so many meetings and talks with the ambassadors of other  countries (including ambassadors of the Big Seven) and embassy  diplomats to clarify their countries' position, as have  Georgia's ambassador and embassy diplomats.    That is the truth, and if that isn't diplomatic activity on  our part, what is?    Now let us talk about other aspects.    No other embassy does more about its country's economy than  Georgia's embassy.    No other country's embassy and ambassador (including those  of  the CIS) has received and entertained so many official,  business, unofficial, and non-business delegations, businessmen  and non-businessmen, members of parliament, and lower-ranking  officials and our own ordinary citizens countrymen (generally  without prior appointment, people who happen to be in Moscow),  as Georgia's ambassador and embassy have.    All the ambassadors and embassy diplomats of the 166  countries together have not taken in so many refugees as  Georgia's embassy has, as many countrymen arriving in Moscow or  going to other countries via Moscow, as our embassy has, or had  to cope with as many headaches as our embassy staffers.    And that is the truth!    After all that, how can anyone with a trace of elementary  human decency say barefaced that Georgia has no embassy or  ambassador in Moscow?    Now let's look at the conditions under which our embassy and  its staffers have to work.    None of the 166 embassies in Moscow have such poor and  wretched conditions in material, financial, and technical terms  as does Georgia's embassy. The embassy has lived on charity all  year.    Georgia's embassy in Moscow is in fact an embassy's embassy  because of Russia's importance to our country. This is where  independent Georgia's vital questions are decided. And the  workload on the embassy's staffers is many times greater than  that of any of Georgia's embassies in other countries, and it is  commonly agreed that Moscow holds first place in the world in  terms of the cost of living. It costs more to live there.    Hence, Georgia's embassy in Moscow leads everyone else in  terms of its importance, its workload, and the cost of living.    And yet, our own government has set salary rates for its  Moscow embassy personnel that are only one-thirteenth--yes,  that's right--one-thirteenth the rates set for Georgian  diplomats in any other country.    On top of all that, none of all the 166 countries'  ambassadors and embassy diplomats together have to take as much  abuse as do Georgia's ambassador and embassy diplomats in  Moscow, which shows how much our work is "appreciated."    That's how we Georgians are!    Enough, I think! Indecency has gone on long enough!    This is not to give the impression that our embassy in  Moscow  is doing ideal work. It has many shortcomings, and Georgia's  head of state has pointed them out, in a spirit of good will,  with the desire to correct them.    As for our other "friends," however, we advise them to  follow  his example and stop abusing the embassy and the ambassador. If  they really care about the work of Georgia's embassy in Moscow  (and not about the ambassador's chair), let them help it  financially and with technical assistance, and if they can't  then let them kindly refrain from giving us advice (if they have  the ability). Anyway, it won't work for them, because those on  whom the fate of the embassy and its personnel depends are not  going to listen to idle talk, and this is the only happiness in  our hellish work.</p>

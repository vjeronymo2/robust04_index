			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / EC telecoms ministers to press UK on HDTV EC telecommunications ministers will today get their best and possibly their last chance to persuade Britain to agree a strategy for the development of wide-screen, high-quality television in Europe. Denmark, which holds the EC presidency, has indicated it will do its utmost to get unanimous agreement on plans to promote European high-definition television (HDTV) at today's meeting in Brussels. But the UK, which has blocked all previous compromises over the last 18 months, is still reluctant to commit itself to new Danish proposals, even though they go further than ever towards meeting British demands. In particular, British officials say that Mr Edward Leigh, the hardline UK telecoms minister, will not discuss funding for a new strategy until the substance has been agreed. 'If the Danes begin with a discussion on money, it will be a very short meeting,' warned one official on Friday. If the UK continues to veto a deal then other member states may finally have to abandon their ambitions for development of European HDTV, based on a central action plan and EC funding for broadcasters and programme-makers. That would cause a political storm because of the amount of time and public money which has already been ploughed into advanced television equipment and programmes in anticipation of continuing EC support. Mr Michel Carpentier, head of the European Commission's telecommunications directorate for the past 10 years and a firm advocate of HDTV, warned last week that today's meeting was 'all or nothing.' But in practice, the political stakes are so high that if there is any progress today, Denmark may allow negotiations to continue at an extra meeting of telecoms ministers on June 16. The Danish compromise tries to answer British objections by suggesting that companies seeking Community backing would have to meet at least half the cost of promoting advanced television themselves. Funding for a five-year plan, originally set at Ecu850m (Pounds 671m) by the Commission, would be substantially reduced, although advocates of HDTV are unlikely to settle for less than Ecu200m over five years. The Danes are focusing on the development of a wide-screen format, not tied to particular standards, and invite the Commission to come up with new proposals to accelerate the development of digital HDTV standards, which Britain argues will soon supersede the original EC norms.

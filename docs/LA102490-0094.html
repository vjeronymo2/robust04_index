			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY'S AIRPORT NOISE LAW SEEMS SAFE FOR NOW;  </P> <P> AVIATION: CONGRESSIONAL PASSAGE OF NEW POLICY THAT WOULD EASE O.C. LIMITS IS  UNLIKELY THIS YEAR BUT ISN'T DEAD YET, INSIDERS SAY. COUNTY OFFICIALS ARE  FIGHTING TO STOP IT.  </P> <P> Congressional passage of a new national airport noise policy that has outraged  John Wayne Airport officials appears increasingly unlikely this year, but the  proposal is not yet dead, officials said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The noise policy is included in aviation legislation that also contains a plan  to levy new fees on passengers. The entire package ran aground Tuesday in a  House-Senate conference because of a last-minute flap over landing "slots" at  East Coast airports.  </P> <P> "The deal is off," said Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), referring to a  tentative agreement that might have led to passage of a noise policy this year.  Cox strongly opposes the noise provisions.  </P> <P> But key congressional aides said that it was too early to pronounce the  agreement dead and that a deal that would include a national noise policy  remains possible in the next day or two.  </P> <P> Orange County officials in recent weeks have lobbied heavily against the noise  proposal. They contend that granting noise-control authority to the federal  government would upset a delicately balanced, 5-year-old agreement on  commercial flight schedules and noise levels that has permitted the expansion  of county-owned John Wayne Airport.  </P> <P> "We don't think the federal government should be able to come in with a policy  that totally tosses out what took years to negotiate, particularly when it's  working so successfully," said Jan Mittermeier, the airport manager.  </P> <P> Even if Congress fails to enact a noise policy this year, it is almost certain  that the issue will be revived when the 102nd Congress convenes in January,  officials said.  </P> <P> Secretary of Transportation Samuel K. Skinner and the major airlines favor  development of a national airport noise policy to lend consistency to what  critics describe as a hodgepodge of local rules and regulations at airports  across the country.  </P> <P> A central issue facing Congress is the extent to which a new national policy  would leave in place, or "grandfather," existing airport noise policies. Such  policies were developed in recent years at perhaps two dozen American airports  as exploding residential development pushed housing closer and closer to flight  lines.  </P> <P> At John Wayne Airport, airlines are barred from operating the noisiest, or  Stage II aircraft, such as Boeing 747s. In addition, outgoing flights may take  off no earlier than 7 a.m. and no later than 10 p.m., while incoming flights  may not land after 11 p.m. The agreement was reached in 1985 as part of an  out-of-court settlement of a series of longstanding lawsuits that sought to  block expansion of the airport.  </P> <P> Early this month, the aviation subcommittee of the House Public Works and  Transportation Committee held hearings on what panel members thought would be  an effort to enact a noise policy sometime next year.  </P> <P> But the effort was short-circuited when Sen. Wendell H. Ford (D-Ky.) introduced  legislation in the Senate to mandate a national airport noise policy as well as  the new passenger fees, known as passenger facility charges. The fees, sought  by the Bush Administration, would help airports pay for needed capital  improvement projects and at the same time reduce airport dependence on federal  dollars.  </P> <P> The Ford legislation, a reauthorization measure that would extend the life of  the Federal Aviation Administration, ultimately was attached to the Senate  version of the federal budget bill.  </P> <P> Although the Ford bill contained language that exempted, at least temporarily,  existing local noise policies from federal review, it set off a storm of  protest among local officials who were concerned that the grandfather  provisions were not strong enough.  </P> <P> Last week, Senate and House negotiators began meeting to iron out the  differences between the FAA reauthorization bill passed by the Senate and an  earlier version passed by the House. The House bill contained language creating  the passenger fees, but not the noise policy.  </P> <P> Some House members, such as Cox, opposed enactment of a noise policy this year,  contending that the policy should be fully aired at public hearings and in  legislative debate. But others, including Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), were  willing to accept a noise policy as long as its grandfather provisions were  stronger than those contained in the Senate bill.  </P> <P> Mittermeier said Orange County officials were satisfied with toughened  grandfather language drafted by House negotiators.  </P> <P> "I thought we had some pretty good language in there to protect John Wayne and  some of the other airports," she said. "I think it would be kind of  disappointing if this all goes away and we have to do it all over again" next  year.  </P> <P> The House-Senate negotiations were scuttled Tuesday, but neither the passenger  fees nor the noise policy was to blame.  </P> <P> Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), one of the Senate negotiators, had insisted on  including a provision that would have expanded the number of "slots" available  to airlines at La Guardia Airport in New York City and National Airport in  Washington.  </P> <P> La Guardia, National, O'Hare International Airport in Chicago and Los Angeles  International Airport are the only four airports in the country that operate  under a system in which airlines are allotted "slots" by the FAA to control  airport congestion. Since 1985, airlines have been permitted to sell their  slots, and some have fetched prices of up to $1.7 million.  </P> <P> McCain's move was widely seen in Congress as an attempt to assist America West,  a Phoenix-based airline that for years has struggled to break into the  congested airports.  </P> <P> House negotiators were adamantly opposed to handing out more slots to benefit a  single business interest, congressional aides said, while the Senate  negotiators have said they must accommodate McCain.  </P> <P> On Tuesday morning, Ford officially rejected a House offer that included  language creating a noise policy and passenger facility charges, but not  additional airline slots. Several aides said that House and Senate negotiators  are close on the passenger fee and noise policy issues.  </P> <P> "We're in a holding pattern," said one Senate aide.  </P></p>

			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / Observer: Parsimoney Chris Haskins must surely be one of the lowest paid chairmen of a Footsie company. Despite a 17 per cent pay rise last year, the cheery chairman of Northern Foods was only paid Pounds 181,000. Indeed, his entire seven-man board - which includes three non-executives - earns less than Pounds 500,000, which is roughly the same amount as the chief executive of Unigate, a company under half Northern's size, gets paid. There's also quite a difference in the two companies' share prices over the past year - Northern has outperformed Unigate two and a half times. So perhaps Northern's seven shirt-sleeved directors, as pictured in the annual report, should be allowed to celebrate with something a little stronger than water and only five glasses.</p>

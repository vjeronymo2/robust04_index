			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / World Trade News: Food aid; demand grows, resources fall - Robert Graham interviews the outgoing director of the World Food Programme THE OVERALL resources available for international food aid are being reduced at a time when the need for such assistance is expanding. This is one of the disturbing trends observed by Mr James Ingram, who has just retired as director of the World Food Programme (WFP), the Rome-based organisation responsible for United Nations food aid. Mr Ingram, an Australian who headed the programme for 10 years, also notes a slowing down in donor countries' responses to aid requirements and their insistence on more conditions for assistance. The organisation is the only multilateral body providing food assistance to developing countries, accounting for one-fifth of all food aid shipped globally. The organisation is also the second largest source of development assistance within the UN system after the World Bank. 'There are enormous problems of how to allocate food aid, since the demands are increasing while resources from donor countries are being reduced,' he says. The decline in resources has been in evidence since 1988, and last year the Dollars 448m (Pounds 260.4m) committed to development projects was the lowest in value terms since 1978. Approximately 22m people were reckoned to have received food through the programme's development projects last year, the bulk in food-deficit countries with per capita incomes below Dollars 1,135. The main call upon the programme's resources has come from increased emergency relief aid. In the two-year period 1991-92, the organisation's total resources are expected to be Dollars 2.6bn. But the number of unforeseen emergencies (such as helping the Kurds in Iraq and cyclone victims in Bangladesh last year) is likely to rise. The situation, he argues, is set to worsen: 'Donors are becoming slower in responding. We have seen this over the recent cases of Sudan, Liberia and Mozambique. The food pipelines are empty, and if you don't deliver now, it becomes impossible to get the food at the right time and thus it becomes very hard to manage the aid well.' The increased delays are less the result of 'aid fatigue' among donor countries than, as Mr Ingram sees it, the consequence of aid being handled by civil servants who have too many calls on their national purses and have to juggle tight budgets. 'They wait until the last moment, weighing their options,' he says. 'It's understandable, but decisions can be too late.' The organisation's current Horn of Africa appeal for Dollars 400m has so far produced no more than Dollars 80m in promises. Of the main donors, Mr Ingram regards the US as still the most responsive. 'The European Community has been a little disappointing,' he says. The EC was still conditioned by 'old geopolitical, historical and colonial considerations' and seemed insufficiently aware of the potential effects of instability and emigration among poor countries, especially in Africa. He also sees aid increasingly geared to serve special interests and hedged-in by conditionalities. Food aid projects now often have to contend with human-rights issues such as the role of women and environmental protection, all of which affect a country's internal politics. While developing countries are far from blameless, Mr Ingram believes too many strings can be counter-productive: 'It is better, perhaps, to have fewer strings and Because the organisation distributes aid directly to the beneficiaries, it is less constrained by the nature of the governments where it is operating. For instance, in Sudan, where the government has a poor record on human rights, emergency food aid is distributed through non-government organisations (NGOs). In some countries the WFP ceases to deal with certain ministries; but, where genuine hardship exists, the organisation seeks to be present no matter the nature of the regime. A more delicate issue, according to Mr Ingram, is whether the organisation should intervene when governments of potentially rich countries fail to feed elements of their population because of poor policies such as in Brazil's impoverished north-eastern region. He believes in principle that resource-rich developing countries should be responsible for their own poor, and in the case of the former Soviet Union the potential role of the WFP, apart from offering its good offices, should be limited to some of the poor Moslem republics. He sees little immediate change in the production of food surpluses, especially where there are high subsidies as in the EC. But he is convinced that, in the longer term, greater trade liberalisation can only benefit poorer countries. 'Trade,' he says, 'is ultimately more useful to them than aid.' Although the organisation last year handled a record 4.8m tonnes of food and has extensive experience in the purchase and movement of food aid, its hands remained tied. 'The WFP has no money to finance stocks,' says Mr Ingram. 'We rely upon the International Emergency Food Reserve (IEFR), which is based solely on commitments from donors - it is not a formal stock. This reserve stands at about 500,000 tons, yet we have to distribute annually over 4m tons.' Mr Ingram has been succeeded by Ms Catherine Bertini, former assistant secretary of the US Department of Agriculture.</p>

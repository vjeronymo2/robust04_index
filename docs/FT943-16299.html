			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Debt forgiveness helps put TBI Pounds 22.5m in black TBI, the property investment and development company acquired by Markheath in a reverse takeover in March, reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 22.5m in the year to March 31. The results were distorted by the restructuring and debt forgiveness of Pounds 27.2m. Markheath, which suffered in the commercial property downturn, was heavily indebted to banks led by Midland and ANZ. It incurred a restated loss of Pounds 68.8m in 1992-93. In the reconstruction, Markheath acquired Thomas Bailey Investments, a private property company in south Wales. The estimated net asset value at completion of Thomas Bailey was about Pounds 7.2m, which was satisfied by the issue of 37m new ordinary shares. In addition, Markheath raised Pounds 24.1m via a share placing and open offer. The company then changed its name to TBI and is now based in Cardiff and London. A one-off payment of Pounds 47m has been made to creditor banks and Pounds 27.2m written off. In addition to the new equity, about Pounds 25m of new debt was raised with Barclays. Mr Michael Rendle, chairman, said the balance sheet now indicated a company of substance with net assets of Pounds 41.7m. 'Interest costs and overheads are now more than covered by our rental income and we can address the future with renewed confidence.' The property portfolio was valued at Pounds 96.5m with annualised rental income of about Pounds 7m. Earnings per share were 18.42p after debt forgiveness. Before, there were losses of 3.88p (55.29p losses). No dividend is proposed but Mr Rendle said the board intended to pay dividends at the earliest possible opportunity. Mr Paul Guy, chief executive, said: 'There is a very good base to take the company forward. We intend very much to be extremely active with regard to acquisitions and disposals.' One property, at Bridgend in south Wales, had recently been sold for Pounds 4.1m when it was in the books at Pounds 2.7m, he said.</p>

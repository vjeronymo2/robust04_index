			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / No need to bribe British voters It has become the conventional wisdom among politicians and commentators that the only hope the Conservatives have of winning the next UK election (due not later than the spring of 1997) is by extensive cuts in income tax. I have not the faintest idea who will win that election; but the view that the crucial factor is income tax cuts is fatally flawed. The reasoning - to dignify it by that name - runs as follows. An unexpectedly sharp economic recovery has neither produced a feeling of well-being nor improved the very low ratings of the Conservatives in the opinion polls. So a further bribe by way of income tax cuts is required. Elections, of course, are not determined by economic circumstances alone. Otherwise Margaret Thatcher's second election victory in 1983 and John Major's victory in 1992 are inexplicable. The Thatcher victory of 1983 was achieved at a much earlier stage of economic recovery than has now been reached in late 1994. The evidence suggests that the 'Falklands factor', which emerged after the defeat of Argentina in those southern islands in 1982, was decisive. Admittedly the third Thatcher victory in 1987 is more convincingly attributed to feelings of economic well-being. But the Conservative victory under John Major in 1992 remains more puzzling. The prime minister won at the bottom of a recession when unemployment was again sharply rising and the poll tax debacle a recent memory. There was no overall rise in living standards in 1991, the year before that election. The most likely explanation is that voters were persuaded that there had already been a change of government when Major succeeded Thatcher in late 1990 and wanted to give the new prime minister a chance. Obviously economic well-being has a large part to play, when there are no special countervailing factors. The reason the present upturn has failed to produce such a feeling is not far to seek. The best single measure of living standards is real personal disposable income after tax. The average increase in this measure since 1970 has been 2.7 per cent per annum. But in 1994 it has actually fallen by up to 1 per cent. Take-home pay has been squeezed by the delayed tax increases announced in the two budgets of 1993, introduced when the scare about a supposed Pounds 50bn budget deficit was at its height. The sources of the present recovery have been net exports, investment and consumer spending. The latter has been financed from a lower savings ratio rather than higher take-home pay. Such an increase does not make households feel as good as higher consumption financed from growing incomes. But the dawn can already be seen. The last of the staggered tax increases will be levied in 1995. The way is then open for real incomes to rise roughly in line with pay, adjusted for inflation. The Budget Red Book does not forecast real personal disposable income in its tables. But there is a verbal reference to disposable incomes rising by 1 1/2 per cent in 1995, despite the residual tax increases, This is also the view of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research  - although the London Business School foresees another year of the zero growth in that measure, with recovery beginning in 1996. Even the LBS sees this variable rising by 2.3 per cent - near the long-run average - in both 1996 and 1997. Of course these projections are fallible. But the underlying trend is for a return to normal growth of post-tax real living standards. And if the mainstream projections underestimate future economic growth, as they probably do, the rise in take-home pay will be larger still. Thus people will be able to increase consumption without running down the savings ratio any further. Moreover, as recovery continues and job totals rise, there should be more confidence in employment prospects, despite continuing reports of dismissals by particular firms. Any feasible 'tax cuts' will be only a fraction of the tax increases imposed earlier in this parliament. They will also be a drop in the ocean in their effect on living standards; and if tax cuts threaten the improvement in the public finances, even the ordinary voter who does not follow the financial markets will still pick up the confidence tremors; and Labour will be able to go to town on fears about the sustainability of recovery. Moreover, all the political gossip has concentrated on income tax, which is now a relatively minor tax accounting for 25 per cent of general government receipts. Once the correction in the public finances has been made, there could be a modest adjustment in income tax bands in an average year to offset the way in which people creep up into higher tax brackets as real incomes rise. But unless or until there is a change in the structure of public services which voters demand of government, the great bulk of the increase in living standards will have to come from pay in the marketplace. Nor is there reason to think a once-for-all obvious pre-election tax bribe will work. To adapt English humorist Hilaire Belloc: there is no need to bribe the English voters considering what he or she will vote for unbribed.  ------------------------------------------ UK real personal disposable income  ------------------------------------------                               % increase                                per annum  ------------------------------------------ Average annual Increase 1970-93                  2.7  ------------------------------------------ 1987*                             3.4 1988*                             6.0 1989                              4.9 1990                              1.9 1991                              0.1 1992*                             2.7 1993                              1.9 1994**                           -0.9 1995**                        0-1 1/2 1996**                            2.3 1997**                            2.3  ------------------------------------------ *Election year; ** Treasury and London Business School forecasts.

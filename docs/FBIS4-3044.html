			<p>BFN     [Text] On the morning of 15 April, the provincial party  committee and the provincial government held a telephone  conference to devise plans for our province to deal strict blows  to serious criminal activities.    Sun Shuyi, member of the standing committee of the  provincial  party committee and secretary of the commission on politics and  law of the provincial party committee, attended and addressed  the conference. Vice Governor Wang Yuxi presided over the  conference. Meng Qingfeng, director of the provincial public  security department, read the program of action.    The conference pointed out: The priorities to attack this  activity are criminals who harm the society, affect stability,  and engage in active sabotage activities; hooligans and local  ruffians who engage in major crimes of violence, gang up to  commit crimes, ride roughshod on the streets, and play tyrant in  their home villages or towns, which the people hate bitterly;  criminals who steal or damage the country's railway,  communications, power, water conservation, and oil field  equipment; criminals who engage in cheating, smuggling, and  making counterfeit money and false tax receipts and bills; and  law-breaking criminals who abduct and traffic in women and  children and engage in prostitution activities.</p>

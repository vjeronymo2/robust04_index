			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / International Company News: SKF tumbles into red but sees income improvement SKF, the world's leading rolling bearing manufacturer, suffered a loss of SKr221m (Dollars 37.4m) - after financial items - last year. This contrasts with an impressive profit of SKr1.750bn for 1990. At the after-tax level the group made a loss of SKr1.17bn in 1991, compared with a SKr1.04bn net profit. SKF blamed the turnround on its Ovako steel operations, which ran up a loss of SKr907m. SKF predicted that while a significant upturn in the economic climate was not probable for 1922, it expected an income improvement so that the company would show a positive net financial result. Group sales fell by 5.3 per cent last year to SKr26.3bn from SKr27.7bn with a 10 per cent decline in volumes. The dividend is being held at SKr4.25 per share. The company announced that its chairman, the 70-year-old Mr Lennart Johansson is retiring and that his post will be taken by Mr Anders Scharp, also chairman of Electrolux and Saab-Scania. SKF said it had cut its workforce by 11 per cent (about 6,000 people) as it has adjusted its production and inventories since late 1990 to falling demand for its products. The reduction in personnel combined with a shortened working week resulted in about SKr950m in non-recurring charges against income for the year. As much as SKr250m of that sum related to costs of reducing the labour force by an extra 2,000 this year. Last December's division of Ovako between SKF and the Finnish Metra group would enable SKF to concentrate on ball-bearing steel production and related special steels and liquidate or sell off other activities outside Ovakos core business. It added that Ovako would be fully consolidated in SKF's results from this year and this would result in an increase of around SKr3.7bn in SKF's balance sheet.</p>

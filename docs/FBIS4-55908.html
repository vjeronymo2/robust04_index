			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Zhelyu Zhelev by Adam Michnik; </F> place and date not given; "published simultaneously" in Warsaw  GAZETA WYBORCZA; "Union of Democratic Forces Failed To Convince  the Public of the Need for Reforms"]    [Text] [Michnik] Mr. President, this is our fourth  conversation since you assumed office. How would you assess the  balance of these four years of change in Bulgaria?    [Zhelev] However discontented we may be, however  disappointed with our original expectations, nevertheless major  changes have occurred in Bulgaria that give grounds for  believing that there can be no going back. Among the  comparatively new developments, I should mention that the war in  former Yugoslavia is exerting an increasingly strong effect on  our country. Bulgaria is being seriously affected by this war.  We are playing no part in it, except for observing the embargo  and the sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council.  Militarily speaking, we are playing no part whatsoever, because  we know that any form of intervention, even of the most noble  kind, even if we were to send "blue helmets," would be regarded  as some kind of revanchism, as political self-seeking, or as  part of far-reaching plans.    However, we are really affected by the war, most heavily by  our losses from the embargo. Our door to the West is simply  closed to us. According to our calculations, so far we have  lost over $3 billion in unrealized contracts, share values, and  so on. The second thing that is affecting us is the appearance  of a petroleum mafia in Bulgaria. Smuggling gasoline and  naphtha across our western border brings the criminals huge  profits, because over there every liter is worth 10 times more.    We are also affected by the absence of foreign investment.  The investors are scared because a war is in progress on the  other side of the border. They simply try to circumvent the  Balkans. Thus, we are becoming a high-risk country through no  fault of our own.    [Michnik] The SDS [Union of Democratic Forces] brought you  to power. What is happening at the moment inside the SDS  coalition?    [Zhelev] In my view the SDS has made a number of very  serious mistakes. After winning the 1991 elections, it had a  parliamentary majority and ruled the country together with the  DPS [Movement for Rights and Freedoms]. However, later they  retreated and lost position after position. After the  resignation of Filip Dimitrov's government and after the  resignation of the vice president [Blaga Dimitrova], the SDS was  without power, although the electors had voted for it.    [Michnik] Why did the SDS "give up" power?    [Zhelev] Personal and group interests played a part, but to  this one should add the lack of breadth in their political  thinking.    [Michnik] One can observe the process of disintegration of  the anti-communist coalitions in all the countries of the former  socialist camp. Do you think, Mr. President, that this cannot  be attributed only to personal conflicts?    [Zhelev] Among other things, more profound reasons lie  behind the different interests of the various participants in  the process of the reforms. To sum up in the most general  terms, in the beginning we had ideals. Our banner consisted of  democracy, the market economy, and a rule-of-law state. The  people accepted all of this and voted for it. We we came to  start the economic reforms, economic interests then came to the  forefront, and they in turn are interwoven with the personal  ambitions of activists and functionaries in various  institutions. Subsequently, alliances were formed that no one  could have foreseen. In parliament, for example, there are  deputies in opposing groups that are linked to certain business  groups, and they sometimes vote together, for example on  taxation issues. This is the reason why we still have no laws  on fiscal police or an audit office. The common platform with  which the parties, movements, trade unions, and associations  forming the SDS fought the elections was a compromise.  Compromises always have to be brought up to date. I think that  the SDS leaders forgot this principle at a certain moment. Even  worse, the SDS failed to convince the public of the need for the  reforms. It failed to convince the public that the SDS is a  national force that identifies itself with national interests.  The coalition left this very important area in the hands of the  BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party], which talks all the time about  Bulgaria, the national cause, and so on.    [Michnik] Do the SDS leaders realize this today?    [Zhelev] Some of them claim that in the next elections the  SDS will win over 50 percent of the votes. This is absolute  utopia.    [Michnik] People tell me that the Communists brought people  like Zhelyu Zhelev to power. They claim that you do not  understand reality, that you are a utopian humanist or even a  cryptocommunist. In Poland people are saying the same things  about the people who opposed the decommunizing laws.    [Zhelev] The Communists in Bulgaria are restoring their  strength, but the opponents of decommunization are not to blame  for this. They are exploiting the fact that they are the main  force that supports the present government, which is formally a  nonparty one. In exchange for their support, they demand  various concessions that stall the reforms. For example, they  want to recall diplomats who obtained their posts in the Foreign  Ministry after 1989. They are trying to reinstall in the  Foreign Ministry the so-called professional staff, but you know  what kind of professionals these are!    The BSP is regaining its lost positions. The SDS is most to  blame for this, because it disowned its allies and relinquished  its changes of its own accord. When the other side retreats,  you are stupid if you fail to exploit the situation.    [Michnik] Do the Communists want the return of communism?    [Zhelev] Some of them do, such as the authors of the  concepts for forming farming cooperatives before the land is  returned to its owners. However, there are others who are  evolving in a social democratic direction; they believe that the  ideas of the first group are stupid. They know there is no  alternative to the transition to the market economy, but want  their party to govern this process independently. For them, the  main question is where the capitalists are to come from, from  the BSP or the SDS? Who will receive the property? Who will  get the money? They do not think of ideals, only of property  and money. From the viewpoint of the national interest, it  would be better if the SDS carried out the reforms. The SDS will  complete them more quickly and in a more radical manner.  Because of its nomenklatura, the BSP will try to preserve the  remnants of the old regime as long as possible, but in the final  event they will collapse.    [Michnik] I have heard a hypothesis that the chaos in  Bulgaria is being made worse by those who support the idea that  dictatorship is the only solution to the chaos.    [Zhelev] Groups do indeed exist in Bulgaria that are  interested in chaos. Chaos benefits certain circles in the BSP  that want to prove that the present version of the reforms is  against the country's interest. Business groups that have links  with the mafia feel very comfortable in the present chaos,  because they gain from this situation. They can carry out  illicit privatization and they can ship fuel illegally to former  Yugoslavia. A further group that is striving to destabilize the  state consists of people from the former State Security, who  have found their true place and calling in the mafia and in  business.    [Michnik] How did it come about that the people who  previously fought for democracy are now thirsting for power and  are open to corruption? This is happening everywhere, not only  in Bulgaria.    [Zhelev] In Bulgaria only a handful of people openly  ventured to oppose the violation of human rights by the  communist authorities. Even in June 1989, I managed to collect  only 56-60 signatures for a statement in defense of the  Bulgarian Turks. Two months later, about 100 people signed a  second declaration that criticized the atmosphere of chauvinism  in even stronger terms.    Most people joined the SDS in early 1990, at the time of the  roundtable talks, when they realized with amazement that  communism would never return. It was then that the great  anticommunists appeared. Like you, even I had become a  "communist" or, at the very least, a "defender of communism."    [Michnik] Why does no political center exist in Bulgaria?    [Zhelev] It is true that the bipolar BSP-SDS model is  managing to survive. The reforms have been greatly delayed in  Bulgaria. The communism-anticommunism confrontation continues  to operate. The situation would be different if the land had  been returned, if privatization had advanced further. As long  as the main economic reforms are hardly beginning, the geometry  of the political space is distorted. This is not Euclidean  geometry, where right is right and left is left, and the center  is in the middle. This only exists in the stable democracies.    [Michnik] In your view, Mr. President, what is a stable  scenario for Bulgaria?    [Zhelev] The unification of the democratic forces in the  name of the reforms, the return of the land to its owners, the  advance of privatization -- these can guarantee the  irreversibility of the transition. For this one needs a strong  government with enough energy and willpower to act.    [Michnik] Do you not think that one has to cross the horizon  of the future and build a reformist camp, not worrying whether  its members were once communists or anticommunists?    [Zhelev] When we founded the SDS, I said that it should  strive to form a coalition that unites people with democratic  views. In my view, this is the only possible and reasonable  formula for action -- continuously to expand the circle of those  who support the reform. The tragedy of the SDS is that at the  last elections it won 34 percent of the vote, but instead of  expanding the circle of its supporters, relied on the so-called  hardline electorate and even started -- as a result of internal  conflicts -- to "shed" members.    [Michnik] Since we are speaking about intolerance....    [Zhelev] All its forms are dangerous: national chauvinism,  ideological fanaticism, religious fanaticism....    [Michnik] Today a great wave of Islamic fundamentalism is  washing through the world. Could it appear in your country as  well? How are Bulgarian-Turkish relations?    [Zhelev] May God preserve us from both Islamic and Christian  fundamentalism! Bulgaria is now threatened with a different  form of fundamentalism -- political. As far as Turkey is  concerned, I regard it not as a bridge, but rather as a barrier  that separates us from the religious fundamentalism of the Arab  countries, and especially Iran.    [Michnik] What about relations with the Bulgarian Turks?    [Zhelev] First, I should remind you that after 1989 the  Bulgarian Turks received back the rights of which they were  deprived by the communist authorities, which in 1984-85 almost  brought our country face to face with a "Bosnian" alternative,  long before the collapse of [East] Germany. I consider that no  fundamentalism exists in this part of our population at present.  The danger comes when people or groups try to exploit religion  for political purposes. Such attempts are made from time to  time, but they have no lasting effects.    [Michnik] What is the political scenario as regards the  Bulgarian Turks? What do they want?    [Zhelev] They have great material problems. They are mainly  farmers, but have never owned their land. Now, when the land is  being reprivatized, it is mainly returning into the hands of the  Bulgarians, which is arousing tensions. However, the law  provides for all those who cultivate the land to receive  ownership titles, but they come second in line.    [Michnik] Some Bulgarians claim Zhelev is blind, because  he cannot see the danger. For example, he cannot see that there  are regions in Bulgaria where no one speaks Bulgarian.    [Zhelev] These are nationalist provocations. Everywhere,  our nationalists are like a horse with blinkers. Because of  their limited views, because of their fanaticism, they are very  dangerous. They manage to raise slogans like "Bulgaria above  everything!" However, when I ask them what they have done for  Bulgaria, for its prestige in Europe, and for democracy, they  have nothing to say.    [Michnik] Is it true that in Bulgaria, like Germany, there  exists a kind of solidarity with Milosevic and Serbia, based on  Orthodoxy?    [Zhelev] Such a tendency does exist within part of the BSP;  pan-Slavist groups also exist, but they do not have much  influence. They were the ones who tried to exploit  Zhirinovskiy's visit to Bulgaria.    [Michnik] Where did Milosevic and Tudjman come from?    [Zhelev] Both of them came from the League of Communists of  Yugoslavia, but I do not think it matters where they came from,  as it is more important to know what they are committing  themselves to now. For example, Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] President Kiro Gligorov, who at  one time was president of the Yugoslav Assembly, is now  following a very sensible policy. Milan Kucan is doing the same  in Slovenia.    [Michnik] What lies behind Milosevic's actions?    [Zhelev] One cannot talk about him without remembering the  situation of Serbia and the Serbs following the collapse of the  SFRY, nor can we ignore certain special features of the Serbian  people. The neocommunists are playing the chief role in fanning  nationalist attitudes....    [Michnik] The neocommunists form a big faction in  Milosevic's party.    [Zhelev] We are talking about the postcommunist period.  Some think that this merely means the period following  communism. It is like a mutated gene, and these mutations can  be very dangerous.    [Michnik] Let us talk about Macedonia.    [Zhelev] Bulgaria was the first country in the world to  recognize the statehood of this former Yugoslav republic.    [Michnik] This was a strange act. It is the first time I  have heard of recognizing a country without recognizing the  existence of its people. Both Greece and Serbia find the  statehood of Macedonia and its name a major obstacle. Bulgaria  has always considered that the Macedonians are its close  relatives, and does so now.    [Zhelev] There is nothing strange in this. A state is  always recognized. Under international law the recognition of a  state means that a nation exists in that state that itself  determines its own sovereignty and identity. It also implies  that the country that recognizes this state has no territorial  claims against it. However, international law says nothing about  a special declaration that recognizes the existence -- or not --  of any nation. The nation either exists or it does not. Does  the existence of the Poles as a nation have to be recognized?    [Michnik] I think Bulgaria is the only country in the  Balkans in which the virus of hatred has failed to spread. What  will the situation be in the future?    [Zhelev] The Bulgarian people are very tolerant....    [Michnik] Have you ever heard a nation that describes itself  as intolerant?    [Zhelev] This is proven by the facts; for example, by the  fate of the Bulgarian Jews during World War II.    [Michnik] Anti-Semitism has never existed in Serbia either.  It existed in Croatia, but not in Serbia.... However, today,  how can the war end if the Serbs do not want to end it until a  united Serbian state appears?    [Zhelev] I consider that a confederal model is the best one.  The idea of a confederation is acceptable in Bosnia -- at least  in the beginning. The Serbs will have great economic problems  after this war. The legacy of the sanctions is even now  arousing public discontent in Serbia. I believe in the victory  of the forces of democracy, but the introduction of an overt  military dictatorship is also possible.    It is essential to improve the relations between the Balkan  peoples. This is very important. I mean we should develop an  extended network of information links and transportation and  other communications. In the Balkans the situation has always  been poor in this respect. The peoples are distanced from one  another not only by the mountains.</p>

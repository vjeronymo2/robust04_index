			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc to lift stake RHONE-POULENC, the French chemicals group, is negotiating an increase in its stake in Institut Merieux, a producer of human and animal vaccines, writes John Ridding. Shares in Institut Merieux have been suspended pending a further announcement on the planned deal. Rhone Poulenc currently holds 51 per cent of the shares with the Merieux family holding 16 per cent, the Dassault family holding 14 per cent, and the balance being controlled by the public and the Pasteur Institute. Chemicals industry analysts said that Rhone-Poulenc wants to increase its holding in Institut Merieux to integrate it more fully into its healthcare division.</p>

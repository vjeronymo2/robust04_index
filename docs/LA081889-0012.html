			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABORTION AND 'NEUTRAL' LAW  </P> <P> We have the right to choose between alternatives that are . . . morally  permissible," writes Philip A. Lacovara in his defense of the Supreme Court's  decision on abortion.  </P> <P> My judgment is that my morals are just fine without Mr. Lacovara's bias.  Further, in comparing a woman's decision to abort her pregnancy with her  decision to have a nose job or a breast implant, Mr. Lacovara reveals  sensitivity exceeded only by his chauvinism. Would he also compare a man's  choosing to become a father (or not to become one) with his opting for a hair  transplant?  </P> <P> I prefer that my state reps don't decide any of my medical, cosmetic, or  ethical choices for me!  </P> <P> SYDNY LORRAINE PAUL  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

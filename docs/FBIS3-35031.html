At the outset, the Central Command members observed a minute  of silence in honor of the departed son of the homeland and the  people, Staff Major Basil al-Asad.    Dr. Muhammad Zuhayr Mashariqah then spoke about Basil  al-Asad's noble traits and good character. The Central Command  members also praised Basil al-Asad's traits, which made the  people love him. They noted that the people are sad on the  departure of the knight, who embodied, during his lifetime, the  genuine values upheld by President al-Asad.    The Central Command also listened to a political report  presented by Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar'. The foreign  minister reviewed the latest political developments in the Arab,  regional, and international arenas, as well as contacts made on  several issues related to these developments.    The Central Command discussed the current political  situation  and Israel's attempts to circumvent the important political  results of the Geneva summit between President Hafiz al-Asad and  U.S. President Bill Clinton, especially with regard to the peace  process. It viewed such attempts as a continuation of Israel's  policy that is based on undermining the peace process by  violating the principles and rules of this process, primarily  implementing UN resolutions, adopting the principles of  international legitimacy, and Israeli withdrawal from all  occupied Arab territories.</p>

			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / International Company News: Kansallis-Osake-Pankki launches bond issue in domestic market Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, Finland's leading commercial bank, yesterday launched a FM300m (Dollars 54m) perpetual subordinated bond issue in the domestic market to help strengthen its capital base. The move is part of a broader plan to raise FM2bn in Tier Two capital on the domestic and international markets in the next few years, following the bank's recent successful FM1bn rights issue. Like other Finnish banks, KOP has suffered heavy losses and its capital adequacy ratio has been badly eroded. The subordinated bonds are the first perpetuals to be issued by KOP. The coupon is 1.4 per cent above 6-month Helibor for the first five years, 1.90 per cent above 6-month Helibor for the next five years, and 2.4 per cent above 6-month Helibor in subsequent years. The issue price is 100 per cent and the subscription period runs from May 26 to June 24.</p>

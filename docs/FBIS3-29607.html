Manae Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning  Agency (EPA), told a regular press conference that official  predictions of cutting the huge surplus as a proportion of gross  domestic product (GDP) provide a reference figure but cannot be  construed as a trade target.    The agency's prediction that the current account surplus  will  fall to 2.8 percent of GDP in the fiscal year starting April,  from an expected 3.1 percent in the current fiscal year, can be  an indicator of effort, but "it's impossible to use as a  precondition" in trade talks, she said.    A senior Foreign Ministry official said Monday that  achieving  the target for cutting the overall current account surplus is  important in reducing the black ink with the U.S. as well.    The comment by Koichiro Matsuura, deputy foreign minister,  was interpreted as implicitly accepting the prediction as a  trade target.    But Kubota said the current account, affected by such  factors  as exchange rate fluctuations, "is not Japan's problem alone."    Kubota, noting that Japan's current account surplus is  declining in yen terms, said the government should endeavor to  achieve its recently stated goals of deregulation, promoting  trade and investment, improving competition through stricter  antitrust enforcement and simplifying the government procurement  system.    To help achieve those goals, she said, the EPA should  support  spurring domestic demand through planned incomes tax cuts and  increased housing investment and public works spending.    The agency should also effectively use its ombudsman's  office  to improve foreign access to Japanese trade and investment and  should form plans to reduce the gap between high domestic prices  and those overseas, Kubota said.</p>

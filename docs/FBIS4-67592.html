			<p>BFN     [Text] Frankfurt-based Hoechst AG has discontinued CFC  [chlorofluorocarbon] production. The chemicals group's  Stammwerk plant, which has already produced 8,100 tonnes of  these ozone-damaging substances in the current year, was shut  down on Thursday and will be demolished for scrap. A smaller  production plant at Hoechst Brazil will cease production by 1995  at the latest, the company has announced. Used CFC's will no  longer be reprocessed by Hoechst in the future, but broken down  into their chemical components. There is thus only one CFC  producer left in Germany, Solvay in Hannover. A Solvay  spokesman has said that this firm, too, intends discontinuing  production within the next few weeks. Last year, Solvay produced  21,000 tonnes of CFC's.    Hoechst, which enjoyed 40 percent of the domestic and 5  percent of the world market, states that it is the first  producer in the world to cease CFC production. It used to  produce up to 90,000 tonnes a year. The group decided in 1989  to cease production, which will be banned in Germany from 1995  onwards. Chlorinated CFC's, which are in widespread use as  coolants in refrigerators and air-conditioning systems,  constitute the main threat to the ozone layer, which protects  the earth against ultraviolet solar radiation, at altitudes  between 15 and 20 kilometers. The chlorine contained in these  substances destroys the ozone chemically. Even now, a million  tonnes of CFC's are still concealed in chilling and  air-conditioning systems and plastic foams the world over.    Hoechst has recently begun producing the ozone-friendly  R134a  coolant as a substitute for chlorofluorocarbons.  Environmentalists, however, complain that this substance still  contributes to the greenhouse effect. There was an explosion in  the new R134a production plant a few weeks after it entered  service, in mid-March. Since then the plant has been at a  standstill by order of the authorities.</p>

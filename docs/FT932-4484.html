			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Jobs: A nation of employment addicts - Although survey shows the work ethic is strong in Britain, certain questions remain unasked FOR the Archangel Gabriel's sake, let's hope that the Almighty has a good sense of humour. If not, it is odds on that the two-way communicator between heaven and earth has been demoted or worse as a result of arriving on high with a survey report just published here below by a consortium of British employers and like interests. The study's subject is work which, except for a spot of light gardening, had no part in the original plans for human kind. It was inflicted on us, as the Old Testament makes plain, as a penalty for our first forebears' sinful lust for apples. That's why it is called 'Adam's curse'. So heaven will hardly rejoice to learn that, far from looking on work as the punishment it was intended to be, the Brits at least are leaping around chortling: 'I like it] I like it]' The study of 3,458 job-holders of all levels included a question asked in surveys before. It was: If you were to get enough money to live as comfortably as you would like for the rest of your life, would you continue to work, not necessarily in your present job, or would you stop working? When it was put to the public in 1977, no fewer than 60 per cent answered yes. Since then, despite the bitter recession, the number who are hooked on employment has risen to 67 per cent. To make matters worse, their liking for it apparently grows as it becomes harder. Not only did over three in every five of the latest lot happily report that the effort demanded from them had increased in the past five years, but 68 per cent claimed to be putting in still more effort than their bosses required. Besides hard graft, they are also having to invest more skill. True, nearly one in 10 admitted that the technical demands of their work had diminished over the last half decade, but another 63 per cent said they were being called on to exercise greater skill. The most marked increase in need for same was reported by those in jobs involving frequent dealings with other people, such as professional staff, managers, supervisors and the like. All reported more pressure on them to communicate persuasively, and be sensitive to the wants of customers and colleagues alike. In return for their added in-puts, most workers at all levels were being given a stronger say over what they should do and how they did it, and allowed to be innovative in their approach. The only cloud in the offing was that two thirds felt that their bosses didn't give them enough say over how their work was organised - a grumble seemingly linked with a majority view that, whatever their addiction to employment, they certainly weren't dependent on their present employer and could well trip off elsewhere when conditions improved. But, while that cloud might make the report unwelcome in boardrooms as well as heaven, the findings must come as manna to a beleaguered government. For they suggest that, on a national plane, the work ethic is not just alive and well in Britain, but stronger than ever before. Even so, to the Jobs column's mind, the 3,458 people's answers may be less crucial than certain questions they appear not to have been asked. For example, how much of the employment they found so addictive consisted of productive work? It is clear that the two aren't just the same thing. As countless housewives still demonstrate, it is possible to do productive work without being employed. Equally, no one need look far for evidence that it's possible to be employed without achieving any productive work. Nor is there any doubt on which of the two Britain's future prosperity depends. But even if there were, the present addiction to employment seems scarcely healthy. For the survey shows that the mounting demands for skill and effort have been accompanied by worsening experience of stress. And in terms of material rewards at least, Adam's curse has not merely been maintained, but is falling more and more on Eve as well. Whereas in 1984, 30 per cent of women job-holders explained that their earnings were essential to keep their family from bankruptcy, the same is now said by 40 per cent. FINALLY, to the underlying table which as on previous occasions is compiled from the latest of the Wyatt management consultancy's surveys of senior managers' pay and perks in 17 European countries. Anyone who wants full information on the findings, which were outlined in this corner of the FT four weeks ago, should contact Don McClune of the consultancy at 21 Tothill St, London SW1H 9LL: telephone (0)71-222 8033, fax (0)71-222-9182. Today's table is limited to 10 of the countries, and gives a broad idea of how each of them views the relative status of the various departments of business as measured by the money value employers put on their directors. The basis of the ranking is the typical gross pay received in cash - basic salary plus bonuses and so on - of a chief executive in the country in question, a figure which is indicated at the top in italic type. The departmental directors are then listed below, their order of appearance being decided by their typical gross pay expressed as a percentage of the chief executive's rewards.</p>

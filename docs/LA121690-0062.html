			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AHIMSA'S ROLE IN NURSING CARE  </P> <P> My letter is a response to the article about Ahimsa Care Facility in Laguna  Beach ("State Health Department Cites Ahimsa Center," Nov. 21). For the past  three years, I have been a frequent visitor to Ahimsa Nursing Home in Laguna  Beach, primarily to visit friends in the terminal stages of AIDS.  </P> <P> I have visited Ahimsa at various times of the day and evening. I have eaten  numerous times there. I have bathed friends using the Ahimsa facilities. I have  been involved with patient care. I have talked with the administration, and I  have prayed there.  </P> <P> I feel very qualified to speak with authority about Ahimsa as a care facility.  I have observed only kindness, patience and courtesy extended toward patients.  The nursing and administrative staff are professional and caring as they  administer their duties.  </P> <P> The place is kept very clean. The meals are warm, nutritious and appetizing.  Even as one enters the doors, one feels a warmth and decency about the place.  </P> <P> In my lifetime, I have had to place both my father and my grandmother in care  facilities, so I am acutely knowledgeable of their service and quality. I would  not hesitate to place a loved one at Ahimsa and, indeed, would feel fortunate  to have a place in a care facility as decent as Ahimsa.  </P> <P> Some people who visit a care facility are immediately overcome with negativity  because they are forced to see people in pain, people who are confused and  people who are in the terminal stages of disease.  </P> <P> I see the professional and kind workers at Ahimsa deal each day in a positive  and loving manner making the last days of our loved ones as decent, dignified  and human as they possibly can. They deserve our praise and thanks. It is a  hard job.  </P> <P> PHILIP R. ALLES, Los Angeles  </P></p>

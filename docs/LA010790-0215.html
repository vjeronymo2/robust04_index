			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOW CARTOONIST CHARACTERIZES HIS OLD PALS  </P> <P> Chuck Jones on a few of the Warner Brothers characters:  </P> <P> Bugs Bunny:  </P> <P> "Bugs was a very unusual character at Warners -- a comic hero. He started out  in a Harpo Marx mode, went through Groucho and ended up as a combination of Rex  Harrison playing Professor Higgins (who would like to stay in and mind his own  business, although still a very intellectual bird), D'Artagnan (because of the  things he could do) and Dorothy Parker (because of the quips).  </P> <P> If you blend those together, you have a pretty good idea of what Bugs was all  about."  </P> <P> Wile E. Coyote:  </P> <P> "The substance of all the Road Runner-Coyote pictures is not how to catch a  road runner, it's how many ways you can't catch a road runner. The Coyote is  his own worst enemy, which is true of all of us. To me, his relationship with  the Acme Co. is the perfect symbiosis: The Coyote supports the Acme Company by  buying -- or at least using -- the things they manufacture; the Acme Co.  survives by supplying them to him."  </P> <P> Daffy Duck:  </P> <P> "For Daffy, go back to when you were 6 years old. After you blow out the  candles, your parents hand you the knife and say, 'It's your birthday and you  can cut as big a piece of cake as you want.' You know full well that isn't  true: There's a particular wedge that's surrounded by corporal punishment -- if  you exceed it, you'll be sent to your room as a selfish little cad who doesn't  want anybody else to have any. Daffy does what we don't have the guts to do: He  grabs the whole cake and runs!"  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL TRACK / THE MASTERS;  </P> <P> FRESHMAN JONES OUTRUNS MILLER IN 100, 200 RACES  </P> <P> Nearly eight weeks ago, Inger Miller of Pasadena Muir earned the title of the  state's top girls' sprinter by defeating Marion Jones of Oxnard Rio Mesa twice  in the Arcadia Invitational.  </P> <P> Since their April showdown, however, Miller has been hampered by an ankle  injury that proved to be all the edge Jones needed in their rematch Friday  night in the Masters' track and field meet before 5,560 at Cerritos College.  </P> <P> Jones, a 14-year-old freshman, avenged her early season losses to Miller by  sprinting to victories in the 100 and 200 meters.  </P> <P> In almost a repeat of their Arcadia matchup, Jones again got off to a fast  start in the 100 meters. But, unlike in their first meeting, she was able to  hold off a late-charging Miller to win in 11.64 seconds to 11.65.  </P> <P> "That was best first 30 meters I ran all year," Jones said of the early part of  her race. "I knew it was close there at the end because she (Miller) is not the  type of runner who was going to stay back there."  </P> <P> In the 200 meters, it wasn't close. Jones ran a personal best 23.70 seconds to  defeat Miller, who clocked 24.27.  </P> <P> "Since our first meeting, I've been working on not breaking down near the  finish," Jones said. "Now, I know that I can beat her."  </P> <P> With the first first five finishers in each event qualifying for the State meet  June 1-2, Miller and Jones will meet again next week.  </P> <P> "We just wanted her (Miller) to qualify," said Muir Coach Jim Brownfield, whose  Mustangs won the team state title last season. "She was favoring her ankle (to)  where she was not pushing off of it well. It is a minute-by-minute thing."  </P> <P> Despite being slowed by her ankle, USC-bound Miller, who has the nation's top  marks in both the 100 and 200 meters, ran the anchor leg in Muir's victory in  the 400-meter relay.  </P> <P> Andre Green of Long Beach Poly reinforced his position as the Southern  Section's top boys' sprinter by winning the 100 (10.57) and 200 meters (21.26).  </P> <P> Coley Candaele of Carpinteria was also a top qualifier in two events, winning  in the 800 and 1,600 meters in come-from-behind fashion.  </P> <P> Napoleon Kaufman of Lompoc also had busy nights, finishing second in the 100  meters (10.60), third in long jump (22-10 3/4) and fifth in the 200 meters  (21.74).  </P> <P> Hawthorne, which has won six of the last seven boys' team state titles, will  not repeat as champion because of injuries, but it will have hurdler Demond  Smith in two events in the state meet.  </P> <P> Smith was impressive in finishing second to Andre Derezin of Muir in the  110-meter high hurdles and second to Charles Johnson of Cajon in the 300-meter  intermediate hurdles.  </P> <P> Overall, four defending state champions were top qualifiers in their events  Friday night.  </P> <P> Julian Yendork of Walnut, who won the girls' long- and triple-jump state titles  last year, led qualifiers in both events with leaps of 19-feet-4 and 41-1 1/4  respectively.  </P> <P> The girls' 800 meters champion, Kim Toney of Atascadero won her specialty in  2:08.11. The Arizona State-bound senior defeated Sheria Moses of Ramona by more  than seven seconds.  </P> <P> Felice Lipscomb of Santa Monica qualified to defend her 100-meter low hurdles  title by winning in a time of 13.97 seconds, ahead of Kim Barnes of Fontana,  who finished in 14.51.  </P> <P> Twila Sims of Lompoc, the state 300-meter low hurdles champion, defeated  Lipscomb in her specialty event, 42.29 to 42.30, after finishing third in the  100 low hurdles.  </P> <P> Deena Drossin of Agoura may not be a defending state champion, but she will be  a force this year after winning the 1,600 meters in 4:54.71 and finishing  second in the 3,200 in 10:42.40.  </P></p>

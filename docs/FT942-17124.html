			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Reuters hit by switching Electronic news and information group Reuters Holdings fell sharply on heavy turnover in spite of positive news as one investor was said to be shifting funds into a derivative version of the stock yesterday. The shares had fallen by some Dollars 2.50 in the US on Monday and were marked down at the start of trading in London yesterday to bring them back in line with the American Depositary Receipts. However, as London and New York prices recovered, Reuters remained in the doldrums and closed 35 off at 1925p. Marketmakers said there was selling of the ordinary shares to buy Daily Mail Group bonds. The 10-year bonds issued last summer are convertible into Reuters shares. Turnover of 4.7m shares - the third highest in more than three years - did suggest that prices were not being merely marked lower following jitters in New York. And the weakness came on a day when Reuters announced that Citicorp, the US bank, was paying Dollars 80m plus redundancy costs for Reuters to take the ailing Quotron dealing system group off its hands. The selling also came ahead of a presentation by Mr Peter Job, Reuters' chief executive, to analysts today and the company's annual meeting next week.</p>

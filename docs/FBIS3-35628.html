Ukraine Is Creating It  Contrary to Common Sense, Striving To Finally Divide the Black  Sea Fleet by Any Means"]    [Text] Of all the former union republics which had outlets  to seas (the Baltic countries, those in the Caspian region, and  Georgia), only Ukraine plans to call itself a naval power in the  very near future. If the economic crisis in the republic were  not so profound, by the start of the new millennium it would be  able to create its own fleet from scratch, as it were. Its  scientific potential, the shipbuilding capacities in Nikolayev,  Kherson, Kiev, and Kerch, the ships laid down at the time of the  "indivisible" Union, and the related enterprises producing  turbines, arms, and optical and electronic equipment make it  possible to implement a shipbuilding program which meets the  needs for defending the republic's sovereignty from the sea.  But the backbone of the Ukrainian Navy, which has already been  created, goes far beyond the tasks of a coastal fleet. Taking  into account the aspirations with regard to dividing the Black  Sea Fleet, Ukraine's future fleet is altogether seen as an  ocean-going one.  <H5>  A Fleet of Which Ukraine Never Dreamed </H5>   Since it proclaimed the policy of creating national armed  forces, Ukraine has followed the principle of having its "own  fleet, albeit a small one," capable of defending the republic's  coast against military and economic invasion and fulfilling the  functions of an emergency rescue service at sea. These tasks  are within the capabilities of a brigade -- two ships to guard  the area of water, several onshore missile and artillery  systems, and a combined (ground-attack fighters and helicopters)  air regiment. Even now, however, the Slavutich -- the flagship  of the Ukrainian Navy -- and the patrol combatant Sagaydachnyy  are clearly confined to the Black Sea in their actions. Like  the "Slava"-class guided missile cruiser which is being prepared  for sea trials, they need ocean expanses. Ukraine has on the  stocks and berthed in shipyards a whole number of other ships  whose building is incomplete, including the heavy  aircraft-carrying cruiser Varyag, for which the Black Sea,  figuratively speaking, is like a puddle. Having also gotten  half of the Black Sea Fleet, the Ukrainian Navy will outdo even  the German Bundesmarine in terms of strength.    Personnel -- from seaman to admiral -- are also finding the  Ukrainian Navy cramped. First, the number of potential  seafarers who have taken the oath is far greater than the number  of vacancies in the Ukrainian Navy today. Second, the Black Sea  Fleet is a kind of forge of cadres, and forms Ukraine's  mobilization reserve. Third, in previous years a large number of  the republic's citizens served in the Navy -- which under  conditions of a shortage of employment can very quickly create  competition for contract service in the Ukrainian Navy.  Finally, an additional influx of personnel can easily be  predicted if the decision to split the Black Sea Fleet "50-50"  is implemented.    In addition, Ukraine is hurriedly building up the forces of  the marines on the Crimean Peninsula. Doctrinally the tactic of  using marine landing forces has not yet been agreed upon, the  Ukrainian Navy does not have the means of getting them to  possible landing sites, with the exception of one "Zubr"-class  MDK [small amphibious warfare ship], and more and more people  originally from Western Ukraine, who make up the backbone of the  Ukrainian Marines, are turning up around Sevastopol and other  points where the Black Sea Fleet is based in Crimea. These guys  with a sleeve badge in the form of a wolf's jaws have already  been used repeatedly as a "detonator" for various kinds of  provocations: The takeover of apartment blocks constructed by  Black Sea Fleet sailors, the armed "resubordination" of  individual Black Sea Fleet units, and so on.    Ukraine also has a training base which is surplus to the  requirements of a coastal fleet. This is, first, the Naval  Institute based on two higher naval schools, which trains  shipboard cadres. Second, the center for retraining flight  personnel in Nikolayev and the center for training carrier-based  pilots in Saki.  <H5>  Some Get the Tops, Some the Bottoms </H5>   To the nonspecialist a fleet means ships, ships, ships....  But in actual fact, without the umbilical cord of mooring  cables connecting ships to the shore, such a fleet will exist  for just 30 days -- a ship's maximum period of endurance in  terms of fuel, water, and food. This was why Ukraine's power  minister and first naval commander in chief, who quit the  military-political arena not so long ago, campaigned in favor of  dividing up the Black Sea Fleet into "tops" and "bottoms": our  bases, your ships. Clearly, Russia does not want ships without  bases. Anyway, the fleet's onshore backup has never attained  civilized norms in the three centuries of its existence. Moving  the fleet, which works in the interests of the whole  Commonwealth, to unadapted berths overnight would mean ruining  it once and for all.    The Ukrainian military department was aware of this, but the  demand for just such a "division" has been implemented with a  persistence worthy of better application. This has essentially  meant ousting the Russian Fleet, which, having no other bases on  the Black Sea, would inevitably leave most of the Black Sea  Fleet's ships and vessels to Ukraine.    Similar submerged rocks are also inherent in dividing the  Black Sea Fleet "50-50." With the sole difference that half the  fleet at once passes to Ukraine's jurisdiction, while the rest  will then be divided by the same method of ousting. With the  present move toward supposedly outwardly more civilized  relations with the Black Sea Fleet sailors following the changes  in the Ukrainian military department, the tactic of "tops" and  "bottoms" has not lost its topicality. The "tops" (in other  words, the creeping privatization of the Black Sea Fleet's  onshore infrastructure) are being gathered with the help of  those same marines, whose place in Ukraine's military doctrine  has not yet been defined. Facilities which at first sight have  no bearing on the Black Sea Fleet's combat readiness are being  transferred to Ukrainian jurisdiction: the marine engineering  service, the housing stock. Moreover, in garrisons remote from  the chief base.    And yet the fleet is a multinational structure. The loss of  components, albeit not the leading ones, leads inevitably to the  breakdown of the entire "organism." There will be no housing on  the bases leased by the Black Sea Fleet (there was, at last,  talk precisely of leasing during the negotiations between  Ukraine and Russia last year), and the onshore infrastructure  will not be developed -- in the very near future neither Ukraine  nor Russia will have any need of the ships themselves.  <H5>  "To Execute, and No Pardon" </H5>   The "joint operation of bases," being imposed by the  Ukrainian side, essentially deprives the Black Sea Fleet of any  prospects for the future: Disagreements will be sure to arise  even between the closest neighbors if, for example, the status  of one spade between two is not enshrined in a corresponding  agreement.    The crack is being widened by the information blockade and  the imposition of the "only correct" information in the  Ukrainian interpretation of it: Central Russian publications,  including KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, do not reach Crimea, television  broadcasting is limited in terms of time and the number of  programs, and the press center of the Ukrainian Navy -- the  ideological mouthpiece for the division of the Black Sea Fleet  -- has a staff many times greater than that of the press center  of the Black Sea Fleet.    It is no wonder that, given this distribution of forces in  the "fourth estate," justification is found for any tricks by  the Ukrainian marines, by their commanders who pit their  subordinates against the "cursed Muscovites [moskalivy]," and by  higher officials who are impatiently awaiting the "black  redivision" of the Black Sea Fleet. Alas, we have to state that  in the Ukrainian fleet, which essentially has not yet come into  being, hatred for everything "non-Ukrainian" is cultivated far  better than common sense and the age-old friendship of the Slav  peoples. We who have prepared this material and who represent  both branches of the peoples who grew out of the single Slav  root find it all the more unpleasant to be aware of this. For,  in tracing the dynamics of the situation, we do not rule out the  least favorable development of events. The intensity of passion  in Crimea and in the Black Sea Fleet and the deepening crisis in  Ukraine's economy and policy are such that it will only take the  slightest provocation (these, let us dare to assert, are not  excluded from the arsenal of the "political" struggle for  possession of the peninsula and the fleet) and blood will flow.    So far the signal has not been given for a general  "offensive" against the Black Sea Fleet, and individual  "battles" of local significance are being waged. These include  "freezing" the Black Sea Fleet's accounts in Ukrainian banks and  levying all kinds of taxes and customs and other duties, whose  total, if it has not exceeded the Ukrainian "share" of the funds  once allocated to maintaining the fleet, at least long ago  became commensurate with it. Even the food and fuel imported  from Russia, with which Ukrainian seamen satisfy their needs,  are requisitioned. The sums recovered in this way go into the  Ukrainian Navy's budget. In these conditions the Black Sea  Fleet sailors should campaign to ensure that there is no tax on  air imported from Russia.    In other words, both the republic's leadership and the  Ukrainian Navy Command are doing everything to ensure that,  instead of the Black Sea Fleet on the southern flank of the CIS,  there is a weak Russian fleet based in unadapted places and an  enlarged Ukrainian fleet capable of operating far outside the  Black Sea. At the same time the Ukrainian side disregards the  fact that the division (in fact, the ruin) of the Black Sea  Fleet will result in an imbalance of forces in the region --  which will infringe Russia's legitimate interests. This means  that, in carrying out its sentence in respect of the Black Sea  Fleet ("to execute, and no pardon"), Ukraine could come up  against the fact that its "ocean-going coastal" fleet will not  protect its personal interests, which are defended today, albeit  to its own detriment, by the Black Sea Fleet.

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / International Company News: India gets a taste of the great world cola battle - Shira Sidhva finds Pepsi and Coke muscling in for their share of the country's fledgling softs drinks market INDIANS have done without the real thing for 15 years. Most have done without any soft drinks at all, with average consumption now at three bottles per person per year compared with 700 in the US. However, Coca-Cola, Pepsi and local manufacturers are entering battle for domination of an already intensely competitive Rs7.5bn (Dollars 240m) market which, some believe, will expand fourfold in the next five years. The government, which is seeking foreign investment as part of its economic reform programme, decided recently to allow Coca-Cola to re-enter India, after having expelled it in 1978 in a drive to reduce the role of multinationals in the Indian economy. Coca-Cola has decided not to go it alone, despite having government approval to set up a 100 per cent-owned venture. The Atlanta-based company will tie up with Parle Exports, which dominates the Indian soft drinks market with a 60 per cent share. Pepsi-Cola International, Coke's arch rival around the world, has built up an impressive 30 per cent share of the soft drinks market since its entry two years ago, albeit without using the Pepsi name and operating under several other government-imposed limits. Last week, it stepped up its campaign by announcing it would buy out Voltas Limited, its primary equity partner, to double its stake to 92 per cent in Pepsi Foods Limited, its food and beverage joint venture. Pepsi's buy-out will mean greater control of its manufacturing operations in the key markets of Bombay and Gujarat, currently franchised to Voltas, a trading, agrobusiness and engineering company owned by the Tata group. Pepsi executives blame Voltas for Pepsi's inability to make a dent in the Bombay region, which accounts for nearly 15 per cent of the overall market. In Bombay, Pepsi and Voltas were taking on Mr Ramesh Chauhan, India's cola king, who heads Parle. He has managed to make Thums Up a generic name for cola in India. Thums Up, which accounts for 40 per cent of Parle's soft drink sales, used lifestyle advertising similar to Coke's 'Can't Beat the Feeling' 1980s campaigns. The company spent Rs70m on its advertising blitz last year. A Parle executive describes the battle with Pepsi as a 'no-holds-barred, on-the-streets fight - purely a marketing game'. However, a marketing manager at Pepsi retorts with: 'We were fighting with our hands tied.' Government restrictions on Pepsi forced the company to use an indigenous brand name ('Lehar', meaning 'wave') and subjected soft drinks sales to a ceiling of 25 per cent of the company's annual turnover. The company says: 'We will now apply to the government to be treated on par with Coke, and the Pepsi brand name will be introduced soon.' Coca-Cola and Parle will form two joint ventures, one for bottling soft drinks (Parle owns two bottling plants in Bombay and Delhi and has 60 franchised bottling plants across India), and the other for marketing the brands of both companies. Parle will receive compensation from Coke for putting into the joint venture its successful brands Thums Up cola; Limca, a cloudy lemon drink; Gold Spot, orange; Citra, clear lemon; and Maaza, a mango fruit drink. Pepsi believes Parle's tie-up with Coke will mean that Coke and Parle's brands will jostle for the Indian cola market to the benefit of Pepsi. 'We have dealt with Coke in 152 countries, so we know precisely what we are in for now,' says a Pepsi executive. Pepsi plans to invest Rs9bn in India, mostly in the soft drinks business. Sales of its cola have grown 33 per cent in 1992, and are up an additional 24 per cent through the first half of this year. The company believes market share will increase once Pepsi is allowed to use its global brand name. Mr Chauhan, however, has a well-entrenched marketing and distribution network, which he had stubbornly refused to share with a foreign company, even a month ago. 'Lots of people ask us what we will do to counter Coca Cola,' he had said. 'We are the market leaders and it is for the new entrants to work out a strategy to counter us.'</p>

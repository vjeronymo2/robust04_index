According to Mr. Prosper, gunshots were actually only  heard in the vicinity of Mrs. Rey's residence. He immediately  gave instructions for police patrols to go to the scene. He  explains that this was done promptly by units from the  Port-au-Prince police and the Petion-Ville Military District,  which reinforced the protection of the concerned residence.  Rene Prosper communicated these explanations to the HAITI PRESS  AGENCY over the phone from Miami, where he was participating in  the international conference on the Haitian crisis.</p>

			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Westbury 45% up at Pounds 3.7m as house sales rise WESTBURY, the Cheltenham-based housebuilder, yesterday announced a 45 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 3.7m in the six months to August 31 compared with Pounds 2.56m. Earnings per share increased more modestly to 3.7p (3.5p) reflecting the exceptional tax credit which significantly reduced the tax charge in 1992. The interim dividend is maintained at 1.75p. Turnover in the first half increased by 8 per cent to Pounds 70m (Pounds 64.5m), buoyed by higher house sales which grew to 1,201 compared with 1,115 in the first half last year. The average selling price in the group's core private housebuilding activities was Pounds 60,628, down 1 per cent from a year earlier, even though prices in the market as a whole fell by about 4 per cent. Westbury managed to offset the decline by changing its product mix and reducing the proportion of first-time buyer homes from 80 per cent to 70 per cent of the total. Mr Richard Fraser, chief executive, said house prices appear to have stabilised in June. 'They are not going up, and they are not going down,' he said. Nevertheless, he said sales incentive discounts had fallen marginally, from Pounds 2,800 to Pounds 2,350 a house. The operating margin on house sales for the period was 6.2 per cent, in line with a year ago but a significant increase over the 5 per cent achieved in the six months to the end of February. Operating profits increased from Pounds 3.63m to Pounds 4.2m more than offsetting an increase in losses from the group's interests in associated undertakings which climbed to Pounds 642,000 (Pounds 493,000). Pre-tax profits also benefited from the turnround from Pounds 583,000 in net interest costs to net interest receipts of Pounds 145,000. During the six months Westbury acquired over 1,200 plots boosting its land bank to 6,050 against 5,850 at the year end. Mr Fraser said there was no general increase in land prices although there was upward presure in some areas. The group ended August with net borrowings of Pounds 4.2m, down from Pounds 7.4m at the year end, equivalent to gearing of 4 per cent.</p>

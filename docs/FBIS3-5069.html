The schedule for inspections  by a seven-member IAEA team was based on the prospect that the  United States will announce an agreement on the issue with North  Korea on Thursday. The agreement will include a date for a  third round of high-level talks between Washington and  Pyongyang, tentatively set for March 21 in Geneva.    IAEA sources said, however, the team will actually be able  to  start inspections from Friday as the U.S. announcement is likely  to be made during the night in Far Eastern time. The inspection  team, which arrived in Pyongyang on Tuesday, is expected to be  engaged in inspections for two weeks.    The U.S. and North Korea reportedly agreed last Friday at a  working-level meeting in New York that Pyongyang would resume  dialogue with South Korea and fully implement IAEA inspections  of its seven declared nuclear plants to realize a third round of  bilateral talks.</p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: Re-balancing the books - The Main Points The chancellor announced a package of immediate and future tax increases in an attempt to avoid 'excessive government borrowing over the medium-term' from preventing 'a sustained economic recovery'. His tax package is broadly neutral this year but will boost government revenues by Pounds 6.7bn in 1994-95 and Pounds 10.3bn in 1995-96. Income tax: No change in the basic rate and no increase in the top rate of tax but the 20 per cent tax band will be widened by Pounds 500 to the first Pounds 2,500 of taxable income from April 1 this year. It will widen to the first Pounds 3,000 in 1994. Personal allowances, the married couples' allowance and the inheritance tax threshold of Pounds 150,000 were frozen this year. National insurance to rise: The main rate for employees and the self-employed will rise by 1 per cent next year, but there will be no change in employers' contributions. VAT extended: Extension of the VAT base limited to domestic fuel and power. From April 1994 it will be levied at 8 per cent, rising to 17.5 per cent in April 1995. Driving penalised: Road fuels will rise by 10 per cent this year to pay for the abolition of car tax last autumn. This adds 2.7p to a litre of unleaded and 3.3p to a litre of leaded petrol. Vehicle excise duty on cars, vans and taxis will rise by Pounds 15 to Pounds 125. Scale charges on company cars will rise by 8 per cent and car fuel scale charges by 20 per cent. The discount on high business mileage will be abolished and from next year, company cars will be taxed according to their list price rather than engine size. Excise duties rise: The chancellor left the duty on spirits unchanged; other alcohol duties rose by 5 per cent. This added 1 1/2 p to a pint of beer and 5 1/2 p to a bottle of wine. A 6.5 per cent increase in tobacco duty added 10p to a packet of 20 cigarettes and 4 1/2 p to five small cigars. Housing: The stamp duty threshold for houses, land and property was doubled to Pounds 60,000. But tax relief on mortgage interest will be limited to 20 per cent from April next year. Small businesses: The Budget introduced wide ranging measures to help small businesses. Business rates will not increase in real terms this year and the threshold above which traders are required to register for VAT will rise from Pounds 36,600 to Pounds 37,600. There will be relief on capital gains tax where entrepreneurs reinvest the gains from the sale of shares in their own business in new unquoted trading companies. Premiums on the loan guarantee scheme will be reduced and traders will also be able to claim VAT relief on bad debts after six months. VAT penalties on late returns and misdeclarations eased. Industry: The rate of advanced corporation tax will be reduced to 22.5 per cent for this financial year and to 20 per cent from April 1994. The chancellor also announced improvements to export credits. Long-term unemployed: A new vocational education programme will finance 30,000 unemployed people to take full-time courses. Expansion of business start-up scheme will provide extra 10,000 places for people wishing to start their own businesses. Infrastructure: The channel tunnel rail link will proceed as a joint venture between the government and the private sector and the Heathrow express will go ahead as a joint venture between British Rail and BAA.</p>

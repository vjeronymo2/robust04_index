			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Kevin Maxwell 'signed invalid transfer' MR Kevin Maxwell's signature appeared on an invalid transfer of Pounds 32m of shares from Bishopsgate Investment Management, which managed much of the Maxwell pension funds, according to a preliminary report made by BIM's auditors, Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte. The shares in EURIS, a French investment trust, are being held by Banque National de Paris as security for a loan to a private company in the Maxwell empire. BIM has received no payment for the transfer, the report said. Mr Kevin Maxwell alone authorised the transaction whereas two signatures were required, the Coopers report said. Details of the transfer, and others from the Pounds 727m of assets managed by BIM for Maxwell pension funds, emerged as Mr Kevin Maxwell was due to appear before the Parliamentary Select Committee on Social Security this morning to explain the disappearance of assets from pension funds. Coopers prepared the report in its role as auditors to BIM shortly before Robson Rhodes was appointed as provisional liquidator of BIM in early December. The report says Pounds 428m was lent in cash or shares to Robert Maxwell Group, one of the main private Maxwell companies. Robson Rhodes says it has yet to trace Pounds 327m missing from BIM and it is uncertain who owns Pounds 400m it has found. The Coopers report also identifies when shares that were being used as collateral for so-called 'stock lending' from BIM to Maxwell private companies began to disappear. BIM began a stock lending programme in 1989, administered by London and Bishopsgate International, another private Maxwell entity. Stock lending is a market practice encouraged by the Bank of England. In July 1991 management of the stock lending programme passed to Maxwell Central and East European Partners, another Maxwell entity, with LBI acting as joint agents for Robert Maxwell Group. At the start of 1991, BIM received collateral mainly in the form of Maxwell Communication Corporation and Berlitz shares. In June Mr Robert Maxwell 'took control of the collateral', the report says, 'except the Berlitz shares which were held in a safe in his secretary's office.' Mr Larry Trachtenberg, a former director of BIM, told Coopers that at the end of September the collateral was adequate but after Robert Maxwell died on November 6, the safe was checked and no collateral was found.

			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S MANIPULATION OF OPINION, NOT JUSTICE;  </P> <P> EL SALVADOR: THE ARREST OF CHURCHWOMAN JENNIFER CASOLO IS A NAKED ATTEMPT,  AFTER THE MURDERS OF SIX PRIESTS, TO INFLUENCE THE UNITED STATES.  </P> <P> To kill priests and church workers is no longer enough in El Salvador. To  discredit those who are alive is seen as more effective.  </P> <P> Churchwoman Jennifer Casolo, accused by the Salvadoran military of storing arms  for the rebels in the yard of the house she rented in San Salvador, is the  coordinator of Christian Education Seminars and a chief organizer of U.S.  congressional and church tours of El Salvador. She is innocent of the  outrageous accusations, which constitute another example of the judicial farce  known as the Salvadoran justice system. Prosecutors cannot even decide under  which law to charge Casolo.  </P> <P> But why is she so important?  </P> <P> People on the Christian Education delegations could see for themselves the  poverty, hunger and destitution of El Salvador and conclude that its current  problems go far beyond a struggle for political power. Casolo provided speakers  who represented both sides in the civil war, and her educational tours included  talks with government, army and opposition officials.  </P> <P> For many people these tour-seminars have been the turning point in  understanding U.S. involvement in the civil war, which currently costs the  United States $1.4 million a day in military aid sent to prop up a weak  government bent on war. Delegates came to realize that humanitarian aid must  take precedence and that U.S. involvement should be a force for a negotiated  political solution. In short, the message the delegates brought home is that  the status quo in El Salvador is no longer acceptable; change is mandatory.  </P> <P> Polls indicate that most Americans do not support U.S. military involvement in  El Salvador. Much of the credit for this belief goes to the eyewitness reports  from church observers. Thus Casolo's arrest is not meant simply to stop the  delegations from arriving. It is a concerted and symbolic message that attacks  the credibility of the church's honest attempt to assess the civil war as a  whole.  </P> <P> For those laboring in church work, there is another parallel. This week marks  the ninth anniversary of the murders of U.S. missionaries Maura Clarke, Jean  Donovan, Ita Ford and Dorothy Kazel. In 1980 these brutal murders rallied  American citizens to argue and win in Congress a temporary halt to U.S.  military assistance to El Salvador. It is difficult to discredit dead  churchwomen. One live churchwoman allegedly caught with arms for the guerrillas  sows seeds of doubt in the minds of the American public.  </P> <P> So now in 1989 we have before us six dead Jesuits, their housekeeper and her  young daughter -- and one live, discredited churchwoman. Which church message  will the American public believe? Each time new martyrs are created, U.S.  policy is questioned. However, each time church workers are described as  leftist subversives, U.S. opinion shifts. This is a sinister and despicable  ploy on the part of the Salvadoran government.  </P> <P> For that government, winning its war is not simply controlling the capital, but  winning votes in Washington. Many of these votes are based on the credibility  of the church's message.  </P> <P> Last month the barbaric murders of the six Jesuits and two women rallied  American churches to demand a halt to military aid to El Salvador. The  congressional vote to cut aid was 194 in favor and 215 against, with 24 not  voting. This was a close call for a Congress in a frenzy to pass a huge  appropriations budget and in a rush to recess for the holidays.  </P> <P> It does not take much to realize that the balance of power is in the non-voting  members of Congress. When they reconvene in January, how will those 24 cast  their votes? Will they listen to the authentic message of the churches, which  are saying "no more military aid to El Salvador"? Or will they fall for the  false image created by the Salvadoran government, of an allegedly discredited  churchwoman?  </P></p>

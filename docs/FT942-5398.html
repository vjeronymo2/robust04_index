			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Watch those Pep charges - Fourth in Anthony Bailey's series on the true costs of investing Investors should be wary of placing too much emphasis on the costs of investing. Other factors, such as the quality and record of a fund manager or the administrative efficiency of a broker, can be equally or more important. When it comes to personal equity plans, however, it is important to pay extra attention to costs. How do they measure up against the gain from Pepping an investment: namely, the tax-saving? There is no point in investing in a tax shelter if the cost of doing so exceeds the benefit. 'Charge-free' Peps What this actually means is that all you pay are the charges on the underlying unit trust. In fact, there are no specific Pep charges levied on the great bulk of Pepped funds. This is because most Pepped money is invested in unit trusts. With few exceptions, unit trust managers allow investors to Pep their funds at no extra cost, although they will have the usual underlying unit trust costs. The case for Pepping is strong with charge-free Peps. Even non-taxpayers can benefit because they avoid the bother of having to re-claim tax and can re-invest gross dividends. There are, though, a few caveats. You will not normally be able to mix funds from different managers within the same Pep. And you are likely to have to pay a transfer fee if you decide to switch to another manager. You will also need to decide if your chosen unit trusts are the most suitable investment to Pep. That could depend on whether you expect greater growth or higher dividends from other bits of your portfolio. Reduced charges Recent developments in the unit trust market have actually made Pep investing cheaper. Fidelity levies a 2 per cent initial charge on its unit trusts placed in a Fidelity Pep. That is a saving of 3.25 per cent on the normal charge, and means the eventual pay-out will be increased by 3.25 per cent. There is, though, an exit charge in the first three years. M&amp;G's Managed Income Pep has no initial charge, boosting the final pay-out by 5.5 per cent. Exit charges are levied in the first five years. Likewise, Guinness Flight, Gartmore and Schroders are among fund managers who have made investing in a Pep cheaper than investing outside one. When charges bite Charge-free Peps are not for everyone, though. Active investors who tend to buy and sell a range of unit and investment trusts, and those who prefer to put their money directly into shares, inevitably incur charges. The main ones are the initial and annual charges. Where these are levied, they may be flat rate or percentage-based. You might be looking at an initial charge of Pounds 30 to Pounds 75, or up to 5 per cent of your investment. Annual charges may be a flat Pounds 20 to Pounds 60 but, more typically, are 1 to 1.5 per cent of the capital value. In addition to the main charges, there are other costs. Fees of up to Pounds 50 to attend an annual general meeting are not uncommon. Other charges may be more significant. A fee of Pounds 10, Pounds 25 or 1 per cent for taking cash out of a Pep will not suit investors planning on a regular income. Fees of Pounds 20 to Pounds 50, or perhaps Pounds 10 per holding, for transferring to another plan manager could also bite. Choosing on cost Some fees charged by some plan managers seem excessive and can be avoided easily by taking your custom elsewhere. Nevertheless, choosing between different charging structures is not easy. A fee to cover the cost of re-claiming tax on each dividend is simple and straightforward. But how many shares and unit trusts do you expect to have in your portfolio, and of what value? With any plan manager, you will want to check details of brokerage commission and minimum dealing charge. Are they priced competitively? What is the cost of buying and selling unit trusts; and are there any switching discounts? The best deal very much depends on what sort of investor you are (or expect to be). Do you want to invest in a mix of shares, unit trusts and investment trusts, or can you live with restrictions? Do you want a self-select Pep, or are you happy to give discretion to an investment manager? Are you likely to be an active investor who deals often? Chase de Vere's Pep Guide, price Pounds 9.95, gives a comprehensive listing of fund managers and their charges (tel: 071-404 5766 for details). Do not forget you will need to add VAT of 17.5 per cent to most costs, although this does not apply to a broker's dealing charge. Cost/tax benefit analysis When it comes to personal equity plans with charges, the case for Peps is not clear-cut. They are a must for investors who pay higher-rate tax and those whose portfolio is big enough to generate a capital gain of more than the annual Pounds 5,800 capital gains tax exemption. Basic-rate taxpayers with small portfolios will need to do some sums, though. A small portfolio could well grow sufficiently to hit the capital gains tax net, so Pepping could make sense. But a cheaper way to protect against CGT could be to bed and breakfast enough investments each year - that is, selling late one day and buying back early the next - so that, eventually, you can bed and breakfast them into a Pep once the portfolio has grown enough. As for the income tax saving, one way of measuring this is to compare the expected yield with the annual percentage charge. Basic-rate taxpayers should multiply the annual percentage charge (before adding on VAT) by 5.875. Higher rate taxpayers should do the same, then divide the answer by 2. The resulting figure must match the yield for the income tax saving simply to pay for the annual charge. Thus, an 0.5 per cent charge has a break-even yield of 2.94 per cent for a basic-rate taxpayer and 1.47 per cent for a higher-rate taxpayer. The break-even yields for a 1.5 per cent annual charge would be 8.81 and 4.41 per cent respectively.  ------------------------------------- COST CHECK  ------------------------------------- Service charge                    Cost Initial charge Annual charge Dividend charge Cash withdrawals Transfers out Closing a plan Attending AGM Receiv'g company reports Share dealing commission Buying and selling unit trusts Unit trust switching discount Interest rate on cash hldgs Loss of shareholders' perks?  -------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Arts: Today's Television Is it really sheer chance that tonight's Arena on BBC2 happens to clash with Heartburn on BBC1? Arena sets out to challenge the pretence that 'any resemblance between the characters portrayed in this book and any person living or dead is entirely coincidental'. The programme attempts to discover who is really supposed to be who in fiction, and 'where writers draw the line between literature and stitching up their friends, not to mention getting revenge on their enemies' (9.30). Meanwhile Heartburn (9.30) offers a big-screen version of the book by Nora Ephron, which is all about a marriage between Washington media folk. The marriage is ruined by an affair between the husband, a journalist, and a diplomat's wife. Since Ephron was married to Watergate journalist Carl Bernstein there has never been too much mystery about who was really being portrayed. Unfortunately even though Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep play the couple it is not the greatest of films. Radio 3 has an unusual concert of music by Ravel, played by the BBC Welsh SO (7.30).</p>

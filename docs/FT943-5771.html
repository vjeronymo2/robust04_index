			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / FA Cup gains a sponsor Littlewoods Pools yesterday became the first sponsor of the 123-year-old English Football Association Cup in a deal worth Pounds 14m, Neil Buckley writes. Together with investment in support activities, Littlewoods is committing a total of Pounds 20m over four years - the biggest-ever sports sponsorship package. The company will have its name attached to the FA Charity Shield as well as the Cup. The FA launched a marketing programme in June combining the commercial rights of the FA and Wembley Stadium, called Total Football. Companies joining the programme were given the opportunity to become 'presenting sponsor' of the FA Cup. The FA selected Littlewoods, a family-owned football pools and retailing business, as the 'ideal candidate'. Littlewoods has previously sponsored the League Cup.</p>

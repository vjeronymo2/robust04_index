			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi by </F> unidentified reporter; place and date not given--recorded]    [Text] [Announcer] How does Silvio Berlusconi answer the  attacks made by his ally [Northern League leader] Umberto Bossi?    [Bossi] Ours is a great idea, a strong idea, a great project  to give Italy a liberal-democratic majority and government. I  believe that this idea is so strong that it cannot fail but to  advance confidently. It is stronger than protagonists and men,  and perhaps stronger even than their particular positions -- and  why not? -- than their egoism and their tawdriness.    [Reporter] So you see Bossi and [National Alliance leader  Gianfranco] Fini coming together again?    [Berlusconi] I see a project that will win.    [Reporter] All the political forces want to name the prime  minister. Does Forza Italia also want its own prime minister?    [Berlusconi] No, I believe that Italians will choose a prime  minister with their votes. If, as I forecast looking at today's  opinion polls, the freedom alignment or the group for good  government -- that is, the liberal-democratic group -- will win.  The votes obtained within this group will indicate who should  be given the task of forming a government.</p>

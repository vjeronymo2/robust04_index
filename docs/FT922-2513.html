			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / French warning to media buyers FRENCH competition authorities have taken fresh action against the discount-buying muscle of media purchasing agencies, in a move likely to be welcomed by media owners across Europe. The Competition Council, France's anti-trust agency, has written to 40 media and publicity groups warning that they may be illicitly distorting fair competition on more than 90 counts. It is concerned about the way France's advertising market has come to be dominated by media buying agencies, whose purpose is to use their volume power to get cheaper space for their advertising agency customers. The top four - Carat, PMS, TMP and Eurocom - together account for almost 80 per cent of French media buying. They are keen to repeat the French model elsewhere in Europe, to the anxiety of many media owners who have seen their advertising margins dwindle or vanish during the recession. The council alleges that Carat, Europe's largest media buyer, has forced media owners into 'economic dependence', according to a French press report confirmed officially yesterday. Media buyers generally conceal from customers the rates paid for space bought on their behalf, adds the council. Discounts must be made clear to all, it argues. The government has already signalled its anxiety about the growing strength of media buyers when last year it told Eurocom and Carat - which had formed an alliance two years previously - that they could not work together in France. This latest step was triggered by an inquiry by the Finance Ministry's competition division. The companies concerned will in the next few months have the chance to respond to the council. It has the power to enforce changes in the way they operate and to levy fines. A decision is expected this autumn.</p>

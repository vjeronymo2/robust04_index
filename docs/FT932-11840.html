			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report COPPER prices fell to fresh session lows on the LME, dragged lower by New York. Business was not particularly active yesterday, as the markets re-adjusted after Wednesday's advances were snuffed out and traders became more cautious. Comex opened sharply down, but was recovering some of the losses in later trading. 'Copper opened up on the defensive and sustained another round of heavy losses in the early hectic, almost frenetic, trading,' said one New York analyst. 'The selling spate was relatively short-lived however, but supported by looming industrial action in eastern Germany and news of yet more increases in production coming this time from Chile.' New York raw SUGAR stayed lower at midday and was perched just above the lows of the week as the market shrugged off a bullish report from FO Licht, which cut its estimate of world sugar production in 1992-93 to 113.01m tonnes from a previous projection of 114.88m. New York COTTON prices were ahead at midday following Wednesday's steep sell off. One broker said the low prices had probably attracted better inquiries for US cotton. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / US takes hard line on 'dumping': Hopes raised by Uruguay Round may be dashed One achievement of the Uruguay Round was agreement on tighter restraints on dumping and countervailing duty laws - actions that have increasingly become weapons of choice for companies seeking protection from foreign imports. But countries that thought their products would get a fairer deal in the US, as a result, may have under-estimated the resourcefulness of US trade lobbyists. A word here, a phrase there, inserted in the implementing legislation for the Uruguay Round, means that foreign steel exporters and other industries selling in the US market could still find themselves subject to 'unfair trade' complaints and years of expensive litigation before winning market access for their products. A senior Administration official last week insisted that the US would abide by the accord it signed in Marrakesh, setting the seal on the global trade liberalising measures agreed in the Uruguay Round negotiations within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 'Consistent with the Gatt agreement is the right to have effective anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws,' the official added. Mr Gary Horlick, a Washington trade lawyer representing a large group of manufacturers, said that US exporters were worried about 'anything the US does which increases the likelihood of trade barriers'. Such action, he said, 'can and will be used by other countries against our exports - and the US government will not be able to defend us,' he said. A rewrite of the US trade rules to comply with Uruguay Round is drawing to a close. A House-Senate conference committee soon will meet to resolve differences in the implementing legislation written in the House by the Ways and Means Committee and in the Senate by the Finance Committee. Then the entire implementing legislation will be on a 'fast-track' for Congressional approval. The Administration will send it back to Congress for a simple vote, with no amendmend allowed. Trade lawyers from both sides of the issue have been fighting tooth and nail for months. Before the ink had dried on the Marrakesh accord, the Committee to Support US Trade Laws had sprung into being. 'We do not intend to stand by passively and allow our market to be eroded by dumped, injurious imports at the expense of our workers and companies,' said Mr Joseph Avento, chairman of Specialty Tubing Group, and a member of the committee. Mostly the committee sought to limit the 'damage' inflicted on US trade laws by pushing loopholes in the Gatt agreement to - and beyond - their limits. There was even an attempt to get the government to repay US petitioners for the cost of their legal fees out of dumping or countervailing duties collected. On the other side, exporters and importers of steel, textiles and other products banded together to demand that the Administration honour both the letter and spirit of Marrakesh - not incidentally because US companies have become the most frequent targets of foreign anti-dumping actions. The Administration rebuffed the most protectionist proposals from Congress, but added some new ones of its own. Free traders were particularly outraged about defeat of a provision that would have allowed the waiver of anti-dumping and countervailing duties, for products in short supply, In this case the Administration joined forces with the Committee to Support US Trade Laws because, according to a senior official, high duties do not prohibit supply - they simply make it cost more. One provision in the implementing legislation likely to pass would allow the imposition of countervailing duties to compensate for subsidies given to businesses - such as British Steel - even though they were later privatised and sold at market value. Another provision provides a formula to determine the market share of foreign companies, which would increase the likelihood of the International Trade Commission ruling that a US company has been injured by dumping or subsidies. The ProTrade Group, a group of exporters, says there are more than 24 violations of the Gatt pact in the implementing legislation. These are likely ultimately to be challenged under the new World Trade Organisation (to replace Gatt), and if the US is found in the wrong, it will have to either amend its law or pay compensation. That could mean one industry would have to pay for the protection granted another. Mr James Currie, deputy chief of the European Union delegation, expressed concerns about protectionist tendencies in Congress. 'Some of the language going around at the moment would simply make it impossible for goods - and particularly steel - to get access and compete fairly in the US market,' he said. But he is 'relatively content' that the Clinton administration will try to do its best to resist Congressional pressure. That the EU is not complaining more could be an indication that its own implementing legislation is by no means free of protectionist distortion, said one observer. In the end, both the US and the EU could suffer as governments in the rest of the world demonstrate that, where protection is concerned, they can be just as creative.</p>

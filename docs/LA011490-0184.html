			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> RED-HOT CERRITOS MAKES EL CAMINO RED-FACED, 102-78  </P> <P> Who were the imposters wearing El Camino's blue uniforms last night in the  Cerritos College gym?  </P> <P> Whoever they were, they couldn't shoot, play defense for long or hang on to the  ball.  </P> <P> Difficult to believe it was the real McCoy. The Warriors, who defeated Cerritos  by 12 points in mid-November, couldn't come closer than a 15-point deficit  against the defending state champions in the second half of Saturday's South  Coast Conference game.  </P> <P> The result was an embarrassing 102-78 loss to the unranked Falcons, who have  only one returning starter from last year's championship team.  </P> <P> Cerritos improved its record to 14-10 and 1-1 in the SCC, while El Camino fell  to 16-6, 1-2 in the league.  </P> <P> "What happened?" asked El Camino Coach Ron McClurkin. "Don't look at me. I  don't know what happened."  </P> <P> Poor shooting (26 of 70 in the game) and an array of costly turnovers put the  Warriors behind, 50-32, at halftime.  </P> <P> The problems started midway through the first half, when El Camino fell behind  17-27 after a two-minute dry spell that included bricks from the entire crew.  </P> <P> Then the Warriors had a 3 1/2-minute scoreless period that put them behind,  38-19, after a pair of free throws by Cerritos' Edgar Loera with 5:58 left to  the break.  </P> <P> From that point, things only got worse for El Camino, whose defense proved  ineffective against Cerritos' lethal outside shooting. Falcon sophomore guard  Doug Newby had 20 points in the first half, including six of six  three-pointers.  </P> <P> Cerritos' lead only got bigger as the second half got under way. Russ May's  10-foot jumper put the Falcons ahead, 67-42, with 12:34 left in the game.  </P> <P> David Keeter's three-point shot followed by Larry Lockley's lay-in with 3:03  remaining shaved the lead to 15, but hopes of a Warrior comeback were long  gone.  </P> <P> In four years in the SCC, El Camino has never beat Cerritos at home, but Falcon  Coach Jack Bogdanovich never thought his club could defeat the seventh-ranked  Warriors by this much.  </P> <P> "We just got up on them," he said. "Last time we tried that it didn't work."  </P> <P> Keeter led El Camino with 25 points and Lockley had 22.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sikandar Bakht: "Kashmir, Human Right, and </F> America"]    [Text] All the announcements made by the government about  the improving situation in Kashmir and the reduction in  terrorist activities are wrong. The situation in the valley is  still bad, and this fire has spread to the Jammu area also.  Bombs are being blasted in Doda, Udhampur, Kishtwar, and Jammu  city itself, and the sphere of terrorist activities is  increasing.    Bomb blasts, loss of innocent lives, and looting and burning  are very common now. It seems that the government is sleeping.  Such incidents have been happening in Jammu region for the last  four years. Our government refuses to wake up. We are not  talking about limited activities, but of total inactivity! How  can there be any good administration possible when the  responsibility for administration has been given to criminals  who have served jail terms, are untrustworthy, have bad records,  and have been expelled from their positions for some crime or  other. Such people have been appointed to important positions.  These include persons who had opposed India at the United  Nations level. How can we expect the situation to improve with  such appointments? The situation in the home ministry is such  that one minister says one thing and the other something else.    Both ministers in the home ministry have adopted different  attitudes about Jammu-Kashmir, and the attitude of the  Jammu-Kashmir government is yet another factor. Let us take the  Hazratbal affair. It is hard to understand why the government  wants to provide itself such an elaborate proof. The opinion of  the security forces about it is very different.    How many murders have been committed in Doda and Kishtwar?  How many bombs went off? What kind of situation exists in Jammu?  The situation of the Jammu population is very different from  that of the valley population. If the situation continues to  worsen here, it could get a lot more dangerous than in the  valley. I just do not understand some of the developments. My  simple and straight question is: How long will we play with  words? We want to continue our talks with Pakistan. We have also  have presented six points on which the talks would be based.  Pakistan has taken the position that it wants to talk to us on  its own terms. I wish that the Parliament first explained to the  people of our country what right Pakistan has to interfere in a  situation that is between us and our people? Whatever is  happening between us and our own people is our own affair and I  just do not understand the reason for holding mutual talks [with  Pakistan] over it.    Pakistan's position in Kashmir is only that of an aggressor.  The only question we can discuss with Pakistan is: When will it  withdraw from the area it has taken over as an invader? I fail  to understand why we repeatedly use words which leave out many  facts. Why have we accepted Pakistan according to its own  perspective instead of from our own perception? Whenever we talk  with Pakistan at the international level, we talk under the  conditions set by Pakistan, for example, violation of human  rights.    Why do not we tell Pakistan that it has no right to  interfere  in our affairs? We have failed to present our case to the world  that the talks that are being held with Pakistan are over the  part of Kashmir that is occupied by Pakistan. In fact, the talks  should be held to discuss the region that Pakistan is occupying  illegally. We have not been able to explain at the international  forum that we can hold talks with Pakistan only based on the  removal of the Pakistani government's and the Pakistani army's  occupation of Kashmir. We have not been able to present this  case strongly to this date.    Pakistan has talked a lot about self-determination, however,  it does not understand what this term means. If we talk about  self-determination within the framework of all countries in the  world, every country has the danger of breaking up.  Self-determination can lead only to breaking up a country.    Just like any other country, India also has its own borders.  Is it possible that people from any part of India should ask for  separating from India based on their self-determination right?  Obviously, we cannot endanger any nation's unity this way. No  part of India can be separated from it, and we must explain this  very clearly to the international community. The fact is that  the international community does not have the right to interfere  in any country's internal affair. Jammu-Kashmir's merger into  India is both legal and final. This has been fully supported in  the United Nations also. The United Nations also has recognized  that Pakistan is illegally occupying a part of Indian territory.  However, we have fully failed in raising these basic issues. We  must explain to the international community that if any Indian  state is toyed with under Pakistan's pressure, the scary  catastrophe of the 1947 partition would be reenacted.  Unfortunately, the shadows of the 1947 partition are still  chasing us. Pakistan by interfering in the Kashmir issue,  various parties that are active in Kashmir, and the people who  are trying to give a religious color to this affair, have all  forgotten that India's Muslims do not live only in Kashmir. 120  million Muslims are spread all over India.    As for the human rights issue, the statements issued by  Robin  Raphel and Clinton are very disappointing. Robin Raphel has put  a question mark on Kashmir's merger into India. By saying this,  she has implied what the United Nations has said is also wrong.  President Clinton and Robin Raphel forgot that the human rights  in Kashmir are being violated by the terrorists who are trained  in Pakistan and sent to our country for carrying on murder and  carnage in our country. I would like to ask a basic question of  the Americans. Have they read the history of India? Do they know  that the thousands of years old Indian culture is based on human  rights? The foundation of our thousands of years old  civilization and culture is human rights. Our nation's  civilization never practiced piracy. Our nation has never  colonized another country. We never even thought about  colonizing. Our nation gave birth to Mahatma Buddha, Bhagwan  Mahavir, and Mahatma Gandhi. These are the people who are known  as ambassadors of peace and non-violence in the whole world. The  United States itself fought a bloody battle to keep its unity.  What lesson can it give us about human rights today? Other  civilizations in the world have taken lessons from us in this  subject.    It is surprising that whoever talks about human rights in  Kashmir only sees the security forces. They never mention human  rights violations committed by the terrorists who are playing  with the lives of innocent citizens day and night. They do not  mention that their extreme actions and atrocities have forced  hundreds and thousands of Kashmiris to flee their homes and live  in camps outside Delhi. Our government has failed to shed light  on this aspect of terrorism in Kashmir. We can easily find an  answer to this question if we recognize whether the terrorists  or the security forces came to Kashmir first. It is clear that  the terrorists came there and spread terrorism and tried to  break up our country. That is when the need to send the security  forces there was felt. The security forces are protecting lives  and property of the citizens in Kashmir.    I want to tell the U.S. administration that the UN  resolutions about holding a plebiscite that Pakistan talks about  day and night also call for Pakistan to vacate the part of  Kashmir it is occupying. We have failed to communicate this fact  also. Is it not surprising that they are talking about holding a  plebiscite by separating it from the whole resolution!    We are being very careful. I know the problems the  government  is facing. It has to go to the World Bank, and borrow money from  the IMF. The situation is such that India cannot function  without borrowing money, everything will close. We cannot borrow  money from these international organizations until the United  States supports our request. However, when India's dignity is  challenged, when India's self-respect is challenged, then, in my  opinion, we should remain hungry and not give the United States  the right to trifle with our national pride.    The situation is very painful when we give our statements  with such hesitancy, fearing that we do not get out of the  diplomatic language. We are not willing to pawn our national  pride and dignity to even the most powerful nation in the  world--the United States or any other nation-- when it comes to  Kashmir and India's unity. The Indian people are willing to  remain hungry, but are not willing to compromise their  self-respect. We have to understand this perfectly.    I am now hearing some talk in my own country about starting  a  political process in Kashmir. I also support the political  process. However, I have some questions before we do that. My  first point is that political process has been tried in Kashmir  for a long time. We had a government elected by democratic  process functioning there. This political process has been  working for several decades. The governments elected by the  people ran the business in Kashmir. How did terrorism arise  while these governments were there? Now, if we think that a  political process is necessary to end terrorism, I do not want  to muddle up this issue by saying that the present situation in  Kashmir has resulted mostly from the lack of strong leadership  there. The political process could not create a strong and  responsible leadership. I wonder if the reason for starting a  political process is to make the United States  happy?</p>

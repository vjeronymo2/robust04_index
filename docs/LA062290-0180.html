			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CAPSULE REVIEW;  </P> <P> AS HERSELF, CHER COMES UP SHORT  </P> <P> Watching Cher go through her pop-celebrity paces Thursday night at the San  Diego Sports Arena, one could only wish that she would slip into something a  little more comfortable -- like an alter ego.  </P> <P> Give Cher a role to play -- the vulnerable nuclear munitions worker of  "Silkwood," say, or even a witch of Eastwick -- and she suddenly becomes an  artist, a conduit for stories and passions.  </P> <P> Singers who treat songs the way committed actors treat their characters can be  conduits, too. But in a lazy hour on stage, some of which she spent singing,  Cher was interested only in spotlighting what's least substantial about  herself: herself. Or at least that side of herself that is bound up in being a  celebrity.  </P> <P> Cher's concert was so much like a testimonial that chicken dinners should have  been served. It began with a five-minute, this-is-your-life video sequence that  ranged from her baby photos to her 1988 acceptance speech for the best-actress  Oscar.  </P> <P> At mid-set came more video history, this time chronicling her partnership with  former husband Sonny Bono. And, with the video screen lowering yet a third  time, we got to see a montage of clips from Cher's acting career.  </P> <P> Cher made a teasing joke early on about doing her concert "naked." For all the  well-toned flesh she showed as she changed from outfit to skimpy outfit, Cher  had a screen to guard her -- the image-making TV screen to which she owes her  stardom.  </P> <P> Cher seldom dared to stand naked in a performing sense, with only her emotive  resources and the quality of her songs to carry the performance. In one of the  most annoyingly cluttered uses of choreography this side of David Bowie's  overblown 1987 "Glass Spider" tour, Cher was surrounded by seven dancers who  rushed and swung about a scaffolded set which resembled the backstage rigging  of a theater.  </P> <P> Like the video screen, the dancers served Cher as a convenient, labor-saving  crutch. With all that motion around her, she could afford to move at a walk.  Consequently, she never broke a sweat.  </P> <P> A complete review runs in Saturday's Calendar section.  </P></p>

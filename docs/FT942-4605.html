			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Reform protest threatens Thai coalition Thailand's coalition government was last night struggling to deal with a protest in favour of constitutional reform that threatens to become a political crisis. A marginal political figure, Mr Chalard Vorachat, a former MP, has projected himself into the forefront of national political debate with a two-week hunger strike to demand the scrapping of the constitution, drafted in the aftermath of a 1991 military coup. About 3,000 people rallied outside the Thai parliament yesterday in his support, echoing protests that eventually brought down a military-dominated government in May 1992. Compromise appeared to have been reached on Tuesday when officials from Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai's Democrat party gave support for a proposal from Mr Chalard for a special committee to study ways to draft a new constitution. But hours later Democrat officials denied that support and expressed opposition to a new constitution.</p>

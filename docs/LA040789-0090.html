MAGOO BANDIT' HITS ANOTHER BANK  </P> <P> A bank robbery in Westlake Village this week was the work of the "Mr. Magoo  Bandit," who is suspected of robbing a dozen banks in the South Bay and Orange  County, sheriff's deputies said Thursday.  </P> <P> The bandit -- nicknamed after the nearsighted cartoon character because he  wears thick glasses -- robbed the Coast Savings bank in the 32100 block of West  Agoura Road shortly after it opened at 9 a.m. Wednesday, said Lt. Frank Woodall  of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> The suspect handed a teller a note demanding money after showing her a handgun  concealed in a brown leather bag, Woodall said. He escaped a few minutes later  with $4,400 in cash, authorities said. No shots were fired.  </P> <P> The man's description matched that of a robber responsible for 11 holdups in  the South Bay area and one in Anaheim between March 28 and April 4, FBI  spokesman Fred Reagan said.  </P></p>

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / US struggles to shake off Iraq's deadly embrace: Review of a reluctant policy shift PRESIDENT George Bush's hopes of a quick, clean departure of all US forces from the Gulf lie shattered. By committing between 5,000 and 10,000 troops to northern Iraq to set up refugee camps to shelter, feed and clothe hundreds of thousands of Kurds, Mr Bush has been forced reluctantly into a fundamental shift in US policy. Until just a few days ago, he hoped to contain relief efforts to the Iraq-Turkey border zones - with the United Nations rather than the US taking charge. Now, under mounting pressure at home and abroad, he has been been pressed into a commitment which seems at best open-ended. The risks of GIs being lured into renewed clashes with the remnants of President Saddam Hussein's army are obvious. One point in Washington's favour is that Iraqi forces have not been involved in action north of the 36th parallel since the US imposed its ban last week. Further guarantees from Iraq may have been sought via the United Nations - though this has yet to be confirmed or denied by US officials. 'We are operating on the assumption that they (US forces) will not be attacked with the United Nations in there. I think there would be a serious problem for Saddam Hussein if he took on the entire United Nations,' a grim-faced Mr Bush told reporters on Tuesday night. The obvious caveat is that since the end of the Gulf war, Mr Bush and his advisers have been operating on a number of assumptions which to date have proved false. In the afterglow of a famous victory, the White House was convinced that someone, somewhere in the defeated Iraqi army would lead a coup against Mr Saddam. Once again, US officials, including Mr Bush, under-estimated their opponent's staying power. At the same time, military and political intelligence appears to have misread the importance of the substantial Iraqi armed forces stationed in northern Iraq near the Turkish border throughout the war. These forces emerged largely unscathed from the Gulf war, which was fought in southern Iraq and Kuwait. Mr Brent Scowcroft, President Bush's national security adviser, once termed the northern army as 'defensive in nature'. What Mr Scowcroft and others failed to predict was that these 'defensive' forces would turn murderously offensive against the rebellious Kurds in the north and Shi'ites in the south. On Tuesday night, Mr Bush again sought to justify his reluctance to intervene in defence of those he had at one time incited to overthrow Mr Saddam's regime - an issue which Democratic critics and some Republicans in his own party are forcing him to confront. 'We never implied that,' he said, 'All along I have said that the US is not going to intervene militarily in Iraq's internal affairs and risk being drawn into a Vietnam-style quagmire.' Even Democrats who supported Mr Bush's decision to go to war - such as Congressman Stephen Solarz of New York - are now complaining that US forces should have pressed on to Baghdad to 'finish the job'. They have been joined by the much larger group of Democrats, including Senator Edward Kennedy, who supported continuing UN sanctions to remove Iraq from Kuwait rather than the use of force. The Gulf war was prosecuted with the perceived lessons of Vietnam very much in mind, such as avoiding a half-fought war with unclear objectives and ambiguous public backing. Yet the other lesson is that pulling out a 500,000-strong army at the end of a war in the Middle East - even a conflict lasting six weeks - is unrealistic. The US, which supported Saddam Hussein with arms, credits and technology for much of the 1980s, has discovered that extricating itself from the deadly embrace with Baghdad is proving a good deal more difficult than first imagined - the famous Gulf victory notwithstanding.</p>

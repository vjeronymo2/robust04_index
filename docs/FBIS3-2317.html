The report  defines the basic principle for the country's work in 1994 as:  taking Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the party's basic line as guidance;  comprehensively implementing the guidelines of the 14th CPC  National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee; precipitating the establishment of a  socialist market economic structure; maintaining sustained,  rapid, and healthy development of the national economy;  maintaining political stability; and promoting comprehensive  social progress.    The current 16,000-character government work report to be  presented to the NPC for examination and deliberation is divided  into seven parts. As disclosed by a member of the NPC Standing  Committee, the seven parts comprise: 1) a review of domestic  work in 1993 and basic principles for work in 1994; 2)  maintaining sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the  national economy; 3) accelerating the establishment of a  socialist market economic structure; 4) developing scientific,  technological, educational, and cultural undertakings; 5)  intensifying building of socialist democracy and legal system;  6) positively pushing forward the peaceful reunification of the  motherland; and 7) work with regard to foreign affairs.  According to the committee member cited above who was  interviewed by this news team, in the first part of the report,  assessment is made on work in 1993, primarily from the following  four aspects: the national economy maintained sustained, rapid,  and healthy development; new headway was made in reform and  opening up; further development was attained in various social  undertakings; and urban and rural people's living standards  continued to improve. In the meantime, the report particularly  points out: It is necessary to take positive measures to  seriously resolve the following problems: excessive investment  in fixed assets; the relatively big margin of price increases;  the irrationality of the economic structure; the relatively  difficult situation in the production and operations of some  large and medium state enterprises; the poor condition of social  security in some localities; the ineffective crack down on ugly  social tendencies; the corruption of a small number of  government officials bending the law to commit graft,  embezzlement, and irregularities; and formalism and  bureaucratism existing in government organs, and so on.  <H3>  The Distribution Relationships Between Central and Local  Authorities and Between State and Enterprises Have Yet To Be  Straightened Out </H3>   The report maintains that GDP growth of 9 percent in 1994 is  a positive and sound growth rate. It is necessary to intensify  the position of agriculture as a foundation, comprehensively  develop the rural economy, improve operation and management, do  a good job of production in industry and communications,  maintain a rational investment scope, optimize the investment  structure, open wider to the outside world, boost foreign  cooperation and exchange, and continue to enhance the people's  living standards. The report emphatically points out that  family planning and environmental protection are China's  national policies.    Meanwhile, it is necessary to conscientiously put into  practice the financial taxation reform plan, straighten out the  distribution relationship between central and local authorities  and between state and enterprises, steadily carry out monetary  structural reform, transform operational mechanisms in  state-owned enterprises, explore an effective way of  establishing a modern enterprise system, further rationalize  price relations, develop and cultivate a market system, continue  carrying out organizational reform in a proper way,  conscientiously transform government functions, reinforce the  building of a clean and honest government, and so on. These are  the major contents of the third part.    With regard to the development of scientific, technological,  educational, and cultural undertakings, the report highlights  the following issues: bringing about the close integration of  the economy and science and technology, taking firm control of  educational reform and development, making socialist culture  prosperous, and developing public health undertakings.    In the section on intensifying the building of socialist  democracy and legal system, the report stresses the necessity of  continuing to strengthen the building of socialist democracy,  taking the building of the legal system seriously, and  conscientiously doing a good job in the overall control of  social security.</p>

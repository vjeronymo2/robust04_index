			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / ECB very much on drawing board Despite the clouds over the Maastricht treaty and European Monetary Union, preparations for establishing the new European Central Bank in Stage Three are going ahead. The treaty itself goes into detail about the constitution and responsibilities of the bank, but says little about how it will operate. Forward thinking on these matters has, however, been taking place under the aegis of the EC Committee of Central Bank Governors, which has already set up a small staff of its own; the committee itself is likely to be taken over by the European Monetary Institute when the latter is established in January 1994 under Stage Two of Emu. Further light on how the ECB might operate is shed by two members of the central bankers' staff, Carlo Monticelli and Jose Vinals in a paper entitled European Monetary Policy in Stage Three, soon to be published by the Centre for Economic Policy Research. Monetary policy, we are usefully reminded, centres round the supply of 'central bank money', which in UK parlance corresponds to bankers' balances at the Bank of England. This should be targeted according to the authors, not on any final objective, like a price index or Nominal GDP, but on some intermediate target, in practice, a measure of the money supply. Discussion of the paper at a recent conference in Barcelona made clear that the only measures of money supply likely to be used were fairly broad ones covering a wide range of bank deposits, as well as cash, such as Britain's M4 or the German M3. A subsequent paper by the Bank of England's economic director, Mervyn King, has a chart hinting that the relation between the British M4 and inflation, which broke down in the early 1980s, might be about to re-establish itself. One argument is that money supply targeting would provide some continuity with national central banks, several of which already target the money supply. Furthermore, money supply targets respond more quickly to policy than inflation itself and are easier to monitor, which would help to establish the credibility of the ECB in its vital early years. The successful pursuit of monetary targets might also exert a favourable influence on private sector expectations and behaviour, while the setting of ranges rather than joint targets should allow some flexibility for the new institution. A more interesting argument, emphasised even more by Professor Ronald McKinnon of Stanford university, is that the relation of the European money supply to incomes and prices could well be more stable than that for existing national currencies, as substitution between them would cancel out. The EC paper also suggests that there are limits to how far the implementation of monetary policies can be delegated to the component central banks. For instance reserve requirements (virtually non-existent in the UK) would have to be harmonised. On the other hand, each national centre could maintain its own standing facilities with national banks. However, conditions for the recognition of banks would have to be well harmonised to prevent the authorities in each national capital from trying to promote its own financial centre at the expense of others. My own worry is how we get from here to there. It does not seem to me conceivable that up to, say, December 31 1998, the Bundesbank will decide its policies with sole reference to securing low inflation in Germany; and then on January 1 1999, the European Central Bank will take over with the different objective of stabilising European Community prices. There must surely be an intermediate stage when the still-independent central banks work together with an eye to the European price level, and perhaps experiment with some measure of the European money supply. Prof McKinnon has advocated a 'common monetary standard' under which the core ERM countries would co-ordinate monetary policies to achieve zero inflation for a common producer price index. His aim is to rehabilitate the European exchange rate mechanism; but it would be equally appropriate as a prelude to full Emu, or as a way of maintaining exchange rate stability while keeping options open.</p>

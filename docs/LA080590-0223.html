			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GARRIDO SAYS HE PROBABLY WOULD TAKE TITAN JOB;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: THOUGH SEARCH CONTINUES, FORMER FULLERTON COACH SAYS HE IS CONVINCED  OF SCHOOL'S COMMITMENT TO SPORT AFTER MEETING WITH OFFICIALS.  </P> <P> Having spent the past three days in Orange County discussing the Cal State  Fullerton baseball coaching job with Titan officials, Augie Garrido is  convinced he would like to return to the program he guided to national  prominence.  </P> <P> "I think if the selection committee would see me as the best candidate, I would  probably accept the job," said Garrido, the Illinois coach who led Fullerton to  College World Series championships in 1979 and '84. "I'm going to continue to  pursue the job -- take it to the end of the process and see where it takes me."  </P> <P> Garrido, who Saturday left for Edmonton, Canada, to rejoin Team U.S.A. for the  World Cup Games, met with the five-person selection committee Friday for about  an hour. He also has met with Titan Athletic Director Ed Carroll and associate  athletic director Steve DiTolla, who oversees baseball.  </P> <P> Garrido said he has not been offered the job, but most of his concerns about  the program -- primarily the school's commitment to the sport -- apparently  have been addressed to his approval.  </P> <P> "I'm happy with the direction they're going," Garrido said. "I feel good about  the cooperative effort that will be made on behalf of the administration.  They're actively going to participate in the program, and that's a key issue."  </P> <P> Garrido spent 15 years at Fullerton, the first two at the Division II level,  but after moving to Division I in 1975, he guided the Titans to a 611-242  record, 11 NCAA regional appearances and four College World Series appearances.  </P> <P> But when he left for a six-figure contract and a strong administrative  commitment at Illinois in 1987, Garrido said he felt like he was "treading  water" at Fullerton.  </P> <P> In past years, the Titan coach has been directly responsible for raising about  40% of the baseball budget -- about $100,000 now -- and that became a burden  for Garrido.  </P> <P> But according to Garrido, the Fullerton athletic department would take over  most of the fund-raising duties in the future, allowing him to coach baseball.  "I had reached the point where I wasn't able to implement new ideas, and we  were constantly struggling to solve the same old problems," Garrido, 51, said.  "That's what I have focused on in these conversations. I wanted to know there's  a real opportunity to do some things that need to be done."  </P> <P> Garrido, who has led Illinois to two Big Ten titles in three seasons, believes  there is.  </P> <P> "It's going to be different," he said. "They're going to build the stadium  (Titan Sports Complex), and the administration is going to be involved in the  program (through fund raising)." Garrido said he didn't know what Fullerton's  timetable was for hiring a coach, and Carroll would not comment on the process  or any of the candidates. But Garrido said he was told the selection committee  would be interviewing other applicants.  </P> <P> "I'm done with the interviewing process," Garrido said. "It's their shot to  call now."  </P></p>

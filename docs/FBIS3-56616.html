He described the situation in Belarus as complicated and  contradictory, having noted that it should be fundamentally  changed and that this can be done only through a new composition  of parliament by early elections, which he is advocating.    Having touched on a possible monetary merger with Russia,  the  Supreme Soviet chairman stated that if the merger of monetary  systems produces merely a parity of prices for fuel, one could  hope for an improvement of the economic situation. "However, no  one will establish order in our house for us. It is for us to  decide how we are going to go on living," he stressed.</p>

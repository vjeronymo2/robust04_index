			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHIEF U.S. COFFEE NEGOTIATOR REPLACED; NO POLICY SHIFT SEEN  </P> <P> The chief U.S. coffee negotiator, Jon Rosenbaum, has been replaced, but the  move does not signal a shift in U.S. coffee policy, officials at the Trade  Representative's Office said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Rosenbaum's departure is considered important because he took a high-profile  approach to his job, provoking the wrath of some coffee producers for his  outspoken ways and perceived hard-line positions.  </P> <P> Colombian President Virgilio Barco, for example, last month blamed the  "intransigent position" of the United States for the collapse of the coffee  price-support system.  </P> <P> Rosenbaum has headed U.S. efforts to overhaul the export quota accord that  until last month governed world coffee trade and helped prop up prices.  </P> <P> The breakup of the 74-nation coffee pact on July 3 threw markets into chaos and  sent prices plummeting. Coffee provides important export earnings for a large  number of developing countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia.  </P></p>

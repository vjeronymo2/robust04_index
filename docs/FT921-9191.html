			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: Denmark puts backbone into Nordic performance - But it is facing a difficult start to the 1991 results season While other Nordic markets battled, rose and retreated in varying degrees of disarray through 1991, Danish equities performed relatively well, with the all-share index increasing by 12 per cent over the year - a rise only moderated by worries in the financial sector. Brokers expect that 1992 will also be bullish. However, the impending 1991 results season will have to go through an uninspiring start, on banking performance, and then reflect the high cost of international ambitions in the insurance industry before it gets to the more stable core of the Danish equity market. Shipping shares, dominated by the AP Moller companies, D/S 1912 and D/S Svenborg and Lauritzen Holding, rose by 31.4 per cent in Denmark last year, and industrials, which historically have underperformed any other sector except the banks, gained 18.4 per cent, reflecting the current export-led recovery in the country's economic fortunes and a relative improvement in the profitability of manufacturing exporters. Seven out of the 10 best performing shares were industrials, including two of the heavyweights: Carlsberg, the brewer involved in a major deal with Allied-Lyons in the UK, which gained 54 per cent, and Novo Nordisk, the pharmaceuticals and industrial enzymes group, 51 per cent stronger. In the medical field, two smaller health care companies, Radiometer, manufacturer of blood analysis equipment, up 71 per cent, and Coloplast, colostomy bags and similar types of medical equipment, up 95 per cent, performed well, as did the enzymes specialist Chr. Hansens Laboratorier. The field was led by Brdr. Hartmann, a small company specialising in recycling of industrial wastes, which rose performers were Sophus Berendsen and the shipping companies, Lauritzen and D/S 1912. Berendsen, which controls the UK-listed Rentokil, acquired the linen service business of Sweden's Electrolux in Sweden, France and Holland last year to become Europe's third largest linen service company. Copenhagen's equity market was supported generally by a satisfactory development in some of the main economic indicators, and Denmark, unlike its Nordic neighbours, was spared the sight of collapsing banks. Inflation, at 2.4 per cent, was lower than in any other European country. Danish export companies have gained market share, especially in Germany and the other Nordic countries. The current account balance of payments, in deficit for 27 years until 1990, is now in surplus of about DKr14bn (Dollars 2.3bn), or just over 1 per cent of GDP. The trade surplus, including both visibles and invisibles, is now a huge DKr50bn, about six per cent of GDP. There is no indication that 1992 will see a break in these trends, although exports may be dampened slightly by slower growth in Germany. The GDP growth rate, according to the government's forecast, will be about 2.5 per cent. Last year saw lively new issue activity. Some 12 new companies were listed, including Norway's Hafslund Nycomed, the shares of which are now traded more heavily in Copenhagen than in Oslo. Total new capital raised was DKr12.6bn, about one third of this accounted for issues by Novo Nordisk and Baltica Insurance last summer. Last year was a relatively poor year for Danish bank shares but still marginally positive, with the sector index up by only 1.5 per cent, less, probably, because of its own constituents' prospects than because international investors moved out of Nordic bank shares, including Danish ones, as a result of events in Norway, Sweden and Finland. The banks' 1991 results are not expected to be exciting. While securities trading business should provide a cushion, loan-loss provisions are still high; and, as a new departure, the Danish financial sector authorities have asked the banks to keep a careful watch on the quality of their loan portfolios, and on the level of their loss provisions. It was a bad year for the insurers, which showed up in the index for investment and property companies, where the holding companies controlling the Baltica, Hafnia and Topdanmark insurance companies are listed. The index fell by 14.3 per cent. Hafnia's and Baltica's shares have been affected by Hafnia's (unsuccessful) attempt to gain control of Baltica Holding, and Hafnia's bid, together with Norway's UNI Storebrand, to gain control of Sweden's Skandia. The considerable financial costs of these two ventures will help to push Hafnia into the red for 1991.</p>

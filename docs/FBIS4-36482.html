			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, it was revealed that a network of 15 Jewish  and Israeli Arab weapons dealers who sold weapons and ammunition  to fugitives from the territories has been uncovered. Our  correspondent Yafa Glick reports that the Tel Aviv Magistrate's  Court today remanded two Netanya shooting gallery owners, Avi  Hajaj and Shim'on Farhan, and one of the workers, Yosi  Yankelevich. The three are suspected of having sold weapons and  ammunition to six Israeli Arabs from al-Tira and Qalansuwa, who  in turn sold the weapons to fugitives from Nabulus, Bayt Lahiyah  in the Gaza Strip, and Tulkarm.</p>

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Pelican to buy restaurants The Pelican group of restaurants is set to buy four London restaurants owned by Mr Robert Earl, the entrepreneur. The Stock Exchange forced Pelican to admit it is in talks following a rise in the share price. The shares rose some 17 per cent to 54p yesterday. The deal would mean a seat on Pelican's board for Mr Earl. It would also roughly double the size of the 17-restaurant-strong Pelican group.</p>

			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NCAA DIVISION II WORLD SERIES NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> COLORFUL PLAY-BY-PLAY AS SHOWY AS A PEACOCK  </P> <P> The assault that Cal State Northridge hitters have waged on opposing pitchers  has inspired some creative writing by Mike Peacock, who types out the official  play-by-play for media covering the NCAA Division II World Series.  </P> <P> A few of Peacock's one-liners from Northridge's 18-5 decision over New Haven on  Tuesday:  </P> <P> On Eric Johnson's fly ball to right that was dropped for an error:  </P> <P> "Johnson hits a rocket into the gap in right center, but (Tim) Burrows is  there, reaches up, and swats it away from him like a mosquito."  </P> <P> On the next play, a home run by Mike Solar: "Solar taps into one of his power  cells and launches a BOMB over the scoreboard in left, 3-run dinger."  </P> <P> On a bouncer hit by Mike Sims that went for a single: "Sims bounces a blind  man's dog to right (seeing-eye single)."  </P> <P> Peacock also had some fun describing a few of the outs.  </P> <P> On a Scott Sharts strikeout victim: "(Adrian) Clark gives the Charger dugout a  nice breeze as he whiffs at strike three."  </P> <P> On a wild pitch, Peacock wrote that the runner moved up on a "savagely uncouth  hurl."  </P> <P> However, the night's classic was saved for CSUN's 21st hit of the game. When  Solar made the score 13-3 by blasting his second home run of the night, Peacock  wrote: "Solar rips the corona off that "ball" as it leaves a vapor trail  leaving the park. There is a brief delay in the action as a brawl is occurring  around the bat rack in the Matador dugout."  </P> <P> Peacock was using poetic license, of course, but only in moderation. The  Matadors did, indeed, look eager to hit.  </P> <P> Prolific production: After totaling only 10 hits in its two victories over UC  Riverside in the West regional, Northridge has scored 36 runs on 49 hits in its  two World Series games.  </P> <P> The Matadors have 37 singles, four doubles, a triple, seven home runs and a  batting average of .505. In addition, CSUN has been on the receiving end of 14  walks and a hit batter.  </P> <P> Northridge will play Lewis today at 1:30 PDT at Paterson Field. Lewis  eliminated New Haven, 3-2, on Wednesday.  </P> <P> Scheduled to pitch for CSUN is Vale Lopez (11-4), who allowed three runs on 11  hits in eight innings when the Matadors defeated Lewis, 18-5, in their opener  Sunday.  </P> <P> Lopez, a senior right-hander, has won his past eight decisions.  </P> <P> Injury report: Third baseman Denny Vigo, second on the team with 19 home runs  and and third with 58 runs batted in, is listed as questionable for today's  game.  </P> <P> Vigo was held out of practice Wednesday after pulling up with a hamstring  injury after singling in the sixth inning against New Haven.  </P> <P> Vigo was examined by a trainer from Troy (Ala.) State on Wednesday. The injury  was diagnosed as a tear in the muscle just above Vigo's right knee. Coach Bill  Kernen said he likely will hold Vigo out of today's game.  </P> <P> "We'll have to see how much better it gets, and how fast," Kernen said. "We may  just use him as a pinch-hitter, or maybe not at all."  </P> <P> Kernen said either Craig Clayton or Andy Hodgins will move from the outfield to  third base. Both made appearances at the position in the late innings Tuesday.  </P> <P> Vigo was in an 0-for-15 slump entering the New Haven game, but he was three for  three with a walk before pulling up lame.  </P> <P> New experience: Northridge's 18-5 rout of New Haven was only the Chargers'  fourth loss of the season.  </P> <P> It came in a fashion New Haven had not experienced. The Chargers' other losses  were all by one run.  </P> <P> "It can be humbling," Kernen said. "I remember Cal Lutheran. You just go, 'Holy  . . .' "  </P> <P> Cal Lutheran, an NAIA team, beat CSUN, 18-3, in February.  </P> <P> Super sub: In appearances as a substitute in both of CSUN's World Series games,  Kyle Washington is four for four with three singles and a three-run home run.  </P> <P> In four pinch-hitting appearances during the regular season, Washington was one  for four.  </P> <P> "I sit there and I see everybody else hitting, so when I get a chance to get in  there, I want to make the most of it," said Washington, a part-time starter.  "I'm just trying to be consistent like the rest of the guys."  </P> <P> Police blotter: Montgomery police reported Wednesday that they had no leads in  the theft of personal belongings from the hotel rooms of several members of the  Northridge baseball team Tuesday night.  </P> <P> Cassette disks, a cassette player, two watches, a diamond earring, a wallet and  various items of apparel were reported stolen by players and coaches.  </P> <P> The thefts occurred between 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. (PDT) on Tuesday while Northridge  was at Paterson Field for its game against New Haven.  </P> <P> The rooms were locked and someone apparently used a key to gain entrance, a  police spokesman said.  </P> <P> Montgomery Police Sgt. Ricky Moore said his department will keep tabs on local  pawn shops in an effort to track the stolen merchandise.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters stated that the narrowed use restrictions as written in the NPRM by EPA are vague and confusing, and overly complex, leading to uncertainty. Commenters asked that EPA clarify such vague terms as ``high value,'' ``public safety,'' ``national security,'' ``life support,'' and ``critical.'' They state that ambiguity will cause many users to be reluctant to use the new substitute agents. Concern was expressed that the fire protection community will have to spend an inordinate amount of time interpreting and deciphering whether a particular system meets EPA's requirements. Some commenters advised that, if EPA retains narrowed use restrictions, these restrictions should be better defined through work with the fire protection industry. One commenter suggested that a more easily enforced method would be to allow use only in applications where toxicity of other substitutes would not be acceptable. Furthermore, some commenters noted that EPA's publicly expressed concern about the environmental acceptability, particularly the global warming impacts, of certain agents has already slowed interest in the development of systems. They state that as a result, there is continued dependence on halon for certain critical applications where no other alternative agent is suitable, such as in explosion inerting applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA agrees with the commenters that narrowed use restrictions must not contribute to uncertainty and a consequent reluctance to move away from ozone-depleting fire fighting agents. To address this concern, EPA has worked with agent manufacturers, system designers, and members of the regulated community to better clarify the intent and the wording of narrowed use restrictions. In this final rule, EPA is amending the means of controlling unwanted emissions of long-lived agents. In the NPRM, EPA attempted to narrow the scope of uses for the PFCs (C <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> F <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and C <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> F <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and for HFC&hyph;23 by listing the use categories that were acceptable. Because the regulated community found this listing ambiguous, and because EPA could not list all possible uses that would require this agent, EPA explored the technical criteria that would define where this agent was best applied, as one commenter suggested. This approach was appealing, but, again, tended to place the task of system design upon the Agency. Therefore, for the PFCs, the Agency has decided to adopt an approach that places the burden of proof upon the end-user for determining that no other alternative was technically feasible for that application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Users shall self-certify the need to use restricted agents.

Users are expected to evaluate the technical feasibility of other substitutes or alternatives to determine their adequacy to control the particular fire or explosion risk. An example of where no other alternative is available due to the physical or chemical properties of the agent would be where, due to the environmental characteristics of the end-use, other agents would fail to vaporize or would not achieve the dispersion required for effective fire protection. Similarly, use of PFCs due to toxicological concerns would be appropriate where use of other alternative agents would violate the workplace safety use conditions set forth in this final rule. For example, use of a certain agent for explosion suppression in an occupied area might require high concentrations of an agent that exceed its LOAEL, or, in cases where egress is precluded such as in military vehicles during wartime, the required concentration of the alternatives might exceed their NOAEL. EPA intends that PFCs be used only as the agent of last resort.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To assist users in their evaluation, EPA has prepared a list of vendors manufacturing halon substitutes and alternatives. Although users are not required to report the results of their investigation to EPA, companies must retain these results in company files for future reference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters requested that narrowed use restrictions on HFC&hyph;23 be lifted because its cardiotoxicity profile is favorable compared to its design or inerting concentration and in some cases it may be the only acceptable alternative. As mentioned above, one commenter suggested that it would be more appropriate to qualify acceptability of a particular agent with respect to its technical applicability in defined situations. For example, this commenter identified several areas where HFC&hyph;23 is particularly applicable: (a) Where temperatures are likely to go below 0 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; (b) where pre-inerting is required for occupied areas, and (c) where occupied areas can suffer considerable variation in fire volume.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most HFC&hyph;23 is a by-product of the manufacture of HCFC&hyph;22. While HCFC&hyph;22 is scheduled for a production phaseout under the Clean Air Act by the year 2020, HCFC&hyph;22 is also used as a feedstock for the manufacture of other products, such as Teflon. Thus, it can be expected that HFC&hyph;23 will likely be inadvertently produced in the future. As discussed above, Action 40 of the CCAP instructs EPA to limit emissions of greenhouse gases under the SNAP program. However, because this agent is typically a byproduct of HCFC&hyph;22 production, it is EPA's position that capture of HFC&hyph;23 and use as a fire suppression agent may delay the effects of this agent in the atmosphere while serving a valuable purpose. Thus, EPA is lifting the narrowed use restrictions imposed in the NPRM, and in this FRM EPA is finding acceptable the use of this agent wherever deemed applicable given technical or market considerations. However, to control unnecessary emissions of this agent, EPA recommends that users limit testing only to that which is essential to meet safety or performance requirements; recover HFC&hyph;23 from the fire protection system in conjunction with testing or servicing; and recycle or destroy agent that is recovered from a system. EPA is encouraging development of product stewardship programs by the manufacturer and by Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) marketing systems containing this agent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Halon categories and subdivisions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Many commenters requested that EPA remove the subdivisions within the use categories. In other words, agents should be classified as either ``total flooding'' or ``streaming'' with no further distinction as to their use. This structure, states one commenter, is consistent with the separation addressed by UNEP and NFPA. They state that the proposed subdivisions over-complicate the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, in total flood applications, some commenters suggest simply referring to an agent's NOAEL which, along with OSHA regulations and NFPA standards, will determine its suitability for a given application. Thus, there would be no need to distinguish between normally occupied and normally unoccupied spaces.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is adopting the recommendation of the commenters. Two end-use categories are used in this final rule: Streaming Agents and Total Flooding Agents. Explosion inertion is included in the Total Flooding Agent category.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4.

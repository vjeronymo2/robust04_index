			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Pensions, the best of both worlds - How to increase contributions WANT TO have your pension cake and eat it? Pensions come in two varieties - occupational schemes, run by employers, and personal pensions, managed by independent fund managers or insurance companies. As a rule you have to decide between the two. The normal way to boost your pension if you are a member of an occupational scheme is to take out an Additional Voluntary Contribution (AVC). These can be free standing contracts, or schemes offered by your main pension plan. But they do not allow the same flexibility as a personal pension. So if the special circumstances in which a personal pension and a company scheme can be run side by side apply to you, it pays to investigate further. Where bonuses and overtime are not included in the employee's pensionable salary under the main scheme, they can be used to pay AVCs or FSAVCs (Free-Standing AVCs). Also, the taxable value of fringe benefits can be used for FSAVCs. The contribution limit is 15 per cent for both main scheme and FSAVCs, subject in some cases to the earnings cap. Unlike a personal pension, you cannot take tax-free cash from a FSAVC - all of the proceeds must be put into an annuity. The same applies to AVCs started after April 1987. Also, the date at which FSAVC benefits can be taken is determined by the main scheme rules. The only exception is where an employee has left the main scheme and has stopped paying into the FSAVC, in which case the FSAVC benefits can be taken at any time between the ages of 50 and 75. For these reasons, a personal pension seems preferable to an AVC. However, anyone contemplating an occupational and personal pension cocktail should seek expert advice to make sure they are not unwittingly contravening Inland Revenue rules. The Revenue monitors contributions strictly. In the case of accidental over-funding the excess contributions normally are refunded, less tax relief. But if over-funding was deliberate, hefty fines are common. The contribution and benefit limits for occupational schemes are very different from those applying to personal pensions. Under personal pensions the maximum contribution is 17.5 per cent of relevant earnings (more for older employees*) subject to the earnings cap, currently Pounds 75,000. Under an occupational scheme employees can contribute up to 15 per cent pensionable salary to build up a maximum pension of two-thirds final salary subject, in some cases, to the earnings cap. Personal pension benefits can be drawn from age 50, whereas the company pension must be drawn at the scheme's normal retirement age - usually 65. There are advantages and disadvantages with both schemes. Personal pensions are more flexible and portable than occupational schemes. But company schemes generally link the value of the pension to the employee's salary and thus provide a better hedge against inflation than a personal pension, which simply provides a fund at retirement which is used to purchase an annuity, making it vulnerable to the health of the gilts market at the time you retire. Personal and company pensions are often used in conjunction when the company scheme is contracted in to the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (Serps). Most schemes in the UK are contracted out of Serps - in other words, in return for a rebate of National Insurance Contributions (NICs), these schemes guarantee to provide pensions which are as good as, or better than, the Serps pension they replace. However, more than 1m employees are members of contracted-in schemes where the scheme benefits are paid in addition to the Serps pension. In these cases it is possible for an employee to use an 'appropriate' personal pension to contract out of Serps on an individual basis. An appropriate personal pension can only be used to take the rebate of NICs which, for the current tax year, is worth up to Pounds 1,500. Most employees under the age of 35 would be better off with such a personal pension as the value of the rebate is greater than the value of the Serps benefit given up. Taking out a personal pension does not affect the employee's rights and benefits under the main company scheme. Personal pensions can also be used by employees who have a second source of income, from freelance work for example. Younger employees can contribute up to 17.5 per cent of these freelance earnings to a personal pension. The Revenue does not take into account the benefits from the personal pension plan when assessing maximum benefits under the occupational scheme. However, it does check payments made by employees to ensure there is no crossover between contributions made in respect of the two sources of earnings. Freelance earnings must derive from an entirely separate source from the main salary. Bonus or overtime earnings cannot be used to fund a personal pension. Personal pensions can, however, be used as a stop gap between the date of joining the company and the date the employee becomes eligible to join the pension scheme. The length of this 'waiting period' varies and can extend to age 30. A high pension-scheme entry age is common among companies which have a rapid turnover of younger staff and do not want the administrative hassle of refunding contributions or arranging transfer values. Contributions to personal pensions must stop when the employee joins the company scheme. Occasionally, an occupational scheme may provide only death and dependants' benefits. If this is the the case, it is possible to take out a personal pension. And finally, an employee who is a member of an occupational scheme may also use a personal pension to take a transfer value from an earlier period of employment. In several of the above examples the contributions to the personal pension will be on a temporary or ad hoc basis. As a result, it is vital that the plan is genuinely flexible so that there are no early termination penalties if freelance earnings dry up or the employee becomes eligible to join the company scheme. The best way to retain full flexibility is to avoid a regular premium personal pension and instead pay a series of single premium contributions, since these carry much lower up front management and commission charges. * Contribution limits for personal pensions as a percentage of net relevant earnings (subject to the earnings cap): Up to age 35, 17.5 per cent; age 36-45, 20 per cent; age 46-50, 25 per cent; age 51-55, 30 per cent; age 56-60, 35 per cent; age 61-74, 40 per cent.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Note. In view of the importance and sensitivity of  the Court of Administrative Justice in the judiciary and in the  Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, we set out to  interview Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Ferdowsipur, chief of  this court, concerning this judiciary entity's accomplishments  and procedures. What follows is the result of the interview.  With thanks to him, we present the text of the interview for our  esteemed readers.    [RESALAT] What are the limitations and responsibilities of  the Court of Administrative Justice? Was its formation an  innovation by the Islamic Republic, or did it have a precedent?    [Ferdowsipur] Ferdowsipur began by detailing the duties in  the short history of the Court of Administrative Justice. He  said: The Court of Administrative Justice actually exercises  supervision over government administrative offices, units,  organizations, and entities. It also deals with grievances from  the public concerning guidelines and charters. It is a source of  pride for the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran that we  also have a substitute magistrate. If the chief justice is sick  or on vacation, that magistrate can manage the branch court.  Every branch court has an office manager, and it also has a  secretary who helps register and distribute complaints and  judgments. We have two review councils composed of five judges,  and the chief of this court is the general chief of the court.  The other four judges are chosen every six months in ballot  voting by the chiefs of the branch courts, and they study the  cases. One of the benefits of our constitution is the enactment  of this same Article 173 concerning the formation of the Court  of Administrative Justice.    In previous governments we did not have such organizations  and supervision over government offices. Of course, there was a  legal body called the administrative council, but this  administrative council was never established and implemented.    After the great revolution of France, an Administrative  Council Law was passed to supervise the work of the government.  This council began its work under the supervision of the  legislative power. According to them, this supervision has been  successful so far. It is also the same way in England, except  that it is under the supervision of the judiciary power. We do  not have such supervision in other countries.    [RESALAT] Must the plaintiff or the complaints definitely  come from the people?    [Ferdowsipur] If we refer to the proceedings of the Assembly  of Experts we see that after this article was proposed debates  occurred. In their remarks concerning the Court of  Administrative Justice, some of the gentlemen paid no attention  to the characteristics of the Court of Administrative Justice.  However, Mr. Hashemi, president of the republic, gave a talk in  which he said: "I, myself, was a defender of the Court of  Administrative Justice, and my view was that we ought to have a  powerful and authoritative organization to supervise the  authoritative government organizations, one that will act with  full power and decisiveness."    The first session of the Court of Administrative Justice  took  place at the Higher Martyr Motahari School, chaired by Mr.  Emami-Kashani. Because it was a newly established entity, they  chose the best judges. The offices of chief of the Court of  Administrative Justice were held by Grand Ayatollahs Rezvani,  Feyz-Gilani, Musavi-Tabrizi, and Hojjat ol-Eslam Abbasifard. We  have three pillars in the court, the plaintiff, the defendant  (in the Court of Administrative Justice the plaintiff and the  plaintiff side must definitely come from the people), in the  sense that if the government, or the government office or  institution or the prosecutor want to complain, it will be  rejected in the court.    He added: The defendant must definitely be the government,  meaning the ministries, the district governor's offices, the  general offices, the government organizations and any  organization that procures the salaries for its workers through  the government. Therefore, the Veteran's Foundation, the Martyr  Foundation, and other foundations affiliated with the  government, which are supervised by the president of the  republic, the municipalities, the Urban Land Organization, and  the seven-person councils can also be the defendants for  complaints.    The third pillar is the question of complaints, and this  goes  back to administrative violations, i.e., if any worker violates  the laws and regulations, which pertain to his work, and if a  complaint is lodged by someone about the violation, we will  investigate these complaints.    [RESALAT] In what way are illegal guidelines investigated  and  voided?    [Ferdowsipur] If illegal guidelines are issued by the  ministries or offices of governors-general and if someone  complains about them, they are investigated, and if it is  determined that they are illegal, the order to void them is  issued. If we do not determine that it is illegal or if we have  doubts, we seek an opinion from the Guardian Council.    If the interested party complains about guidelines, letters  of enactment, and charters, and guidelines for government  organizations and centers, which is illegal, we are required to  attend to it, and what we do is announce that it is illegal and  order it nullified, or we announce that it is not illegal and  issue a verdict of affirmation.    [RESALAT] In what way can the people complain about  government organizations, foundations, and municipalities?    [Ferdowsipur] Our petitions have specific forms that are  sold  at the post offices in all the cities. The people can obtain the  petition forms from the post offices, and the procedure for  complaining is given on these forms.    [RESALAT] What is the procedure for appealing and protesting  the court's opinions?    [Ferdowsipur] After the verdict is issued, if it is against  the defendant, he has up to two months to protest and request an  appeal. After we receive the information we study the request  for appeal. Here either the original verdict is upheld and  distributed for implementation or it is ruled deficient and sent  to another court at the same level for reconsideration.    [RESALAT] How many judges and branch courts deal with the  cases?    [Ferdowsipur] There were formerly 10 branch courts. This  Court of Administrative Justice now has 20 branches. The chief  of each branch is an experienced and committed judge with a  record of service, and there is also a consultant. Likewise,  after the verdict is approved on appeal it is distributed for  implementation. If the verdict is against the defendant, the  person who has executive responsibility and against whom the  verdict was issued must carry out the verdict.    [RESALAT] What happens if he does not carry out the verdict?    [Ferdowsipur] We issue a reminder, and if he pays no  attention we have a legal article called Article 21, which  allows the branch court of the Court of Administrative Justice  to terminate the employment of the executive official who  refuses to carry out the verdict. This termination is in  proportion to the violation, which has been committed.    [RESALAT] What will happen if an executive official in a  higher position does not carry out the verdict? For example,  what will happen if the mayor of one of the districts of Tehran  is convicted in the Court of Administrative Justice, but the  mayor of Tehran, who is a higher executive official, does not  carry out the verdict concerning his mayor from the court of  justice?    [Ferdowsipur] The implementation of the verdict pertains to  the highest ranking executive official in that organization. For  example, if we order the dismissal of the mayor of a district,  the general mayor must implement it and if he does not, the  highest level executive official, meaning the president of the  republic, can do this.    I told the chief of the branch court to carry out the law in  accordance with the regulations he has and to coordinate it with  me wherever he encounters problems. I coordinate with the  highest ranking executive official to carry out that verdict.    For example, regarding the position of president of one of  the universities, we had a verdict on a complaint received from  one of the professors of the university, which was issued for  the professor and against that university. We had to implement  Article 21, because this verdict was not implemented for about  two years. I got in touch with the minister of culture and  higher education and told him we have such prerogatives. I  believe that we should not do such a thing without coordinating  with the highest level executive official. He welcomed this, and  because he was not familiar with the case the files were given  to him to familiarize him with its details. He said that they  would implement the verdict themselves if possible, and if not  we were free to do as we wished under the law, and this is just  what we did.    [RESALAT] Where has the case gotten now regarding the  dismissal of one of Tehran's regional mayors and his failure to  obey the verdict from the court of justice?    [Ferdowsipur] In this regard I have also heard that that  official for the municipal district was sentenced to termination  of employment. However, to keep from executing the verdict, they  resorted to starting a rumor that he had been pardoned by the  exalted leader. Then when Mr. 'Abbasifard told Ayatollah Yazdi,  Ayatollah Yazdi said that he was the one who recommends pardons;  how could this person have been pardoned by the exalted leader  without me knowing? It is, therefore, nothing more than a rumor.  Then they realized that the truth had been discovered. They  worked in secret for a time and then were forced to carry out  the order to dismiss the mayor of that district.    [RESALAT] Do you have stronger procedures under  consideration  to carry out the orders of the Court of Administrative Justice?    [Ferdowsipur] I have coordinated this subject with the  minister of justice, with Ayatollah Yazdi, with other officials,  with the Majles, and with the Article 90 Commission so they will  support our verdicts so we can implement our verdicts  decisively. God willing, we hope the issue will not arise.  Second, if such a thing happens we will act in accordance with  rules and regulations.    [RESALAT] What is the difference between the General Council  of the Court of Administrative Justice and the Supreme Court?    [Ferdowsipur] Another organization we have is the General  Council of the Court of Administrative Justice. This council  meets once a week on Saturday. Verdicts that contradict each  other are presented in this council. That is, if two similar  complaints are presented in two branch courts and the issued  verdicts are in conflict, these complaints are sent to this  council to resolve the conflict. After a review, if it is  decided that there is a conflict, a new vote is then taken on  which verdict is correct. There is a general council both on the  Court of Administrative Justice and on the Supreme Court, and it  has law-making status, meaning that opinions issued by this  general council have the force of law. The same is true of the  national Supreme court, although the area of competence of each  is different.    [RESALAT] In the Court of Administrative Justice, may those  who lack the credentials of an attorney represent the two sides  in the consideration of the complaints?    [Ferdowsipur] The interested party or his attorney may make  the complaint. Of course, the attorney must be qualified and a  member of the Attorney's Society.    [RESALAT] Is it compulsory or optional to have an attorney  at  the Court of Administrative Justice?    [Ferdowsipur] This issue was raised at a meeting of judicial  officials and a decision was made that the attorney must be  required. Of course, if the party himself does not want to get  an attorney and says he will defend himself, we will not accept  this and at the time of the trial officials must obtain a  government attorney for him, because this is their right unless  he himself has no interest.    [RESALAT] What are the statistics on the court's backlogs  and  verdicts issued?    [Ferdowsipur] Answering, the chief of the Court of  Administrative Justice said: The total case backlog in all  branch courts is 1,000 to 1,100 cases. About 100 cases arrive at  each branch court each month.    One of the distinctions of the Court of Administrative  Justice is that every branch court is required to hear 70 cases  month, meaning it must issue a verdict on them. If the number is  less than this the court is reprimanded. If the number is  between 70 and 120, in accordance with a measure we have this  year it receives a commission. For the branch courts, which hear  more than 120 cases, we give a prize to the three highest, and  we have a court that completes 300 cases per month. Sometimes,  however, when a case takes too long it is not the fault of the  court of justice, because we must send one copy of the plea to  the defendant, and sometimes the defendant does not answer for  up to six months.    [RESALAT] How far has the work on the seven-person land  investigation councils gone?    [Ferdowsipur] The work on the seven-person councils has been  completed in the court. Of course, we have cases for which a  verdict has not yet been issued, and they will also be heard.  However, the final verdict will be given by a council designated  by the Interests Discernment Council consisting of a judge  confirmed by the chief of the judiciary, a Majles deputy  confirmed by the speaker of the Majles, and a person chosen and  confirmed by the minister of agriculture. These three people are  a council, and they must study all the cases of the seven-person  councils that have ended here with the issuance of a verdict.    Recently a set of guidelines for these councils was  presented  at a meeting of judicial power officials by the minister of  justice and was approved. The three-person councils will be  formed to deal with these kinds of cases in order to determine  their outcome.    [RESALAT] In conclusion, do you have any special  recommendations for the public and for the two parties to a case?    [Ferdowsipur] Some complaints are time consuming. The  complaint is rejected and they complain at another court,  meaning they present their complaints several times. It would be  better for people like this to consult with a judge or a lawyer  to deal with the problem. A judge is not anyone's family. When  he issues a verdict the right to protest is retained for  individuals, but when the verdict is finalized it must be  obeyed. Send individuals to give advice which, in the words of  His Holiness the Imam (peace be upon him), will be plastered on  the walls.</p>

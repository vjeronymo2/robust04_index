			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / International Company News: Soros invests in Carlyle fund THE CARLYLE Group, a Washington-based investment banking group that features former US secretary of state Mr James Baker among its partners, plans to seek fresh institutional investment in Europe in the next few weeks to help finance a new Dollars 500m buy-out fund. Mr George Soros, the New York-based investor, has agreed to put up the first Dollars 100m 'anchor' investment in the new fund, according to Mr David Rubenstein, a managing partner of Carlyle. 'We are very pleased that George Soros has selected us to be a vehicle for his investment activity. We plan to use the Dollars 500m fund as the equity segment of purchases in the defence, aerospace and other sectors,' he said yesterday. Among Carlyle's holdings is Vought Aircraft, the Texas-based company that consists of the former aircraft division of LTV. Carlyle also manages defence contractors, airline catering businesses and a book distributor. Carlyle, which was founded more than six years ago with seed money from the Mellon family of Pittsburgh, already controls companies in the defence, telecommunications, aerospace and service industries that have Dollars 5bn of combined revenues. Mr Baker joined Carlyle as one of seven partners, each of which is believed to earn more than Dollars 2m a year, soon after he left the Bush administration. Another former Bush administration official who has become a Carlyle partner is Mr Dick Darman, the former director of the Office of Management and Budget. The chairman of Carlyle is Mr Frank Carlucci, the former defence secretary.</p>

"There is no possibility of a South-North summit in Beijing  during President Kim Yong-sam's visit to China," Chu said.    "An inter-Korean summit is not such a simple matter as to be  realized just because the two leaders are visiting Beijing  nearly at the same time," Chu said.    In order for Seoul and Pyongyang to hold a summit, extensive  consultations and preparations must take place, Chu said. At  present, there is no possibility that Presidents Kim Yong-sam  and Kim Il-song will visit Beijing at the same time, Chu added.    Reliable sources in Beijing said Monday that the North  Korean  president would visit China in May at the latest.</p>

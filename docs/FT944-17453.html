			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Spirit of politics takes its toll on Yeltsin The official Russian news agency, Itar Tass, yesterday published excerpts from a letter from President Boris Yeltsin to Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, which express the president's 'sincere regret' for the 'annoying misunderstanding' which kept him inside his jet at Shannon airport on his way back from the US a week ago, instead of attending a scheduled meeting with the prime minister. Mr Reynolds, with great good humour, accepted the explanation given to him by Mr Oleg Soskovets, first deputy prime minister, that Mr Yeltsin was 'unwell' and 'fatigued'. Mr Patrick McCabe, Irish ambassador to Moscow, said yesterday the letter, sent on Tuesday, was 'warm and gracious': it repeats an already-issued invitation to Mr Reynolds to visit Moscow next year, and looks forward to a meeting at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe in Budapest in December. It could not have escaped the attention of the Irish, however, that Mr Yeltsin said he was not unwell when he returned to Moscow, proffering instead the explanation that his security people had not allowed him to be woken and that he was annoyed about it, an explanation the letter seems to implicitly endorse. The Irish snub completed a troika of such events. Last month, Mr Yeltsin seized a baton from a band leader, sang loudly and stumbled at a reception at the Berlin ceremony marking withdrawal of Russian troops. In Washington last week he gave a boisterous press conference after talks with President Bill Clinton. These have embedded themselves in the Russian political landscape, and, as the political season opens once more, the president's behaviour and habits will not be off-limits. They have not so far, however, come under the sustained attack which a western head of state would certainly have had to suffer. Mr Victor Ilyukhin, communist deputy who referred on Wednesday to Mr Yeltsin's escapades as 'our shame' and claimed he was a long-term sufferer from alcoholism, was a rare exception to official silence, or indifference. The incidents, and Mr Yeltsin's general behaviour come up in ordinary conversation, but are shrugged off, as if to say: 'What would you expect?' The official Communist party disapprobation of drunkenness, which reached a peak when Mr Mikhail Gorbachev come to power in 1985 and banned drinking, has wholly gone. It had anyway been, in the latter part of the Soviet period, largely hypocritical: Mr William Pokhlebkin, whose 'History of Vodka' appeared three years ago, says that, in the 1970s, 'it was no longer possible to evoke a popular contempt for drunkenness, to create an attitude of disdain for drunkards, since heavy drinking had lost its stamp as a grave offence incompatible with the Soviet system'. Now, alcohol is indispensably compatible with the good life, or efforts to simulate it. Most of the street kiosks sell alcohol of varying sorts. It is available in large quantities at official, as well as private, receptions. Mr Genady Zyuganov, the increasingly militant leader of the Communist party, said yesterday that the opposition would be out in force next week to debate parliament's relations with the president. The communists have shown that they have no inhibitions about attacking Mr Yeltsin for his alleged drinking habits: the issue will come up again, and, if the allegations have a basis, then Mr Yeltsin, his health uncertain, is in poorer and poorer shape to withstand the attacks.</p>

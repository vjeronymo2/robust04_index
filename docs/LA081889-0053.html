			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> PROS SHOOTING IN THE DARK IN COLORADO EVENT  </P> <P> Doug Tewell may have the inside track on solving the peculiar format that  confused and mystified some of golf's leading pros Thursday in the first round  of the $1-million International tournament at Castle Rock, Colo.  </P> <P> "You find yourself thinking, 'Now what is it I'm trying to do?' " Hale Irwin  said.  </P> <P> Craig Stadler may have put it in focus when he walked off the 18th green at the  Castle Pines Golf Club and said: "I don't know what I shot. And I don't care."  </P> <P> His attitude is understandable in an event where medal scores don't count, the  lead through the first three days of play is completely meaningless and Tewell  figured out a way he may be able to make a double bogey work to his advantage.  </P> <P> The tournament uses a modified Stableford scoring system in which a player's  medal score has no bearing. Points are awarded for eagles (5) and birdies (2),  and points are subtracted for bogeys (-1) and double bogeys and higher (-3).  Only the player's point total counts.  </P> <P> Previously, the field was cut after each round and there was no carryover of  point totals from one round to another.  </P> <P> This year, however, the 150-man field is scheduled to play two rounds, with  points carried over from Thursday to today, before the 72 players with the  highest point totals advance to Saturday's play.  </P> <P> Saturday, they will all start from zero again, competing for 24 places in  Sunday's final round, when the field again will start from zero.  </P> <P> Wayne Westner of South Africa led the first-day point-getters with 16.  </P> <P> Price, Bill Britton, Brad Fabel and Bob Gilder had 12 points apiece. Steve  Elkington of Australia had 11, and Tewell and Corey Pavin each had 10.  </P> <P> Tewell said his 10-point total may be too much.  </P> <P> "How are they going to pair us for Saturday? Will they pair by scores?" he  asked.  </P> <P> "If they do, and I get another eight or 10 points tomorrow, I may have to start  thinking about making a couple of double bogeys to get the total down and get  an earlier starting time when the wind doesn't blow so much and the greens  aren't spiked up," Tewell said.  </P> <P> Would he purposely make bogey or double bogey to arrive at a more advantageous  starting time?  </P> <P> He shrugged. "For this much money (total purse of $1 million, with $180,000 to  the winner) I might have to think about it," he said.  </P> <P> Jack Nicklaus had eight points, Greg Norman five.  </P> <P> Calvin Peete shot a six-under-par 65 to take the lead after the two rounds of a  $256,000 tournament at Chepstow, Wales.  </P> <P> Peete's round earned him 42 points under the Stableford scoring system being  employed at the Welsh tournament. He had 35 points in the first round and held  the lead with 77.  </P> <P> Carl Mason of England and Mark McNulty of Zimbabwe were tied for second place,  a point behind Peete.  </P></p>

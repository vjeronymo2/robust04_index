Final  </P> <P> STATE;  </P> <P> RAUCOUS PROTEST OVER ADMITTING MEN ROUTS MILLS COLLEGE CHIEF  </P> <P> Angry Mills College students blockaded buildings today during a raucous  demonstration that drove the school's president from her campus home, one day  after trustees voted to admit men at the exclusive women's institution.  </P> <P> Several hundred students took part in the blockade, surrounding major buildings  at Mills College, including the administration building and the school  president's home.  </P> <P> Some parked their cars in front of campus buildings, honking horns and setting  off car alarms in a bid to disrupt classes.  </P> <P> "We're trying to shut down the operation of the college until they reverse  their decision," said Esther Barragan, a senior economics major. "We're not  going to take this lightly."  </P> <P> Mary Metz, the school's president, was chased from her home about 9 a.m. The  students, with radios at full blast, were shouting, "We will not accept this!"  </P></p>

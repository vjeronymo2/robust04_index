The goal of this project is to identify the ADA as a civil rights law, distinct from a ``benefit program'', with the same historical background and battles associated with other types of civil rights legislation. The project will draw comparisons between discrimination encountered by people with disabilities and other protected classes of individuals and the historical struggle people with disabilities and others faced to gain the right to equality. Finally, the project will focus on the impact that complying with the ADA can have on changing stereotypes, eliminating barriers, and increasing access to goods, services, and activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Educating the public about the abilities of people with disabilities to function well in an accessible environment and dispelling oft held myths and stereotypes can lead to increased voluntary compliance with the ADA. Materials developed in this project shall portray persons with disabilities in a positive manner and will be used to increase the general public's awareness of disability, accessibility and the ADA and its historical place in the development of civil rights legislation. The project should also strive to increase the level of communication between covered entities, people with disabilities, and providers of consultation services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Priority 6 is an ADA educational audiovisual project that shall include the following major components:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Create and disseminate broadcast quality educational videotapes, identifying the ADA as a civil rights law with protection for people with disabilities parallel to that provided under other civil rights legislation;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Edit to provide videotapes of varying lengths, suitable for use in a variety of broadcast situations (e.g., short segments to be used to promote the videotape or on magazine type programs, longer segments for viewing by audiences attending a meeting, etc.);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Identify target audience and state explicitly the number of people expected to be served in the course of the project's activities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Specify how the project will reach all parts of the targeted audience, including racial and ethnic minority communities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Identify types of attitudinal and physical discrimination that prevent people with disabilities from gaining equal opportunity and possible methods to eliminate discrimination;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Illustrate the increased independence persons with disabilities experience when barriers are removed;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

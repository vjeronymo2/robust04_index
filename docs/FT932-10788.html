			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / UN hopeful for Cambodian vote THE United Nations said last night it felt encouraged to proceed with preparations for a 'free and fair' election in Cambodia later this month, despite continued attempts at disruption by the Khmer Rouge. Mr Yashushi Akashi, head of the UN peacekeeping force in Cambodia, said after meeting Cambodian faction heads in Beijing he had been 'given encouragement' to proceed with elections planned for May 23-27. However, he conceded that Khmer Rouge absence from the process coupled with threats to disrupt the election was 'not a very happy omen'. Earlier, Mr Son Sann, the leader of a moderate Cambodian splinter faction, had urged the United Nations to postpone elections in the strife-torn country to allow further reconciliation efforts. Mr Son Sann's call was debated at a meeting convened at Prince Norodom Sihanouk's villa in Beijing and attended by representatives of three of Cambodia's four factions. The Khmer Rouge, responsible for the deaths of an estimated 1m Cambodians during their 1975-79 rule, stayed away. Mr Akashi, head of the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia, strongly recommended that elections proceed as planned. 'No Cambodian party should have a veto on peace or the electoral process,' he said. AP adds from Phnom Penh: Gunmen believed to be Khmer Rouge guerrillas attacked a train, killing at least 13 people and injuring dozens more, a UN spokesman said. The 50 guerrillas blew up a section of railway track in the north-western province of Battambang and then opened fire on the carriages.</p>

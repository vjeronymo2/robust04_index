			<p>BFN     [Text] A news just coming in says: In furtherance of the  ongoing peace process in Liberia, the leader of the National  Patriotic Front of Liberia [NPFL], Mr. Charles Gankay Taylor,  has opted to send a high-powered delegation to Monrovia to hold  discussions with the Liberian Peace Council [LPC], aimed at  resolving the conflict in Rivercess and parts of Sinoe County.  In a press release today, Mr. Taylor said while the NPFL is  fully aware that the LPC is not a party to the Cotonou Peace  Accord, yet because of the love he has for the Liberian people  and his desire for peace and national reconciliation, a  delegation will leave Gbarnga shortly to hold discussions in  Monrovia. The NPFL leader is, therefore, urging the special  representative to Liberia and head of UNOMIL [UN Observer  Mission to Liberia], Ambassador Gordon-Somers, to provide full  security protection and sponsorship for the ensuing talks.</p>

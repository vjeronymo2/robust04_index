He will attend a  parliamentary debate tomorrow. In London yesterday, Prime  Minister al-Hariri met with British Foreign Secretary Douglas  Hurd, who hosted a dinner in his honor.    Prime Minister al-Hariri has urged Arab investors to invest  in Lebanon. He told foreign reporters that Lebanon will not  sign a peace agreement before Syria and Jordan do. He pointed  out that there is an agreement with Damascus not to proceed  separately. He noted that the issue of Syrian troops in Lebanon  will be discussed in light of the results of the negotiations  with Israel. Here is a dispatch from our correspondent in  London, Khalil Fulayhan:    [Begin Fulayhan recording] Prime Minister al-Hariri has  stated that if Yasir 'Arafat wishes to visit Lebanon, he should  apply for an entry visa. The prime minister was answering a  question during a news conference held last night at the Foreign  Correspondents Club in London.    He was asked: How could 'Arafat be asked to apply for a visa  to Lebanon and is Ahmad Jibril asked to do the same before he  comes to Lebanon to inspect his troops? Prime Minister  al-Hariri answered: I have not seen his passport.    Prime Minister al-Hariri added that U.S. Secretary of State  Christopher had told him that the al-Asad-Clinton summit was  successful and good, adding that he hopes 1994 will be a year of  peace. Al-Hariri pointed out that resettling the Palestinians  in Lebanon is impossible for us to accept, and this is a  principled stand.    Asked if he was ready to meet Rabin after attempts to bring  Rabin together with other Arab leaders have succeeded, Prime  Minister al- Hariri said: This is not a personal issue. I am  not ready to meet Rabin before a peace agreement is concluded.  The Israelis must withdraw first, and then we can discuss the  issue. [end recording]</p>

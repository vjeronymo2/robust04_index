			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Well worth a read Sir, Your report, 'Libraries go up for grabs' (April 13), makes fascinating reading. It will be interesting to see whether contracting out the service to 'bookish entrepreneurs' will achieve more than a well-run public service. According to published figures, libraries in Brent cost each resident Pounds 15.60 a year and on average each person borrows five books a year. In Hampshire, to take an example, the service costs each resident Pounds 11.22 and on average each person borrows 11 books a year. I do also wonder what the 70 administrative staff saved in Brent were doing in the first place] Paul Turner, Hampshire County Council, 81 North Walls, Winchester, Hants</p>

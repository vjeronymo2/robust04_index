			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Rescued The British way of receivership, administration and liquidation is, by comparison with, say, the German approach, a rough old business. But the Department of Trade and Industry has recently been doing its best to foster a more constructive climate for insolvency practice in Britain. The Appeal Court ruling in the Paramount Airways case clearly created uncertainty about the personal liability of insolvency practitioners in relation to employees' contracts and thus threatened jobs. Against that background Mr Heseltine's decision to amend the 1986 Insolvency Act is a commendable step down the road towards a rescue culture. To anyone but a lawyer the grounds for the Appeal Court's decision looked pedantic. Until now, receivers and administrators have followed earlier case law to avoid liability under the act for all contracts that they adopt after their appointment. This has involved writing to employees within a 14-day period to disclaim liability for employment contracts. Lord Justice Dillon decided that this was purely cosmetic; and that where administrators and receivers continued to employ staff and pay them in accordance with their previous contracts, they would be deemed to have adopted those contracts. The worry was that insolvency practitioners would feel unable to take on the increased risk of keeping the company afloat with a view to sale as a going concern and conclude instead that liquidation was the only solution. Banks might also have been encouraged to assess creditworthiness more on the basis of asset values, because greater resort to liquidation would destroy goodwill while leaving assets intact. Since the detailed legislation will not appear on the statute for some time - though it will apply with effect from midnight last night - it remains to be seen how Mr Heseltine has dealt with the potential claims against receivers and administrators stretching back to the implementation of the 1986 Act. But there is no question that the insolvency practitioners' lobbying has scored a victory. This was not, however, the only area of insolvency in which current practice involves a threat to jobs. One score on which the accountants have not been lobbying relates to the potential conflict of interest where they advise banks on the viability of client companies and then accept the resulting receivership or administration. The abuse of this conflict can never be susceptible of proof. But sufficient suspicion has been aroused over the past recession to suggest that this should be another priority for the DTI. The irony in the present legislative revision is that it attacks the enhanced status of employees in an insolvency vis a vis other creditors  - the de facto position, if not the legal one, in the much trumpeted German approach to corporate rescuscitation. There are rescue cultures and rescue cultures, it seems.</p>

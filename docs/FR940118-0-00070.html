The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection and copying during regular business hours in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, room 10278, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20410.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule was reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Review as a significant rule, as that term is defined in Executive Order 12866, which was signed by the President on September 30, 1993. Any changes to the rule as a result of that review are contained in the public file of the rule in the office of the Department's Rules Docket Clerk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this rule before publication and by approving it certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the intent and purpose of that Act. The Act is intended to encourage Federal agencies to utilize innovative administrative procedures in dealing with individuals, small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental bodies that would otherwise be unnecessarily adversely affected by Federal regulations. To the extent that this rule affects those entities, its purpose is to reduce any disproportionate burden by providing for the waiver of regulations and by affording other incentives directed toward a positive economic impact. Therefore, no regulatory flexibility analysis under the Act is necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12611, Federalism  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12611, Federalism, has determined that, although the policies contained in this rule may have a substantial direct effect on States or their political subdivisions that are designated as Empowerment Zones or Enterprise Communities, this effect is intended by the legislation authorizing the program. The purpose of the rule is to provide a cooperative atmosphere between the Federal government and States and local governments, and to reduce any regulatory burden imposed by the Federal government that impedes the ability of States and local governments to solve pressing economic, social, and physical problems in their communities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12606, The Family  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that the provisions of this rule will not have a significant impact on family formation, maintenance or well being, except to the extent that the program authorized by the rule will empower communities and their residents to take effective action to solve difficult and pressing economic, human, community and physical development challenges that have a negative impact on families. Any such impact is beneficial and merits no further review under the Order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Semiannual Agenda  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule was not listed in the Department's semiannual agenda of regulations published on October 25, 1993 (58 FR 56402) under Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act at 49 FR 15960.

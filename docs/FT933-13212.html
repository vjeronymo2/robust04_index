			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Doubts at Boots In a second dramatic development in the drugs sector yesterday, Boots announced that it was withdrawing its frontline heart treatment Manoplax. Boots shares jumped on the news, initially because of its earning-enhancing potential, but later lost heart as speculation mounted that the company may be considering selling its pharmaceutical division. The shares closed 13 ahead at 435p in hefty volume of 9.5m. Manoplax had been dogging the Boots price for several weeks after a research report suggested that too high a dosage could be lethal. Boots' decision yesterday will add around 6 per cent to earnings in the year to March 1995, according to analysts. Speculation that the company may entertain offers for the drugs division generated further excitement, although most stores specialists were sceptical. The business turned over around Pounds 550m last year.</p>

			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LETTERS TO THE TIMES  </P> <P> Over the years, The Times has consistently urged government to invest enough in  schools, transportation networks and other public services to keep pace with  California's phenomenal growth. Its hope has been for public services that  would nurture commerce, industry and people and to protect the unique natural  resources that make California the Golden State.  </P> <P> In a recent letter, Gov. George Deukmejian complained that The Times' editorial  policies call for growth in government programs but never describe where  government can put its hands on the money necessary to support those programs.  He challenged The Times to "put up or shut up." It is a fair challenge that The  Times accepts.  </P> <P> Today's editorial is the first of a series of three in which The Times will  examine the need for new and expanded programs for schools, universities,  health care, transportation and all others essential to the state's future.  Consistent with the challenge, the series will specify the programs that  California needs to grow and prosper, the cost of the programs and the tax  increases it would take to finance them.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE GOVERNOR'S LETTER  </P> <P> Deukmejian on State Budget  </P> <P> In your editorial "State Budget: Over the Cliff" (Feb. 17), you have once again  attributed virtually all of California's challenges to what you say is a lack  of state revenues and to the fact that I won't consent to a tax increase.  </P> <P> Why didn't you inform your readers that over the last six years, we have had a  73% increase in state tax revenues -- thanks to our strong economy and job  creation -- and a 65% increase in expenditures? Both increases exceed the  combined rate of inflation and population growth during that same period.  </P> <P> Our problem is not a lack of revenues. By keeping taxes reasonable, we have  helped keep prosperity and job creation high, and this growth has brought more  new, steady revenues into government coffers for public services than any tax  increase ever could.  </P> <P> California is not falling off a "cliff" or sinking into an "abyss" -- to cite  just two examples of the hyperventilated phrase-making that has become a staple  of your "Chicken Little"-style editorials. Virtually the whole world knows that  when it comes to the quality of life, the level of public services and the  opportunities for personal fulfillment, few places on Earth can match  California.  </P> <P> That is why people are leaving other states, some of which are high tax states,  and beating a path to our door. It is why the job creators and corporate  decision makers, both foreign and domestic, have made California their No. 1  favored destination for new investments. And most recently (on Feb. 24), Wall  Street has expressed renewed confidence in California's underlying fiscal  health by reissuing our Triple A-bond rating.  </P> <P> Yes, we have challenges and we always strive to be the best. But your endless  refrain -- more spending, higher taxes -- represents a disproved, discredited  prescription for mediocrity, and we will never return to that philosophy as  long as I'm governor. And I am convinced that, come 1990, the people will  reject any candidate who thinks like you do.  </P> <P> I propose that at the end of each editorial calling for increased spending or  higher taxes in a given area, you add it to a cumulative total of all new  spending and taxes you have proposed in a given year and report those totals to  your readers. In this manner, readers could judge the wisdom of your views not  just on one isolated issue, but they would be given an opportunity to judge the  total impact of your views on their wallets and pocketbooks if the state were  to follow your advice.  </P> <P> Finally, if you feel so strongly about providing state government with  additional revenues, why wait for the governor and Legislature to raise taxes?  The Times Mirror Co. reported that it made $332 million last year, after taxes.  We will gladly accept your voluntary higher tax payments. Simply make your  checks payable to the "State of California," and send it to my attention. In  other words -- "put your money where your mouth (or pen) is." Or stated another  way -- "put up or shut up." I will make sure that your generous contributions  are deposited into the state's general fund and that your money is wisely  spent.  </P> <P> GEORGE DEUKMEJIAN  </P> <P> Governor  </P> <P> Sacramento  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with FRY Defense Minister Pavle Bulatovic by </F> Radoljub Matovic and Milorad Pantelic; place and date not given]    [Text] "We are successful in developing the defense system  of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, although the  circumstances in the country and its neighborhood are very  complicated. Defense and safety are two vital functions in the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which has decided to establish  and organize a professional, powerful, well-equipped, and  efficient military force. In other words, we would like to  develop a military force that will be able to avert an  aggression against our country and that is capable of defending  our territorial integrity, freedom, and independence in case of  an aggression," Pavle Bulatovic, the federal defense minister,  said in his first interview for VOJSKA.    [VOJSKA] To what extent is the defense concept being  manifested?    [Bulatovic] It is clear that a military force and a defense  system in general depend on the financial possibilities of the  country, but also, vice versa, the power of a country depends on  the capabilities of its military force, which should defend it,  thus enabling it to prosper in freedom.    The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  unified its defense system, and this concept is being  consistently materialized in the republics of our federation.  In other words, the republican defense ministries have  practically been abolished and the Federal Ministry constituted.  Defense is a portfolio in the Federal Government. There are  problems with the materialization of our defense concept, but  they cannot affect the defense system as defined by the  Constitution.    It is clear that the federal state had to define what kind  of  a military force it wanted and how big it should be, and it did  so. We have to bear in mind that a powerful military force is  the aim we want to achieve. This aim cannot be achieved  overnight. Especially not because we are trying to develop our  army under the conditions of a war and economic sanctions, which  means with very little financial means. The Federal Government  and the Federal Defense Ministry do not have any additional  funds that would make it possible to speed up the organization  of the army, so that the only approach, which must be applied  consistently at all command levels, is to be rational and set  priorities.    Our multiparty system requires us to reach a consensus in  all  important issues, especially in the field of national defense.  This must be binding for all parties, regardless of their  political programs. Conflicts between political parties must  not affect the defense system.    [VOJSKA] The Yugoslav Army must not be accused of the  disintegration of Yugoslavia any longer.    [Bulatovic] The question of who caused the disintegration of  Yugoslavia is very complex. Nobody has treated this issue  seriously yet. This is necessary, though. It is more than  obvious that the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [SFRY]  was a fragile structure since it collapsed at the first  nationalist attacks and influences from abroad.    The former Yugoslav People's Army is unfoundedly accused of  the disintegration of Yugoslavia. Seen from the point of view  of history, the army has always defended freedom in this area,  and politics has always chosen the state it wanted. In my  opinion, the Yugoslav People's Army could have done only two  things -- either to execute the orders given by its supreme  command, the SFRY Presidency, or to stage a coup. The military  leadership chose the correct solution; everything else is  speculation since we cannot know whether Yugoslavia would have  collapse also in the case of a coup, whether more or less blood  would have been shed.... We must not allow wrong assessments  made by individuals from the former Yugoslav People's Army to be  ascribed to the Yugoslav Army. The phenomenon of treason has  always been present in this area, but always as an act committed  by an individual, not as collective hypocrisy.    [VOJSKA] The defense of Yugoslavia is a right and duty of  all our citizens. Still, some do not want to fulfill this  obligation.    [Bulatovic] This is a big and complex problem. It is  necessary that the state is accepted and respected by all of its  citizens if we want them to accept its defense as their duty.  Unfortunately, there are still people who have not accepted the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as their state. Would the use of  repressive measures mean that they accept our state, its  leadership and policy, or will it only be the implementation of  laws? It is not only necessary to find rational political  solutions to controversial matters, but also to apply legal  regulations.    There must be no quarrels about certain questions,  especially  about the territorial integrity of Serbia, Montenegro, and  Yugoslavia in general. No negotiations are possible about this  topic, neither in Yugoslavia, nor abroad, since this state is  the result of historical processes and desperate struggles for  freedom. Nobody has the right to argue about the blood shed in  this area.    [VOJSKA] What is the destiny of peace in the Balkans, and  who will, in your opinion, decide about it?    [Bulatovic] Major powers are following their interests and  are creating the spheres of their interests in the Balkans. It  is clear who does not want peace; the Serbs in Yugoslavia and in  the former Bosnia-Herzegovina certainly do want it.    I would like to remind you that the aim of the aggressors in  the two world wars was to exterminate the Serbian and the  Montenegrin population, but they were not successful. What was  not achieved then is beingdone in a much more perfidious way now  -- by waging a low-intensity war against us, without spreading  into war conflicts. The Serbian and Montenegrin people have to  defend their freedom decisively, as they have done during the  course of history. They have no other choice.    Many assessments have already been made, but I would like to  remind you of the words uttered by Mr. Jovan Cvijic that the  Serbs are guilty only because they built their house in the  middle of the road. The house has to be defended because it is  obviously an impediment to the interests of major powers. They  do not want to allow us to live peacefully in our house.    [VOJSKA] The required high professionalism of the army  collides with the modest financial means Yugoslavia can invest  in it. What is done in order to find a solution to this  contradiction?    [Bulatovic] There is really a striking discrepancy between  our wishes and our financial power. This problem is often  discussed at the Federal Defense Ministry and in sessions of the  Supreme Defense Council. There is understanding in military  commands and units that financial means are restricted and that  priorities have to be set. By additional efforts of army  members, it is possible to perform key tasks and keep the combat  readiness of our defense system on the required level. The  recovery of country's economy is encouraging, so we can hope  that more means will be devoted to the defense system soon.    [VOJSKA] When will the organization of the Federal Defense  Ministry be adopted?    [Bulatovic] We have not completed the organization of our  Ministry yet. We are intensely working on it, however. There  are still some questions that have to be solved. After that, we  shall present the scheme of our organization to the Federal  Government for adoption. This will happen soon.    [VOJSKA] The protection of civilians has been taken over by  the Federal Defense Ministry, too. What problems accompany this  procedure?    [Bulatovic] The tasks that had been performed by the  republican ministries before the new Law on Defense was adopted  were taken over by the Federal Defense Ministry at the end of  last year. It was not a simple operation, since a completely new  defense type had to be developed. We did not only take over  these tasks from the republican ministries, we also employed  their employees in charge of defense tasks. I can tell you that  radical changes are foreseen in this field. There is a lot of  work, but I believe that we shall be able to manage it.    [VOJSKA] You have stressed on several occasions that it is  necessary to transform the military industry. What are the  concrete measures you have proposed?    [Bulatovic] As you know, approximately 48 percent of capital  assets of the former military industry have remained on the  territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Forty-six  percent of the former employees have also remained. We have  inherited almost all the scientists and researchers and other  respectable personnel, as well as laboratory resources.    In cooperation with the Army of Yugoslavia General Staff,  the  Ministry has successfully organized the manufacturing process of  priority weapons and military equipment. It is only natural  that the present financial possibilities dictate our behavior in  this extremely important field.    The Federal Defense Ministry will make use of its military  industry facilities according to the criteria of economic  feasibility. In other words, it will act according to market  economic principles wherever this is possible. Since the market  economy has been introduced, it is necessary to reorganize the  military economy. The Yugoslav Army cannot invest in new  facilities and technologies in order to develop complex combat  and non-combat systems. It can only buy certain products from  the "list" of the existing equipment in various units and  commands.    One of the reasons we have not completed the process of  military industry transformation is that the respective federal  laws are late, too. The new law on companies will give the  institutional framework for a more efficient organization and  transformation of the military industry that will be adapted to  the economic system of the country and to the needs of the  Yugoslav Army.    [VOJSKA] Does this mean that the chances for a quicker  technical modernization of the Yugoslav Army are getting better?    [Bulatovic] The Yugoslav Army must be equipped with modern  and efficient weapons and technology. This is also the aim of  the transformation, but we have to be aware of the reality of  our military and political situation.    Technical modernization includes the introduction of  efficient combat means, modern rocket systems and optoelectonic  means, radio systems protected from surveillance, wiretapping,  and disturbances, modern means for fire control etc. Our  experts have assured us that the existing combat means can be  modernized and developed. Certain complex means will have to be  bought abroad. Research and development and manufacturing  facilities will be adapted to the already adopted plans for  technical modernization.    [VOJSKA] Let us go back to the difficult problem of  finances....    [Bulatovic] This is a really difficult question because we  only have means to cover the most necessary things and it is  difficult to set priorities under the present circumstances. We  must not allow our basic defense functions to be affected, and,  on the other hand, we must not allow young personnel to leave.  In cooperation with the Federal Government and the Supreme  Defense Council we shall do everything in order to prevent this.    [VOJSKA] One of your biggest problems is apartments for your  employees....    [Bulatovic] It is well known that there are 25,000  applications for apartments that have to be solved, 17,500 of  them were filed by people who have no apartment at all. So far  we have succeeded in temporarily accommodating 3,000 Yugoslav  Army members with 10,000 family members in military facilities.  These people came to Yugoslavia from the breakaway republics.  A radical change in the search for solutions in this field will  not be possible without considerable financial help from  society. Together with the General Staff, we have prepared a  special program according to which 10,000 apartments should be  built for the Yugoslav Army by the year 2000, but it is still  not sure whether this will materialize or not. It is only  certain that we shall have 2,000 apartments for our personnel  next year. There are numerous other initiatives, but their  materialization depends on funds.    [VOJSKA] The Yugoslav Army members who have not become  Yugoslav citizens would like to know what their status is.    [Bulatovic] It has been precisely defined by the  Constitution of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia that the  members of the Yugoslav Army can only be Yugoslav citizens.  There is the same regulation everywhere in the world. The  question of Yugoslav citizenship for those people will be solved  according to the federal law on citizenship, which has to be  adopted. I hope that the bill of law will soon enter the  parliamentary procedure.    [VOJSKA] We are approaching 16 June -- the Day of the  Yugoslav Army. The traditions of both the Serbian and the  Montenegrin Armies are rich and long....    [Bulatovic] Our peoples have always cherished the idea of  freedom, we have always supported defense politics, politics of  peace. We are powerful as far as our willpower and decisiveness  are concerned.    June 16 was chosen as the Day of the Yugoslav Army, so that  we are approaching its first anniversary. We must not assume,  however, that history began on 16 June, or 27 April, or on some  other day. We have to avoid mistakes that have been made since  1945, because during this time it was almost degrading to  mention Kajmakcalan, Cer, Mojkovac, Kolubara, Skadar, or army  commanders Misic, Stepa, Putnik, Bojovic, Janko Vukotic, from  whom we could have learned a lot, not only as far as tactics and  strategy are concerned, but also as far as the relation toward  soldiers and the state are concerned -- with adaptations to  modern times, of course. Nor must we forget the experiences of  World War II, especially from the resistance movement against  Fascism.    I am convinced that commanders, soldiers, and other  professional members of our army, as well as all those who are  contributing to the development of our defense system, work  toward a reliable defense system for the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia.    Finally, I would like to congratulate all Yugoslav Army  members and the employees of the Federal Defense Ministry on the  first Yugoslav Army anniversary.  <H5>  [Box, p 7] </H5> <H5>  Who Are Barbarians? </H5>   Five hundred years ago we printed our first book in Obod,  the  "Oktoih." This was our contribution to world culture. Our  first book is only a little younger than the United States,  whose propaganda machine is now accusing us of being barbarians  and monsters who should be wiped off the the face of the Earth  for the benefit of humankind.    A nation exists, however, not only based on its biological  existence, but also in the light of its contribution to  civilization.    I would like to remind you of a dialogue between the army  commander Drasko and the principal of the Republic of Venice in  "Gorski vijenac," a work by P.P. Njegos that shows that  accusations, but not by the Serbian and Montenegrin people, have  a long tradition.    The principal is interested in the "Bosnjaci [population of  historic Bosnia-Herzegovina] and Arbanasi [population of  historic Albania]" and asks Drasko: "If they catch a  Montenegrin, either dead or alive, will they eat him up, or what  will they do with him?"    Drasko answers: "How would they eat him up, for God's sake,  a man cannot eat a man!"    It is obvious who would like to change the roles now....</p>

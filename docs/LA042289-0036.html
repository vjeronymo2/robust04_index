			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SABATINI CLOSES IN ON ANOTHER TOURNAMENT WIN  </P> <P> Top-seeded Gabriela Sabatini beat Linda Ferrando of Italy, 6-2, 6-3, Friday in  the quarterfinals of the Eckerd Tennis Open at Largo, Fla., but the Argentine  said the match was tougher than it should have been.  </P> <P> "I think I made it a lot more difficult," Sabatini said. "It was hot to play  out there. It was hard to move. There were many deuces in all the games. I made  too many mistakes and was not really into the match."  </P> <P> Sabatini nonetheless advanced to today's semifinals. Her opponent will be No.  4-seeded Arantxa Sanchez of Spain, who needed just 57 minutes to eliminate  Rosalyn Fairbank of San Diego, 6-1, 6-0.  </P> <P> The other semifinal pits No. 6 Sandra Cecchini of Italy against No. 8 Conchita  Martinez of Spain. Cecchini dropped qualifier Petra Langrova of Czechoslovakia,  6-2, 6-2, and Martinez defeated Halle Cioffi of Knoxville, Tenn., 6-1, 6-2.  </P> <P> Sabatini, ranked third in the world, said she is eager to win the tournament as  a follow-up to last week's upset victory over top-ranked Steffi Graf at Amelia  Island, Fla.  </P> <P> "It was a good win over Steffi, but now I have to try to win this one,"  Sabatini said.  </P> <P> Yugoslav teen-ager Goran Ivanisevic and last year's surprise finalist, Jerome  Potier of France, gained the semifinals of the $200,000 Swatch Open tournament  at Nice, France.  </P> <P> The 6-foot 5-inch Ivanisevic, 17, who advanced to the quarterfinals of the  Australian Open in January, beat Fernando Luna of Spain, 7-6 (7-5), 6-3, and  Potier defeated Alberto Mancini of Argentina, 2-6, 6-4, 6-2, in another  quarterfinal match. Potier is ranked 254th in the world, Mancini 32nd.  </P> <P> No. 6-seeded Andrei Chesnokov of the Soviet Union beat No. 3 Guillermo  Perez-Roldan of Argentina, 7-6 (7-3), 6-4. The match was delayed two hours  because of rain.  </P> <P> In an all-Italian quarterfinal, Francisco Cancellotti defeated Claudio  Pistolesi, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2.  </P></p>

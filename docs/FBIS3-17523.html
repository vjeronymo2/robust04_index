			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Otakhon Latifi, chairman of the board of the </F> coordinating center of Tajikistan's democratic forces in the CIS  countries, by OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent Aleksandr Karpov;  place and date not given: "Opposition Is for National Accord"]    [Text] The Tajik problem may only be solved by political  methods -- this is the main result of negotiations between the  delegation of forces in opposition to the current official  Dushanbe with the Russian MFA [Ministry of Foreign Affairs]  leadership, which were held under UN sponsorship in Teheran. Our  correspondent, Aleksandr Karpov, interviews a member of the  Tajik delegation at this meeting -- Otakhon Latifi, chairman of  the board of the coordinating center of Tajikistan's democratic  forces in the CIS.    [Karpov] Why did the negotiations process on the Tajik  problem begin with, of all things, the opposition meeting with  the Russian political leadership?    [Latifi] It is our deep conviction that negotiations with  current Tajik authorities are impossible without first  discussing the Russian factor. Russia, which alternately  supported either one or the other side in the confrontation,  found itself moving willy-nilly, directly involved in this  conflict. Today, the official regime in Tajikistan is holding up  only because of the presence of the Russian army, which in its  actions transcends the boundaries of peacekeeping tasks and  constantly interferes in the internal affairs of a sovereign  independent state. This has been acknowledged by international  experts, Russian analysts, and the Russian press. One of the  important results of the meeting in Teheran is the general  understanding that peacekeeping forces in our Republic may even  be represented by Russia's 201st motorized rifle division, but  on the condition that it will be authorized by the United  Nations.    [Karpov] Opposition leaders' statements at various times  often mentioned Russia's special geopolitical interests in  Tajikistan. What specifically do they have in mind?    [Latifi] The economy; it is the uranium industry in  Leninabad  Oblast. Do not forget that the first Soviet atomic bomb was  built using uranium ore mined around the city of Chkalovsk. Many  among our enterprises also have direct ties with plants and  factories in the Russian Federation. In the political sphere,  Tajikistan has always been and remains a gate to the East for  Russia; Russian positions in Iran, Afghanistan, and India depend  to a considerable extent on relations with Tajikistan. Anyway,  how can one discard ties that go back more than 200 years?    [Karpov] For a long time, Tajikistan's official authorities  kept saying that they could not sit down at the negotiating  table with the opposition, whose "hands are in blood up to the  elbows." The opposition, in turn, maintained that they have  nothing to discuss with a puppet government...    [Latifi] Most such mutual accusations are a thing of the  past. During his latest trip to Tashkent, Emomali Rakhmonov said  that he is willing to sit down at the negotiating table with any  official representative of the opposition forces regardless of  his political views. As to blood on the opposition's hands, I  want to remind that opposition in Tajikistan had never been in  power. Right now, however, the important point is that there is  an opportunity to reach a sensible solution, in which there  should be no place for ambitions.    [Karpov] Criminal proceedings, which are investigated by the  Republic procuracy, have been initiated against many opposition  leaders in Tajikistan...    [Latifi] One of the terms of truce is that all these  proceedings will be terminated.    [Karpov] Probably the first round of negotiations between  the  opposition and the representatives of Tajikistan's official  authorities will take place soon. What proposals will the  opposition forces leaders bring to this meeting?    [Latifi] Tajikistan's authorities more or less control the  situation in Dushanbe, but certainly not in the republic as a  whole. Therefore, a period of transition to stabilization must  be defined. During this time, in our opinion, a state council of  national accord should be set up, which will be comprised of  new, absolutely neutral people. Over the period of two or three  years they will have to make a tremendous effort to return all  refugees to the Motherland (about a million people); conduct a  population census; disarm all -- both opposition and government  -- illegal armed formations, and only then draft and adopt a new  national constitution and conduct elections to the supreme  bodies of authority. The opposition does not thirst for power.  All we want is national accord.</p>

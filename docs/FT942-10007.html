			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Resumed bull run pushes copper price above Dollars 2,100 The copper market's bull run got back into gear yesterday, lifting the three months delivery price at the London Metal Exchange above Dollars 2,100 a tonne, for the first time in 13 months. Tuesday afternoon's shake-out continued in early trading, with the three months price dipping Dollars 15 to Dollars 1,957 a tonne. But then the recent heavy speculative buying was resumed and the price quickly climbed to Dollars 2,117. The move was helped by continued tightness of nearby supplies, which was reflected in the elimination of the discount, or 'contango', on nearby positions. At the close of the afternoon ring the cash price had moved to a 50 cents premium over that for delivery in three months; and the three months position's premium over December 1995 had widened to Dollars 50 from Dollars 25 on Tuesday. By the end of after hours 'kerb' trading the three months price had been trimmed by profit-taking to Dollars 2,109 a tonne, but that still represented a gain of Dollars 36 on the day. Dealers remained convinced, however, that a sizeable downward correction was overdue following an almost uninterrupted upward run of nearly Dollars 200 over the past two weeks.</p>

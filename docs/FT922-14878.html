			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Apparent irregularities found involving former Lloyd's agency INVESTIGATORS have un-earthed evidence of apparent irregularities at businesses formerly administered by Gooda Walker, a Lloyd's agency which managed some of the worst loss-making syndicates in 1989 and 1990. The discovery is likely to have serious implications for the legal battles between Names, who are the individuals whose capital backs insurance business, Lloyd's and their agents. Names are insisting that cash calls needed to pay more than Pounds 200m in losses made in 1989 and 1990 by the Gooda Walker syndicates should be frozen while investigations continue. The evidence of apparent irregularities was discovered by GW Run Off, an agency set up to manage the affairs of Gooda Walker, and is contained in an affidavit presented by Lloyd's to the Commercial Court on Tuesday. It centres on the use of so-called time and distance policies. These allow syndicates to reinsure known liabilities with outside reinsurers. Before its liquidation last year Gooda Walker managed eight syndicates which mainly specialised in catastrophe reinsurance. Yesterday Mr Alan Lord, chief executive of Lloyd's, said that GW Run Off, a company formed to manage the syndicates, had exposed 'a number of transactions which appear to have rather odd and perhaps damaging consequences for Names'. However despite the new information Lloyd's would continue to press Names 'to pay cash calls and if necessary draw down the deposits,' said Mr Lord. Failure to meet claims from its policy holders would damage the insurance market's tarnished reputation. This means that the legal action by 820 Names who are seeking court injunctions to prevent Lloyd's from drawing down their deposits will continue next Monday. 'I do not think it will change our prospects of succeeding in our ability to draw down on Names' deposits. It will not change the substance of our case,' added Mr Lord . The case in which the Names are being represented by Michael Freeman &amp; Co was adjourned on Tuesday to allow both sides to consider the new evidence. The Gooda Walker Action Group, some of whose members are party to the Freeman action, may now mount a separate legal action. Indemnity notice from Lime Street nearly month late, Page 9</p>

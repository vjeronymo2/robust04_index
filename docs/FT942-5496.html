			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Heseltine chides chambers for poor business support Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday criticised chambers of commerce for providing inadequate support services to business. Mr Heseltine, speaking at the British Chambers of Commerce conference in Birmingham, urged chambers to get into partnership with other support agencies. Mr Heseltine topped a poll of the 500 delegates by Ernst &amp; Young, the accountants, as the best person to lead the UK. He won 23 per cent of the votes, compared with 16 per cent for Mr John Major and 14 per cent for Mr Tony Blair. He told the conference some of the larger chambers had a tradition of high-quality support through the provision of information and advice to companies. They had been drumming up export business since the days of Queen Victoria. But, he said, this was not the case in the newer industrial regions. 'Outside the industrial heartlands the chamber network is patchy,' he said. This meant that service was 'something of a lottery'. Mr Heseltine plans 200 Business Links all over England by the end of next year - one-stop support shops offering information, advice, business health checks and training by pooling the local resources of the government, the chambers and the training and enterprise councils which deliver government training schemes. He warned the chambers not to be parochial. He said: 'You cannot allow yourselves to be seen as watching on the sidelines like a pack of vultures waiting to make a hearty meal of the carcass. I urge you now to join with your partners.' The theme of support for small businesses was the strongest to emerge from yesterday's discussions. Mr Eric Swainson, vice-chairman of Lloyds Bank, said: 'Banks want and need industry to succeed.' Mr Pen Kent, executive director of the Bank of England, referring to the hostility between some companies and their bankers during the recession, said: 'In the next decade we want to get much more right than we got in the last one.' Both made clear that there was money available for small businesses. Mr Kent said: 'The banks have the headroom to lend if they see opportunities. The shortage now is of demand.' Both urged companies to break away from dependence on the overdraft. Mr Kent said it was 'a false economy - it sometimes looks cheaper, but it does not have the commitment of both sides of a term loan'. Mr Swainson said: 'The more structured borrowings are, the easier it is to adopt an effective financial plan.' But he came out against bank support for companies through the long-term holding of equity. Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of the Stock Exchange, favoured encouraging local investors to invest in local companies. Calling for tax changes, he said: 'A capital gains tax regime which allowed an investor to ringfence his gains when he sold one share and reinvested in another would stimulate that sort of investment.'</p>

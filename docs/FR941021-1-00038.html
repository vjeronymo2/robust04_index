			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With respect to positive drug tests other than those conducted under rules or internal programs of the Department of Transportation, the FAA would evaluate such test results and the surrounding circumstances on a case-by-case basis to determine the weight to be accorded them. If one of these tests is positive for substance use, the individual could be disqualified under the criteria used in the definition of substance abuse or substance dependence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A fourth substance abuse criterion states that an individual is medically disqualified if he or she misused a substance that is found by the Federal Air Surgeon to make the person unable to safely perform the duties or exercise the privileges of the airman certificate applied for or held; or may reasonably be expected, within 2 years after the finding, to make the person unable to perform those duties or exercise those privileges. The finding of the Federal Air Surgeon is based on the case history and appropriate, qualified medical judgment. Again, as in the two previous criteria the misuse must have taken place within the preceding 2 years in the case of alcohol or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5 years in the case of other substances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As with the current regulation, certification before completion of the 2- or 5-year abstinence/recovery period is possible under the special issuance provisions of the FAR if an individual evaluation demonstrates that the applicant is able to perform airman duties without endangering public safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Neurological Conditions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current regulations on neurological conditions list as disqualifying for all three classes anyone with a history or clinical diagnosis of epilepsy or disturbance of consciousness without satisfactory medical explanation of cause. Nor may a person have any other convulsive disorder, disturbance of consciousness, or neurological condition that the Federal Air Surgeon finds makes the person unable to perform airman privileges safely, or may reasonably be expected, within 2 years after the finding to make the airman unable to perform airman privileges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A detailed discussion of neurological conditions, their evaluation, and prognosis is provided within the AMA Report. Additional information and recommendations are contained in ``Neurological and Neurosurgical Conditions Associated with Aviation Safety,'' a major report prepared in 1979 by representatives of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Association of Neurological Surgeons through an earlier contract between the FAA and the AMA. Neither report proposes detailed, objective criteria and tests that could be included in the standards and by which medical certification could be determined. They discuss the medical techniques now available for evaluation of individual airmen and the significance of the results obtained from their use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Both reports emphasize the significance of seizure disorders. The few changes to the standards suggested by the AMA Report are proposed by the FAA at &sect;&sect;67.109, 67.209, and 67.309, for all three classes of airman medical certificates and include the addition of ``a single seizure'' to the list of disqualifying conditions; the use of ``seizure'' rather than ``convulsive'' to describe disorders that may be found disqualifying by the Federal Air Surgeon; and the addition of a ``transient loss of control of nervous system function(s) without satisfactory explanation of the cause'' as a specific basis for disqualification. This last proposed addition clarifies the agency's aeromedical concern about such events whether or not they are characterized as disturbances of consciousness. (Discussion of how a proposed disqualifying condition may affect a current medical certificate appears under ``Additional Standards for Disqualification.'')  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other neurological conditions described in the AMA Report, though of significance in questions of aeromedical certification, are not proposed as separate standards. The proposed regulatory provisions provide an adequate medical basis for assuring safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The AMA Report recommended that an abbreviated mental examination of four questions be included in each airman medical certification examination. If one or more responses are incorrect, the Mini-Mental Status Examination of Folstein, Folstein and McHugh (Folstein) would be given. The FAA studied the feasibility of the AMA Report's recommendation. It found that neither the AMA-recommended test nor the test by Folstein provides a useful screening device, alone or in combination, for airman neurological status. There was an unacceptable incidence of false negatives. Additionally, neither test, alone or in combination, provides predictors of any skills known to be relevant to piloting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Cardiovascular Conditions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To meet its statutory responsibility to ensure public safety, on May 17, 1982 (47 FR 16298; April 15, 1982), the FAA amended part 67 of the FAR in part to clarify the cardiovascular standards. This change codified FAA policy that individuals with a history of coronary heart disease not be medically certificated for the exercise of airman privileges under &sect;&sect;67.13, 67.15, or 67.17. These individuals would continue to be certificated through the discretionary special issuance procedures after a separate determination that their disease no longer represents a risk to aviation safety. During that rulemaking procedure, a number of commenters expressed the belief that the cardiovascular standards for medical certification should be relaxed. Commenters also suggested that those standards be revised to set forth more detailed, objective criteria and tests by which medical certification could be determined, and a group of concerned pilots submitted a petition for rulemaking (to be discussed later in this document) that was intended to accomplish such a revision. Many commenters contended that the standards failed to take into account the advances in medicine that had occurred since part 67 was issued. The FAA announced that these issues would be addressed in its review of part 67.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Optimism among Scots companies still growing CONFIDENCE among Scottish businesses about their prospects is still rising, although at a slightly slower rate than before, according to the latest chambers of commerce survey. Optimism is increasing among manufacturing companies with a marked improvement among construction companies. Confidence in the retail and wholesale distribution trades and in tourism and leisure is also rising. The survey, analysed by economic forecasters at the Fraser of Allander Institute of Strathclyde University, shows demand rising in all sectors. However, the domestic Scottish market appears less buoyant than the rest of the UK and export markets. The survey shows that investment by manufacturers in plant and machinery is increasing while investment in buildings continues to fall. Employment trends are the best since 1990. A number of sectors reported recruitment difficulties.</p>

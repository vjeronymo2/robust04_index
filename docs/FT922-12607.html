			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Survey of Swindon (4): Giants dominate economy - Two large businesses make up the core of the town's financial services SWINDON'S role as a financial services centre rests largely on the presence of two large concerns - insurance and personal finance group, Allied Dunbar, and leading building society Nationwide, both of which have chosen the town as the centre for providing a range of back-office services. The advantages it can offer as a location have also resulted, however, in a number of small- and medium-sized companies flooding into the town, and these in turn have attracted a number of correspondingly small and medium-sized legal and accountancy firms. Large hotels with conference facilities have also been set up, the latest of which is the De Vere Hotel. There is a Holiday Inn and it is possible that a Hilton hotel will be built. There are also several property and employment agencies. Mr Nicholas Davies, a senior audit manager at accountants Ernst &amp; Young and president of the Swindon Chamber of Commerce, says: 'Enough medium-sized businesses have established themselves in Swindon to ensure that there is enough work for lots of smallish accountants and not just the big boys. But the really large companies like Allied Dunbar tend to carry out a lot of services in house.' Swindon is, moreover, close enough to London (55 minutes by train) for large concerns to rely on legal and other financial services in the capital. Allied Dunbar has its national headquarters in Swindon and employs 2,500 people in various buildings throughout the town. Nationwide don, another 2,000 in Northampton and has a small headquarters in London with about 100 people. Both companies moved to Swindon in the early 1970s when white-collar businesses began leaving London in earnest. Improved communications meant it was possible for service companies to move most so-called 'back-office functions' out of London and save considerably on wage, rent and rates costs . Mr Bernard Simpson, the technology director of Nationwide, says: 'When the company started looking at the options in the early 1970s, Swindon seemed the best bet. It was close to London. There were tremendous communications not just with London but with the rest of the country. There was a supply of labour available from the railways. These workers also had wives who increasingly wanted to work. There were no other significant white-collar employers around at the time. The local authority was extremely welcoming in finding accommodation.' Nationwide has grown strongly over the years. It has just completed a move into new buildings on the outskirts of Swindon and vacated six offices in the town centre. Mr Simpson says: 'We moved because it suited us better to have everyone under one roof. Also, we wanted to avail ourselves of the latest information technology. Swindon has a very good technological environment.' Mr Simpson adds that Swindon remains an ideal location for the company. 'We have always been able to recruit and, more importantly, keep the staff we needed.' The company, Mr Simpson says, has been hit by the recession but only to the extent that it has stopped taking on new staff. The company has not had to lay off people. Allied Dunbar has a similar story to tell. Mr Bob Gill, corporate affairs director, says: 'The founders of Allied Dunbar were with Abbey Life in the early 1970s. They were in a hurry to set up the new company. They came upon Swindon and it seemed ideal. It was convenient. It was close to London. But there was this huge captive labour market. The borough council was very helpful and welcoming.' Allied Dunbar has expanded considerably. In 1975 there were 75 employees. Now there are 2,500 people working for the company in Swindon. Mr Gill says: 'We have never had trouble in finding new staff. We have a good, stable workforce. Turnover is very low.' Mr Gill adds that costs have remained well under control in Swindon. Office rents are also reasonable. Just as with Nationwide, the recession has slowed Allied Dunbar's recruitment rate, but the company has not announced any redundancies. 'We are still doing well. The company made Pounds 121m profit last year,' he says. This compares with Pounds 118m the year before. Looking to the future, Mr Gill says: 'I suppose if there were to be another boom, then we might find it difficult to recruit the people we need. Two years ago shortages were beginning to appear in the local labour market. The town had virtually reached full employment. On the other hand, increasing automation means we would probably not have to take on new people at the same rate as we used to. Anyway, shortage of labour is not a problem that we or Swindon have to worry about at the moment.' With these two big companies firmly established, it is unlikely that Swindon will attract any other large financial services group. Nevertheless, there are nearly 5,000 people employed in financial services which makes this sector an important part of the town's economy.</p>

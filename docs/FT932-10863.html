			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Switzerland (7): Difficult problems being resolved  -Banking and finance THE strength of the Swiss stock market and the Swiss franc in the wake of the negative outcome last December 6 of a referendum on joining the European Economic Area (EEA) has surprised many analysts. It was widely predicted in the run-up to the vote that unless Switzerland joined the EEA, thereby gaining free access to European Community markets, the country's industries would be hurt badly and its economy would weaken. That view may yet turn out to be right, but it will take several months, if not more than a year, for the potential negative impacts of the decision to become apparent. In the meantime, however, Switzerland has recovered a role that a year or so ago it seemed to be irrevocably losing, that of financial safe haven. Until last summer, the leading European currencies were calm within the exchange rate mechanism and the path to monetary union looked clear and relatively smooth. Now not only the monetary but also the political future of the EC is looking uncertain, whereas Switzerland's course is, at least for the medium term, clear. It may not be a brilliant one economically, but it is safe, and it is a truism that investors prefer safety to uncertainty. Thus, money has poured into the country in recent months, helping the banks to improve their recession-damaged profit and loss accounts, and enabling the central bank to drive down interest rates without having to worry about a serious weakening of the franc. Another factor adding to the buoyancy of Finanzplatz Schweiz is the speed with which the financial industry has sorted out some difficult structural problems. In particular, the takeover of the troubled Swiss Volksbank by CS Holding, the group built around Credit Suisse, has resolved a nagging uncertainty about the future of structure of retail banking in the country. Long before the acquisition, it was clear that big changes were necessary in this overcrowded sector. In addition to four universal banks, Switzerland has 28 public sector cantonal banks, nearly 200 regional banks and over 1,100 outlets of the Raiffeisen network of co-operative banks all competing for the small customer's business. In the boom of the late 1980s, banks of all kinds and sizes lent too much money to small businesses and property speculators. When the economy slumped they were hit hard by bad debts and higher costs of refinancing loans. In late 1991, to the shock of the Swiss themselves, one regional bank, Spar und Leihkasse Thun, went bust leaving depositors in the lurch. Since then, safety nets have been strengthened and, to the banking community's relief, 21 regional banks and 27 Raiffeisen closed last year without any depositor losses. But these were relatively minor events compared with the uncertainty over what was happening on the commanding heights of the sector. Was Credit Suisse big enough to compete in retail banking with the other two big banks, Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corporation? And what would become of Volksbank, its capital draining away rapidly to cover bad debts? The takeover of Volksbank by CS solved both issues at once, putting the CS group on a roughly equal footing with the other big banks with a more than adequate national branch network and customer base. As Mr Silvio de Capitani, chairman of the Federal Banking Commission, said last month, 'The important positions are now taken up in the retail banking sector. It is very unlikely, at least in the medium term, that any financial groups not already active in this sector or any foreign competitors will play an important role in this market.' Mr de Capitani did not mean that the sector would become soft and inefficient again. On the contrary - 'we must expect a new intensification of competition among all the banks concerned,' he predicted. 'Structural change will certainly continue, and not only in the regional bank sector. There will be mergers, takeovers and co-operation agreements.' Indeed, but from here on, the pattern is clearer. The mergers and takeovers will be largely among the regional banks, as they grope for a formula that will enable them to counter the economies of scale that the big banks can offer. The cantonal banks are trying to achieve the same end mainly through co-operation agreements. Mergers are largely excluded because each enjoys at least some measure of guarantee from its cantonal government, although a big merger of two Geneva based cantonal banks is due to take place later this year. The cantonal banks have already pooled their efforts in a number of areas, including data processing, pension fund management and credit cards, and other plans are in the works. While many big strategic decisions have been made, it has to be said that the mostly painful implementation process still lies ahead. CS alone is looking to close at least 100 of its combined 400 branches and shed 2,000 jobs. And while the industry welcomed the reduction or elimination of stamp duties and turnover taxes on some securities transactions that came into effect on April 1, leading bankers know they must continue to fight for further legislative and regulatory reform to make the financial centre fully competitive. Stamp duties still apply on more than three quarters of securities transactions. In one category - the purchase by a foreign investor of Swiss shares on a Swiss stock exchange - the duties apply where they did not exist before. The other area where reform is urgent is in investment trust law. Much of this business in recent years has gone to Luxembourg because of excessive restrictions and unfavourable tax treatment in Switzerland. A draft reform has been agreed by interested parties and is expected to be presented to parliament in either September or December. The industry's other priority is rationalising its securities markets. The aim to create a single national stock exchange to replace the three remaining ones in Zurich, Geneva and Basle has been tied to a plan to build an infrastructure for electronic trading and settlement. An initial design for an electronic trading system was abandoned last year after much bickering by member banks about its cost. A more modest one is now being developed with a view to beginning operations in 1995.</p>

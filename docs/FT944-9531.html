			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: Strong sales growth at Toys R Us Strong growth in domestic sales and a fall in tax charges helped Toys R Us, the US toy retailer, report a 26 per cent increase in net profits in its third quarter to October, writes Richard Tomkins. Net income rose to Dollars 47.4m from Dollars 37.5m, but the comparison was flattered by a one-time tax charge of Dollars 5m in last year's third quarter. Without the charge, profits growth would have been 12 per cent. Sales rose 13 per cent to Dollars 1.63bn and operating profits, 15 per cent to Dollars 96m. Earnings per share, boosted by the company's stock repurchase programme, rose from 13 to 17 cents, a gain of 31 per cent.</p>

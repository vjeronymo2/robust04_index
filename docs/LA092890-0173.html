			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY PSYCHIATRIC REPORTS HIGHER NET INCOME  </P> <P> Community Psychiatric Centers Inc., benefiting largely from price increases and  business expansion, on Thursday reported a 16% increase in net income for the  third quarter ended Aug. 31.  </P> <P> The company, the operator of a chain of acute psychiatric hospitals, reported  quarterly net earnings of $19.7 million on revenue of $94.9 million, compared  to net earnings of $16.9 million on sales of $80.3 million in the same quarter  a year ago.  </P> <P> Community Psychiatric's earnings for the first nine months of this fiscal year  were $62.5 million on revenue of $282.28 million, compared to earnings of $55.5  million on revenue of $250.6 million for the same period a year ago.  </P> <P> Richard Conte, senior vice president of Community Psychiatric Centers, said he  believes that the company's adolescent business is on the rebound after  suffering for nine months from adverse national publicity about hard-sell and  abusive marketing in the industry.  </P> <P> He said that is reflected by a slight increase in occupancy levels at the  company's older hospitals in the third quarter, compared to declining  occupancies for the first six months of the fiscal year.  </P> <P> But Conte acknowledged that his company's third-quarter earnings increase was  attributable mostly to the construction and acquisition of additional  hospitals, price increases and corporate measures undertaken to reduce  operating costs.  </P></p>

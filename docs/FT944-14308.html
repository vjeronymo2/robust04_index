			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Management: Accounting for the undeserving rich The minimum wage debate won't go away. It is now so well rehearsed among the politically aware that both the arguments and the best examples are known to all. But now there is a new twist. Prominent left-wing politicians have usurped the old Victorian distinction between the deserving (widows, orphans, the aged) and the undeserving (the feckless, drunkards, scroungers) poor and applied it to those at the other end of the spectrum. We thus have the new concept of the undeserving rich. But precisely who they are and how they are defined is unclear. The Victorians would probably applaud self-made millionaires who, through ability and effort, created wealth for themselves and others. They might have been less charitable to pools winners; but their attitude to inherited wealth was more ambiguous. In the 1970s some people were taxed at 98p in the pound, which seems a clear indication someone thought that people in this income bracket didn't need or deserve any more. But how to decide on this barrier: Pounds 100,000; Pounds 50,000 or even Pounds 30,000? Because it is so easy to adapt, some well-padded people find it inconceivable they could 'exist' on amounts others think is a fortune. As the late Duchess of Windsor said: 'One can never be too thin or too rich.' I have recently spotted an important gap in the market. There is an ever-growing collection of anthologies covering every sort of poetry: the Oxford Book of Comic Verse, Christian Verse and Garden Verse. But nowhere can I find the Book of Management Poems. Has none been written? Are managers passionless or simply too busy? Perhaps the experience of managing and being managed is so mundane and commonplace that all poetry is management poetry. But there is joy, elation, fury and disappointment at every turn in the world of work. Alas, try looking up job, employment, work or manager in the appendix or topic index of a great general book on poetry and you're not likely to find much. Whilst there are many poems whose reflections and ruminations on the human condition are extremely apposite for managers, none appears to dwell on the agony or ecstasy of management. Why have we no 'Elegy on an Executive Washroom'; 'Ode to a Senior Executive' or even 'Lines on a Favourable Flipchart'? One of the great charms of poetry is that certain memorable lines are frequently quoted (and misquoted). Would a sonnet in iambic pentameter be too much for the businessman? Or perhaps the limerick or the clerihew are more the sort of thing the corporate culture might ordain. Managers, like parents, realise that you need both carrot and stick to motivate and persuade. The promise of reward and the threat of punishment are powerful weapons in the armoury of the average manager who needs to discipline and encourage. Some managers don't believe in punishment, preferring only to withdraw reward when displeased. Others, from 'the school of hard knocks', believe that birching - whether psychological, monetary or physical - never did anyone any harm. But researchers in London using pharmacological and brain lesion work, as well as personality tests, have found impressive evidence of two quite different brain systems. One means that certain people are highly sensitive to cues of reward and are disposed towards them. The other means that people are especially responsive to punishment cues and experience great anxiety in situations where there is impending or possible punishment. Thus some people will do anything for reward and ignore the risk of failure, while others are cautious and will do anything to avoid punishment. Are marketing people differentially sensitive to reward and accountants differentially sensitive to punishment? Marketing managers' offices are often festooned with awards and prizes. This seems to contrast starkly with the minimalism of accountants whose offices lack all adornment. Maybe it is true that extroverted, hail-fellow-well-met marketeers can best be managed by lots of reward. Equally, the threat of public humiliation alone may be enough to deter the introverted, cautious accountants from misbehaving and cause them to work very hard. But the message is clear - threats, even the enforcement of punishment, may be quite ineffective for some employees, while the promise of small, even significant, rewards may be quite unappealing for others. The trick, of course, is knowing which type of person is which. The author is head of the Business Psychology Unit at University College London.</p>

			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Nigerian police arrest leader of striking oil workers' union Nigerian police yesterday arrested the sacked leader of a striking oil workers union, the latest detention in a crackdown on opponents of the military government, Reuter reports from Lagos. Mr Frank Kokori, former general secretary of the Nupeng trade union, has been a powerful force behind the six-week strike aimed at forcing the military to hand over power to presidential claimant Chief Moshood Abiola, who is now on trial for treason. A colleague, Mr Wariebi Agamene, the sacked president of the union, said Kokori was arrested in the early hours of the morning. Kokori and Agamene were dismissed by military ruler General Sani Abacha on Wednesday along with leaders of another oil union and the umbrella labour federation. Nearly a dozen people were arrested nationwide in a swoop on Friday but many others were later released. Among those still detained are Anthony Enahoro, vice chairman of the National Democratic Coalition (Nadeco), a 71-year-old politician who was in the forefront of push for independence from Britain in the 1950s. Others are Mr Cornelius Adebayo, a former deputy state governor, a Nadeco leader and two aides of Chief Abiola - his spokesman Mr Fred Eno and Mr Ademola Adeniji-Adele. In an effort to break the strike, the government has asked retired oil workers to register at their local job centres with a view to being re-engaged.</p>

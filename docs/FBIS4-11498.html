			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Gladys Bernal Barzola; all quotation marks as </F> published]    [Text] Puno, 15 Apr -- President Fujimori expressed here  his firm opposition to criticism of the human rights situation  in Peru. He asserted that the government will not tolerate any  interference "under the facade of the defense of human rights"  in the measures that have led to the achievement of peace in  Peru.    Speaking about his administration, Fujimori stressed that he  will not revise any of the trials of terrorists who killed  dozens of innocent Peruvians. He said: "Those who perpetrated  these killings were tried in compliance with the emergency laws  promulgated after 5 April 1992."    Fujimori on 15 April dedicated the second stage of the  Yanamayo penitentiary, a maximum-security prison. In his speech,  the president stated that in honor of the thousands who were  killed and the hundreds of thousands of orphans, Peruvians have  the moral duty of never forgetting this horrible tragedy. In  view of this, he asserted that although the laws will be  readjusted as peace is achieved, he will not yield an inch  regarding antiterrorist issues. Fujimori said we will not allow  Peruvians to again experience the violence of the 1980's.    Also present at the ceremony were Justice Minister Fernando  Vega Santa Gadea, Interior Minister Juan Briones Davila, Energy  Minister Daniel Hokama, and Chief Justice Luis Serpa Segura and  other Supreme Court members.    President Fujimori insisted Peru enjoys a promising future  today in view of the peace that has been achieved. Speaking to  journalists from Argentina, France, and Spain and  representatives from some international news agencies, Fujimori  warned he is not being patronizing when he said Peru has  achieved an unprecedented deed. He stated: "International  experiences on terrorism have shown that Peruvians have defeated  this scourge in a short period and at a minimal social cost."    Also present at the ceremony were 10 inmates facing  terrorist  charges, two of whom were serving 20-year prison sentences.    President Fujimori stated: Before, certain countries  recommended not travelling to Peru but that today an  ever-increasing number of delegations are arriving to assess  which antiterrorist measures have been adopted by the sovereign  government of Peru. He said: "People compare the French, German,  and Italian legislation to our own and they say that some  principles are violated in Peru, but they forget to mention that  the situation in those countries is completely different from  ours."    He said it was incoherent for some to try to make  suggestions  when "they left us to our fate" during 12 years of subversive  violence. Fujimori said: "No government-run or private human  rights organization or international organizations ever reported  at the proper time the human rights violations committed by  Shining Path [SL] or Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement  terrorists.    He harshly criticized the fact that the SL was allowed to  make propaganda in Europe and America during those past 12  years, when in truth what they were doing was collecting funds  to finance guerrilla activities in Peru. Without mentioning any  organizations, Fujimori commented that some people have even  drafted reports assessing and then disqualifying his  administration's judicial and prison system. Fujimori said:  "They have no right because a reform of the Civil and Penal Code  that took experts on the Peruvian situation years to draft  cannot be assessed in three or 10 days."    The chief of state admitted the existence of isolated cases  of human rights violations and corrupt government officials.  "But this is the case in every country of the world, including  the most developed ones, but the institutions, as such, have  revealed a high degree of professionalism, high moral standards,  and respect for the law. He then added that the soldiers and  policemen in charge of guarding the Yanamayo prison will  safeguard the inmates' safety in an honest manner. He  emphasized: "The change that has taken place is that they will  not allow anyone to corrupt them."    The prison's second phase -- considered the most secure in  the country -- was built in nine months and is divided into five  wings with almost 300 inmates. The building, which has 80  individual cells and 108 cells for two inmates, cost 4.7 billion  Peruvian soles. A total of 260 terrorists are lodged in the  area built first.    The chief of state visited this part of the prison  accompanied by foreign journalists. SL leaders Maritza Garrido  Lecca, Osman Morote, Martha Huatay, and other high-ranking  terrorist leaders are in this part of the prison. It was  learned that the aforementioned made some requests to Fujimori.  During his visit, the chief of state also went to a children's  home where he made some donations.</p>

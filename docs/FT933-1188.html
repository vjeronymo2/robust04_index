			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (34): Rapidly growing richer - Vietnam / Victor Mallet examines hopes of another economic miracle in the making VIETNAM is still one of the poorest countries in the world, but it is rapidly becoming richer. In the imagination of investors, if not yet in reality, this country with an annual gross national product of only about Dollars 200 per person is poised to join the ranks of south-east Asia's miracle economies. Since 1986, the communist government has pursued an economic reform policy known as doi moi, or renovation. The reforms have been accelerated by the collapse of Vietnam's erstwhile ally the Soviet Union and by a surge of foreign investment from Asian and European companies. The results are spectacular. Price liberalisation and land reform allowing farmers effective ownership of their fields have boosted agricultural output and made Vietnam the world's third largest rice exporter, after the US and Thailand. The capital Hanoi, once an elegant but glum northern city of crumbling French villas and wide boulevards, becomes busier and noisier by the month; Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon), already Vietnam's principal commercial and industrial centre, is booming. Last year real economic growth in Vietnam exceeded eight per cent, and in 1993 the figure is likely to be around 7.5 per cent. Industrial production and exports continued to rise in the first half of this year. The dong, the Vietnamese currency, has meanwhile remained stable against the dollar and inflation has fallen. Until recently the main obstacle to further economic progress was - in the eyes of the Vietnamese government and foreign donors - the US refusal to countenance assistance to Vietnam from the international financial institutions such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Asian Development Bank. Vietnam's transport and communications infrastructure is in desperate need of repair and expansion. For market-oriented industrialisation to succeed, the country and its foreign backers will have to spend billions of dollars on everything from ports and airports to telephones and power stations. The Clinton administration finally yielded to pressure from other IMF lenders and withdrew its objections to multilateral aid for Vietnam in July. This should allow the 'Friends of Vietnam', led by Japan and France, to pay off Vietnam's IMF arrears of some Dollars 140m through a combination of bridging finance and bilateral aid. A recent meeting of the support group in Paris was unable to agree on how much of the arrears should be met by the bridging loan (which would be quickly repaid by funds from the first, short-term IMF programme for Vietnam) and how much by the donors, but the participants are due to meet again at the time of this month's IMF/World Bank conference. Multilateral and bilateral donors are then expected to meet in Paris on November 9 and 10 for a pledging session for Vietnam - the country's first - which could raise Dollars 1.2bn to Dollars 1.5bn. Vietnam's difficult transition from a communist command economy to free enterprise is greatly assisted by its existing oil industry (which accounts for two thirds of exports). At the same time the country's promise as a future Asian economic 'tiger' is enhanced by the well-deserved reputation of its people as hard-working and literate. It was perhaps, inevitable that a reaction would set in among investors as they began to realise that Vietnam had a long way to go before its reached the level of say, Thailand or Malaysia. 'It's a little too easy to get too excited about Vietnam's prospects,' says Mr Bradley Babson, the Bangkok-based regional World Bank chief. 'It's not going to be a piece of cake and I think we should be quite up front about that.' Wages are attractively low for businesses but Vietnam does not have the capacity - in terms of officials, local entrepreneurs or physical infrastructure - to absorb immediately all of the capital that foreigners want to invest. The US economic embargo which remains in place - President Clinton eased it on September 13 to allow US companies to compete for projects funded by the World Bank and the ADB - is of more concern to frustrated US companies than to the Vietnamese, who are struggling to absorb investment capital from other sources as far apart as Taiwan and France. Vietnam has licensed more than Dollars 6bn worth of foreign investment projects so far, but only a quarter of this amount has actually been committed by the investors. Privatisation is moving much more slowly than expected, and Vietnam is encountering problems with its state industries which are typical of the former Soviet block. According to the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the number of state enterprises has been reduced by mergers and liquidations in the last 18 months to 7,000 from 12,000, but economists say only a quarter to a third of state enterprises are profitable. Many of the rest are so run-down that no-one wants to buy them. Unemployment is one of the government's biggest concerns. Private Vietnamese companies have emerged since the government relaxed its grip on the economy, but most of them are tiny businesses involved in the retail trade and other services rather than manufacturing. Large projects, whether they are wholly Vietnamese or joint ventures with foreign partners, still tend to be the preserve of state or semi-state organisations; the army, for example, owns one of the best-known hotels in Hanoi, and the city's new fleet of metered taxis comes under the control of the city's communist people's committee. Corruption, as the government has acknowledged, is becoming increasingly widespread as wealth increases. Foreign donors and reformist Vietnamese officials say two of the most urgent priorities to ensure continued economic growth are the establishment of commercial laws - to cover bankruptcy procedures and contractual obligations, for example - and the deve-lopment of a strong financial sector.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               VIETNAM: PRINCIPAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                    1990   1991   1992   1993*   1994*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Gross domestic product (% change)   5.1    6.0    8.3    7.5     8.2 Agriculture                         1.5    2.2    6.3    3.6     3.8 Industry                            2.8    8.8   10.9   11.5    12.4 Services                           10.3    8.3    8.6    8.8     9.7 Gross domestic investment  (% of GDP)                        11.5   11.6   12.0   12.7    13.5 Inflation rate** (% change  in CPI)                           67.5   67.6   17.5   14.0    12.0 Merchandise exports  (Dollars bn)                       2.4    2.0    2.5    3.0     3.7 % change                           23.5  -18.0   25.6   22.2    22.0 Merchandise imports  (Dollars bn)                       2.8    2.2    2.5    3.1     4.0 % change                            7.3  -20.2   14.1   24.7    28.0 Current account balance  (Dollars m)                     -200.0  -82.9  212.6  170.0    10.5 % of GDP                           -3.6   -1.3    2.3    1.5     0.1 External Debt (Dollars bn)         14.6   15.3   15.4   16.8    17.5 Debt service ratio (% of exports)   5.5    5.6    7.5    8.0     8.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Estimates; ** Refers to year-on-year data  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: ADB and General Statistical office, Vietnam  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

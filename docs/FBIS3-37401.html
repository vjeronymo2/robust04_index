			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>   [Text] Premier Vyacheslav Kebich has abolished the State  Secretariat for Struggle with Crime and for National Security by  his ordinance.    According to governmental sources, a department for  coordination of administrative bodies' activities was  established instead of the former state secretariat. The newly  established department is led by Belarussian People's Deputy,  former First Deputy State Secretary Valeriy Pavlov.    At the same time, Kebich introduced a new post in the  Cabinet  of Ministers -- the State Secretary for National Security, the  rank of who in the official hierarchy is close to an envoy.  Former State Secretary, Gennadiy Danilov, (who is considered  by observers in Minsk as one of the most influential people in  the circles close to the premier) was appointed to this post.    Among the new secretary's duties there is coordination of  activities carried out by all law enforcement structures and by  the army and aimed at combating the crime. According to  governmental sources, Kebich demanded that Danilov urgently work  out "a national program on very strict measures for struggle  with this evil."    According to the results of the recently held public opinion  poll published by the government's press service on Wednesday,  as many as 32.7 percent of respondents believe that the crisis  in the republic could be overcome through strengthening of the  struggle with mafia and corruption.    Answering to the question who could withdraw the country  from  the crisis, a total of 10.3 percent of respondents called  Kebich; 6.8 percent Head of the temporary parliamentary  commission on struggle with corruption, Aleksandr Lukashenko;  4.2 percent Mechyslaw Hryb; 3.4 percent Leader of the Belarusian  People's Front, Zyanon Paznyak and 0.8 percent of respondents  put their confidence in the parliament's former Speaker,  Stanislav Shushkevich.    The rest of the respondents said there was no such leader in  the republic or found it hard to give a definite answer.</p>

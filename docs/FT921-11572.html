			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Hungary short-lists toll motorway tenders FRENCH, Italian and Spanish companies are heading five international consortia which have been short-listed to submit bids to build and operate one of the first privately-financed toll motorways in eastern Europe. The road, which will connect Budapest, the Hungarian capital, to the Austrian and Czechoslovak borders, is expected to cost about Pounds 200m after allowing for interest charges and inflation. A short-list of pre-qualifying bids was published this week by the Hungarian Ministry of Transport, Communication and Water Management. Leaders of the five consortia are BAMEST of Italy, HASA of Spain, and GTM Grands Travaux de Marseille, Transroute International, and Bouygues all of France. There are no British companies in the consortia which include Austrian, Finnish, Swedish and Danish construction groups. Britain has little experience of operating privately financed toll roads, while many of the large continental European toll road operators, notably in France and Italy, are either state-owned or have the support of their domestic governments. Hungary last year announced a Forints 320bn (Pounds 2.3bn) road construction programme, about half of which is planned as new motorways. It is hoped that private finance will be raised internationally to build much of the new motorway system which is needed to support the economic development of the country. The first toll motorway will involve a 43km extension to the Austrian border of the two-lane dual carriageway which connects Budapest with the city of Gyor. The road would provide the last section of a 260km Vienna/Budapest motorway. A 15km spur to Bratislava, on the Czechoslovakian border, would also be built under the private sector plan. The Czechoslovakian government has proposed a similar programme of privately financed toll motorways to open up its domestic markets and encourage development. The Hungarian authorities, which are being advised by Morgan Grenfell, the British merchant bank, have told the five consortia that charges initially should take account of the country's current economic situation. It recommends that tolls should be about half the level of those charged on west European roads. The concession to operate the motorway would run for a minimum of 15 years or longer, depending upon the nature of the bid. The government plans to award the concession by the end of this year, allowing construction to start by next spring. The motorway is expected to be completed by the summer of 1995.</p>

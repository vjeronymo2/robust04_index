			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lome, Feb 21 (AFP) -- Togo's pro-democracy  opposition claimed Monday [21 February] it had won an absolute  parliamentary majority following the country's first multi-party  elections challenging President Gnassingbe Eyadema's monopoly on  power.    Yao Agboyibo, the leader of the Action Committee for Renewal  [CAR], the main opposition party, told reporters that his party  and its allies had obtained an absolute majority having won 41  seats in the 81-member legislature.    Agboyibo said that the results from 79 constituencies were  already known, although the official National Election  Commission had not yet issued any results from the second round  poll held on Sunday.    Earlier Eyadema's ruling Togolese People's Rally (RPT),  which  has helped the military strongman maintain his monopoly grip on  power since 1967, made charges of "massive fraud" by the  opposition.    In a statement, the RPT called for legal action against  "certain political leaders," who it alleged had tried to "upset  the vote by defamation, violence and fraud."    Twenty-four parliamentary seats were at stake in the run-off  round of the elections, with the opposition sure of taking 12  seats and well placed in seven other constituencies.    Outbreaks of violence occurred in three of the 11  constituencies where opposition candidates were directly up  against supporters of General Eyadema, who has ruled Togo for 27  years.    Under the terms of the constitution, the victory of the  opposition, if confirmed, obliges Eyadema to name a prime  minister from the ranks of the new majority parties.    Asked whether he would become the next premier, Agboyibo  refused to rule it out but said he would beforehand call a  "round table" meeting of all political parties and  social/professional groups to get their assent to the  government's policies.    The "round table" would also announce a "general armistice  covering the opposition and people in power, including the  military."    The armistice would allow the return of civilian refugees  and  soldiers estimated to number around 50,000 people, Agboyibo said.    The opposition leader added that his becoming prime minister  would depend upon Eyadema accepting his government's programme.    "Cohabiting with Eyadema is the problem. We'll have to  negotiate the cohabitation," he said.    The Constitution demands that the government, responsible to  the National Assembly, should "lead and determine national  policy".    The head of state signs decrees and orders and promulgates  laws. He can dissolve parliament but not during the 12 months  following an election.    "Our chief concern is to create a climate of social peace,"  said Agboyibo, adding that he wanted "to see the head of state  less involved in public affairs".    Since Eyadema took power in 1967, he and his followers in  the  RPT have maintained an unbroken absolute rule except for during  the first few months of the transition period started in August  1991.    Agboyibo admitted fears for his security. "There have been  death threats against me and my deputies," he said, without  providing any details.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- Japan resumed Monday [16  May] accepting trade insurance coverage for Bulgaria, the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) said.    As a first step, the government will establish a credit line  of 200 million dollars for the east European country on  condition that the country smoothly repays outstanding external  debts in line with rescheduling accords in the latest meeting of  the Paris Club of western creditor nations, MITI said.    The restart of Bulgaria-bound trade insurance coverage came  after Japan's assessment of the recent economic developments in  the country, including its accord with the International  Monetary Fund on economic reforms, MITI said.    Japan had suspended accepting trade insurance for Bulgaria  after the country froze external debt repayments in March 1990.    The Paris Club in its April meeting agreed on a 10-year  rescheduling for part of Bulgaria's official debts totaling an  estimated 4 billion to 5 billion dollars, including a grace  period of six years.</p>

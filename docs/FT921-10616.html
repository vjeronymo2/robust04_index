			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Mitterrand tries to end row THE French government will call a special session of parliament on Friday to debate the Habash affair, President Francois Mitterrand said last night. He made the announcement in an unscheduled television interview, in an attempt to put an end to the political storm of protest precipitated by the hospitalisation in Paris last week of the Palestinian leader, Mr George Habash. 'There is no longer a Habash affair,' he said. He insisted it had never been serious or dramatic, but merely an error of political judgment on the part of the senior officials who authorised the admission of Mr Habash. President Mitterrand said that Friday's debate would be preceded by a government policy declaration, and concluded with a government confidence motion. If the motion were defeated, or an opposition censure motion passed, he indicated, the national assembly would be dissolved and early elections held. He ruled out the resignation of any government ministers, or a more general reshuffle of the government of Mrs Edith Cresson, in response to the Habash affair. He said if he had ever contemplated a government reshuffle, he certainly would not carry it out now. He also announced that US President George Bush had agreed to a meeting of the powers with nuclear weapons in Europe to discuss the security of nuclear systems in the former Soviet Union.</p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / UK Company News: MAI lifts holding in SIS to 17.5% MAI, the broadcasting and moneybroking group headed by Lord Hollick, is increasing its stake in Satellite Information Services, which provides a television-based racing service to betting shops, from 7 per cent to 17.5 per cent. The shares come from Sears, the Selfridges retailing group, which is selling its entire 12.7 per cent stake for Pounds 9.9m. MAI is paying Pounds 8.1m for 10.5 per cent and Racal Electronics is buying the remainder, increasing its stake to 22.2 per cent. MAI, which controls Meridian Broadcasting and Anglia Television, said the move was a natural extension of its television interests. 'With the proliferation of television channels there will definitely be a sports channel at some stage, perhaps even a racing channel.' SIS dominates the coverage of UK racing, producing between five and 12 hours of live television a day. SIS was formed in 1986 by the then big four book-makers, Coral, Ladbroke, Mecca and William Hill (then owned by Sears), for which it has been a very successful investment. Set up with Pounds 10m of equity, SIS paid out a special divi-dend of Pounds 55m last year and is now valued at over Pounds 77m on the basis of the Sears sale. William Hill, now owned by Brent Walker, the heavily indebted property and leisure group, has a 15 per cent stake worth Pounds 11.7m. Sears, which will make a profit on disposal of about Pounds 9.8m, said the sale was in line with its strategy of selling off its non-retail interests.</p>

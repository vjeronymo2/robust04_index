			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Kantor voices fears on US-EC farm deal MR Mickey Kantor, nominee for US trade representative in the Clinton administration, yesterday expressed 'concern' about the US-EC agreement over farm trade, sealed by his predecessor in an effort to push the Uruguay Round to a conclusion. Just a few minutes into his nomination hearing before the Senate finance committee the California lawyer swept away concerns about his inexperience in trade matters by politely correcting one senator on the details of the US-EC farm trade deal. 'The devil is in the details,' he said. 'I think it has to be looked at closely.' Less than three hours later the finance committee approved Mr Kantor's appointment, sending it on to the Senate for a full vote. Mr Kantor said he hoped to be at work by tomorrow morning. That was after he threw a new thunderbolt at the EC, insisting 'the US must respond to the new utilities directive that went into effect on January 1'. The local content requirements and preference given to local suppliers in government procurement was 'a serious matter'. Mr Kantor, a longtime Clinton friend, spoke with ease across the range of issues he would have to deal with. He declined to commit himself on many points, including the need to extend fast-track negotiating, hinting he might consider working for a less ambitious package of reforms than the one long stalled in the Uruguay Round. He defined himself as 'a realistic person,' who would not simply assume other countries supported the concept of free trade when the facts indicated otherwise. Perhaps without meaning to, Mr Kantor sent a subtle message of change in US trade policy. When it has to act, the Clinton administration will be more concerned with the reaction of the US voters than of its trading partners. He promised to support a renewal of the controversial Super 301 provision, which requires the US trade representative to single out countries with excessive trade barriers for negotiation and perhaps retaliation. 'The days when we could afford to subordinate our economic interests to foreign or defence concerns are long past,' he said. However, he added: 'No amount of negotiating, bilaterally or multilaterally, can overcome or offset the burdens placed on US companies from misguided economic policies or uncontrolled health care costs. Nor are trade negotiations a substitute for educating our children or training our workers.' A 'coherent US economic strategy' will be co-ordinated within the new national economic policy. As trade representative, he will be the administration spokesman on trade, and its negotiator. 'I will be the leader in that area,' he said, emphasising: 'I will have direct access to the president.'</p>

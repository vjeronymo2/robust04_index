			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Falling trade deficit eases fears of early rate rise Hopes grew yesterday that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, would hold back from an early rise in interest rates. A marked narrowing in Britain's visible trade deficit in June and an apparent slowdown in retail sales last month pointed to continued non-inflationary growth. The Central Statistical Office reported a lower-than-expected deficit of Pounds 690m on Britain's trade with the rest of the world in June, while the Confederation of British Industry's distributive trades survey suggested that retail sales in August were only slightly up on a year ago. Together with recent indications of slower monetary growth and credit demand, yesterday's economic news reinforced the impression that last year's two tax-raising Budgets have rebalanced the economy so that growth is now based more on exports and investment than consumption. If so, the UK recovery, now more than two years old, could be entering a more mature phase without threatening to push inflation higher or trigger a balance of payments crisis. While the trade figures had little impact on financial markets, the CBI survey prompted prices of government gilt-edged stock to move higher as the City reasoned that a rise in bank base rates from 5.25 per cent was less likely. 'This survey should effectively put the kibosh on speculation of an imminent rate hike,' said Mr Don Smith, an economist with Midland Global Markets. His hopes were echoed by Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, speaking at the annual dinner of the Scottish CBI in Glasgow last night. 'We needed a recovery based more on production, investment and exports than on consumption. So a modest slowdown on the high street is no cause for alarm,' Mr Davies said. 'Indeed, I hope the main effect is to persuade Eddie George (the governor of the Bank of England) to hold off his interest rate rise for some time yet.' Mr Davies also took a swipe at MPs who wanted to undermine the government's programme to reduce the budget deficit through tax cuts 'for short-term political reasons'. Pressure for such tax cuts 'has to be resisted', he said. Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, told the Scottish CBI that Britain now had 'one of the most favourable combinations of economic circumstances' for 40 years and the government was determined to keep it that way. He warned of tough public spending decisions ahead and urged industry to keep wage costs firmly under control. According to Mr Michael Saunders, economist at Salomon Brothers in London, Britain's mix of low pound, ample spare capacity and tight fiscal policy 'is pretty close to the text book recipe for a country with a persistent balance of payments deficit, and it seems to be working'.

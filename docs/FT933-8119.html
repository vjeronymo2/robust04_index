			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Brussels to probe potash merger THE European Commission has started a detailed inquiry into the planned merger of two potash producers in west and east Germany, which it fears might create a monopoly. The proposed merger is between the potash and rock salt business of Kali + Salz, a subsidiary of BASF, and Mitteldeutschen Kali, an east German producer being privatised by the Treuhand agency. After a month-long investigation, the Commission has concluded that 'the merging companies will have an extremely high combined market share or even enjoy a monopoly with regard to the supply of potash products in Germany'. The Treuhand, however, said the merger would reduce annual potash capacity in Germany from more than 4m metric tonnes to 3.1m tonnes, and make the industry more competitive. 'The aim of the merger is to secure as many jobs as possible, as well as investments for the potash industry in eastern Germany, and at the same time reduce capacity,' a Treuhand spokesman said. Brussels now has four months to decide whether to let the merger through, under vetting powers granted nearly three years ago. Since then, it has blocked only one of 165 cases - the planned Franco-Italian takeover in 1991 of the Canadian aircraft-maker de Havilland. But 11 cases have reached the 'in-depth investigation' stage now opening for the German potash alliance. In seven instances, the companies involved have been forced to alter the terms of their proposed merger, usually by divesting assets, ending capital or contractual links between competitors, and the cancellation of exclusive distribution arrangements. One Commission official suggested yesterday that the terms of the Kali + Salz/MdK merger might also have to be altered to win approval. The Commission is also examining in parallel whether to authorise around DM1bn (Pounds 400m) in state aids provided through the Treuhand to cement the alliance, although it has generally treated state aid for the restructuring of east German industry indulgently.</p>

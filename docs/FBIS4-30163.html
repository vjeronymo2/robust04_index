			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 24 (KCNA) -- The Institute of  International Affairs of the DPRK issued Thursday a memorandum  making public concrete facts about Japan's direct involvement in  the last Korean war.    The memorandum was published at a time when the revived  Japanese militarists are trying to take a military action  against the Korean people, gravely jeopardizing peace and  security in the Korean peninsula and the rest of Asia.    The lengthy memorandum under the title "Japan was directly  involved in the war of aggression against Korea" says Japan  together with the United States prepared the war of aggression  against Korea and served as a logistic base, supply base, repair  base and attack base for the U.S. Forces during the Korean war  and directly involved itself in germ warfare.    "The Japanese militarists directly participated in the war  of  aggression in Korea started by the U.S. imperialists in the  1950s and committed a hostile military action against the Korean  people, but this fact has remained a secret," the memorandum  says, adding: "This is why we are opening the materials to the  public."    Recalling that Japan participated in the U.S.-imposed Korean  war in violation of international laws and its "peaceful"  constitution and inflicted immeasurable misfortunes and  sufferings on the Korean people, the memorandum warns: "If the  Japanese reactionaries expect `a shower of gold' again in `a  second Korean war', it is a big mistake."</p>

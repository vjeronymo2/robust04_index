			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Failures in auditing 'widespread': Profession reports lapses to DTI Many accountants are failing to meet professional standards when carrying out audits, says a confidential report sent to the government by chartered accountancy bodies. Nearly two-thirds of firms inspected in the year to last September were the subject of detailed regulatory reports triggered by concerns over issues such as the quality of auditing or compliance with regulations. The report, which has been obtained by the FT, covers the second year of the regime of self-regulation for auditors. It was recently sent to the Department of Trade and Industry and its findings are due to be made public soon. It interprets most of the breaches as relatively minor and applicable primarily to smaller firms, but the figures raise serious questions about the quality of auditing conducted by the 10,600 firms registered. The report says many firms have failed to provide evidence of the work they have carried out, or have not established procedures designed to assure the quality of their auditing. It describes inspections to 312 firms by the Joint Monitoring Unit, which is controlled by the three chartered accountancy bodies covering England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. So far 263 of these visits have been written up in completed reports to the profession's regulatory committees, of which 197 are in 'long form'  - normally meaning that the firms need to take remedial action. The most common problems identified were with firms' audit procedures, performance of individual assignments, quality assurance procedures and independence. Most of these issues applied to smaller firms and those without listed clients. For the larger firms, the inspectors concluded that most problems were human failures rather than deficiencies in systems and procedures. The report concludes: 'While it is clear that the majority of registered auditors aretaking the need to comply with the regulations seriously, it is also clear thatmany firms have not reached the standard of work envisaged by current auditing standards and guidelines.' It stresses that the problems identified havenot 'necessarily' affected the audit opinion, and that in most cases non-compliance 'would not' have resulted in any interested party suffering loss. Across mainland Britain since October 1991, 111 firms have had their audit registration withdrawn or revoked, 15 have been refused registration, 19 are subject to restrictions on auditing and 1,904 have voluntary withdrawn applications to be registered. The report shows that complaints against auditors in England and Wales rose to 268 in the year to last September, up from 175 in the previous year. Total regulatory costs for 1993 were Pounds 4.2m, and are projected at Pounds 4.7m for 1994. Just 147 firms audit all 2,300 listed companies in the UK, and 18firms audit 2,044 of these. The report, which will form the basis for a review by the DTI of the effectiveness of self-regulation, suggests concentrating future inspections on the issues identified as causing the greatest problems.</p>

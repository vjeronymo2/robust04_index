			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / International Company News: Decision on Corange board battle delayed A decision over the future composition of the Corange board has been put off until May 20 after Mr Curt Engelhorn, the company's biggest shareholder, was unable to attend a special general meeting in Bermuda. Corange, the Bermuda-based pharmaceutical group, is the parent company of Boehringer Mannheim, one of Germany's largest healthcare companies. The board is attempting to eject Mr Engelhorn, who speaks for 42 per cent of the shares, as chairman of the supervisory board of Mannheim. Corange's board yesterday issued a statement calling on Mr Engelhorn to give his full support to its chief executive, Mr Max Link. But Mr Engelhorn, who has called on Mr Link to resign, was yesterday backed by Mr Franz Kuehner, head of the German Workers' Council and a member of Mannheim's supervisory board. Mr Kuehner denounced the statement from the Corange board and warned that employees could no longer work for the new chief executive. He also turned down the opportunity of taking part in any mediation with Mr Link, although he said he was prepared to speak with Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the temporary chairman of Corange and former president of the Bundesbank.</p>

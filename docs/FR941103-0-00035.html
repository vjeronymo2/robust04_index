			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A second implication of the fairness principle is that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic harm that could be created during a period of transition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from one pricing approach to another should be mitigated to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extent practicable. Solutions to any transition problems arising  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from pricing reform should balance fairness considerations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with any reform against the potential efficiency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improvements, and should mitigate the hardships arising from any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reform. The major purpose of transmission pricing reform should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to provide more efficient price signals, particularly for new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transmission uses, and not simply to reallocate sunk costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Transmission Pricing Should Be Practical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Transmission pricing should be practical and as easy to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administer as appropriate given the other pricing principles. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> user should be able to calculate how much it will be charged for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transmission service. Some pricing proposals may be so complex  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that they are difficult to understand and analyze. Such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complexity, while not fatal, should be balanced by efficiency gains  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or other advantages produced by such complexity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Guidance Regarding Pricing Proposals That Conform to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Traditional Revenue Requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to the five general principles above, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission provides guidance on specific pricing proposals,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including examples of acceptable pricing approaches and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clarification of limitations on pricing flexibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is important for those involved in transmission pricing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussions and negotiations to have a common understanding of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attributes of various pricing proposals. For example, various  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parties advocate the use of ``megawatt mile'' pricing. Several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distinct pricing proposals carry the same ``megawatt mile'' label.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, those proposing transmission pricing reform must provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a clear explanation of their proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As the industry considers possible pricing reform, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following three attributes of any transmission pricing method  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be specified to provide a common framework for analysis:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The method for measuring cost for purposes of rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design: embedded cost, incremental cost, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission's current ``or'' policy, long-run marginal cost,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or short-run marginal cost;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The method for treating power flows: contract path or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flow-based approach; and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The method for grouping transmission facilities:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corporate postage stamp versus more disaggregated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approaches, such as zones, or line-by-line methods. <FOOTCITE>30</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 30 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Under a line-by-line pricing method, the costs of each transmission line, or segment, are allocated to individual transmission transactions, based on the usage each transaction makes of each line or segment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We anticipate that a wide variety of pricing proposals may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reconciled with the traditional revenue requirement. In theory,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptable cost-based pricing that satisfies our principles could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be designed for many combinations of these possible attributes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, prices could reflect incremental cost (the first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attribute), be based on flow (the second attribute), and be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocated on a line-by-line basis (the third attribute). A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different approach is taken by changing any one of the attributes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  zones instead of lines. Therefore, many varieties of cost-based pricing are possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We fully intend to be flexible and to consider innovative,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conforming pricing approaches that accommodate the changing needs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the competitive bulk power market. This applies to pricing for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> firm as well as non-firm transmission services. The pricing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principles set out in the prior section are intended to guide RTGs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and individual utilities in their consideration of new approaches.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To provide further guidance, we discuss below examples of new cost-based pricing methods that we believe can be made consistent with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> our principles. These examples are intended to be illustrative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other approaches also may be consistent with the principles. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all cases, we emphasize that pricing reform must have a purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with the principles. We want transmission pricing that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supports good and consistent decisionmaking by transmission system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> users and owners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

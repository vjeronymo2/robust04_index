			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Tallinn Radio Tallinn Network in  Estonian at 1000 GMT on 15 March broadcasts a 5.-minute report  on a meeting of pensioners in Tallinn today, near the parliament  and government building on Toompea Square. The unidentified  correspondent notes that Marju Lauristin, the minister of social  affairs, was surrounded by pensioners eager to voice their  grievances and she promised to convey their problems to the  government, which is scheduled to meet this morning.    The correspondent then interviews Lauristin who says that  the  pensions issue is a priority for the government but extra money  is hard to find. "What we have done now," she explains, "is to  provide compensation totalling 200 million kroons for domestic  bills and there is a law on increasing pensions being debated  now -- another 200 millions are needed for that. To the  population at large this will seem like a crumb to a beggar.  And public discontent is particularly bolstered by the fact  that incomes have become so different and these differences in  wages and incomes can be as much as 20 or 30 times."</p>

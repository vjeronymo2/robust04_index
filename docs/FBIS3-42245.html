This formation hid behind a "front"--a private legal  practice  called Partner LTD, which was supposedly intended to give legal  assistance to the population regarding the privatization of  state property.    In fact a well organized, cohesive gang was set up complete  with its own operations administration, security service,  special department, and skillfully camouflaged bases in  neighboring woods, where they stored arms and munitions,  interrogated citizens with the use of physical violence, worked  out kidnapping plans, and trained gang members in the use of  guns and knives and in unarmed combat.    The general director of Partner LTD, who styled himself the  "savior of Siberia" and his gang the "Movement for the Recovery  of the Siberian Nation," committed with his partners in crime  the murder of two entrepreneurs in the city of Shelekhov,  Irkutsk Oblast, and was preparing to commit other acts of terror.    The uninvited "savior of Siberia" and 13 members of his gang  were arrested as a a result of measures taken by investigations  operatives. All have had charges pressed against them. Another  three gunmen are being sought.    During the operation to eliminate the gang 4 assault rifles,  14 sawed-off guns, 11 sporting shotguns, around 40 grenades,  hundreds of kilograms of napalm, 12 radio sets, a large number  of sets of militia uniforms, camouflage clothing, and other  military equipment and munitions were seized at storage sites.    The case is being investigated by an Irkutsk Oblast  Prosecutor's Office investigation operations group. The  investigation is constantly monitored by the Russian General  Prosecutor's office.</p>

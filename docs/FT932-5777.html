			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: De La Rue British consumers wrote 3 per cent fewer cheques in 1992 than the year before as they made greater use of debit cards. This trend could have proved an embarrassment for the printer De La Rue, but it remained unperturbed: the company also specialises in payment systems. This breadth of activity enabled De La Rue to record a 34 per cent increase in profits last year. Its banknote business - given a fresh burst of life by former communist countries issuing new currencies - provides a steady income stream. Its presence in payment technology, strengthened by the acquisition of Inter Innovation, gives good growth prospects. De La Rue's attractions are clear enough and it deservedly stands at a 15 per cent premium to the market. But over the past year, its shares have been becalmed as investors chase UK recovery stocks. With 90 per cent of its sales made overseas and a policy of hedging foreign income, De La Rue has been further disadvantaged in terms of sentiment. To some extent, De La Rue has also been caught out by the speed of its progress. Its strong cash flow, better than even it expected, has left it with net cash of Pounds 170m at the year end, making its Pounds 160m rights issue of just two years ago appear superfluous. With the bulk of the cash held in the UK, De La Rue now faces a drag on earnings. The company may make acquisitions but insists they must not be dilutive. Given current levels of interest rates that should not be difficult. It may also provide the spur to return De La Rue to the buy lists.</p>

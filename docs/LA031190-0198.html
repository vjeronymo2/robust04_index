			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRUISE VIEWS: VESSEL CONTAINS EVERYTHING FOR CASUAL VOYAGES  </P> <P> "If you travel much on cruise ships," James Thurber once wrote, "you are bound,  sooner or later, to run into Mrs. Abigail Pritchard. She is not one woman, but  many; I have encountered at least 15 of her."  </P> <P> We didn't encounter any of her incarnations during a recent voyage aboard the  Club Med I, but we had to wonder what she would have thought of the the vessel.  </P> <P> What, for instance, would she have made of its lack of a dress code?  </P> <P> What would her reaction have been to learn that all prices are in francs?  </P> <P> And, most interesting of all, what would she have thought about all the topless  sunbathers?  </P> <P> Probably, she would have locked herself in her cabin, which, aboard this new,  442-passenger cruise ship, might have suited her just fine.  </P> <P> Of the 191 regular cabins on the 610-foot, 9,000-ton Club Med I, 168 have twin  beds that can be converted to queen size and 23 have a third fold-down berth.  </P> <P> There's plenty of storage space and excellent lighting, mirrored walls,  mahogany furniture, high-tech modular bathrooms with shower and teak floor, a  dresser/desk with one chair, refrigerator/mini-bar and a color-TV set that  plays films, most of them in French, all day long on three channels.  </P> <P> In addition, all cabins have portholes instead of windows. For passengers  needing more space, there are also two suites and four large inside cabins.  </P> <P> What more could Mrs. Pritchard want?  </P> <P> Well, for one thing, perhaps a professional cruise staff -- those  silver-haired, deferential gentlemen in navy blazers and white slacks.  </P> <P> Instead, what we found were 64 energetic gentils organisateurs or "congenial  organizers," who, although not always congenial, usually seemed to be having  more fun than the passengers.  </P> <P> Take the captain's welcome cocktail party, for instance. Usually, this sort of  affair means shaking hands with the captain, accepting a drink from a nearby  waiter and exchanging small talk for an hour or so.  </P> <P> On the Club Med I, we stood around empty-handed while the gentils organisateurs  performed a musical number about cocktails reminiscent of the shows Judy  Garland and Mickey Rooney used to put on in grandpa's barn in old MGM movies.  </P> <P> No doubt there are people who enjoy this sort of thing.  </P> <P> In fact, the whole shipboard experience is rather like summer camp, Club  Med-style, except that the famous pop beads have been exchanged for a plastic  credit card, and the price per passenger, double occupancy, per day, hovers  from $250-to-$300 range.  </P> <P> Billed as the world's largest sailing ship, the Club Med I unfortunately spends  most of its daylight hours in port, sails furled. While in port, the ship's  duty-free shop remains open -- a cruise line first.  </P> <P> Meals are served in an a la carte restaurant called La Louisiane and in an  informal restaurant called Odyssey, where buffets are set up for breakfast and  lunch, with fixed-menu steak-and-lobster dinners by reservation at no extra  charge in the evenings.  </P> <P> The cooking is continental rather than nouvelle, rich in cream and butter  sauces, with a large serve-yourself salad buffet at lunchtime. Wine is included  with lunch and dinner.  </P> <P> Restaurant and cabin stewards are from Mauritius, the officers French and  Italian. The ship's registry, however, is Bahamian rather than French.  </P> <P> For night owls, there is a small casino and a glittering disco.  </P> <P> Some pluses: spacious teak decks and indoor/outdoor lounges in tropical and  nautical colors, a great gym with glass walls facing the sea on two sides and  top-quality equipment, two good-size swimming pools, telescopes mounted on an  outdoor deck to view passing ships or a nearby island, a large water-sports  platform that is left lowered all day as conditions permit when the ship is at  anchor -- for scuba-diving, snorkeling, water skiing and sailing, two  elevators, no tipping and no port charges.  </P> <P> Some drawbacks: no designated nonsmoking areas, a chaotic and confusing  lifeboat drill without ship's officers in evidence, unusually high bar prices  (highballs $4 and cocktails $6.35), and something that's on no other ship --  room service charges on everything but a cabin continental breakfasts.  </P> <P> Fares in the Caribbean this spring are from $275 to $304 per person, double  occupancy, per day, for the standard cabins, $506 for suites.  </P> <P> Fall Caribbean cruises and summer Mediterranean sailings are somewhat lower,  about$240 a day per person for standard cabins.  </P> <P> Children must be 12 years and older. Three people sharing a cabin pay $220 per  person, per day, in the Caribbean, about $160 in the Mediterranean.  </P> <P> In the Caribbean, the ship anchors off Iles des Saintes, St. Martin, Virgin  Gorda, St. Thomas and St. Barts, and docks in San Juan.  </P> <P> While the accent is on water sports, passengers are also offered shopping  opportunities, car rentals and shore excursions.  </P> <P> Club Med I will continue its Caribbean itinerary through April 21, then will  sail the Atlantic Ocean on a budget-priced 19-day crossing ($2,280 to $2,480  per person, double occupancy) before beginning a series of seven-day sailings  in the Mediterranean.  </P></p>

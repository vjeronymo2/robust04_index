			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUSTICES SHARPLY LIMIT EMOTIONAL DISTRESS SUITS  </P> <P> The state Supreme Court sharply limited emotional distress suits Thursday,  ruling over a harsh dissent that a mother who did not actually see her child  hit by a car cannot collect money damages.  </P> <P> The court by a 5-2 vote said direct family members can collect damages for  emotional distress only if they actually witness an injury-producing event and  suffer emotional distress "beyond that which would be anticipated in a  disinterested witness."  </P> <P> Writing for the majority in a closely watched case, Justice David N. Eagleson  said he was seeking to draw a clear line to govern emotional distress suits in  the future and avoid "limitless liability out of all proportion to the degree  of the defendant's negligence."  </P> <P> Eagleson reasoned that if the court had opted to allow emotional distress  claims by family members who do not witness accidents, insurance companies  would be unable to issue insurance policies without "imposing unacceptable  costs" on their policyholders.  </P> <P> "That relatives will have severe emotional distress is an unavoidable aspect of  the human condition," Eagleson said. He was joined by the court's four other  conservative members.  </P> <P> "The emotional distress for which monetary damages may be recovered, however,  ought not to be that form of acute emotional distress or the transient  emotional reaction to the occasional gruesome or horrible incident to which  every person may potentially be exposed in an industrial and sometimes violent  society."  </P> <P> The court went on to emphasize that unrelated friends or unmarried partners may  not collect for emotional distress -- "regardless of the depth of feeling or  the resultant physical or mental illness that results from witnessing violent  events."  </P> <P> Dissenting Justice Allen E. Broussard called the ruling "myopic," and said it  "will deny recovery to victims whose injuries from the negligent acts of others  are very real."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Arbitrary Standard'  </P> <P> Broussard said the majority's "arbitrary standard" will "lead to unjust  results." Under the new rule, Broussard said, a mother could not sue even if  she saw "her 6-year-old son immediately after he was electrocuted, lying in a  puddle of water in a dying state, gagging and choking."  </P> <P> The decision overturned a Court of Appeal ruling in a San Diego case that would  have allowed the mother, Maria E. Thing, to sue for emotional distress. She had  been in her Lemon Grove home in December, 1980, when her daughter ran inside to  say a car had run over her son, John.  </P> <P> Thing rushed outside to find her son bleeding and unconscious. She thought he  was dead. A Superior Court in San Diego dismissed the suit, finding that since  she did not actually see the accident, she could not sue.  </P> <P> The boy suffered a head injury and collected about $100,000 in a separate  action against the motorist and his insurance company, according to the  family's lawyer, Patrick F. O'Connor of El Cajon.  </P> <P> "This ruling restricts access to the courts for people who undeniably suffered  harm from someone else's wrongdoing," O'Connor said.  </P> <P> Marcelle E. Mihalla, the San Diego lawyer who represented motorist James V. La  Chusa on behalf of the Automobile Club of Southern California, hailed the  ruling, saying that "once you allow a plaintiff who wasn't at the scene to  collect . . . the floodgate is opened."  </P> <P> "You have to have reasonable limits to liability," she said.  </P> <P> The case drew friend-of-the-court briefs from insurance companies that urged  the tighter standard enunciated by the court on Thursday. The California Trial  Lawyers Assn. argued for a looser standard.  </P> <P> "The fear of a flood of lawsuits and claims of increased insurance rates has  never been demonstrated to be true," said Douglas deVries, who wrote the trial  lawyers' brief.  </P> <P> "It's best left to a jury to decide whether the event really happened and the  person really suffered the injury," DeVries said, adding that the ruling  suggests that the court has a "distrust" of letting juries decide such issues.  </P> <P> In the opinion, Eagleson criticized a landmark 1968 California Supreme Court  ruling that allowed emotional distress suits by family members who saw, heard  or in some other manner sensed an accident. It was the first ruling by a high  court anywhere in the country that allowed such suits.  </P> <P> Eagleson said the 1968 case, "like a pebble cast into the pond," created a  proliferation of lawsuits and "ever-widening circles of liability" because of  its "murky" standards.  </P> <P> He went on to attack several emotional-distress opinions issued since the 1968  case as evidence of the "expansive progression" of court decisions allowing  emotional distress suits.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cases Allowed to Proceed  </P> <P> In one case, a suit was allowed to proceed after a family member was told the  circumstances of an accident. In another, a mother was allowed to sue because  she may have mentally reconstructed the accident.  </P> <P> Eagleson, citing confusion in the lower courts, said the high court was under  an "obligation to create a clear rule under which liability may be determined."  </P> <P> "In doing so, we balance the impact of arbitrary lines which deny recovery to  some victims whose injury is very real against that of imposing liability out  of proportion to culpability for negligent acts," he said.  </P> <P> However, in a dissent, Justice Stanley Mosk attacked the majority for "callous  disregard" of rulings by the high court and courts of appeal, "some prevailing  for three decades."  </P></p>

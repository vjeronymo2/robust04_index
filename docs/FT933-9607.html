			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Arts: The Basset Table - Theatre Susanna Centlivre, who died in 1723, is having a pretty good year. After well over a century of neglect, two of her plays have been produced on the London fringe in the past few months and, on the evidence so far, one must hope for more. Ms Centlivre was one of the first women playwrights. As a contemporary of Congreve, Farquhar and Wycherley, she had a lot to compete with. She was also prolific in her output and one wonders now, with obvious hindsight, whether she was perhaps the most interesting of them all. Today some of her topical references seem obscure, but no more than in the others. Her talent was not so much to write good plays - her plots and sub-plots are all over the place - as to write good parts. She did so in abundance. When The Artifice was revived at the Orange Tree in Richmond earlier this year, I was struck by the sheer number of roles - Mr Watchitt and the Widow Heedless, for examples - that any actor or actress would like to have played. Now that The Basset Table is appearing at the New End Theatre in Hampstead, another compliment is in order: Ms Centlivre wrote some very good scenes. Basset is a game previously unknown to me. It appears to consist simply of wagering which card will come up closest to your own, with the odds lying heavily in favour of the banker. It is much more primitive than (say) pontoon and entirely devoid of skill. At Hampstead they seem to play it with 2p pieces, no doubt as a symbol of the shoe-string nature of the theatre. Yet precisely because the game is so primitive, it brings out the addictive nature of the gambler, and in the women more than the men. The specific scene at the table, where they cheat under and over the counter, is magnificent, almost a forerunner of subsequent Hollywood movies about other games for higher stakes. Yet that is not all. The Basset Table contains a wonderful female character in Valeria, whose interest in the gaming table is non-existent. Played by Geraldine O'Connell, she is a scientist and philosopher who dissects animals in the pursuit of knowledge about the human condition. 'Cousin,' she says to another woman, 'I'll give you this jewel for your Italian greyhound,' which she intends to cut up. In a later period Valeria might have been called a blue-stocking. Ms Centlivre, however, is much more subtle than that. Valeria is a most attractive lady who dresses well, knows the man she wants and gets him in the end. It is tempting to say, and some people do say, that this was the advent of feminism. Valeria is attacked for her interest in science not only by her embarrassed father, but by the rest of the females. 'Ridiculous learning,' says one. 'Ridiculous, indeed, for women,' says another. 'Philosophy suits our sex as jackboots would do.' My own view is that Ms Centlivre was remarkably even-handed. Some of the men are dolts as well as some of the women; some of the men, such as Tony Tarrats as Sir James Courtly, are also clever and generous. She gives an overall, accurate view of society, and she does it in such a sprightly fashion that this production by the Company of Clerks deserves a bigger showing than the tiny Hampstead stage allows. The list of good parts (13 in all) extends all the way down the line, notably Constance Byrne as Mrs Sago. Between them the Orange Tree and the New End have begun a major work of restoration. New End Theatre Hampstead until August 29. (071) 794 9963</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Drive for high growth and living standards - Red Book details The government's economic objective is to promote sustained growth and higher living standards. In delivering this objective, fiscal and monetary policies are complemented by the government's continuing programme of microeconomic reform. This programme is designed to improve the efficiency of markets and strengthen the long-term supply performance of the economy. The central purpose of this budget is to put the public finances on to a sound basis, so that the economic recovery now under way can be sustained over the medium term. The budget combines tight public expenditure restraint with measures to raise revenue. It also includes a number of measures to help large and small businesses, thus improving the prospect for jobs. The budget measures on taxation and spending will reinforce the fall in the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) as the economy recovers. The PSBR path now projected is significantly below that in the March projections. The budget should bring the PSBR back close to balance by 1998-99 (see accompanying table), when the government will be borrowing only to finance its net capital spending. On the spending side, tight control over pay and running costs and savings in a number of programmes contribute to substantial reductions. On the revenue side, the main focus is on broadening the tax base rather than increasing tax rates, while supporting environmental and health objectives. The strategy for strengthening the supply side aims to make the economy more responsive to market disciplines by enlarging the market sector, increasing competition, deregulating, and improving the climate for enterprise, particularly small businesses. The budget contains a number of measures which contribute to this aim. There is a package of tax and national insurance measures designed to help businesses, particularly smaller businesses, and to reduce the cost of employing lower-paid workers. On the spending side, more resources have been found for education and health; provision has been made for a new apprenticeship scheme and further measures to help people get jobs; and there are reforms to the social security programme, including help with childcare costs for low income working families. Additional help is given to exporters, and the budget takes forward the government's commitment to encourage the private financing of infrastructure projects and other capital expenditure which have hitherto been undertaken by the public sector. Measures to help business More resources will go to raising skills: They will go to education programmes to ensure record levels of participation in further and higher education, and a new apprenticeship scheme will be introduced for the training of young people. Spending on basic science and technology will be maintained in real terms. Promoting employment: Employers' national insurance contributions will be reduced by 1 per cent for employees earning less than Pounds 200 a week and 0.2 per cent for others. This should more than offset the cost to business of changes to statutory sick pay, which will encourage employers to manage sickness absence better. There will also be measures to encourage people to find work, including help with childcare costs for low-income working families and a new Job Seekers' Allowance. Promoting investment: More private finance will be levered into capital projects. This will augment direct investment planned by the public sector, averaging around Pounds 22bn over the next three years. Help for finances: A new scheme will be introduced to relieve surplus advance corporation tax (ACT) on dividends paid from foreign income. The maximum real increase in business rates faced by businesses in transition to higher rates will be halved; other businesses face no real increase. The profits limits for the small companies' rate of corporation tax will be raised by 20 per cent. The government will consult on measures to promote prompt payment by means of legislation for interest on late payment and a British Standard for prompt payment. Regulatory burden reduced: The VAT registration threshold for smaller businesses will be increased to Pounds 45,000, and statutory audit requirements will be abolished for companies with a turnover below Pounds 90,000. Investment in growing companies: A new Enterprise Investment Scheme will be introduced; the government will consult on a Venture Capital Trust scheme; and CGT reliefs will be extended. Exporters: More help will be given through increased export credit cover and lower premiums. Choosing public spending priorities Spending is reduced by Pounds 3.8bn in 1994-95 and Pounds 2.1bn in 1995-96. By 1996-97, total spending is reduced by Pounds 4.4bn as a result of the budget measures, equivalent to  1/2 per cent of GDP. This is achieved in particular by the following. Restraining public sector paybills and costs: Provision for civil service running costs in the period 1994-95 to 1996-97 is frozen at broadly the 1993-94 level. A similar approach is applied to running costs in the rest of the public sector. Restraining the growth of social security: By reforming invalidity benefit and benefits paid to the unemployed, and making employers fully responsible for paying statutory sick pay with an exemption for small companies. Savings on defence, housing, transport and other programmes: Within the lower totals more resources go to priority programmes. In addition to the measures to boost wealth creation, the new plans provide extra resources for the Health Service in 1994-95 and allow for increases in real terms each year. Extra help will be provided to pensioners and those on income-related benefits to meet the cost of extra fuel bills as a result of the introduction of VAT on fuel. The plans also fully protect the level of spending on law and order. Revenue measures for medium term There will be a broader tax base: Income tax allowances and the basic rate limit are unchanged for 1994-95. From April 1995 the value of the married couple's allowance will be restricted to 15 per cent and tax relief for mortgage interest payments will be reduced to 15 per cent. Most insurance premiums will be taxed at 3 per cent. A duty will be charged on air passengers of Pounds 5 for flights to destinations within the EC, and Pounds 10 elsewhere. There are a number of measures to protect revenue and block tax avoidance schemes. Health and environmental aims: Tax on road fuels will rise by 3 pence per litre and will be increased on average by at least 5 per cent a year in real terms in future budgets. The tax on tobacco will rise by 11p on a packet of 20 cigarettes and on average by at least 3 per cent in real terms in future budgets. VED on cars is raised by Pounds 5 to Pounds 130.</p>

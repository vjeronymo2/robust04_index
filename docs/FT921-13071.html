			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Commission unleashes powerful forces: Big energy suppliers will fight to keep their monopolies BRUSSELS' first faltering steps towards opening up the European Community energy market still face fierce opposition from established power suppliers reluctant to relinquish their monopoly clout. Many state utilities have great influence over their respective governments and could delay the approval of the Commission's draft directive on energy liberalisation. 'I'm not against competition, but it's clear to me that if you change the system in this way, you run the risk of disturbing the security of supply,' said Mr Robert Grosman at Electrabel, Belgium's main electricity supplier. In order to combat some of this opposition, Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha has sidestepped the issue of central regulation for the emerging market and is leaving it up to the individual EC states. The Commission will review the situation in 1995 to check whether competition is going ahead as planned. Said Mr Jonathan Stern, energy expert at the Royal Institute for International Affairs: 'It could mean that the legislation is put in place, but nothing happens in practice, because there is no one to ensure that it does.' He argues that those countries which face most opposition to the plans, could just drag their feet on introducing the framework. At the same time, some consumers are eager to push ahead more quickly with a fully competitive market. By initially restricting competition to customers using more than 25m cubic metres of gas or 100GW hours of electricity a year, the Commission has ensured that only the largest users, such as aluminium- and steel-makers, and glass and chemicals companies, will benefit. Companies will also have to be using that much power at an individual site rather than on a company-wide basis, before they can canvass alternative suppliers. For instance, Dow Chemical has 35 sites in Europe, but only five or six would qualify for the high energy consumption required. 'This means the Commission is only scratching the surface on competition,' said Mr Francesco Balocco, European energy supply manager at Dow. 'We want a lot of new players to come into the market, but the only way that will happen is if there is a large enough slice of the market to warrant their participation.' Nevertheless, Brussels has had to tread carefully in order to deal with the sensibilities of most member countries. Even consumers are not united in wanting a swift approach to competition. In Germany, where the Vereinigung Industrieller Kraftwirtschaft represents the interests of large and small power users, customers favour a slower pace. One consumer argues that if the whole market is thrown open to competition, the results could be so chaotic that it would justify the opposition of the country's large regional monopoly power groups. Regional power monopolies in Germany are entrenched in law and consumers are calling for a strong legislative framework to overcome the current system. Domestic consumers are unlikely to feel any benefits of a more open market before the end of the decade. In fact, many large electricity suppliers argue that the household customer could initially be paying higher prices for his power to compensate for the increased investment companies will make in competing for large industrial clients. One area where the Commission hopes that competitive advantages may filter down to households is through large energy distributors buying power outside their home country. For example, in France where 22 municipalities account for 4 per cent of gas sales, the largest distributors could band together to ensure their needs are greater than the 25m threshold and buy cheaper gas from, say, the Netherlands. The UK has been most enthusiastic about greater competition in the power market since the main suppliers have been privatised over the past decade. British energy companies are keen to expand on the continent and National Power and PowerGen, the two generating companies, refused to sign a paper put out by Eurelectric, the Brussels electricity lobby group, which opposed the Commission's plans. 'We argued against more competition here (in the UK) when it was first mooted in 1987,' said Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power. 'We said it would not work and that security of supply would be endangered, but we've been proved wrong.'</p>

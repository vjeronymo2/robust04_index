At a press conference Monday [31 January], Brazauskas  described relations with Russia as normal, which sometimes  improve and sometimes get worse. He said Lithuania's statement  on intentions to join NATO "left a certain shade" in bilateral  relations. But when Lithuania signed Partnership for Peace, no  comments followed from the Russian side, he said. "I think this  is not such a bad sign."    Brazauskas said he raised the problem of Russian military  transit through Lithuanian territory during his meetings at the  NATO headquarters in Brussels. The president said he asked  foreign experts to present their recommendations on the problem.    Brazauskas said he emphasized to representatives of NATO  nations that Lithuania does not question the Kaliningrad  region's subordination to Russia, which is a legal successor of  the former Soviet Union. The president said Lithuania will  continue talks with Russia and will carefully listen to the  opinion of others.    Commenting on Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk's  forthcoming visit to Lithuania, Brazauskas denied suppositions  that Lithuania might create a separate military alliance with  Ukraine. "I don't think that having signed the Partnership for  Peace program we can participate in any other alliance." The  Lithuanian president said Lithuania and Ukraine should primarily  discuss a number of economic issues.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Milorad Pupovac, president of the Serbian </F> Democratic Forum, by Tihomir Dujmovic; place and date not given:  "Do Not Mention the Badinter Commission"]    [Excerpts] Milorad Pupovac, a professor at the Faculty of  Philosophy in Zagreb, politically prominent both during the  former regime and after the democratic changes, has consistently  supported a policy that classifies him among the Serbian  hard-line intellectuals. He is president of the Serbian  Democratic Forum [SDF].    [Dujmovic] Whenever we asked ourselves how you envisioned  the  beginning of the normalization of the relations between the  Croats and the Serbs, it always seemed to us that you envisioned  it exactly as it is happening now. How right are we about that?    [Pupovac] The normalization started, in fact, much earlier.  That means that efforts were made by both the Croatian and the  Serbian sides to arrange the relations between the two states  and the two peoples as soon as possible. We at the SDF, and I  personally, believed profoundly that this was possible, and we  have been doing everything during the last three years to  achieve it. It sometimes seemed to us that we were very close,  especially two years ago, and then things started going in the  opposite direction. Not so much in Croatia but elsewhere, maybe  more in Bosnia and in terms of world policy.    [Dujmovic] When we say that you imagined the beginning  exactly like this, we are referring to the unresolved issue of  the UNPA [UN Protected Areas] zones and the appointment of  Veljko Knezevic as the head of the Serbian office in Zagreb.  What do you think about this, is Knezevic coming to Zagreb as a  winner or a loser? Is his appointment a provocation?    [Pupovac] This is the decision of the government of the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY], and one should not doubt  its good will as long as there is no proof to the contrary.  Veljko Knezevic is a citizen of the FRY, and it is probably best  to put aside all the stories regarding this issue, including the  stories linked to the name and work of Veljko Knezevic. If it is  proven that his choice was not in accordance with the declared  intentions, then, of course, there will be changes. But I hope  that it will not be necessary to come to that. [passage omitted]    [Dujmovic] You have been in contact with Belgrade and Knin.  Is it true that Knin is willing, under certain conditions, to  accept the Croatian Government?    [Pupovac] Many have confirmed to me that a Croatian-Serbian  agreement on the relations of Zagreb and Knin is possible.    [Dujmovic] Do you speak about individuals, "persons from the  people," or statements of important politicians?    [Pupovac] No, I am not speaking about the people, because  they are molded in accordance with the demands of the current  political trends. I am speaking about those who know what is and  what is not possible. Finally, I speak about those who know that  compromise in Croatian-Serbian relations, and especially between  Croats and Serbs in Croatia, is inevitable and necessary.  [passage omitted]    [Dujmovic] What would be the compromise, what would both  sides have to renounce in order to reach it?    [Pupovac] It is important to accept that mutual relations be  resolved through an agreement, to find transitional solutions, a  modus vivendi, which will be the basis for the final political  agreement. This agreement must contain a mutual recognition of  two peoples within one state, and, on the basis of this  agreement which would precede the recognition, a political  solution for life in common must be found.    [Dujmovic] When you say "mutual recognition of two people,"  does that mean that Croatia must recognize the so-called Krajina?    [Pupovac] I think that the fact must be recognized that the  Serbian people have lived in Croatia throughout history and that  they are a people with autonomous political will. Thus, what is  at issue is an inalienable sovereign political will which simply  cannot be annulled. This is why it is important that this fact  be confirmed by the Croatian side, just as it is necessary for  the Serbian side to realize that the fulfillment of its own  right cannot be achieved by bringing into question the right of  another people, but that a compromise has to be made.    [Dujmovic] Does the "political will of the Serbian people"  also include the possibility of secession?    [Pupovac] The right to secession is a risky right, which,  based on all that we know about international rights, cannot be  achieved only on the basis of the desire of those who interpret  this right as theirs. Namely, the rights of others should be  taken into consideration, as well as the interests of the  international community as a realistic framework for the  fulfillment of this right. I expect, in this respect, that the  Serbs will coordinate their national will for autonomy with the  rights of the Croat majority people and that they will find a  way of fulfilling, within this context, their right to  self-determination within the republic.    [Dujmovic] Why, in speaking about the Serbs, do you use the  expression "Serbian people in Croatia"? In doing this you  violate the Badinter [EC Arbitration] Commission. Why do you  qualify an entity consisting of somewhat more that 10 percent of  the total population as a people?    [Pupovac] Do not mention the Badinter Commission, because it  is one of the rather bad episodes in the disintegration of  Yugoslavia. It is one of the episodes that undoubtedly can be  linked to the escalation of the conflict in the former  Yugoslavia, not to mention that no one, absolutely no one, and  especially not an ad hoc commission, can determine what this  international right is. But, since we are speaking about this  issue, one should say that what is at issue is a perception.  What is involved is self-perception. You cannot tell the Serbs,  who for the last 150 years have been perceiving themselves as a  people with autonomous political will, that from now on they  must not have that perception. It may be that such a  self-perception is wrong, but it exists, and it is better to  understand it that to go against it. [passage omitted]</p>

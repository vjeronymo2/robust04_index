			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> 100 FLEE MYSTERY CHEMICAL ODOR  </P> <P> A suspected chemical leak at McDonnell Douglas Space Systems in Huntington  Beach sent four people to the hospital for tests today and prompted an  evacuation of about 100 workers from one of the company buildings.  </P> <P> The evacuation of Building 28 at the 250-acre plant began at 7:30 a.m. when  workers reported a strange odor. Four people who complained of dizziness were  treated at Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center and released  after tests showed that their blood gas levels were normal.  </P> <P> Hazardous materials teams from Westminster, Huntington Beach and Newport Beach  fire departments spent nearly three hours examining the building, but could  find no sign of a spill or a leak, said Birgit Davis, a Fire Department  spokesperson.  </P> <P> Thomas Williams, a McDonnell Douglas spokesman, said gallium arsenide  microchips, a highly advanced semiconductor used for research, are made in  Building 28. He said he did not know what kinds of chemicals in the plant could  cause problems if they leaked.  </P></p>

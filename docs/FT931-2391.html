			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Clinton triumphs in House votes: Tougher battle ahead as Senate verdict on budget and stimulus plans due next week PRESIDENT Bill Clinton faced a tough battle for his economic programme in the US Senate yesterday after winning a sweeping victory in the House of Representatives. 'We are really trying to break the gridlock,' Mr Clinton said after winning almost total party loyalty from his fellow Democrats in separate votes on a short term Dollars 16bn (Pounds 11bn) stimulus programme and on a longer-term budget plan aimed at cutting the federal deficit to Dollars 184bn in 1997. But the two bills face more obstacles in the Senate, where some conservative Democrats are reluctant to vote for the stimulus measures, and where senators from oil states are equally reluctant to back a plan that depends in large measure on a new energy tax. The Senate is expected to vote on the budget and stimulus plans next week. For the moment, however, President Clinton seems to have preserved important momentum for his economic programme. Mr Clinton's reading of earlier presidencies, including those of Mr Franklin Roosevelt and Mr Ronald Reagan, has encouraged him to believe he has a fleeting opportunity to push a great deal through Congress at the start of his term. Although 11 Democrats deserted the president on the budget vote, and 22 on the stimulus vote, Mr Clinton has succeeded in preserving much greater party loyalty than the last Democratic president, Mr Jimmy Carter. 'I think it's the first of a number of victories,' said Congressman Richard Gephardt, leader of the House Democrats. Helping Mr Clinton along is the growing perception among members of Congress that they had underestimated the extent to which their voters were prepared to tolerate tax increases and cuts in favourite spending programmes if, in return, a serious attempt were made to tackle the budget deficit. Congress has, in fact, decided to outdo Mr Clinton in its zeal for deficit reduction: the programme passed by the House will cut spending by Dollars 60bn more over five years than Mr Clinton's initial proposal, while the version debated by the Senate yesterday also proposed additional spending cuts. Both House and Senate versions, however, preserve essential outlines of Mr Clinton's scheme: increased revenues through higher income taxes for the wealthy and a new energy tax, matched by deep cuts in defence spending, federal subsidies and government management costs, and offset by raised 'investment' spending on the environment, education, health, technology and infrastructure. The House vote, however, is only the first, and arguably the easiest battle. The budget resolution provides the general outlines of spending and taxation: the details of spending cuts and tax rises may be harder to secure when Congress addresses them this summer.</p>

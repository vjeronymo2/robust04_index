Defence Minister Vlado  Popovski said on national radio: "If the (United Nations)  Security Council approves an increase in the number of American  peacekeepers or a replacement of the Nordic battalion, Macedonia  will respond positively to that decision." Stressing the  Scandinavian troops had done a "highly professional" job,  Popovski added that he believed their replacement by U.S. forces  would send "a warning to possible aggressors" against Macedonia.  The minister added: "The work of the Nordic battalion on the  northern border (with Serbia) has already led to a decrease in  tensions and ensured a degree of stability in the region."  [passage omitted]    Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden have a total of 800  troops in Macedonia.</p>

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Blueprint for Hong Kong: ExCo nominees well received MR Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, yesterday reshuffled his Executive Council (ExCo) appointing leading lawyers and academics while retaining most of the non-politicians appointed by his predecessor Lord Wilson. He broke with 150 years of tradition by not including the commander of British forces, Sir John Foley. His appointments were mostly well received. Two distinguished barristers were named, Mr Denis Chang and Mr Andrew Li. Mr Li shares chambers with Mr Martin Lee, leader of the United Democrats. Both are opponents of the agreement reached between Britain and China last year on the colony's Court of Final Appeal. Mr Patten would not be drawn yesterday on the significance of their appointment, but indicated he might revisit the issue of the court. 'I look forward to discussing the Court of Final Appeal with my new Executive Council.' Mr Patten also appointed one of the 44 Hong Kong citizens named by China to advise Beijing on Hong Kong affairs. Mr Tung Chee-hwa, 54, is a director of Orient Overseas Container Line and a former member of the Basic Law Consultative Committee which advised Beijing on the drafting of the colony's post-1997 constitution. As expected Mr Patten retained the services of Mr William Purves, chairman of HSBC Holdings, and Baroness Lydia Dunne. She delivered the heads of the ExCo members by persuading them to submit letters of resignation. Baroness Dunne's use to Mr Patten goes further than Hong Kong. Her seat in the British House of Lords may be useful to him.</p>

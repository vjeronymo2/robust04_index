			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Industrial gas price forecast to rise The price of gas supplied to some of the largest industrial users could rise as a result of introducing greater competition into the domestic market, according to a survey published yesterday, Robert Corzine writes. The survey, which compared international gas prices, was conducted by National Utility Services, a company which advises businesses on ways to control utility costs. It noted that British Gas's monopoly over the residential market had allowed it to offer very low prices to industrial users willing to have their supplies interrupted during periods of peak demand. But the company said the removal of the monopoly, as recommended recently by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, could lead to price rises for large users in the short term.</p>

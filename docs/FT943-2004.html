			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / International Company News: Holden Automotive ahead at ADollars 162.6m Holden Automotive, the Australian carmaker, saw net profit jump to ADollars 162.6m (USDollars 119.5m) in the year to June 30 from ADollars 98.2m in 1992-93. The company said the return on sales of 6.5 per cent was the highest since 1989-90. 'A result like this doesn't come around every year but when it does, it sets a more secure platform for our future, and evens out the low spots,' Mr Bill Hamel, chairman and managing director, said. Holden is a subsidiary of United Australian Automotive Industries, owned equally by General Motors of the US and Toyoto Motor of Japan. Holden said the 1993-94 performance confirmed its confidence in Australia and in investments such as its ADollars 150m paint facility. It also prepared the group for essential future investments. The company has said it needs an annual profit of ADollars 100m in order to maintain its competitive position. Revenues for the year rose to ADollars 2.51bn from ADollars 1.92bn a year earlier, reflecting the market acceptance of Commodore cars launched in July 1993, and a return of economic and consumer confidence. Vehicle sales grew 15.9 per cent to 109,371 in 1993-94 in a market which grew 6.6 per cent to 584,702.</p>

			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PERSONAL CRUSADE OF JUDAS PRIEST'S ROB HALFORD;  </P> <P> LITIGATION: LEAD SINGER OF THE BRITISH HEAVY-METAL BAND IS SCHEDULED TO TESTIFY  TODAY ABOUT SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES. HE HAS BECOME A FIXTURE IN THE COURTROOM AS HE  DEFENDS HIS MUSIC.  </P> <P> As lead singer of veteran British heavy-metal band Judas Priest, Rob Halford is  used to being photographed and signing autographs. But that's usually backstage  at one of the group's head-banging concerts.  </P> <P> For the past two weeks, Halford, 38, has been approached by fans in a place he  never expected to be: the steps of the Washoe County Courthouse, where his band  is being blamed in the deaths of two local youths.  </P> <P> "This situation is like Disneyland or something," said the soft-spoken rocker,  who is scheduled to testify today. "It's so hard for me to comprehend that the  prosecution actually believes Judas Priest would ever attempt to hurt the  people who buy our records. Why would we want to do that?"  </P> <P> Halford's band is being sued by the families of two Sparks, Nev., young men who  shot themselves on Dec. 23, 1985. The parents of Raymond Belknap, 18, and James  Vance, 20, blame their sons' deaths on auditory subliminal messages they allege  are embedded in the band's 1978 album "Stained Class."  </P> <P> Attorneys for the parents are seeking unspecified money damages to compensate  for the deaths, medical bills and child support. In addition, they want  punitive damages from CBS Records, which produced and distributed the album.  Both CBS and the band deny the existence of subliminal messages on any Judas  Priest album.  </P> <P> Dressed in a conservative gray suit and white shirt buttoned to the collar,  Halford shook hands and posed for a series of snapshots with a polite crowd of  heavy-metal fans after Friday's court session. Nothing but the chrome-studded  black leather boots and belt suggested the rebellious image that Judas Priest  projects on stage.  </P> <P> "A lot of people didn't think we'd show up except to testify, but we feel this  is a very serious issue," the singer said.  </P> <P> "We are here to defend the name of Judas Priest, but also because somebody has  to take a stand against these . . . attorneys who prey upon the grief and pain  of families for publicity. We have to stop them from attacking and using art to  fill their pockets with cash."  </P> <P> Halford and three other members of the quintet -- bassist Ian Hill and  guitarists K.K. Downing and Glenn Tipton, are staying in a house outside Reno.  They rescheduled their upcoming tour and delayed the release of their new CBS  album to attend the trial, which is expected to run through mid-August.  </P> <P> Onstage, Judas Priest plays the role of a loud leather-clad rock band whose  performances include heavy doses of fireworks and feedback.  </P> <P> But offstage, Halford, who jots down notes and observes the courtroom  proceedings intently, insists that he and his band mates lead quite ordinary  lives. Two are married with children. Three are golf fanatics. Halford is a  tennis buff.  </P> <P> "Personally, I consider myself to be a Christian man," Halford said. "I don't  drink, smoke or take drugs. I don't plant sinister subliminal messages on any  of my songs. Never have. Never will."  </P> <P> Critics of the band, however, have denounced Halford's music and stage show for  promoting violent, suicidal and satanic themes.  </P> <P> Last week, Robert S. Demski, the medical director of a San Antonio, Tex.,  hospital for troubled adolescents, testified in court that he banned the  group's music from his facility because he believed it induced violent behavior  in his patients. Also, Darlyne Pettinicchio, a Fullerton probation officer,  testified that the group's music glorifies Satan, causing youths to become  self-destructive.  </P> <P> Peter A. Michas, vice president of the National Information Network, a  Redlands-based organization that prepares training manuals to educate police  departments across the United States as to the negative effects of heavy-metal  music, says Halford is using his daily presence at the trial to fleece the  media.  </P> <P> "Of course he's going to claim his music is not satanic. What else would you  expect him to say?" Michas asked in a phone interview. "If you ask me, putting  a Judas Priest album on the turntable is like putting a loaded gun in a kid's  hand."  </P> <P> Halford scoffs at such accusations.  </P> <P> "It's preposterous. These people act like we drink a gallon of blood, hang from  crucifixes upside down and do incantations before we go on stage," Halford  said. "What we do is show business. Our fans expect us to dress in the costumes  we wear. I mean, it's not as if we could go out there looking like (country  singer) Waylon Jennings, now could we?"  </P> <P> Halford says the band is very concerned about the trial's outcome.  </P> <P> "If the judge does decide against, that means Judas Priest might literally end  up being charged with criminal manslaughter," Halford said. "At the risk of  sounding melodramatic, I believe such a ruling could open up a hornet's nest in  the industry.  </P> <P> "Artists, producers and record companies could be forced to sign affidavits  swearing that no subliminal messages have been inserted into every piece of  work they did. Radio and TV stations that played the music would also come  under scrutiny, having to run non-subliminal disclaimers."  </P> <P> Outside the courthouse, a small group of fans pledged to maintain a vigil  throughout the trial to show support for Judas Priest. Reno resident Scott  Michaud, 19, called the charges against Halford's band "a bunch of false  accusations."  </P> <P> William Ellenberger, 18, says he intends to picket the trial for its duration.  "Heavy-metal music doesn't kill people," Ellenberger said. "How can the parents  blame Judas Priest when it was their own kids' fault?"  </P> <P> Even Vivian Lynch, one of the attorneys attempting to prosecute Judas Priest,  waited in line for an autograph in court. Lynch has blamed alleged subliminal  messages in the band's music for pushing "the boys over the edge into  eternity."  </P> <P> During a recess Friday, however, she told The Times:  </P> <P> "I have nothing against the Judas Priest band. They were very nice to me when I  took their depositions. They gave me autographed pictures for my sons."  </P></p>

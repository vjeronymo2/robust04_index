			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Rates unchanged PERIOD rates in the sterling cash market were largely unchanged yesterday, even though the large Pounds 1.2bn shortage forecast by the Bank of England was mostly removed in the morning. As often happens on a Friday, players in the discount market mustered paper in the morning to push the overnight rate down as far as possible over the weekend. The overnight rate went down to a low of 8 per cent. But at the end of the day, period rates firmed up as the overnight ended at around 10 3/8 per cent. One week money again ended at 10 1/8 per cent, 1-month was marginally softer at 10 1/32 per cent and 3-month money, often seen as the most important indicator of market sentiment, again ended on 10 per cent, in line with UK bank base rates. Most of the shortage in the market was removed by lunchtime, with the Bank of England again dealing at the established rates of 9 7/8 per cent for Bands 1 and 2, 9 21/32 per cent for Band 3 bills and 9 15/16 per cent for the repurchase agreements (repos). The Bank purchased Pounds 519m of Band 1 bank bills, Pounds 146m of Band 2 bank bills, Pounds 142m of Band 3 bills, and Pounds 200m for resale to the market in equal amounts on 8 and 9 July. The forecast was later revised to a shortage of around Pounds 1.3bn. In the afternoon, the Bank purchased Pounds 141m of Band 1 bank bills and provided late assistance of Pounds 70m. Trade in sterling futures reflected the bullishness in the cash markets during the morning. The bulls were partly spurred on by the news from Dublin that the Irish people had voted an overwhelming 'Yes' in the Maastricht treaty on European Monetary Union (Emu). In the morning, the September short sterling contract rose 4 ticks from its opening levels to a high of 90.28. It later drifted back down again to close at 90.25. The December contract plotted a similar trajectory, rising 3 ticks to a high of 90.56 but dropping back to a close of 90.51. Despite the encouraging news from Dublin for sterling, the market is still expecting next week to be expensive for money. The second quarter draws to an end, and banks face short term liquidity problems. Next week's gilt auction of Pounds 2.75bn, will also drain the market of liquidity.</p>

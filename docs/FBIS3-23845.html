			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by IZVESTIYA writer Irina Sabvateyeva: "A London </F> Professor on the Standard of Living in Russia"]    [Text] Richard Laird, a professor at the London  School of Economics, in conjunction with specialists of the Work  Center for Economic Reforms under the Government of Russia, has  done a study of the standard of living of Russians. His approach  to the problem turned out to be somewhat nontraditional.  <H5>  Are We Poor? Or Perhaps Not So Poor? </H5>   According to Professor Laird's calculations, with the  average  wage at the end of 1993 it was possible to buy 83 percent of  what could have been acquired for similar wages in 1985. But in  general at the end of last year Russians had about 90 percent of  their 1985 income.    But this overall, quite pleasant picture was significantly  adjusted by the figures that characterize social stratification.  The difference between the "average" and that 10 percent of the  population who occupy the lower rung of the income ladder is  growing. While in 1991 the latter had 52 percent of the average  income, by the end of 1993 they were left with only 40 percent.  At the same time, in Mr. Laird's opinion, this spread in the  incomes is comparable to the degree of stratification that is  observed in Great Britain.    And another curious tendency: In 1993 we managed to reduce  the proportion of Russians living in poverty.  <H5>  The Reasons for Inequality: Discovery Laird Style </H5>   The London professor thinks that the reasons for the  stratification in Russia are the difference in earnings and the  nonpayment of wages. He categorically disagrees with the  widespread opinion in Russia that the poor system of social  protection of the underprivileged also contributes to this. Here  are Mr. Laird's thoughts.    The pension? But the ratio between the average pension and  the average wage last year was the same as in 1985. And 12  percent higher than in 1992.    Stipends for children? There is no doubt that this is the  most important element in the system of social protection. Since  there are more Russian children in poverty than Russian  pensioners. But by the end of last year this indicator was  higher than in 1985. True, the situation deteriorated this  January. As a result of the indexation of the minimum wage  conducted in December, the amounts of stipends relative to wages  decreased. And now they are somewhere around the level of world  standards.    Unemployment compensation? It is indeed low. But it is quite  comparable to our minimum wage. And it amounts to approximately  10 percent of the average wage. Undoubtedly it is less than the  unemployment compensation in any other country of the world. But  our level of unemployment is not high--1.4 percent of the entire  work force.    Incidentally, the professor categorically disagrees with the  idea that the actual level of unemployment in Russia is much  higher than the official one. According to his figures, we have  an increase in the number of people employed in the financial  sphere, the system of social protection, and trade.    Moreover, last year many enterprises tried to avoid mass  firing. They did this for two reasons. First, out of social  considerations. Second, it was advantageous for the managers to  keep many workers but pay them little. Since high taxes are  imposed on high earnings.  <H5>  A Unique Way of Fighting Unemployment? </H5>   Quite possibly, thinks Mr. Laird. This method consists in  that the people do not lose their final connection with the  enterprise until they have a new job. They go on unpaid or  partially paid leave and work a partial work week.    To be sure, the London professor does not agree with the  assessments of this phenomenon made by certain Russian  researchers. Here is what he says:    "I decided to verify the following assertion: `During the  past 10 months, 5 percent of the workers were on partially paid  leave.' And what did I find out? This leave lasted an average of  23 days a year. But this means that a total of only 0.7 percent  of the work force was on this kind of leave during the year.  This figure is not very large."    In the opinion of the Englishman, the Russian "humane"--as  he  christened it--means of fighting unemployment will be effective  only when a personnel retraining system is in place. But up to  now very little has been done in Russia to prepare people for  new occupations. This is the circumstance that Richard Laird  considers to be "the greatest failure of the reforms."</p>

			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INSANE DEFENDANTS CAN BE BILLED FOR CARE  </P> <P> Defendants who are found insane can be required to pay for housing and  treatment in a mental hospital, says a state appeals court.  </P> <P> In a ruling released Friday, the 1st District Court of Appeal upheld a law  requiring a defendant who is acquitted by reason of insanity, and confined in a  mental hospital, to pay for maintenance and care.  </P> <P> The law does not require patients to pay costs of public protection that should  be borne by society, and does not discriminate illegally against the insane,  the court said in a 3-0 ruling.  </P> <P> The decision saves the state at least $3.9 million a year, money paid by more  than 1,900 insane patients or their health plans, said Deputy Atty. Gen. John  Porter. The case stemmed from an appeal by a Marin County woman who was found  insane after killing her two sons in 1975, and was charged for her hospital  care from her sons' estates, which she was later ruled eligible to inherit.  </P></p>

			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: CIS aluminium costs 'are half world average' ALUMINIUM SMELTERS in the Commonwealth of Independent States have exceptionally low operating costs, according to estimates by the Anthony Bird Associates consultancy group. In mid-1992 these costs were about 25 US cents a lb on average - well below the 53.6 cents average at smelters in the rest of the world, it suggests. CIS smelters are 'technically inefficient and are only made economic by astonishingly low input prices (for essentials such as labour and energy),' it says in a new study of industry costs. 'This edge will disappear if the CIS continues to move towards a market type of economy,' the study suggests. But 'by the year 2000 only one or two of the CIS smelters will still be competitive by western standards. The rest of them won't necessarily close down, they might be kept in business to supply local demand, on a protected basis. But cost pressures will put an end to the flood of metal flowing from east to west'. Aluminium Production Costs: 1992. Pounds 4,500 from Bird Associates, 193 Richmond Road, Kingston upon Thames, Surrey KT2 5DD, UK.</p>

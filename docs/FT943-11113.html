			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo Although investors continue to be wary of committing funds in large amounts into the Japanese bond market due to increasing signs of economic recovery and the possibility of a rebound in the dollar, the yield on the No 164 10-year government bond is expected to remain within a range of 4.2 per cent to 4.4 per cent over the next few weeks. A shift in bond portfolios by Japanese institutional investors from mid-term bonds to long-term government paper is likely to continue to provide support for the Tokyo bond market. Life assurers and financial institutions are reluctant to buy up the market, but are ready to purchase long-term bonds around the 4.4 per cent to 4.5 per cent level due to the lack of risk-free high-yielding investments. Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo reckons yields at around 4.5 per cent for government bonds are too high considering the low rate of inflation: 'Given the 0.3 per cent year-on-year decline in Tokyo prices in July, and the core rate of 0.7 per cent, it is clear that even official inflation measures are catching up with the reality of declining prices for consumer goods.' Over-supply concerns are likely to subside. Last week's 10-year government bond auction saw active demand, with Y1,622bn of bids for Y600bn of available bonds.</p>

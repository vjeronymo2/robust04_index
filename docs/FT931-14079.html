			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / International Company News: Reynolds Metals posts Dollars 152m loss REYNOLDS Metals, the diversified aluminium producer based in Richmond, Virginia, suffered a fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 152.1m, or Dollars 2.55 per share. For the full-year, the deficit was Dollars 748.8m, or Dollars 12.56 a share. The losses reflect previously-announced after-tax charges for environmental and restructuring costs and for changes in benefits accounting. Without the special items, the company said it would have reported net income of Dollars 1.29 per share for the year, including 8 cents per share in the fourth quarter for tax benefits related to Canadian debt restructuring. In 1991, the company earned Dollars 23.7m, or 40 cents per share, in the fourth quarter. Sales for the 1992 fourth quarter were Dollars 1.35bn, compared with Dollars 1.45bn in the corresponding period of 1991. Mr Richard G. Holder, chairman, said continuing world oversupply of aluminum and depressed prices led him to expect another loss in the first quarter and 'gradual improvement thereafter'.</p>

King Sihanouk reiterated Wednesday his proposal for the  different factions in Cambodia to come together for talks in the  North Korean capital Pyongyang on May 27 to end the fighting  between the government and Khmer Rouge guerrillas.    "We sincerely hope that setting store by their national  interests, the Cambodian leaders of various parties will, with  the spirit of mutual understanding and mutual accommodation,  make joint efforts for national reconciliation," Wu said.

The artists' media range from oil  painting to neon sculpture. There are also 24 special exhibits, including  "Artists in the Backroom," a display of art by budding artists who work in  galleries.  </P> <P> More than 300 works of art will be offered for sale at a silent auction at  Westminister Elementary School, 1010 W. Washington Blvd., where tickets can be  purchased Sunday. To buy tickets in advance, call (213) 392-8630. The school is  the starting place for the walk.  </P> <P> A separate component of the Art Walk on Saturday and Sunday will be guided  docent tours, for a contribution of $90, of selected studios and the  neighborhood.  </P> <P> At the annual Art Walk dinner Saturday night at Santa Monica Airport,  pediatrician Walter M. Tasem and restaurateurs Rebecca and Bruce Marder, owners  of Rebecca's and the West Beach Cafe, will be honored.  </P> <P> All proceeds from the Venice Art Walk go to the Venice Family Clinic, which  provides medical care for the uninsured, working poor and homeless. About  10,000 patients are served at the clinic each year. The Art Walk provides about  one-quarter of the clinic's funding.  </P> <P> For more information, call (213) 392-WALK.  </P></p>

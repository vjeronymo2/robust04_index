			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 13 (BTA) -- A BTA correspondent today  asked Deputy Foreign Minister Todor Churov about the Foreign  Ministry's stand on a UN request for Bulgaria's assistance in  the transportation of UN property and equipment for the UNPROFOR  [UN Protection Forces] contingent in Macedonia [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] via its territory. The  deputy foreign minister said taking an official stand on this  matter is within the cabinet's powers. The Foreign Ministry's  opinion after careful consideration of the request, made on  behalf of UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, is that this  country's reply should be a positive one, Mr. Churov said.  UNPROFOR-Macedonia has an entirely new task to carry out. With  its task to prevent the Yugo-conflict from spreading to  Macedonia, it is the first preventive operation the UN has ever  launched. Bulgaria, therefore, sees UNPROFOR-Macedonia as a  factor of stability in this part of the Balkans, and its  presence there, as fully coinciding with this country's national  interests.    Being committed to Article 43 of the UN Charter, this  country  is expected to meet any request on the part of the organization  to facilitate its operations, including passage through  Bulgaria's territory when it is essential for keeping the peace  and security in the world. In this particular case were are  being requested to facilitate the passage of UN equipment and  not military troops, which means that a decision on the matter  should be taken by the cabinet, Mr. Churov said.    The deputy foreign minister went on to say that Bulgaria's  consent has nothing to do with granting corridors for the  passage of military contingents of countries which, according to  Bulgaria, should not in any way participate in the  Yugo-conflict, even if under the UN auspices. Our conviction is  that the United Nations will use the equipment for preventive  and not military operations. The request is within this  country's commitments under the UN Charter and has a mostly  technical character, the deputy foreign minister also said.    Bulgaria's principled stand in favour of non-involvement in  the Yugo-crisis remains unchanged. So is this country's  understanding that neighbouring or Balkan countries should in no  way participate in the conflict, Mr. Churov said.</p>

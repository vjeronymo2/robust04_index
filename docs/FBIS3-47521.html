Cho Sun-hwan of  the United People's Party during the National Assembly's regular  session last year, and is trying to find it.    Investigators from the Defense Security Command searched the  homes of Rep. Cho's aides -- Yi Un-chae, 38, and Chong Chu-hun,  31 -- for the "secret" paper Thursday but came up empty handed,  a ministry spokesman said.    The document contains details of the operating budget for  the  ministry for 1994 and could benefit Korea's enemies, he said.    The ministry prepared the document in September and, through  the National Assembly Secretariat, gave a copy to each member of  the defense and the budget and accounts committees for their  deliberations on the defense budget. The copy sent to Cho, a  member of the budget and accounts committee, was not returned.    Pressed for its return, the secretariat told the ministry in  a letter Jan. 3 that it had no way of finding the document  because the aide who had kept it had been fired.    In January 1992, Hwang In-o, the leader of a North Korean  spy  ring, obtained a classified Defense Ministry document through Yi  Kun-hui, a lawmaker's secretary, and handed a photocopy to North  Korea through Japan.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In a letter he sent today, Prime Minister Janez  Drnovsek informed the Social Democratic Party of Slovenia that  he had sent the State Chamber his proposal on the replacement of  Defense Minister Janez Jansa. Namely, the government commission  investigating into the Smolnikar case has established that  members of the Defense Ministry have overstepped their powers.  Therefore, the defense minister must take responsibility for  that activity. According to Drnovsek, permitting such activity  would mean deviating from the rule of law. The prime minister  suggests that the Social Democratic Party should continue  participating in the government coalition.</p>

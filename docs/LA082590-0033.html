			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HARPER ACCENTS FUNDAMENTALS AS HE RUNS TWO PRACTICES FOR HIS CLU FOOTBALL TEAM  </P> <P> Joe Harper put his Cal Lutheran football team through its opening practice  Friday morning, marking the first time the Kingsmen have begun a season without  Bob Shoup, who coached them for 28 years.  </P> <P> Harper worked his 50-plus-member squad for a little more than two hours and  brought the team back for more in the afternoon.  </P> <P> The emphasis was on fundamentals including, in the morning session, several  attempts at properly breaking the offensive huddle.  </P> <P> "We're a long way away," Harper said. "We're starting from ground zero -- 'This  is a football.' "  </P> <P> Veterans found the workouts more structured than Shoup's practices.  </P> <P> "I like the way his practices are compared to last year," senior safety Nicko  Rising said. "We've got more to do."  </P> <P> Harper, however, was less than pleased by his team's intensity.  </P> <P> "It's not good enough, not yet," said Harper, who described his players'  overall conditioning as "very average."  </P> <P> While many members of the team have expressed regret at the way Shoup's  dismissal was handled, they are nearly unanimous in their approval of Harper,  who won a Division II championship at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.  </P> <P> "With all the talk about Coach Shoup there was a lot of negativity about the  program," said Dana Zupke, a senior co-captain. "We can concentrate on just  playing football for a definite change."  </P> <P> And Harper can concentrate on coaching football. Not having coached since the  1985 season at Northern Arizona, he is back on the field for the first time in  five years.  </P> <P> "This is the most enjoyable thing I've done since I've been here," Harper said.

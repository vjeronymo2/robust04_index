			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Russian and the G7: Lamont sets a 10-year target for free trade THE G7 countries should commit themselves to establishing completely free trade with Russia within 10 years to hasten Russian integration into the world economy, Mr Norman Lamont, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, told the Group of Seven's finance and foreign ministers in Tokyo. He said such a timetable would be a symbol of economic partnership, rather than merely aid. Mr Lamont also announced a Pounds 380m addition to the UK's bilateral aid programme to promote economic reform in Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union. The additional assistance would bring British aid to the former Soviet Union to Pounds 1.1bn, including the UK's commitment to the EC's aid programme. It is mainly in the form of Pounds 320m in export credits and insurance for British companies investing in Russia. Technical assistance to Russia will be doubled to Pounds 120m. Most of this will go into an international fund to support the development of small and medium-sized enterprises, with the rest to expand the recently launched scheme to second Russian managers to British businesses to give them experience of working in a market economy. Mr Lamont said: 'Russia could be one of the biggest export markets for British firms in the next decade. We want to help and encourage them to get in on the ground floor and to establish links with Russia at an early stage.' However, the British proposal for a free trade agreement appeared to win little immediate backing, apart from support from Japan. Before yesterday's announcement Britain had pledged about Pounds 130m in bilateral aid, including Pounds 38m for military safety and Pounds 60m to the Know-how fund for business development. It had also provided Pounds 323m in export credits and Pounds 321m for the EC aid programme.</p>

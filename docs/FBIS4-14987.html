			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Release"] </F>   [Text] Tallinn, April 5 -- Russia cannot become member of  the Council of Europe unless it pulls its forces out of the  Baltic countries, Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar told a news  conference on Tuesday [5 April].    Laar said that Russian MPs have been very active at a  parliamentary seminar in Helsinki on Russia's chances of  becoming a member of the Council which "demonstrates  extraordinary interest in obtaining the status of full member",  Laar said.    "Such interest is very positive from our standpoint as the  Council of Europe has unanimously accepted an attitude that  Russia cannot become a full member before its troops are  withdrawn from the Baltic states completely and without  conditions," Laar stressed. He also added that even if a member  country should make any amendments to the stipulation, Estonia  would not change its views.    "It has been clearly said in the Council of Europe that as  long as Russia continues talking about seizing other countries  and pursues the near-abroad policy, Russia's becoming a member  of the Council is hopeless," Laar said while adding that as any  decision needs to be passed under consensus, "even one is a  soldier on the battlefield".    Only today, the Russian ultra-nationalist Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy who is a member of the Russian delegation said that  Estonia would soon be reabsorbed by Russia, REUTERS reported  from Helsinki.</p>

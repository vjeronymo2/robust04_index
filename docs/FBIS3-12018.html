Ramiro de la Rosa, the PRI representative who heads the  Youth  Secretariat of the Latin American Parliament, blamed some  government officials, whom he refused to name, for the "climate  of conspiracy that surrounded the assassination." He told  "Panamericana Television Network" that the Mexican media has  virtually ignored him, adding that President Carlos Salinas de  Gortari will exploit Colosio's death to "promote a candidate  that lacks the support of the PRI's rank and file and that fails  to meet the expectations of the Mexican people." He said: "We  and the Mexican people are demanding that President Salinas not  be involved in the selection of the presidential candidate for  the upcoming elections."    The youth leader also accused the president of "having  endorsed and encouraged the ambitions of the PRI's dubious  leader Manuel Camacho Solis." De la Rosa added that the  government has used Camacho to create specific political  situations.    The Lima newspaper LA REPUBLICA published de la Rosa's  statements today by running a front-page headline that reads:  "It Was a Plot." This report differs from that of assassin  Mario Aburto, which also received ample coverage. Aburto  maintained that he worked alone and followed no one's orders.    In his interview with the "Panorama" talk show, however, de  la Rosa expressed optimism for the PRI's future: "There is a  large sector that maintains a position of democracy, openness,  and renewal. I am not alone; there is a growing democratizing  current."</p>

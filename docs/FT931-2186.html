			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Nato jets ready to enforce no-fly zone: Bosnia peace talks reach an impasse NATO has completed plans to enforce a no-fly zone over Bosnia, with the United Nations expected to approve the use of allied fighters this week to shoot down Serb or other aircraft over the republic, Reuter reports from Brussels. At the same time negotiations on peace talks to end the war reached an impasse at the weekend with mediators Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen evaluating how or whether to keep the negotiations going. Bosnia's Moslem President Alija Izetbegovic has refused to participate in any formal talks with the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, as long as the siege of the east Bosnia town of Srebrenica continues. At issue in the peace talks is a map splitting Bosnia into 10 semi-autonomous provinces, largely along ethnic lines. Bosnia's Croats have accepted this plan but both the government and the Serbs have rejected it. Nato sources in Brussels said the no-fly zone enforcement operation would be run from a Nato air headquarters at Vicenza, north-eastern Italy, and would probably include fighters from the US, Britain and France. Various plans were available, ranging from simple patrolling of the skies to bombing airfields in Serbia and elsewhere if necessary. While Nato will run the operation, it will be under the strict political control of the UN. The UN imposed the no-fly zone over Bosnia in October to stop air attacks. The ban has been violated more than 450 times since then, mostly by Serbs. The UN Security Council is expected to vote for enforcement this week, after light aircraft carried out the first confirmed bombing raids against Moslem villages in Bosnia and then flew off in the direction of Serbia a week ago. However, the resolution is likely to include a 'warning period' of days or even weeks before enforcement begins. In eastern Bosnia, General Philippe Morillon tried to put together a deal with Serbs and Moslems yesterday to get aid flowing again to starving Moslems there. Gen Morillon, commander of UN troops in Bosnia, left the headquarters he has set up in Srebrenica for talks with both warring parties after 18 trucks with supplies for the besieged Moslem town were blocked on the Serbian-Bosnian border. A UN military source in the border town of Mali Zvornik, where the Danish trucks were stranded for a second day, said the general had talks in the Bosnian Serb town of Bratunac before driving on to the Moslem stronghold of Tuzla. UN officers said Gen Morillon had struck a deal to evacuate Serbs from Tuzla. It was also hoped to get agreement to use helicopters to evacuate more refugees from Srebrenica. US aircraft dropped more aid over Srebrenica early yesterday, in individual packets rather than pallets to try to prevent starving inhabitants killing each other in the chaotic scramble for food. Meanwhile, the besieged Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, came under heavy artillery attack yesterday after two days of relative calm. At least eight people were killed and about 95 wounded as Serb artillery unleashed a ferocious barrage on the Old Town and the residential quarter of Vratnik. Shelling, apparently from Moslem positions, also rained down on the airport, hub of the international relief airlift for the besieged capital, and closed the road leading from it into the city, UN officials said.</p>

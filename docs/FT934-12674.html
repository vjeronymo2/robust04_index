			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Siemens powers ahead in China SIEMENS, the German electrical and electronics group, is expanding in the Chinese power plant market through a joint venture to make instrumentation and control (I&amp;C) equipment there. The venture, Siemens Power Plant Automation, will be 60 per cent-owned by Siemens, with the balance held by Nanjing Electric Power Automation Equipment General Factory, controlled by the Chinese ministry for the electric power industry. The venture will be based in a special economic zone in Nanjing, 150 miles from Shanghai, and will employ about 100 people when fully established. It will focus on producing, selling and servicing the Teleperm ME process control system, developed by Siemens for large power plants, but will subsequently also produce hardware such as electronic equipment cabinets. The joint venture is the latest in a string of link-ups between western and Chinese power equipment suppliers, prompted by China's surging demand for power capacity. Advanced I&amp;C equipment increases the reliability, cost-effectiveness and service life of plant while reducing fuel consumption and emissions. The tie-up replaces Nasic, another venture set up in 1991 by KWU, the Siemens power equipment subsidiary, with the same partner. Siemens said preparations were under way for further joint ventures in China.</p>

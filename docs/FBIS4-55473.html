			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Boris Latta: "The Engineers Are Earning Us a </F> Good Reputation"]    [Text] A delegation led by Defense Minister Pavol Kanis  returned home early in the evening of 7 May from its two-day  official visit to Slovenia and Croatia. Immediately upon his  return, the minister said that the two visits were completely  different from the point of view of their contents.    The talks in Ljubljana, Slovenia, defined in the dialogue  between our minister and his departmental counterpart, Jelko  Kacin, were oriented mainly toward an exchange of views on  security issues in the Central European region and on the next  course of action within the framework of the Partnership for  Peace plan.    According to Minister Kanis, the talks with President Milan  Kucan had a special quality. First and foremost, from the point  of view of the broad coalition government in Slovenia, which is  fully functional and, therefore, contradicts the claims by some  of our politicians about the impossibility of normal activity by  such a grouping.    The Slovak Army commander, Lieutenant General Julius Humaj,  who was also a member of the delegation, briefed journalists on  the military aspect of the talks in Slovenia. Among other  things, he said that he had followed up on the talks he had had  with General Gucman, chief of the Slovene General Staff, last  December.    Following the division of greater Yugoslavia, Slovenia is at  the stage of building up its own army and is resolved to expend  considerable resources on this. In this context, it has asked  to cooperate with Slovakia, first and foremost, in training  certain types of troops. For example, our assistance could  consist of training military pilots or artillery gunners. Humaj  emphasized, however, that this would require the Slovene Army to  also have our systems among its armaments so that it could then,  as the case may be, exercise in our military areas. It is  simply up to the Slovene side which of our proposals it will  accept. With regard to the embargo that is still in force, they  are convinced in Ljubljana that it will come to an end this fall  and then nothing will stand in the way of even military  cooperation. The two sides should sign a specific agreement  during the coming visit of Minister Jelko Kacin, which should  take place in about a month.    The focal point of the visit to Croatia was a visit to the  Slovak engineering battalion, which is part of the UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Force] forces in Yugoslavia and which, on Saturday,  was celebrating its first anniversary in the difficult  conditions of the region of its deployment. According to the  defense minister, "such activity in UN peacekeeping missions  should form a significant element of the Slovak Army's future  activity, and, therefore, it is necessary to strengthen it."  Kanis also said that very few of Slovakia's citizens are aware  of the good reputation these soldiers are earning for us and  that they are also creating a very advantageous and suitable  basis for Slovak diplomacy in the international arena. "We have  to overcome the very simplified views held by our citizens about  the activity of Slovak troops in UNPROFOR services. I think our  units are doing very well there and that the UNPROFOR command  also appreciates them," said the defense minister to reporters  in his assessment of the visit following his return to  Bratislava.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Exportation of Sheep and Goats  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulations in 9 CFR part 91 also set forth the conditions under which sheep and goats are eligible for exportation with regard to scrapie. Scrapie is a progressive degenerative disease of the central nervous system of sheep and goats. The signs that become manifest may include nervousness, incoordination, slight muscular tremors, visible weight loss, lack of luster in the animal's wool, and itching. Infected animals become debilitated and die.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations in &sect;&sect;91.6(a)(3) and 91.8(a) provide that a goat or sheep shall not be exported if it is affected with or exposed to scrapie; if it originated from, or has been on, any premises which then were infected or source flock premises; if it is the progeny, sire or dam, or full or half brother or sister of any animal found to be affected with scrapie; or if it was moved from premises located in an area quarantined for scrapie.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the current regulations, infected premises are those on which an animal has been found to be infected with scrapie, and source flock premises are those premises from which an affected animal was moved within 18 months or less prior to showing signs of scrapie.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When the 18-month time period was established for source flocks, existing biological evidence indicated that the incubation period for scrapie was less than 18 months. Therefore, flocks from which an affected animal was moved more than 18 months prior to showing signs of scrapie were not considered to be at risk from the scrapie-affected animal. However, evidence now available indicates that scrapie develops more slowly than previously thought, with an incubation period that could last for years, and that averages more than 18 months. Therefore, a flock from which a sheep or goat was moved more than 18 months prior to showing signs of scrapie could be at risk from the affected animal. We are therefore proposing to amend &sect;&sect;91.6 and 91.8 by removing footnote 4, which refers to source flock premises as those premises from which an affected animal was moved within 18 months or less prior to showing signs of scrapie, and to define ``source flock'' as defined below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are proposing to amend &sect;&sect;91.6 and 91.8 to prohibit the exportation of scrapie positive animals and all animals from infected flocks, source flocks, and trace flocks, as defined in both 9 CFR part 54 (which describes the Voluntary Scrapie Flock Certification Program in place in the United States) and 9 CFR part 79 (which imposes interstate movement restrictions for sheep and goats). We are also proposing to prohibit the exportation of exposed animals, as defined in part 79, and to amend the definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> scrapie-exposed animals <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in part 54 to update it and make it consistent with the definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> exposed animal <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in part 79. The definitions of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> exposed animal, infected flock, scrapie-positive animal, source flock,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> trace flock,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> as set forth in part 79 and part 54 (except for  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> exposed animal <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Exposed animal. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Any animal which has been in the same flock at the same time within the previous 60 months as a scrapie-positive animal, excluding limited contacts. Limited contacts are contacts between animals that occur off the premises of the flock, and do not occur during or immediately after parturition for any of the animals involved. Limited contacts do not include commingling (when animals concurrently share the same pen or same section in a transportation unit where there is uninhibited physical contact).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Infected Flock <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Any flock in which a Veterinary Services representative or State representative has determined an animal to be a scrapie-positive animal. A flock will no longer be an infected flock after it has completed the requirements of a flock plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Scrapie-positive animal <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . An animal for which a diagnosis of scrapie has been made by the National Veterinary Services Laboratories, United States Department of Agriculture, or another laboratory authorized by the Administrator to conduct scrapie tests in accordance with (9 CFR part 79), through histological examination of central nervous system samples from the animal for microscopic lesions in the form of neuronal vacuoles or spongy degeneration, or by the use of protease-resistant protein analysis or other confirmation techniques used in conjunction with histological examination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Source flock <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . A flock in which a Veterinary Services representative has determined that at least two animals, that were diagnosed as scrapie-positive animals at an age of 54 months or less, were born. In order to be a source flock, the second scrapie-positive diagnosis must be made within 60 months of the first scrapie-positive diagnosis. A flock will no longer be considered a source flock after it has completed the requirements of a flock plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

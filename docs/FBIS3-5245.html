			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 5 (YONHAP) -- South Korea's net  external debt fell below 10 billion U.S. dollars in 1993 for the  first time in three years thanks to an increase in the country's  foreign reserves, the Bank of Korea said Saturday. Net external  debt, the amount remaining after subtracting foreign reserves  from total external debt, decreased from 11.1 billion dollars at  the end of 1992 to 7.98 billion dollars last year.    Foreign reserves soared last year as foreigners' investment  in stocks increased and the current account posted a surplus,  thereby reducing the nation's net foreign debt. Foreign  reserves, which include foreign exchange holdings and overseas  stocks and bonds, reached 36.1 billion dollars at the end of  last year, up 4.38 billion dollars from the year before.    South Korea's balance of current accounts recorded a  450-million-dollar surplus for the first time in four years,  while foreigners invested 5.7 billion dollars in stocks here,  increasing the country's foreign reserves.    Meanwhile, total external debt rose 1.26 billion dollars to  44.08 billion dollars at the end of 1993, from 42.82 billion  dollars a year earlier. Long-term foreign debt rose by 760  million dollars from 24.31 billion dollars in 1992 to 25.07  billion dollars, while short-term debt increased 500 million  dollars to 19.01 billion dollars.    South Korea's net foreign debt decreased to 3.02 billion  dollars in 1989 when the nation enjoyed a large current account  surplus, but increased again to 4.85 billion dollars in 1990 and  11.95 billion dollars a year later.</p>

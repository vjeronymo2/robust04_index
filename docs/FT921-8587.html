			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Hibernia work capped while investors sought THE THREE remaining partners in the Hibernia oil project off the coast of Newfoundland have put a brake on construction work while they seek new investors for the CDollars 5.2bn (Pounds 2.48bn) venture. The move followed the decision by Gulf Canada Resources to abandon its 25 per cent stake in the project. Gulf, controlled by Olympia &amp; York Developments, developers of the Canary Wharf in London, said last month that it needed to conserve resources for higher priorities. The field was originally expected to produce 110,000 barrels of oil a day by 1996, but the slowdown will delay completion until 1997 at the earliest. The federal and Newfoundland governments are contributing about half the cost of the project, but Hibernia's long-term viability depends on an increase in oil prices. The remaining shareholders, Mobil Canada, Chevron Resources Canada and Petro-Canada, said no new contracts would be signed from this week and most work already under way would be slowed down. Work on the concrete gravity base for the production platform would be stopped immediately. The slowdown will affect Canadian as well as foreign suppliers. Wimpey is among the companies which have been told to halt work. About 70 jobs will also be lost at a design office in Paris. The three remaining partners have appointed Goldman Sachs and Wood Gundy to find a replacement for Gulf. However, Petro-Canada has also indicated that it would like to to reduce its stake.</p>

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Austria's coalition under electoral siege: The socialist and conservative hold on power is beginning to weaken A big upheaval is in the making in Austrian politics, as an increasingly fractious 'grand coalition' of Social Democrats and conservatives begins to tear apart. The rupture will probably not be set off immediately by this Sunday's national elections. The coalition that has ruled the country since 1986 will almost certainly carry on in the short term, if only to guide Austria smoothly into the European Union at the start of next year. But it could break up well before the next scheduled election in 1998, clearing the way for a political and economic overhaul. The socialists and conservatives have managed, in a cozy partnership, virtually every aspect of economic and social life in Austria since the second world war. Together they set up carefully balanced power structures for employers, workers and farmers and staffed the nationalised industries and financial institutions with their supporters. As long as the two parties had the support of most Austrians and as long as competence was not too important a factor in filling key positions, this so-called Proporz system could thrive. But as a privatisation programme gathers pace and the country opens itself to EU competition rules, it no longer works. Early this week, for example, only 30 per cent of workers bothered to vote in elections to their Arbeiterkammer, a counter lobby to the employers' Chamber of Commerce. Most workers know their chamber has less influence on their lives and careers than Brussels bureaucrats. In Sunday's election the Social Democratic party (SPO) and the conservative Austrian People's party (OVP), which between them polled more than 80 per cent of the votes in 1986, will be lucky to collect two-thirds. The legitimacy of reserving government and government-controlled jobs for supporters would thus be brought increasingly into question. This is the kind of environment in which new and fringe political movements grow, and Austria is no exception. So far none constitutes a serious threat to the two old parties, but the Austrian Freedom party (FPO), under the leadership of Mr Jorg Haider, a charismatic right-winger, could change that on Sunday. Mr Haider took control of the FPO, a flagging party with a mixed liberal and Nazi heritage, in 1986, purged its leaders and turned it into a rowdy protest movement against the self-serving socialist-conservative partnership. Now every time a party supporter gets a high-paying sinecure, Mr Haider brays about 'rotten' patronage. When the iron curtain fell in 1989 he began appealing to Austrians' fears of being overrun by asylum seekers and other immigrants. He maintains that foreigners are taking over Austrians' jobs and benefiting excessively from government welfare payments, while crime rates are soaring and the quality of education is declining. With these themes and his opposition to European integration, Mr Haider has more than doubled the FPO's support to 22 per cent, not far below the OVP's 28 per cent, according to opinion polls. Normally this would make the party an alternative coalition partner for one of the two main parties. But Mr Haider's rhetoric, which often appeals to xenophobic and racist sentiments, has made him a pariah. 'Haider's FPO is no alternative for us - which I regret,' Mr Erhard Busek, leader of the conservative OVP, said on Wednesday. However, such is the frustration within the OVP with being the junior partner in the governing coalition that another of its leaders, foreign minister Alois Mock, said last week that the party should rethink its stance on Mr Haider. 'It certainly would do democracy in this country no harm if the socialists went into opposition for a few years,' Mr Mock said in a magazine interview. The socialists have been more successful than the OVP in preventing erosion of their support, mainly because of the popularity of Mr Franz Vranitzky, their moderate and competent leader. But they too have struggled in the current campaign, hurt by losses to Mr Haider in a provincial election two weeks ago, revelations of huge salaries being paid to leaders of the Chamber of Labour and an insensitive remark from Mr Vranitzky's wife criticising mothers who left their children to work. Meanwhile, on the left, the Greens have gone some way to transforming themselves and their leader, Ms Madeleine Petrovic, into a responsible force. Their standing in the polls has risen from 4.8 per cent in 1990 to 8 per cent. And the Liberal Forum, formed last year by defectors from Mr Haider's party and led by Ms Heide Schmidt, is hoping to break through the 4 per cent barrier needed to win a share of the 183 parliamentary seats.</p>

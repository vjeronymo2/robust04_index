			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Clowes and wife told to pay damages to DTI MR PETER CLOWES and his wife Pamela were ordered by the High Court yesterday to pay damages to the Department of Trade and Industry which took over the claims of thousands of small investors who lost out in the collapse of the Barlow Clowes investment group in 1988. Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor, said it was incontrovertible that there had been a fundamental breach of the contract entered into by investors and there was no defence to the damages claim. The amount of damages will be assessed later. Mr Clowes is serving a 10-year jail sentence for fraud. The DTI claim is one of many against Mr Clowes, who cheated investors of an estimated Pounds 113m by falsely promising to invest their funds in gilt-edged securities. He spent the money on a yacht, executive jet, expensive cars and business enterprises. Only Pounds 1.9m of a Pounds 115m investment fund was found to have been invested in government stock. The DTI paid out Pounds 150m in compensation to investors after its attempts to regulate Barlow Clowes were strongly criticised by the parliamentary ombudsman. The DTI had asked the court to grant it immediate judgment in the sum of Pounds 19.8m, representing the losses suffered by investors in Barlow Clowes and Partners before the management of its funds was taken over by Barlow Clowes Gilt Managers in 1987. The vice-chancellor said that application was 'misconceived,' but the DTI was entitled to judgment because the investors had been the victims of a fundamental breach of contract in June 1988 when BCGM was compulsorily wound up. Mr and Mrs Clowes, both of whom are legally aided, are considering an appeal. At present their assets are charged to the joint liquidators of Barlow Clowes, leaving them without funds. They were ordered to pay the DTI's legal costs, but the judge said the costs order was not to be enforced without further leave of the court. This means in effect that the costs order will not be implemented unless the couple accumulate money in the future.</p>

			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BIG WAVES LEAP OUT OF NOWHERE  </P> <P> Impressive waves -- some as big as 10 feet -- thundered onto Orange County  beaches Wednesday, in some cases catching swimmers by surprise.  </P> <P> Two swimmers in Laguna Beach were taken to local hospitals with moderate neck  and back injuries after sets of six-foot waves emerged from a seemingly calm  sea and sent them plunging into the sand, lifeguards said.  </P> <P> Waves as big as nine feet are expected today.  </P> <P> The National Weather Service warned people fishing or sightseeing near the surf  today to be prepared for occasional, larger-than-usual waves washing over  previously dry areas.  </P> <P> "It does not appear that beach property will be threatened," the weather  service added.  </P> <P> The forecast was for diminishing surf beginning Friday as the effects of a  South Pacific storm begin to wane. The storm, far out to sea and near the  Equator, has been sending south-to-southeast swells against the Southern  California coast.  </P> <P> The swells have been causing the large waves at shore, but not a continuous  parade of them.  </P> <P> "What happens is, we put out the yellow flag (indicating moderately dangerous  surf), but it gets real calm for a while," said Laguna Beach lifeguard Kristi  Farley. "It looks like a calm day, so people who don't know the beach think  they can handle it. A lot of these people are tourists who haven't even seen  surf before.  </P> <P> "They go out and then a set (of big waves) comes in, and they get caught in the  impact zone. They come right over the top of the wave -- we call it going over  the  </P> <P> falls -- and they slam into maybe two feet of water. It's like slamming into  concrete."  </P> <P> The biggest waves Wednesday -- an estimated 10 feet -- were reported at Newport  Beach.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach State Park lifeguards reported rescuing at least 60 swimmers.  </P> <P> "This is our second south swell of the summer, and it's the largest so far,"  said Dan Kennedy, a lifeguard supervisor.  </P> <P> San Clemente on Wednesday night was expecting its highest tide of the year --  7.1 feet -- which, coupled with the big surf, might threaten a lifeguard tower  or two.  </P> <P> "But our beaches themselves are in pretty good shape," said Richard Chew, the  city's beach supervisor. "The south swells actually fill in the beach during  the winter, so we're OK."  </P> <P> Weather service forecasters expect Orange County beaches to receive the biggest  waves today -- four to six feet with occasional nine-footers. They predicted  waves of two to three feet in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties and two to  four feet, with a maximum five or six feet, in Los Angeles and San Diego  counties.  </P></p>

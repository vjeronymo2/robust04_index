			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Credit cards Barclaycard's offer to take over balances from other cards at a discount looks baffling when it already has a market share of 38 per cent by value and is recruiting new customers at record rates. There is no immediate threat from newcomers to the market - Barclaycard's link with Ford seems to have been an effective response to Vauxhall's GM card. Then again, the offer is not quite as generous as it looks. There cannot be many low risk customers around who are also feckless enough to run up a balance of at least Pounds 3,000 on their credit cards when cheaper forms of borrowing are available elsewhere. Barclaycard's campaign may keep its public profile up, but the offer looks unlikely to cost that much. Still Barclaycard's tactics do reveal a reluctance to take on board the notion that its business might grow even faster if it were prepared to cut its prices. There must be some resistance to an annualised percentage rate of nearly 22 when base rates are a mere 5 1/4 per cent. Since most banks want to lend more and the consumer sector offers a better prospect of loan growth than the corporate sector, the chances are that margins on credit card lending will come under pressure. At that point profits will become harder to earn, even if there is some reduction of bad debts in the recovery.</p>

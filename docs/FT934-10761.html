			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Ukraine foreign currency curb President Leonid Kravchuk yesterday banned the buying and selling of foreign currency in Ukraine, closing down all auction centres and exchange points, writes Jill Barshay from Kiev. Hard currency exchange transactions are now confined to government-authorised imports and exports. The decree was the latest in a series, which this week has increased the government's control on the economy, dashing hopes that Mr Kravchuk might try to introduce market reforms before parliamentary and presidential elections due next year.</p>

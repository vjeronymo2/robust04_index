			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PADRES SUMMON BENES AFTER ASTROS POUND ON SCHULZE  </P> <P> Third base was supposed to be a Padre problem. And a power hitter. As spring  turned into summer, Manager Jack McKeon wanted another power hitter.  </P> <P> But on Tuesday evening in San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, the Padres were forced  to deal with a problem they didn't anticipate during those optimistic days of  spring training.  </P> <P> Pitching.  </P> <P> Don Schulze, obtained from the New York Yankees July 22 and thrust into the  lineup to replace Walt Terrell, lasted four innings, allowing two home runs.  Houston hit two more homers on this night, but by then, things were long since  decided as the Padres lost to Houston, 12-3, in front of 16,988.  </P> <P> And with a doubleheader Friday against Atlanta and the Padres currently eight  games behind first-place San Francisco, the Padres made a move to solve their  pitching woes after the game. They summoned Andy Benes, the nation's No. 1 pick  in the June 1988 free agent draft, from Las Vegas (triple A). They also  recalled right-hander Dan Murphy (6-9, 4.20 ERA at Las Vegas).  </P> <P> To make room, they dispatched Fred Toliver (7.07 earned-run average) and Dave  Leiper (5.02 ERA) to Las Vegas.  </P> <P> Benes will start one of the games of Friday's doubleheader.  </P> <P> "We saw him in spring training, and he's got an arm," McKeon said. "We wanted  to be patient with him, because he's big in our future. But now is the perfect  opportunity. We need a pitcher for Friday."  </P> <P> Benes was 2-1 at Las Vegas with an 8.10 ERA. He allowed 41 hits in 26 2/3  innings. He started the season at Wichita (double A), where he was  overpowering, going 8-4 with a 2.16 ERA.  </P> <P> Greg Harris will make his final start on Thursday and then be sent back to the  bullpen, where he has pitched well this season. McKeon said he may go with a  four-man rotation for awhile.  </P> <P> Five Padre pitchers served up four Houston home runs Tuesday. And what was  almost as troubling was four Padre errors.  </P> <P> None of which helped the depleted pitching staff.  </P> <P> Two-fifths of the rotation that began the season for the Padres has  disappeared. Terrell is in Yankee pinstripes and Eric Show was knocked out for  the season by back surgery.  </P> <P> Into their places came Schulze and Harris. Schulze, 26, was 2-0 before  Tuesday's debacle despite a soaring 4.09 earned-run average. He lasted six  innings in his first start as a Padre, against the Dodgers, and five on Aug. 3  against Atlanta.  </P> <P> Harris, meanwhile, left a gaping hole in the Padre bullpen when he moved into  the starting rotation. Basically, Mark Grant and Mark Davis are the only  relievers McKeon has any confidence in. Before Tuesday, Toliver last appeared  in a game on July 30. So did Leiper, who came in in the eighth.  </P> <P> Here's how much confidence McKeon had in Toliver: With Houston ahead, 6-0, in  the fourth Tuesday and the game seemingly out of reach, Toliver got up to warm  up in the bullpen. Then the Padres scored three runs to pull within reach. So  Grant got up, and Toliver sat down.  </P> <P> Toliver finally got in after Grant allowed four runs on three hits in two  innings of work, running the score to 10-3. Toliver walked the first batter he  faced, Gerald Young, then watched Craig Biggio drill a pitch over the  right-field fence to make it 12-3.  </P> <P> Toliver, though, had a few things to say before he left.  </P> <P> "I'm a starter," he said. "You don't pitch this kind of arm every 13 days. I'm  a competitor. I know how to win. I don't like sitting. You have to use me. I've  got to try and not be (angry) and hold back the tears. I'm an athlete.  </P> <P> "I didn't go to a rehab center. I don't do drugs. I'm a good guy. Somebody's  going to give me the ball."  </P> <P> Schulze (2-1) started things Tuesday by allowing a two-run home run to Glenn  Davis in the first and a three-run homer to Davis in the fourth.  </P> <P> Then Grant gave up a three-run homer to Ken Caminiti in the sixth. And Toliver  served a two-run homer to Craig Biggio.  </P> <P> "We just got out-homered, guys," McKeon said. "No question about that."  </P> <P> Just three National League teams totaled fewer than Houston's 63 homers  entering Tuesday's game.  </P> <P> Houston starter Jim Clancy (6-9), meanwhile, was able to withstand a Padre  rally in the fourth and ease to a win. It was his third victory over the Padres  this year.  </P> <P> Schulze started out smoothly, getting Houston's two leadoff Craigs, Biggio and  Reynolds, to ground to shortstop. But then, trouble started on a ground ball to  first.  </P> <P> Jack Clark backhanded it, but his flip to Schulze, who was covering first, was  low and wide. Schulze couldn't get his 6-foot-3 frame down in time, and the  ball bounded off his glove. Schulze was given the error, and the Astros were  still alive in the first.  </P> <P> Davis proved that by taking a one-and-one Schulze pitch over the left-center  field fence for his 26th home run of the season.  </P> <P> Defensively, it got worse before it got better for the Padres. In the second  inning, Gerald Young reached first when Clark fielded his bleeder and then  dropped it while trying to make the throw.  </P> <P> In the third, with Doran on first, Davis hit a sharp grounder to shortstop  Garry Templeton. The ball, as well as a potential double play, skipped between  Templeton's legs.  </P> <P> Terry Puhl followed with a single, scoring Doran and sending Davis to second.  Here, the Padres -- and Schulze -- finally got a break.  </P> <P> Caminiti hit your basic, routine single off the left-field wall. It easily  would have been a double had the bases not been clogged with unsure Astros.  Davis only advanced as far as third, thus halting the activity around the rest  of the bases.  </P> <P> Schulze then struck out Billy Hatcher, and got Young to fly to left. Davis  tagged up on the fly, but Carmelo Martinez threw a perfect one-hopper to  catcher Benito Santiago, who made a sweeping tag in time to double up Davis.  </P> <P> So Houston had three runs, none of them earned.  </P> <P> That lasted until the fourth, when Schulze met Davis for the third time. With  Clancy standing on second and Biggio on first, Davis hit another one-and-one  pitch even farther into the left-center field bleachers than the first. It was  6-0, Astros, and time was about out for Schulze and the Padres.  </P> <P> But remember, Clancy was the man who started against the Cincinnati Reds last  week when the Reds struck for 14 runs and 16 hits in the first inning of a game  in Cincinnati. And in the Padre fourth, he reverted to that form.  </P> <P> Templeton, Gwynn and Clark led off with singles, with Templeton scoring on  Clark's hit. Then Chris James doubled to left, extending his hitting streak to  a career-high 12 games and driving in Gwynn to make it 6-2.  </P> <P> Martinez struck out looking at a full-count pitch before Mike Pagliarulo  grounded to short, giving Clark time to cross the plate while James advanced to  third. Santiago, though, flied to left to end the inning.  </P> <P> But Houston scored again in the sixth on a run-scoring Doran single and another  three-run homer, this one by Caminiti. It came off Grant and made the score  10-3.  </P> <P> The final runs were scored in the seventh, when Biggio hit the two-run homer  off Toliver.  </P> <P> Padre Notes  </P> <P> Mike Scott, the winningest pitcher in the major leagues with a 17-6 record, is  doubtful for Thursday's scheduled start for the Astros against the Padres.  Scott reinjured his left hamstring warming up in the bullpen before Saturday's  7-0 loss at San Francisco. "It will be a miracle if he pitches," Manager Art  Howe said. . . Entering Tuesday's game, Houston outfielders had hit just six  home runs in 1,250 at-bats. Padre backup catcher Mark Parent has six homers in  117 at bats. . . . The Giants' announcement that pitcher Dave Dravecky,  recovering from surgery to remove a malignant tumor from his left arm, will  start Thursday impressed McKeon. "If there's a guy who could do it, he'd be the  guy," McKeon said. "He has so much faith in himself, and he has a tremendous  positive attitude. And, he worked like hell to get to this point. He's a real  special guy. Just going out there is enough -- for him to throw that first  pitch will be quite an accomplishment." . . . Sandy Alomar Jr. went four for  five Monday night for triple-A Las Vegas to extend his hitting streak to 18  games. Alomar, who is batting .479 (35 for 73) during the streak, raised his  season average to .307. He has 90 runs batted in.  </P></p>

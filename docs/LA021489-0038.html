			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PRICE TO CHALLENGE SUSPENSION TODAY  </P> <P> Jerome Price, a standout basketball player for University City High who was  declared ineligible for the remainder of the season, plans to challenge his  suspension in a hearing today at the San Diego Superior Court.  </P> <P> Price was declared ineligible Feb. 3 by San Diego Section Commissioner Kendall  Webb following Price's participation in the Gus Macker three-on-three  basketball tournament in San Diego.  </P> <P> According to Webb, Price, one of six players to lose eligibility for playing in  the tournament, violated California Interscholastic Federation Rule 600, which  states: "A student on a high school team becomes ineligible if the student  competes in a contest on an 'outside' team, in the same sport, during the  student's high school season of sport."  </P> <P> "From the CIF viewpoint, it's very clear that a violation has taken place,"  said Webb Monday, adding that this is the first time he has been challenged on  a decision involving "Rule 600" during his 13 years as the San Diego Section  commissioner.  </P> <P> Price's attorney, Tim MacNeil, said the rule needs to be more clearly defined,  and the three-on-three style of basketball played in the Gus Macker Tournament  is "entirely different" from full-court high school basketball.  </P> <P> "I think it's much ado about nothing," MacNeil said. "Even if (Price) did play  in this tournament, what's the harm? I think the CIF has always drawn a hard  line. (The decision) seems unduly harsh to me."  </P> <P> John E. Mortimer, who will represent the CIF, said Monday that he had no  comment.  </P> <P> Price, a 6-foot junior guard/forward averaging nearly 16 points a game, was the  dominant offensive player on the team. University City (15-8, 5-3) is currently  a game out of first place in the City Western League but has lost two of three  games since Price's suspension. Tom Medigovich, University City's coach, said  he encouraged Price to take action because he felt it was unfair.  </P> <P> "I think it's a ridiculous ruling," Medigovich said. "It's like giving the  death penalty to someone who steals gum out of a store. I think (Webb) is not  in it for the kids, making a decision like that."  </P></p>

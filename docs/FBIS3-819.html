Robbie  Terreblanche reports:    Azapo [Azanian People's Organization], the local ANC  [African  National Congress], student organizations, and the Lawyers for  Human Rights organization are in the forefront of a campaign to  oust Dr. van der Walt from his post. Azapo says it rejects Dr.  van der Walt's appointment. A spokesman, Mr. Philip Kepadisa,  said that they will make Bophuthatswana ungovernable through  stayaway action and strikes. The ANC says Dr. van der Walt is a  companion of Mr. Mangope and has worked with Mr. Mangope to  oppose free political movement in Bophuthatswana. Lawyers for  Human Rights say they are drawing up a report of complaints  against Dr. van der Walt. This will be handed over to the  Transitional Executive Council later this week.</p>

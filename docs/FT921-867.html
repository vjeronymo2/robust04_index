			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (6): Dinosaur syndrome  -The troubled banking sector JAPANESE banks, until recently the behemoths of international banking, today look like dinosaurs, burdened by their huge size and very uncertain about their future. They are in a triple bind: capital is short, bad loans weigh heavily on their balance sheets and a slowdown in the Japanese economy is reducing opportunities to lend money at a profit. 'We are going to have a very hard time for the coming five years or so,' says Mr Tokio Inoue, a managing director of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Japan's largest bank. Bankers say it could take five years to get over the difficulties. Borrowers at home and abroad will find credit more difficult to secure than at any time since the 1970s - and more expensive. But the outlook is not wholly bad - the recession in Japan's financial markets is forcing banks to weed out unprofitable business and concentrate on profits. The stronger banks will remain formidable competitors in domestic and international markets. The weaker ones are in danger of losing their independence. Also, even though deregulation has reduced the Japanese authorities' ability to control the markets, both the Bank of Japan and the ministry of finance retain considerable reserves of power. They will try to make sure even in these difficult times Japan does not suffer the ignominy of its first post-war bank bankruptcy. Moreover, if Japanese banks are suffering, so are many international rivals, as shown by the recent credit crisis at Olympia and York, the Canadian-based world's largest property development company. After the Nikkei index's fall below 20,000, the banks' main concern is the effect of falling share prices on capital reserves. Under rules set by the Bank for International Settlements, Japanese banks are allowed to count as capital a portion of unrealised gains on their stock holdings. The lower the market falls, the smaller the unrealised gains. At 20,000, leading commercial banks are close to the 8 per cent ratio of capital to assets which the BIS set as a minimum. The BIS standard does not apply until next year. But banks cannot afford to wait until then to put their balance sheets in order - they must act now to cut asset growth and bolster capital. 'We are standing on the edge of a cliff,' says one leading banker. For the big city (commercial) banks asset growth has already fallen from more than 10 per cent a year in the late 1980s to around 5 per cent in the year to the end of March 1992, and could slip further next year. With the economy slowing and corporate cash levels high by historic standards, most of industry has yet to feel the squeeze. How soon the crunch comes will depend on how quickly the economy recovers. Meanwhile, unable to raise new equity because of the stock market's weakness, banks are defending balance sheets by securing subordinated loans, which count as capital under BIS rules. The city banks have raised around Y1,700bn in this financial year and plan to raise a further Y300bn or so by the month's end. This follows Y4,000bn raised in the 1990 year. Banks are also urgently trying to raise profitability, principally by widening lending margins. So basic business profits for the year to the end of March should rise sharply - by around 30 per cent for city banks, according to industry estimates. Pre-tax and net profits, which take account of loan write-offs, stock investment losses and other charges, will decline but not by as much as was once feared. The worst results among leading banks are likely to come from scandal-hit Fuji Bank, which has suffered losses associated with a fraudulent loan scheme, Fuji has forecast a 74.9 per cent decline in net profits to Y30bn. A poor result, but one that still leaves the bank in the black. If the economy fails to recover as soon as the government expects, then the threat of a squeeze on credit will recede. However, this will also bring banks little relief since slower economic growth will erode customers' profits and so push more borrowers into difficulties. Moreover, banks are also suffering from an overhang of bad and doubtful debts incurred during the speculative boom of the 1980s. Some, at least, of these loans will have to be written off against reserves - further eroding the banks' capital and reducing their ability to expand lending. As much as possible, banks will try to avoid write-offs by taking possession of land and stocks held as collateral and waiting for an opportunity to sell. Banks keep silent about the true extent of their problems: under Japanese regulations they are not required to publish figures for the size of bad and doubtful debts. The ministry of finance may change the rules next year but even then many problem debts are expected to stay hidden. Outside estimates of the bad and doubtful loans of leading banks range up to Y20,000bn. Some banks are much worse off than others. Long-term credit banks and trust banks generally have stronger BIS ratios than commercial banks. But their exposure to problem debtors is also bigger. For example, the Long-Term Credit Bank is a major creditor of EIE International, a debt-laden land and hotels group which recently revealed debt and asset restructuring plans. In the past, Japanese banks have relied on economic growth to pull them out of trouble by creating opportunities to sell debt-laden assets. This time, bankers will have a long wait before they can be sure that they are free of their problems.</p>

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / US brewer in Mexican deal ANHEUSER-Busch, the giant American brewer has agreed to buy 18 per cent of Grupo Modelo, Mexico's largest brewer, for about Dollars 477m (Pounds 335m). The deal would represent one of the largest foreign equity investments in Mexico, and the first in the tightly controlled beer market. Mr Juan Sanchez Navarro, vice-president of Modelo, said the joint venture 'is an example of strategic associations that will be increasingly seen in other sectors' as Mexican businesses gear up for the implications of free trade in North America. Modelo's only rival in Mexico, Femsa, is also looking for a foreign partner in its soft drink and beer businesses. Under the terms of the venture, Anheuser-Busch will buy a 10 per cent stake in Grupo Modelo and another 10 per cent in its fully-owned subsidiary Diblo, giving it an effective 17.7 per cent of the Modelo Group. After Anheuser acquires its stake, the privately controlled Grupo Modelo intends to seek a listing on the Mexican stock market. It plans to issue 13 per cent of its capital split equally between Mexican and international markets, for which it hopes to receive around Dollars 270m. Modelo controls 51 per cent of Mexico's domestic beer market and makes Mexico's best selling international beer, Corona. It has sales of around Dollars 1.5bn, making it the tenth biggest brewer in the world. Exports - to 56 countries - are worth Dollars 150m. Anheuser has an option to increase its stake to 35 per cent. It will take three seats on Modelo's board of directors, while Modelo will have one on Anheuser's. The two companies will exchange personnel and information in areas such as finances, marketing and distribution. Modelo will remain the sole importer of Anheuser beer, including the Budweiser brand, continuing an agreement it has had since 1989. Because of Modelo's existing contractual agreements in the US, Anheuser will not import Modelo beer into the US. But Corona will work more closely with Anheuser in exports to Europe and other markets. Mr Sanchez Navarro said the money raised from the stake will help finance Modelo's eighth brewery, which is being built in Zacatecas, Mexico. This will be Mexico's largest brewery and will benefit from Anheuser's technology.</p>

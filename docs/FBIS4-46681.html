			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Shprygin, president of the Center for Study </F> of the Conditions of Prices and the Market (Tsenakor) of  EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN, corresponding member of the Russian Academy  of Economic Sciences: "Price as a Lever of Financial  Stabilization"]    [Text] In countries with a developed market economy,  stabilization of the financial system and support for the  processes of the normal functioning of the market are realized  by means of a whole system of economic levers, a key place among  which is occupied by prices.    Prices operate simultaneously both as an important  instrument  of control and as an object of government regulation. Having  liberated prices, Russia abandoned both, finding itself, in  fact, thereby the sole country which had taken the path of  complete self-elimination of the state from a controlling impact  on prices. This was quickly reflected in the results of  management in a thousandfold-plus growth of prices of almost all  commodities produced in the country and the complete  disorganization of control of the economy. Inasmuch as prices  under acute shortage conditions compensate enterprises for  virtually all product costs, prices have ceased under the  current irrational production structure to influence qualitative  changes in production.    As a result we are increasingly acquiring a warped economy.  What under normal conditions, according to the laws of the  market economy, should be efficient and, in keeping with this,  have high prices is in our deformed production structure proving  cheap, and the less efficient product, more costly.    As a consequence, the production structure of Russia is  becoming increasingly less efficient and is lagging increasingly  noticeably behind countries with a controlled market economy  like the United States, Japan, the FRG, and others. There are  simultaneously increasing contradictions between the interests  of individual enterprises and the long-term interests of all of  society. This is being manifested particularly graphically in  the sphere of investments, when long-term investments in  production, which are beneficial from the viewpoint of the  national economy as a whole, are proving disadvantageous from  the viewpoint of the current interests of private entrepreneurs.  As a result, whereas countries with controlled prices have an  opportunity to influence with them inefficient industries and  thereby effect progressive structural transformations, we are  increasingly losing this opportunity.    There are today few people who believe that under the  current  conditions the market is capable independently, without the  intervention of the state, of effectively regulating the  proportions of the national economy. The production and  financial disproportions have become so deep that continuation  of the chosen price policy makes it, in view of its destructive  nature, not only pointless but also dangerous for the economic  system. These disproportions cannot be rectified by means of an  improvement in the financial system alone inasmuch as the state  thereof, in turn, depends on the state of the system of prices  itself. Their rectification, together with the use of methods of  market regulation, requires the active intervention of the state  in the regulation of pricing processes. We can hardly, for  example, agree with the current pricing practice, whereby  significant amounts of national income created in agriculture  and the fuel sectors are via the prices of the products coming  into these sectors being withdrawn from them, and then the  state, by means of a variety of privileges and subsidies,  returns to these sectors the funds withdrawn from them.  Specifically, by means at this time of a nonequivalent increase  in the efficiency of products thanks to an increase in the price  (not counting inflation) of metal, mechanical engineering  products, electric power, and timber approximately 14 percent of  the national income created in coal industry is being withdrawn  from this sector, and then, by means of the establishment of a  special tax on the prices of the products of the other sectors,  the state returns to this sector some of the national income  withdrawn from it. What, one wonders, is the point of  introducing special taxes and thereby ratcheting up the already  high inflation even more when all questions connected with the  assurance of normal economic conditions for the functioning of  the sector may be settled by means of the establishment of  prices objectively estimating the equivalence of exchange of the  results of labor between sector and the utility of the product  they create? Unfortunately, this is not being done.    Approximately the same situation is taking shape in certain  other sectors of natural resource use also.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Amounts of National Income Withdrawn Via Prices, %                           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |1988-1990                |1992-1993                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Agriculture[.sup]1[/]  |37                       |41                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Coal industry[.sup]2[/]|12                       |14                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Oil-producing and petrol-|31                       |32                       |  |eum-refining sectors[.sup]|                         |                         |  |3[/]                  |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Timber[.sup]4[/]       |16                       |16                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Note: Per volume supplied to the sector of products of: 1, 2 = mechanical en-|  |gineering, timber and electric power and metal products; 3 = mechanical engi-|  |neering; 4 = machine building, fuel.                                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      It is not surprising that these sectors are permanently in a  difficult economic situation and are experiencing a chronic  shortage of financial resources. Whereas the sectors of natural  resource use are losing a substantial part of national income,  it is accumulating in surplus in certain manufacturing sectors,  on the other hand. Thus in mechanical engineering surplus  national income in connection with the higher rate of growth of  prices compared with the increase in the efficiency (consumer  properties) of the machinery, not counting inflation,  constitutes approximately 35 percent, and in commerce, 60  percent. As a result, whereas the efficiency of the sectors of  natural resource use is declining on account of the permanent  shortage of financial resources, the efficiency of the  manufacturing sectors, mechanical engineering particularly, is  declining as a consequence of their reduced competitiveness  caused by the disproportionate growth of product efficiency by  increased prices.    Whereas here mechanical engineering withdraws to its  advantage via prices per comparable amounts of exchangeable  products from the fuel sectors, power engineering, iron and  steel industry, timber industry, and other sectors of the  national economy up to 40-45 percent altogether of the national  income created in these sectors, it, in turn, redistributes some  of the national income created in it (up to 10 percent) to the  servicing sectors. With such a price policy the financial system  becomes extremely muddled and increasingly less capable, and  cost proportions and the actual picture of the aggregate product  created in the sectors are distorted. As a result, all  incentives to labor are lost and the fledgling market relations  are destroyed.    The state must determine for the market, therefore, insofar  as it is not yet itself in a position to do this efficiently,  progressive price proportions in the exchange of what are for it  the most important products. But it must not compel the  manufacturer to make products which are unprofitable for him.  The manufacturer himself should decide what kind of products he  will manufacture. We see also in the determination of basic  price proportions the state's role as equal participant in  market relations. It should in this connection occupy a more  active position in the harmonization of price proportions and  the estimates of the costs of labor in its exchange between  sectors and the most important industries inasmuch as the  objectiveness of the commensuration of the costs and the results  of labor depend on this, and the justification of the levels of  pay, pensions, allowances, and other monetary payments are  likewise dependent. It has to be stated that in connection with  the growth in price disproportions the value assessment of the  labor of employees of the base sectors of the national economy  frequently proves to be unjustifiably understated compared with  the labor of employees of the nonproduction spheres. Thus the  value assessment of the heavy and dangerous labor of miners and  iron and steel industry workers, counting withholdings from pay,  constitutes at the present time approximately 45 percent of the  valuation of the labor of employees of commerce, who receive  their pay immediately following the sale of a commodity. As far,  on the other hand, as the valuation of the labor of a scientist  is concerned, it constitutes an even lesser value--26 percent.  Thus as a result of the distortion of the price proportions  directly influencing the proportions of distribution of the  national income into the accumulation fund and consumption fund  and, thereby, the proportions of remuneration, the employees of  the base sectors of the national economy have come to be the  least socially protected. It is not surprising that it is in the  sectors of material production that the greatest decline in  productivity is occurring and that a recession is observed.    In need of government regulation today are the price  proportions of the sectors of the fuel and energy complex,  transport, and the base industries of mechanical engineering and  also the price proportions between agriculture and industry,  which are today shaping up to the disadvantage of agriculture  and throwing its economy back to the level of the end of the  1970's.    Agriculture has always been a sector at whose expense other  sectors of the national economy have developed, which has left  its mark on its production structure and led to the engineering  backwardness of the sector. As a result, the sector cannot  compete in many processes with other countries.    There is in the agriculture of Russia today a production  structure and specialization of production engineering processes  which took shape under the conditions of the business relations  of the former USSR with a command system of management, when it  was planned for each kolkhoz and sovkhoz what would be produced  when and in what quantity and to whom the products would be  supplied. This production structure was oriented toward  large-scale production, to whose servicing industry was adapted  also.    We have to come to terms with this. It is essential also to  consider that agriculture is tied to land which farms have  cultivated for many decades and which has, therefore, techniques  adapted to the production of strictly defined crops. Changing  this production structure which has evolved in the  agro-industrial complex will take much time and large resources,  which the state does not have.    Agriculture cannot under these conditions be approached with  the same yardsticks of price liberalization with which we  approached industry, especially since in respect to industry  this policy has proven ineffective. With its technical  backwardness and inadequate competitiveness, agriculture will be  in need of government support for a long time to come.    The efficiency of the government's price policy in respect  to  agriculture, therefore, consists not, having set free prices in  this sector, in distancing itself from the support of  agriculture as quickly as possible but in creating by means of  price privileges and a variety of preferences incentives to the  concentration of the production of agricultural produce in the  most favorable areas of its commodity production.    A most effective way of influencing production is the  stimulation by prices of resource-saving, and via this, a  reduction in the product's prime costs, that is, developing  production thanks to economies in resources approximately 3-3.5  times more cheaply than thanks to the development of new  deposits and the attraction of new resources.    The acquisition by the state of extra revenue thanks to a  reduction in prime production costs, not thanks to an increase  in prices, should be the main direction of the price and  financial policy of the state. It is essential in this  connection to return to the practice, which existed previously  and which gave a positive account of itself, of the  determination of ceiling prices showing the upper limits of  prices within which the purchase of products is for the consumer  efficient. This would enhance the role of the consumers in  pricing processes and simultaneously prompt the manufacturers to  reduce production costs.    World market prices are a special question. Many economists  are speaking of the need for the prices of the domestic market  to be aligned with those of world markets. But this cannot be  done. So-called "world" prices are the national prices of  individual countries reflecting the production costs that exist  in these countries and their technical development levels and  also the correlations that exist in these countries in the  levels of the remuneration of employees and incapable members of  society, which with us, as shown above, are distorted. In this  connection, adapting our domestic prices to the prices of other  countries, we would not only destroy the business ties and  techniques that have been created with great difficulty over  many years and thereby undermine production even more but also  conclusively destroy the economy.    The transition to market relations requires a linkage  between  the pricing processes occurring at the macrolevel and prices at  the level of enterprises, individual territories, commodity  manufacturers, and the consumers. In order to protect the  interests of each participant in social production against any  arbitrary action, against the unwarranted intervention of the  state in pricing processes included, it is essential to draw up  a special pricing law by analogy with the laws that exist in all  countries with a developed market economy. Without this, the  current chaos in the economy will continue.</p>

The  delegation includes seven senators. While they were in Hanoi,  six senators of the delegation met with Vietnamese and foreign  press men. Following is the report about this press conference,  held in Hanoi on Sunday:    At the press conference, all American senators welcomed the  Vietnamese Government and people's goodwill in cooperation with  the United States side to settle the MIA issue. They called on  the U.S. President, Mr. Bill Clinton, to lift the economic  sanctions against Vietnam and set up diplomatic relations with  Vietnam. Senator Bennett Johnston, a Democrat from Louisiana  who is chairman of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources  Commission, said:    [Begin Johnston recording] It is very clear that the  Vietnamese have been cooperative -- most of the way if not all  the way -- and the way to reward cooperation is not by  punishment. An embargo is punishment -- it is a sanction -- and  the punishment ought to stop, and start a new chapter. [end  recording]    Senator Johnston noted that as Vietnam has been very  cooperative in the settlement of the MIA issue, the U.S.  Administration should respond to this goodwill. The embargo  should be lifted. He added that Washington should close the  past and reconcile with Vietnam. It was in the interests of the  families whose sons were reported missing during the war in  Vietnam. He noted that there was no obstacle for President  Clinton to lift the embargo.    For his part, Senator Mark Hatfield, a Republican from  Oregon, noted that the lifting of the embargo and trading with  Vietnam would promote a true sense of the settlement of the MIA  issue, which is the most concerned issue of Americans.    On impressions of his visit to Vietnam, Senator Bennett  Johnston said:    [Begin Johnston recording] There is tremendous vitality and  energy in this country. That is the first thing you notice --  activity everywhere; entrepreneurship everywhere. It's the kind  of thing you saw in China a few years ago, and of course China  is now an economic miracle of Asia. I would expect that  economic miracle to take place here. The second impression is  the friendliness of the Vietnamese people toward us -- toward  Americans; toward the United States. You can't hide that sort  of thing and you can't fake it. And that came through very  clear. [end recording]</p>

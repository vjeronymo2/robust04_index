			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing May 27 ITAR-TASS -- Russian Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin and Chinese Premier Li Peng on Friday held  talks in Beijing. The agenda covered aspects of political,  trade, economic, scientific, and military technical interaction  of the two countries.    Before the two delegations sat down at the negotiating  table,  Chernomyrdin and Li Peng had a one-to-one conversation. "Russia  and China -- for all the differences of their internal  conditions -- have identical purposes of creating full fledged  social-market economies and integrating in the world economy,"  the Russian prime minister said.    Chernomyrdin praised the results of cooperation between  Moscow and Beijing last year when the value of bilateral  commodity turnover reached a record-high amount of 7.68 billion  dollars, but admitted that problems still existed which impeded  the free development of mutually beneficial Russo-Chinese ties.  He pointed to certain economic difficulties, the shortfalls in  agreements and the backwardness of transport communications and  infrastructures.    We think it advisable to strengthen the role of the centre  in  our trade and economic relations. We should also think about  upgrading the level of cooperation," he said.    The Russian prime minister recalled that more than one half  of trade exchanges between Russia and China is carried out as a  simple commodity exchange. "This form is exhausting itself ever  more," he stressed.    According to Viktor Chernomyrdin, the economic ties between  Russia and China can be made more effective by investments of  entrepreneurial capital. A case in point is the use of Russian  natural resources and the building of agricultural projects.    Another promising direction, according to Chernomyrdin, is  the creation of a flexible banking infrastructure and  interaction in the field of civil aviation, nuclear power  engineering and peaceful uses of space.    As concerns border issues, the chairman of the government of  the Russian Federation pointed to the significance of their  resolution in the interests of the further strengthening of  bilateral relations. This work continues, he said.    The head of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Russian  Federation assured the Chinese premier that Moscow's position  with regard to Taiwan is immutable. "We proceed from the  assumption that only one China exists, and Taiwan is its  inalienable part. Russia does not maintain official interstate  relations with the island," he stressed.    Chernomyrdin invited Li Peng to pay an official visit to  Russia.    In his opening address to the two delegations, the Chinese  premier said good mutual understanding relating to many problems  had been achieved during his one-to-one conversation with  Chernomyrdin. He expressed the hope that Sino-Russian  cooperation would develop, particularly in the economic sphere.    "China and Russia are great powers. The Chinese and Russian  peoples are great nations. The two countries have a common  border. China is interested in a steady expansion of  comprehensive relations with Russia," Li Peng stressed.    He emphasized in particular the significance of the inter-  governmental agreement, the signing of which will become "a big  step" forward towards the turning of the Russo-Chinese frontier  in an area of peace and friendship."    The head of the Chinese Government also expressed the hope  that friendly relations between the Chinese people's republic  and the Russian Federation would strengthen peace in the whole  world.    As concerns trade and economic cooperation, the two sides  agreed that the economies of China and Russia are "largely  complementary" and expressed the desire to further expand this  interaction, Li Peng said.    Russo-Chinese inter-governmental agreements were signed as a  result of the talks.</p>

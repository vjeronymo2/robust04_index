			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Leading Article: A government on the run EVEN AS formidable a politician as Michael Heseltine, president of the Board of Trade, cannot make yet another retreat look like a victory. Last week the government insisted that 31 pits should close at once. Now it offers at least a three-month reprieve to 21 of those previously condemned. Regardless of the merits of the case, such a defeat must be damaging. The UK would not be better off under a mob rule of craven Conservatives and backward-looking socialists, baying for more inflation and the preservation of any job, however unneeded. The government has to impose itself upon events once more. The dangers of a total loss of credibility are now severe. A firmly worded commitment has once more proved to be written on water. Will a government so terrified of its backbenchers be able to carry the Maastricht treaty through the House of Commons? Will it be able to close redundant London hospitals, any more than redundant pits? Will it be able to control public spending? Will it, in fact, be able to govern? Even over coal, more defeats may be on the way. First, the government will have to get its revised programme through the House of Commons. Then it will have to endure months of questioning over the closure of the pits that have been given a reprieve. These will be months of demonstrations, months of petitions, months of dismay on the Conservative backbenches and months of wobbling on the frontbenches. Long-term goal The coal saga demonstrates the political advantages of privatisation. It is partly because the government is held responsible for the coal industry that a fairly straightforward industrial decision has created such a political storm. It is partly because adjustment to economic reality was resisted so long that much of the coal industry still seems to be unviable. Neither consideration exculpates the political ineptness of the announcement of these closures. But it does justify the government's longer term aim of creating a normal private industry out of nationalised British Coal. The economic case for closures seems equally persuasive, at least at first sight. Keynes once argued that, short of any better cure for a recession, people should be paid to dig up bottles full of pound notes that had first been sunk into the ground. Paying people to dig up coal that is destined for ever growing stocks would be just as foolish. By now it should have been accepted, even in the UK, that it makes better sense to pay people to produce goods and services that someone actually wants, even in a recession. Independent review Unfortunately, the government's economic case has a large hole in it. Because of the botched electricity privatisation, it is impossible to be confident that the 'dash for gas' is economically sensible. Moreover, while the past militancy of the miners may justify some diversification of energy supplies, the subsidising of nuclear power can hardly be justified at anything like current levels. It is because of the disquiet over the structure of the electricity industry that the Labour party's proposal for an independent review of the coal closures is appealing and may prove persuasive. If the political costs of yet another government climb-down could be ignored, it would make good sense to postpone the decision on coal until after a public review of the implications of the structure of the electricity industry for the efficient use of alternative fuels. Politically, a review would also postpone the evil day of further closures, perhaps to a time when an economic upswing is in evidence. Economically, a thorough review would be the occasion for remedying the defects in electricity privatisation. On its merits, this is an option well worth considering. It would also be another defeat. Since the government has picked a fight with the wrong enemy at the wrong time, further defeat may even be inevitable. All such defeats are damaging to the capacity to govern, which is why it is important to choose one's ground wisely. But what the government most needs is an overall economic strategy. With one, its effectiveness might survive still more compromises over the coal closures. Without one, it is in serious trouble.</p>

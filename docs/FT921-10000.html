			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: It's time to top-up your Tessas HOLDERS of Tessas (tax-exempt special savings accounts) should be topping them up on the anniversary of their opening. As well as the Pounds 3,000 maximum for the first year, a further Pounds 1,800 can be deposited during the second. Yearly instalments paid into the Tessa can build up to the maximum of Pounds 9,000 in the fifth year. Interest will be earned tax-free if you keep in the capital for the full five-year term. However, you can draw net interest during that period and the balance of the interest will be paid on maturity. Obviously, the best returns are on maximum deposits, but the largest banks and building societies are allowing savers to open Tessas with as little as Pounds 1. Christine Bayliss, investment editor of Moneyfacts, points out: 'On small amounts, the interest paid on many Tessas is often far better than the similar rate on normal savings accounts. Even without the tax relief, many of them would still be best buys.' As the table shows, gross Tessa rates vary between 10.5 per cent and 11.4 per cent, compared with 2.35 per cent and 7.4 per cent on ordinary savings accounts. Abbey National's Tessa pays 11.1 per cent on just Pounds 1, for example, compared with 4.8 per cent on its Instant Saver account. The best Abbey Instant Saver rate is 9.35 per cent - and that is obtainable only on deposits of Pounds 25,000 or more. Given these rates, savers should take a close look at using Tessas as an ordinary savings account. The difference is that you will not have multiple access to your deposit. The effect of drawing out the capital will result in the Tessa being closed and you will receive a net rate of interest on the deposit. But, as we have seen, this will be substantially higher than the rate a taxpayer would receive on the ordinary savings accounts. There are two main ways of treating the Tessa like an ordinary savings account. One is to be careful to put aside small amounts of money that you know you will not need. Many people are tempted to put in more into a Tessa than they can afford and then find they have to draw on the capital, resulting in closure of the account. Another way is simply to open a Tessa knowing you might not be able to run it for its five-year term. If you were to put in, say, Pounds 2,000 for one year in Abbey's Tessa, you would receive the net rate of interest of 8.325 per cent, amounting to Pounds 166.50 (assuming the present rate holds). The same amount in the tiered Instant Saver account would earn 5.93 per cent net, or Pounds 118.60 - Pounds 47.90 less than on the same amount in the Tessa. Also, there is nothing to stop you taking out a new Tessa later to gain the same advantage. Using Tessas in this way is, however, against the spirit in which the scheme was devised, which was to encourage long-term savings, and banks and building societies may devise penalties to prevent depositors doing it. It is also important to ask about any early-closure penalty. At the moment, it is usually just the loss of gross interest, but there could be an adminstration fee as well.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        TESSAS VS SAVINGS ACCOUNTS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  Savings Accounts    Min dep     Tessa     Min dep                  Rate (Percent)      (Pounds)    Rate      (Pounds)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Abbet Nat            4.8                1        11.1         1 Barclays             5.0                1        11.0        25 Lloyds               5.0                1        10.5       100 Midland              6.89               1        11.0       100/10pm Nat West             4.58               1        10.5         1 Halifax              3.0               50        11.4        50 Nationwide           7.4                1        10.9        25 Woolwich             2.35               1        10.75       25 All &amp; Leic           3.90              10        10.9        10 Leeds Perm           5.05              25        10.55       25  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Moneyfacts.

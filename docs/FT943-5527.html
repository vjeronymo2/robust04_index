			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Years of debate fuel compromise: Tim Coone on Sinn Fein negotiation and the development of its 'unarmed strategy' The IRA's decision this week to call an end to its 25-year military campaign comes after well over three years' intense debate in the republican movement about how its aims might be achieved by an 'unarmed strategy'. Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, was given responsibility for developing that strategy in a resolution passed at its 1991 party conference. While developing its strategy it has been overhauling its party structure and organisation. It has reorganised in the Irish Republic on a constituency basis rather than a county one - it was already organised on a constituency basis in the north. In the north it has performed strongly since losing its one parliamentary seat - Belfast West - in the 1992 general election. In May's local elections it took 23.2 per cent of the vote in Belfast, the biggest share for any party. Across the province its vote rose 1.5 percentage points to 12.5 per cent, taking 51 council seats out of the 582 total. In the European elections its support in Northern Ireland advanced by 1 percentage point to 10 per cent. In the June local elections in the republic this year Sinn Fein won a series of council seats in areas it had not contested before, finishing ahead of the conservative Progressive Democrats party. The discussion document of the party's national executive - Towards a Lasting Peace in Ireland - unveiled at the 1992 annual conference, said a permanent peace 'must involve at some future date the removal of British interference from the political equation in Ireland. There is an onus on those who proclaim that the armed struggle is counter-productive to advance a credible alternative. The development of such an alternative would be welcomed by Sinn Fein'. Since the launch of the document it would appear that alternative has emerged to the satisfaction of the republican leadership, in spite of the fact that the British government has not made the ending of partition a policy goal, as the document argued it must. That fact is perhaps the most significant and surprising in the IRA ceasefire decision, and indicative of the distance its has gone in reassessing the value of continuing the 'armed struggle'. Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, emphasised at a press conference in Dublin yesterday that the party's goal remained 'an end to British jurisdiction in Ireland and an end to partition'. But this should be achieved through negotiation and lead to an agreement 'which recognises and encourages the diversity of Irish people and which will earn their allegiance and respect'. Significantly, he said: 'That is how we would like to see the situation develop. Others may have different agendas and views. How it is concluded is a matter for agreement.' He emphasised that agreement would not be achieved without unionist participation in discussions. In effect, the IRA and Sinn Fein have acknowledged publicly that continuation of the military struggle is not the way forward, and that an all-inclusive negotiation process involving compromise might lead to something less than a united Ireland. Mr Adams yesterday laid out what he saw as the next steps in the process: The UK should lift the Sinn Fein broadcasting ban, as the Republic of Ireland did eight months ago. A monitoring procedure for the ceasefire should be established. The demilitarisation process should start immediately. Full protection should be provided for republicans who have been targeted by loyalists. All republican prisoners in the UK should be transferred to their home regions. Raids, searches and arrests in nationalist areas should stop. Closed border roads should be opened. 'Political' prisoners should be released - Mr Adams said this included both republican and loyalist prisoners 'and the small handful of British Army and RUC prisoners' who have been charged with offences. He said this 'might take time'. Dublin plans to set up its Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, which will involve Sinn Fein, by the end of October. A meeting between Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister and Mr Adams is likely in the next two weeks. Mr Tom Hartley, Sinn Fein's general secretary said: 'The ceasefire has created a great momentum. I envisage a series of developments resulting from that. This could take as much as one, maybe two years. Each one of those may create a crisis but they will be dealt with and we will move on.'</p>

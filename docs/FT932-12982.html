			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Legal advice in custody criticised FEWER THAN one in four people in police custody who request legal advice see a solicitor, the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice said yesterday. Most are seen by untrained, inexperienced staff - untrained clerks or former police officers or, less often, a trainee solicitor - and many receive incorrect advice. Very few know their adviser is unqualified. A report by the commission challenges claims by the police that defence advisers counsel clients to remain silent under questioning to win acquittals. It says only one in five suspects were advised to stay silent. Nearly half were told to co-operate, while a further 31 per cent were given no advice. Clients were generally advised to stay silent as a precaution because investigating officers refused to give information about their suspicions. The researchers, from Warwick University, spent six months observing interviews at police stations with clients of 17 large criminal legal aid firms in London and eight other cities and towns in the north, north-west, Midlands and East Anglia. They also shadowed freelance advisers - mostly ex-police officers - from three agencies used by defence solicitors to give cover at police stations. No attempt was made to match the seriousness of a case with the experience of advisers, the report said. Clerks were found to advise in cases involving murder, unlawful killing, robbery, aggravated burglary and arson, as well as small thefts, criminal damage, driving and public order offences. In almost half the cases, advisers spent less than 10 minutes in private consultation with their client. This meant most legal representatives agreed to police interviewing clients though they knew little about what the client might tell officers. Safeguards to stop compliant individuals making false or unjustified confessions were inadequate, the researchers said, and the right to silence should be strengthened rather than weakened.</p>

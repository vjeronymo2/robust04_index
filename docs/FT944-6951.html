			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Property: Autumn and fall - Cadogan's Place The chancellor is unlikely to bring pre-Christmas cheer to the property market on Tuesday. But he probably will not do anything to make matters worse. For the second year running the autumn trading season has dribbled away. Net sales in October, as measured by the Corporate Estate Agents Property Index (based on more than 4,000 offices), are 7.4 per cent down from September and 5.3 per cent down from October 1993. Two leading indices diverge on prices: the Nationwide calculates a rise of 0.7 per cent over the year to October, the Halifax a fall of 0.9 per cent. Not all the market is in the doldrums. Winkworth, which has 31 offices across London, has had higher sales month by month from January to October than in 1993. At the top end of the market, Jackson-Stops has sold Thornhaugh Hall estate in Cambridgeshire for above its guide price of Pounds 1.6m and, in Cornwall, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley sold Bar on the Helford Passage for 'significantly' above its guide of Pounds 1m. Farms have also done well, with the average value of land free of buildings rising 11.7 per cent in the first half of 1994 and 21.1 per cent in the year to June 1994, according to Savills. If a farm does not have an attractive house, says Richard Gayner of Carter Jonas, neighbouring farmers looking for economies of scale will be the buyers. That is not true for Bluey's Farm in the Chilterns near Marlow, however, which has a brick and timber 16th century farmhouse. It once belonged to Bluey Mavroleon of the Greek ship-owning family. It goes to auction in Henley-on-Thames with a guide price for six lots of more than Pounds 1.125m. Inquiries to Cole Flatt (0442-870444) or Lane Fox (071-499 4785). In the middle range of houses, Carter Jonas had a notable success in the auction of the former rectory at Swinbrook in Oxfordshire. At a guide of Pounds 400,000, it went for Pounds 592,000. The local family that bought it will have to spend a considerable sum doing it up. For regular sales, however, the price must be competitive. Pullen's End, a splendid large Victorian house in Oxford, was on the market for a week at Pounds 1m. Then realism prevailed. It is now on offer from John D Wood (0865-311522) at Pounds 700,000. Even romantics who want to live in castles are insisting on realistic prices. An illustration of how the market has changed is Broncroft Castle in the Corve valley, which Andrew Grant in Worcester sold recently. The asking price was Pounds 975,000. Four years ago it sold for Pounds 1.75m. In Blackheath, south-east London, a wing of Vanbrugh Castle designed for his own use by Sir John Vanbrugh, who was also the architect for Blenheim Palace and Castle Howard, is on offer from Winkworth (081-852 0999) for Pounds 395,000. Listed grade I, it has a big 32ft x 17ft drawing room with views across Greenwich Park to St Paul's Cathedral (on a clear day) and shares a two-acre garden with the other parts of the castle. Most romantic of all is a castellated dairy at Fort Putnam near Penrith in Cumbria. The 'fort' is one of three late 18th century 'folly farms' that the then Duke of Norfolk built on his estate at Greystoke Castle. A splendidly perverse Whig, he put them up to celebrate American victories in the War of Independence. One of the other follies is called Bunker Hill. Fort Putnam is listed grade II and is being converted to a two-bedroom cottage. It is at Pounds 75,000 from Lowther Scott-Harden (0768-64541).</p>

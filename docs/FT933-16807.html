			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Treasury boosts help for business THE TREASURY has set up a unit to co-ordinate policies to help industry, in a fresh sign that the department is attempting a cultural change to make it more sympathetic to wealth-creation. The new unit will have a roving commission to explore ways that Treasury policies could improve industrial competitiveness, for example by releasing funds for training, roads or railways. The change is designed to meet criticism from industry that the Treasury puts too many resources into control of public spending and not enough into understanding business. It has come about as part of a review of Treasury management by Sir Terence Burns, permanent secretary to the Treasury. The unit is headed by Mr Bill Guy, a senior Treasury official, and is part of the department's industry division. The Treasury said: 'Mr Guy will be taking an across-the-board look across all Treasury activities to make sure all the industrial issues are picked up.' The move comes after increasing recognition throughout Whitehall that government departments may need to reformulate policies to help industrial competitiveness, especially given the growing trade deficit. Part of the unit's job will be to act as a link between the Treasury and big companies, particularly manufacturers. Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said: 'This change is exactly what the Treasury needs.' Mr Neil Johnson, director-general of the Engineering Employers' Federation, said it was 'a step in the right direction'. Punitive credit insurance premiums on exports to Argentina and Lebanon are to be cut from today by NCM, the leading credit insurer in the UK. The company says the cuts are the first ever, and are intended to aid Britain's export effort. Analysis pointing to lower risks of default means that premiums currently at 6 per cent for Argentina are being cut to 3.5 per cent. For the Lebanon, the cut is from 6.33 per cent to 4.5 per cent.</p>

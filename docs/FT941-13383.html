			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Smith calls for interest rate cut Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, yesterday called for an immediate cut in interest rates to reduce the risk of the recovery being choked off by impending tax increases. Speaking in Bonn he urged the government to co-ordinate further interest rate reductions with Britain's European Union partners. 'This is particularly important in Britain where the Conservative government are forcing through massive tax increases which even the chancellor of the exchequer now admits will check the recovery,' he said. Addressing a 'Euro-conference' staged by Germany's SPD social democratic party, Mr Smith argued that the consequences of allowing recovery to falter were 'too serious to contemplate'. He said: 'The cohesion of our own communities is at stake. Recession and economic decline are clearly the breeding ground of crime, intolerance and racism. 'Europe cannot afford a downward spiral that would threaten not just our prosperity but our democratic way of life.' As MPs at Westminster began considering the finance bill implementing chancellor Mr Kenneth Clarke's first Budget, Mr Smith said the issues of jobs, investment and growth were back at the top of the economic agenda 'where they always should have been'. But he urged his audience not to let the right dominate the debate about jobs 'as they did over inflation in the 1980s'. Signalling one likely theme of Labour's European election campaign in June Mr Smith said there was a clear 'jobs battleground' ahead. 'It is a choice between a high-wage, high-tech, high-skilled route to the highest possible levels of employment and the Conservatives' low-paid, low-skilled, insecure, unsafe, deregulated economics of the sweatshop.' What was needed for Europe to prosper was a 'self-confident, adaptable, highly skilled and participative workforce,' Mr Smith said. 'None of these qualities will be present in a sweatshop economy that drives down wages, removes employment rights and relies on fear to provide flexibility at the workplace.' Touching on what has recently been a favourite subject of the Conservatives Mr Smith said economic recovery was also necessary for the EU to fulfil its wider responsibilities by doing 'all that we can to help the people of eastern and central Europe'.</p>

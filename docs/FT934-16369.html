			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: GAN bids for control of Canadian insurer GAN, the state-controlled French insurance company, yesterday mounted a bid to take full control of Simcoe Erie Investors, a Canadian insurance company in which it is a minority investor. GAN, the fourth largest insurer in France and one of the government's privatisation candidates, is offering CDollars 7.625 a share for the remaining shares in Simcoe Erie, valuing the company at CDollars 19.47m (USDollars 15m). GAN owns 21.6 per cent of the Canadian insurer. Simcoe Erie, which is based at Burlington in Ontario, is one of the 20 largest damage insurance companies in Canada with 600 employees. It made pre-tax profits of FFr14m (Dollars 2.4m) on turnover of FFr1.5bn in its last financial year to June 30. GAN, which has been more cautious than its French competitors in terms of international activity, described the Canadian deal as 'evidence of its willingness to expand into other countries'. It also sees the transaction as an eventual stepping stone into the US which has been closed to GAN because of restrictions over inward investment by public-sector companies.</p>

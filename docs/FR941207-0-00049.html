This action requires inspections to detect cracking of the surfaces of the outboard strut spring beam, and replacement of cracked spring beams. It also requires an inspection to detect damage to the structure that is adjacent to the cracked spring beam, and replacement of any cracked parts. This amendment is prompted by a report of failure of a spring beam due to cracking that was propagated by fatigue. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent failure of a spring beam, which could lead to loss of an outboard strut.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective on December 22, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of December 22, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before February 6, 1995. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;207&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Boeing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commercial Airplane Group, P.O.

Investigation revealed that cracking initiated at a flaw (porosity) in the material of the spring beam and propagated due to fatigue. The subject airplane was operated as a freighter and had accumulated 15,809 total flight cycles on the struts. This airplane was originally delivered with P&amp;W Model JT9D&hyph;3 engines and struts, but was later reconfigured with P&amp;W Model JT9D&hyph;70 engines and struts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Spring beams are used in place of midspar fittings on the outboard struts of all Model 747 series airplanes, except those equipped with P&amp;W Model JT9D&hyph;3 and &hyph;7 engines. (The P&amp;W Model JT9D&hyph;3 and &hyph;7 engines have midspar fittings at the outboard strut.) Airplanes equipped with P&amp;W Model JT9D&hyph;70 engines have spring beams that are made of titanium. All other spring beams are made of steel, which analyses and tests have shown to be more resistant to fatigue cracking than titanium spring beams.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fatigue cracking, if not corrected, could result in failure of a spring beam, which could lead to the loss of an outboard strut.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Alert Service Bulletin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 747&hyph;54A2171, dated October 31, 1994, which describes procedures for repetitive detailed visual inspections to detect cracking of the upper, lower, and side surfaces of the spring beam, and replacement of cracked spring beams with new spring beams.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other airplanes of the same type design, this AD is being issued to prevent failure of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spring beam due to fatigue cracking, which could lead to the loss of an outboard strut.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This AD requires repetitive detailed visual inspections to detect cracking of the surfaces  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the spring beam from the root of the clevis lugs to the forward journal, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacement of cracked spring beams with new spring beams. This AD also requires an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional detailed visual inspection to detect damage of the adjacent spring beam and all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support fittings of the affected strut, and replacement of any cracked parts with new parts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As an alternative to the repetitive detailed visual inspections, this AD also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides for an optional terminating action, which entails removing the spring beam,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplishing a fluorescent dye penetrant inspection, and accomplishing a zero-time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overhaul of the spring beam, in accordance with Section 54&hyph;00&hyph;01 of the Boeing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Overhaul Manual, and reinstalling that spring beam.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of America, the FAA has learned that, in general, some operators may misunderstand the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability provision of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. The FAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> points out that all airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to the AD. If an airplane has been altered or repaired in the affected area in such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required to obtain FAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph of each AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been included in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule to clarify this requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is found that notice and opportunity for prior public comment hereon are impracticable,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments Invited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affecting flight safety and, thus, was not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons are invited to comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the address specified under the caption  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . All communications received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amended in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would be needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> filed in the Rules Docket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted in response to this rule must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 94&hyph;NM&hyph;207&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has been determined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emergency regulation otherwise would be significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules Docket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the caption  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Adoption of the Amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFR part 39) as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=2 --> PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> 1.

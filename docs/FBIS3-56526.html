			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas has  declared his administration is assigning priority to cooperation  with other Baltic republics, integration into the political,  economic and defense structures of Europe, and the promotion of  neighborly relations, primarily with Russia, Ukraine, and  Belarus.    The President announced this Monday [17 January] to the  Vilnius-based chiefs of diplomatic missions.    He said he was planning to visit Belarus and invite his  Ukrainian counterpart Leonid Kravchuk to visit Lithuania.  Treaties on cooperation and neighborly relations were likely to  be signed as a result of those visits.    Algirdas Brazauskas felt relations had improved between his  republic and Russia. The discussion, he said, would soon resume  of an agreement on military transits from Russia to the  Kaliningrad region via Lithuanian territory.    The Lithuanian President told diplomats that calls for the  revision of the Pottsdam conference's decision on the  Kaliningrad region had nothing to do with his administration's  official foreign policy line. The calls were coming from  certain members of the Lithuanian parliament.</p>

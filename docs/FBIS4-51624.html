			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 18 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and Russia  can arrange resettlement of North Korean loggers from Siberia  independently without intervention by U.N. High Commissioner for  Refugees (UNHCR), Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said Monday.    "Bilateral cooperation may be sufficient for those who have  clearly indicated they choose to come to Seoul on their own free  will," Han said at a press conference after arriving from Moscow.    His remarks signify a change in Seoul's earlier position  that  the government will seek intervention by the UNHCR to prevent  possible claims by Pyongyang that South Korea is kidnapping the  loggers. An estimated 500 North Koreans are said to be in flight  throughout Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), seeking  resettlement mostly in South Korea.    "Not all of these estimated people are North Korean loggers,  but people who have fled North Korea through other means," said  Han. North Korean loggers have escaped their Siberian camps in  droves, later testifying to rampant human rights violation  inside the camps.    Han had discussed this issue at length with Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev during his Moscow visit. "Russia has  promised full cooperation, saying it has not and will not send  back the loggers to North Korea," said Han.    UNHCR support and mediation would become necessary for  protecting the escapees who have not yet being able to contact  the South Korean embassy in Moscow and need protection.    There are various ways to bring the loggers to South Korea,  such as having Moscow issue them residential permit and later  allowing them to emigrate to Seoul. The South Korean Embassy  could issue them travel permits or passports and recognize them  officially as South Korean citizens, Han said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas </F> and Romanian President Ion Iliescu in the Lithuanian Seimas in  Vilnius -- live; Brazauskas speaks in Lithuanian, with passage  by passage translation into English; Iliescu speaks in English;  correspondents speak in Lithuanian, Romanian, and English, with  all questions translated into English -- processed from the  English]    [Brazauskas] Our two countries today represented by the  President and members of cabinet have signed a number of  bilateral and very significant agreements. First of all I would  like to single out the political treaty on friendship and  cooperation between Lithuania and Romania.    Romania was one of the first countries to recognize the  newly  restored independence of Lithuania. [Word indistinct] the second  half of this century has been quite alike. Since the  Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in 1939 we underwent similar fate --  Lithuania was occupied and Romania lost Bessarabia. We all  entered the period of (?the fear of) Socialism or, shall I say,  the fear of influence of Stalinist oppression.    Now under the conditions of free development there are again  similarities in our way: both of our countries have become  members of the Council of Europe and both of our countries have  already signed the Partnership for Peace agreement with NATO.    Further steps in our development are also quite similar --  Romania is already an associated member of the European Union  while Lithuania is hoping to achieve this status perhaps this  year. The possibilities for our cooperation in all spheres are  huge too, because both of our countries are trying to  consolidate the steps towards free market economy and towards  the development of really democratic society.    Extending my gratitude to His Excellency President Iliescu  and his delegation for visiting Lithuania I would like to wish  the Romanian President and all the Romanian people all the best  success and to achieve all the goals that they had set for  themselves.    [Unidentified moderator] Now, His Excellency Ion Iliescu,  the  Romanian president.    [Iliescu] Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen. First of all,  I should like to express our thanks for the climate of  friendship and for very good conditions of our visit, of our  talks.    I should firstly underline the political significance of our  visit. It is the first visit of a chief of state of Romania in  the new, independent Lithuania. And therefore the signature of  the political document, the treaty of [word indistinct]  cooperation between our two states, and some economic agreements  are an expression of our goodwill, of our political  determination to strengthen and to develop our relations. (? At  least could we see) even today, by visiting the [word  indistinct], the history of our two countries has a lot of  similarities. It is a history of the people which has fought  during their history to preserve their independence, their  sovereignty, their cultures, and now we are fighting to  consolidate our new achievements on the way of democratization,  of the strengthening of a state ruled by the law and to promote  the very difficult process of transition from a state, a  centralized system of economy to a market, efficient economy.    We (?are considering in) this very concentrated program of  our visit and of our discussions a lot of problems,  preoccupations, difficulties which we are passing through and I  think the exchange of experience, the better knowledge of each  other will be a very good contribution to strengthen our ties  and to develop our common experience in this very difficult way  of contemporary history of our countries and [words indistinct].    We are both preoccupied to promote the integration of our  countries in a new Europe, in a new, united Europe, to liquidate  any remnants of the separation of our continent into (?walls)  separated by the military means, by the political, ideological  barriers and now by economic barriers which are much more  visible. And we have to make a large effort to promote this new  climate on the continent. As President Brazauskas underlined, we  are going together on this way and I think we shall do it with  success. We wanted to express our sympathy, our solidarity with  the Lithuanian people and hope you the best in you efforts and  in your national (?development).    [Unidentified correspondent from Romanian Radio] As it is  Women's Day, I would like to ask both His Excellency the  President of Lithuania and his excellency the president of  Romania to allow Romanian Radio to ask two questions.    One of the topics of yesterday's talks was the question of  minorities and relationships with neighboring countries. What  is your specific point of view on this topic?    [Brazauskas] Indeed, we did talk about the issues of  national  minorities and relations with neighboring countries with His  Excellency President Iliescu and we found out that our opinions  on these issues were similar and, I would say, even coincided,  because the establishment of friendly relations with neighboring  countries is one of the chief goals of our foreign relations  policy. We hope to sign in the nearest future friendship and  cooperation agreements with Belarus and Poland.    As to ethnic minorities, I must say that ethnic minorities  in  Lithuania enjoy all the privileges and rights which are  stipulated by our constitution and our laws and which are also  stipulated by international documents on these matters.  Lithuania is a member of the Council of Europe and it abides to  all the stipulations in the Universal Declaration of Human  Rights.    [Iliescu] First of all for the women, I should like to  express our congratulations and best wishes to all the women  present in this hall with the occasion of Women's Day.    Secondly, in connection with the problem raised with  (?satisfied discussion), as President Brazauskas said, I should  underline two aspects of the problem because all our countries,  and I think in all Europe, there does not exist any country  which should not have national, ethnical minorities on their  territory. Also, there is not any country which should not have  their core nationals living on the territory of other states.  In this connection there are also problems connected with the  neighbor problems and historical problems which thus exist  between neighbor countries in connection with this coexistence  of the co-citizens or of the co-nationals living on the  territory of the other country.    Of course, the problem of the national minorities and  national and ethnical minorities is a question of the internal  development of each country and only on the democratic basis,  with the creation of the general frame of the individual  liberties and the right of every member of the society, only in  this frame the problems of the citizens belonging to different  national minorities can be solved. And I think that with the  democratic development of our country, with the new constitution  which has the most important chapter connected to the rights and  the liberties of the citizens, we have created the juridicial  base to solve any problems for any citizen of the country,  including those belonging to national minorities.    Of course, there are some general international, European  [word indistinct] concerning the civil rights, which are  including also the rights for the persons belonging to the  national minorities. And we have such a provision in our  constitution that any international juridicial provision is  (?prevalent) to any of our national juridicial provision  concerning the rights and liberties of the citizen. So we are  ready always to align ourselves to any international  regulations, provisions, agreements on the international level,  including European level.    But, of course, there is some conditions which is creating  normal or un-normal relations between neighboring countries.  When some state, or leader of one state, is proclaiming their  right to intervene in the regulation of the activities of the  representative organizations of some national minorities on the  territory of other countries, it is already a source of tension  between the states. Or some proclamation (?in the last period)  for the so-called territorial, ethnical self-determination, it  is also a principle which is not in accordance with the general  international and European [word indistinct] of the development  of the trust between nations and between states. It's a sort of  theory of bantustanization of some such local community. I  think not on this basis the rights and the liberties of the  national minorities could be provided, but in accordance with  legislation which does exist in every country and with a general  democratic rule of the relations between the citizens of each  country.    [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President Brazauskas, Mr.  President Iliescu: Can you point out, please, the ways in which  the two countries are planning to contribute to the maintenance  and strengthening of the stability, security and peace on our  continent? Thank you.    [Brazauskas] I would like to say that our active  participation in the Partnership for Peace system shows that our  countries are looking for strong and guaranteed security  systems, such as we see in the activities of NATO, for example.  I also hope that other countries will be signing the  Partnership for Peace agreement and this will provide a very  good security basis for Central and Eastern European countries.  I would like to express a hope that Russia, too, signs this  agreement, then the question itself of dividing Europe into  military or some other kind of bloc will no longer be existing  at all.    [Iliescu] I think there are two elements for the (?general  stability). There is from the one side the internal stability  of every country, and we are making all the efforts to stabilize  politically and economically our country to become a factor of  stability in our geographical zone and on the continent.  Secondly, there are the activities of external relations,  firstly the good relations with our neighbors, our contribution  by bilateral contacts and multilateral contacts to eliminate the  sources of conflict and tension which exist in our zone. And  Romania has (?this privilege) to live in such a zone with two  big sources of tensions and open conflict -- Yugoslavia from one  side and the former Soviet Union, with different sources of  tension and conflict, from the other side.    We are making all efforts, with our modest possibilities, to  contribute to this activity, international activity, to  eliminate these sources of the conflict. And also our  participation in the international body, the Conference for  Security and Cooperation in Europe, which can (?become) such a  general frame for the stabilization and security on the  continent. Our participation in the Partnership for Peace and  our connection with NATO, with European Council, with European  institutions -- all this frame of our external activities are  interconnected with the preoccupation to secure more stability  and security on the continent.    [Moderator] The last question is from Baltic News Service  Agency.    [Unidentified correspondent] There were two questions, the  first one to both of the presidents: can we draw from the  meetings that you have had that there is a possibility of a  Baltic and Black Sea union? And the second question was to Mr.  Brazauskas, about the possibility of a new trend in Lithuanian  foreign policy towards the Black Sea countries.    [Brazauskas] Of course, Romania is on the Black Sea and  Lithuania is on the Baltic Sea and we can and must use to the  best advantage our geographical situation in order to promote  economic and trade relations. As to the second question, I must  say that Lithuania has been using every possibility to establish  and to improve relations with all states, first of all with  neighboring states and also with states that are further away.  With Romania we have many similarities in our domestic life and  in our outside activities and the signing of the important  documents today expands the sphere of our relations and leads us  to better links with countries of the Black Sea basin.    [Iliescu] I think that any initiative, [words indistinct] to  promote the cooperation between the two states and to promote  such zones of stability and security on our continent. From  this point of view, the development of initiatives of the Baltic  Sea from one side and the Black Sea from the other side are such  initiatives which have such an objective -- to promote stability  in our region, to promote the cooperation between our states.    Of course, I cannot speak about the union of two zones. We  should develop firstly such cooperation in our zone, but such  interconnections are of course beneficial and our presence here  is an expression of our desire to develop such interconnections.  More, I could say. We have visited in the morning the Trakai  [town near Vilnius, ancient residence of Lithuanian rulers]. On  our perception, "Trakai" is coming from the nomination of a  great family of people of Asian civilization, the (?Thracians).  Our ancestors, that was the Prince of (?Thrace). If the  (?Thracians) could develop such a zone of interconnection and  coexistence from Black Sea and Mediterranean Sea with the Baltic  Sea, why could it not be able for our generation to develop such  and interconnection and such a cooperation? I think it is quite  realistic to speak about.</p>

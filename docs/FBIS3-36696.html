Historic  Document May Be Signed 15 February"]    [Text] Tatarstan Vice President Vasiliy Likhachev, who  heads the Tatar delegation to talks with Russia, has told your  SEGODNYA correspondent that the work on the draft Treaty on the  Mutual Delegation of Powers and Terms of Reference between the  Republic of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation has been  virtually completed. Last weekend the document was presented to  Presidents Yeltsin and Shaymiyev.    Likhachev would not specify what formula for relations  between the republic and the federal center was found after  nearly three years of negotiations, saying only that it differed  from Article 61 of the Tatarstan Constitution, which stipulates  that "the Republic of Tatarstan is a sovereign state, a subject  of international law, associated with the Russian  Federation-Russia on the basis of a treaty..." It has  transpired, however, that the Russian side agreed to accept  sovereignty and the republic's status as a subject of  international law, a fact from which local observers conclude  that only the term "associated" has been changed in the  aforementioned constitutional formula.    The Tatarstan vice president said also that human rights and  freedoms come first in the treaty and that the largest section  deals with the joint powers of the Russian and Tatar  authorities. In Likhachev's view, this is an argument in the  dispute about how the treaty should be assessed: As a document  formalizing Russia's breakup or as a legal framework for  Russia's establishing itself as a federation.    Likhachev said also that "the talks between Tatarstan and  Russia have ushered in a completely new type of diplomacy" and  that the "draft treaty under consideration is unprecedented both  in Russian history and on a world scale."    During the Tatar delegation's stay in Moscow another four  agreements were drawn up that are set to be signed  simultaneously with the treaty: on combatting crime, on  finances, on budget relations, and on foreign economic activity.  Hence 11 out of the planned 12 agreements (seven were signed  earlier, and one -- on military organization -- has not yet been  prepared) will go into force in the near future.    This week, a Tatar delegation is scheduled to arrive in  Moscow again to initial the treaty, a ceremony which was put off  4 February owing to Boris Yeltsin's illness. The ceremony of  signing the document is still tentatively scheduled for 15  February.    It is yet unclear at what stage the treaty should pass  through the Federation Council: The upper chamber has made  clear that is wants to take part in the historic event.</p>

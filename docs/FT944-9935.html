			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Private View: Positive picture book thinking - Christian Tyler meets the philosopher Sir Anthony Kenny Voltaire pulling on his trousers, Sartre being shadowed by a gendarme, a Botticelli nude, some languid Gauguin beauties, a Gillray cartoon of fat men playing billiards - these are some of the more outlandish images pressed into service for Anthony Kenny's latest work. A picture book on philosophy, however handsome, however learned, may seem to purists about as clever as turning Wittgenstein's Tractatus into a musical. Sir Anthony, philosopher-knight, former Catholic priest and one-time Master of Balliol (among many other academic distinctions), admits he was 'initially rather sceptical' when approached by Oxford University Press to edit an illustrated history of western thought. But, impressed by the popular response to a TV series on the great thinkers in which he had appeared, he decided the OUP venture would reinforce a healthy trend. 'There used to be a certain contempt for philosophers who tried to speak to the general public,' he said. However, over the last two or three decades they had been descending from their ivory towers to work in scientific laboratories and to tangle with such everyday issues as medical ethics and women's rights. He himself wrote about the logic of nuclear deterrence. But if the subject is not in decline, where are the great philosophers of today? Sir Anthony concedes there is none of the stature of Bertrand Russell or the aforementioned Ludwig Wittgenstein. (His top six, incidentally, include the latter, plus Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Descartes and Kant.) 'The kind of genius it takes to be a first-rate philosopher - you can't get a bit right without getting it all right - is something which can't be expected to occur very often. You're lucky if you get two of them in a century. We're waiting for the next one. And I think there will be one. 'It gets harder and harder because of the massive expansion of human knowledge, of all the different scientific disciplines. 'Because philosophy has this extraordinary ambition to take a single, synoptic vision of the methodology of the whole of human knowledge it becomes a more and more ambitious task. Nobody could ever be again what Aristotle was, a master of all the sciences.' Is philosophy today in retreat from science; can it pretend to be more than a handmaiden? 'I don't think it's true that it's in retreat from science,' Sir Anthony said. 'The relationship is rather different, and always has been. Rather than being the handmaiden, philosophy is parent or nursemaid to the sciences. That is, there are areas of human curiosity where we not only don't yet have the answers, but we haven't got the questions properly formulated. 'Gradually, through reflection, the terminology and methodology become clear. Once that emerges, then a new scientific discipline sets up house on its own. It's like the relation between a parent and an immature child becoming mature. So philosophy is in retreat from science only in the way in which parents are in retreat from their children.' A good example, he said, was the problem of mind itself, currently preoccupying both philosophers and scientists. Until they could decide whether, for instance, thoughts are independent of language, a scientific project was not really possible. Philosophy was a never-ending story, Sir Anthony said, partly because of oddities such as the self-reflexiveness of language and mind. 'Philosophy is to some extent parasitic. When it has done its job well, it just disappears without trace. People are then able to think without the muddles which they had. 'So you can either say there aren't any achievements - they all belong to the sciences - or you can claim all of them.' If science eats up philosophy, does philosophy undermine religion? In Sir Anthony's case it did. Born into a Catholic family in Liverpool, he went to Gregorian University, Rome, and was ord-ained. Eight years later he returned to the lay state and three years after that married an American. Somewhere in the course of studying Aquinas's famous five 'proofs' of the existence of God, the young priest lost his faith. It was the conflict between divine omniscience and human free will that did for him. These days he is a true agnostic. 'I know of no compelling argument either for the existence of God or against,' he said. 'But many of the best philosophers I know are very religious people.' (He mentioned Michael Dummett, former Wykeham Professor of Logic at Oxford, and his own tutors Peter Geach and Elizabeth Anscombe - all Roman Catholics.) 'I don't believe in double truths. I don't believe something can be true in religion and false in science. There's just Truth. Of course, people can believe in God quite rationally without having a philosophical proof. That's why I've said I am agnostic.' Then what do you do for consolation, I asked. Is philosophy sufficient? 'I don't think the function of either philosophy or religion is consolation. Wanting to know what is true is a more serious motive than what is comfortable.' To believe something without cause was superstitious and to put comfort above truth was 'ignoble'. I suggested that was precisely what many people do. 'The question is not about people do but what they ought to do.' If he is an intellectual ascetic, Sir Anthony was not behaving like one. He remained calm and affable. So I gave him another push. 'Isn't it a fact of life that people don't do what they ought to do? They do what makes the burden of consciousness easier? You're a human being like the rest of us, so . . . He parried with a laugh. 'Are you urging me to do what I oughtn't to do?' Why not? He laughed again. 'Then you're a bad man if you're telling me to do what I oughtn't to do.' Aren't you afraid that at the last moment you'll reach for the priest? 'There are all kinds of temptation which I might succumb to at some time or other in my life.' Is that one you've decided not to succumb to? He paused. 'It's something . . . I mean, one cannot predict what one's beliefs will be at a later stage. I hope very much that I wouldn't be so weak as to ask for the consolations of a religion I didn't believe in.' Do you suspect you will? 'I have no idea.' Do you think about it? 'No.' Do people chide you with it? 'No, this kind of conversation that you and I are having is extremely rare.' Don't your friends say 'Once a Catholic, always a Catholic?' 'Most of my friends have known me since I stopped being a priest and are more interested in what I've done with my life since I got on the right track than the mistake I made early on.' Were philosophers' attitudes largely a function of their epoch and upbringing? 'I think 'function of' is a sort of weasel word. If it means that they are influenced, that's obviously true. If you think they are determined without the alternative, I think that is quite untrue. I don't believe in determinism.' Are they influenced sometimes more than they understand? 'Yes. I agree with that entirely.' I asked him how far his own career had been influenced by his unusual upbringing. Sir Anthony said the Latin and Greek he had learnt in the seminary had proved extremely useful. He had reacted against the philosophy taught him in Rome but it was there he acquired his deep interest in Thomas Aquinas. 'You won't find that I'm one of those ex-Catholics who devote their life to attacking the Catholic church or Catholic philosophers. On the contrary. I recognise the importance and intellectual power of those philosophers, living and dead. I just think they've got some of it wrong.' Would you recommend philosophy as a career? 'I don't think anyone should take it up as a career unless they feel they must. It is something that has got to compel you if you're going to do it at all well. 'Unless people are really gripped by at leat one major philosophical problem, and willing to put aside a lot of other things in order to get to grips with it, they oughtn't to become a philosophers . . . though they'll need philosophy for other things . . . 'On the other hand, I think that somebody can be a very good philosopher without being a professional.' Can it be morbid, depressing? 'I haven't noticed philosophers looking any more depressed than others,' he smiled. So it hasn't got you down? 'No. It's one of the most exciting things there is.'</p>

			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Lara's theme becomes a symphony: Dominic Lawson describes how he learned - the hard way - to judge fine cricket talent It was January 1991. We were on holiday in the West Indies. I discovered that, on a day too hot for sunbathing, a West Indian under-21 team was playing a three-day cricket match against a touring Australian XI on the island of St Vincent. I persuaded my wife that we should take the little boat across to watch the game: the locals said we really should go, if only to see a youth called Brian Lara, whom they considered to be their most promising player since the young Gary Sobers. The ground on the tiny island was so primitive that there were not even turnstiles or tickets. A man would simply stamp a 'pass' mark on the wrists of those who paid to enter. While we were there, Lara scratched around for 20 or so runs before being caught in the covers. I turned to my wife, and said, with all the authority of half-an-hour's knowledge: 'I don't think this man Lara's all he's cracked up to be.' Don't forget: you read it here first. We are still in danger of underestimating the achievements of Brian Lara, in the week that the little man has scored 501 not out, in a single innings over a day and a bit, setting a record which, unless we return to timeless Test matches, is unlikely ever to be broken. The skill and strength involved in taking 390 runs off a first-class bowling attack in a single day is almost unimaginable, and because of that, not properly appreciated. To the wider public it resembles a party trick, a magician's sleight of hand. It needs to be put in the context of the game as a whole, rather than a few other freakish achievements by Don Bradman or Gary Sobers. If you play club or village cricket you will understand what I mean. The best batsman in that game is, in that context, an impressive sight. He will hit the ball ferociously, and probably score 100 runs against club players you thought were rather good. The chances are that he once played for a county second XI, when he was in his prime. But he was not good enough to be a professional, let alone command a regular place in an English county's first XI. Imagine what a regular county player would do to your club's bowlers. But even that player does not register more than a couple of points on the cricketing Richter scale. Compared to a player selected for the England team he is a plodding trundler, non-descript, untalented even. Then, imagine the speed of co-ordination of the best batsmen in the England team, and attempt to realise that, on a purely statistical calculation, they are several times less good than Brian Lara. Television is the medium through which the public appreciates the skills of the first-class cricketer, the medium through which most people will witness the genius of Lara. But television hopelessly underestimates that genius. There is no sense, through the foreshortened picture from the camera at the end of the ground, of the fantastic speed of the ball, as it travels towards - and sometimes away from - the batsman. From the armchair sportsman's perspective, the batsman edging a ball into the slips looks almost deliberately incompetent and the slip fielder who drops the catch, sluggish beyond belief. The same perspective, to a lesser extent, is shared by the man in the stands, say 200 yards from the action; hence my fatuous remarks about Brian Lara, when I watched him play more than three years ago in St Vincent. But not much more than a year ago, I learned my lesson. I found myself playing cricket in a testimonial match for the West Indian fast bowler Courtney Walsh. By some strange chance I got him out. When it was my turn to bat, Courtney grabbed the ball. Three times he bowled, and three times I saw nothing. I just heard a percussive thump as the ball hit the pitch and another thump as, a split second later, the ball had travelled a further 20 yards into the wicket-keeper's gloves. Courtney was not bowling his fastest, of course not, he did not want to hurt me. He was probably bowling at the sort of pace which Brian Lara can hit at a rate of almost 400 runs a day.

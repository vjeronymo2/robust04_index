			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Business and the Environment: Eco-index charts corporate efforts - Hilary Barnes examines the growth of in-house environmental reports Novo Nordisk, the Danish health care and industrial enzymes group, has developed a new tool for use in corporate environmental analysis, an environmental performance indicator or 'eco-productivity index'. It was included in the group's first corporate environmental report, a detailed 42-page production published recently. 'The index enables us to make precise environmental comparisons from year to year,' says Steen Riisgaard, a Novo Nordisk director. It also enables the group to set measurable goals for improvements in performance. Riisgaard heads the group's bio-industrial division, which operates the fermentation facilities for the production of enzymes and the health care division's insulin and human growth hormones. These facilities produce most of the group's waste. The concept of the index was welcomed by John Elkington, partner in the UK environmental consultancy SustainAbility, which last year published Coming Clean, a survey of corporate environmental reporting. Elkington and his colleagues have provided a verification of Novo Nordisk's report as 'a fair and honest reflection' of the company's policies. He gave the report high marks in comparison with reports by other companies. He described the index as 'very useful' and hoped other companies would adopt the idea. The index is derived by dividing the volume of output sold by the volume of inputs, such as water, energy, raw materials and packaging. The index rises if the company is successful in producing more per unit of input. Taking 1990 as the base year (=100), the index shows an improvement on the raw materials side of 19 per cent, for water of 31 per cent, for energy of 33 per cent and for packaging of 19 per cent. The group has set specific targets for annual improvements in each of the indexes of 4 or 5 per cent a year. The Danish group claims to be the world's biggest producer of insulin, used to treat diabetes, and industrial enzymes, which have a wide variety of applications - in detergents, for breaking down starch into sugar, extracting juice from grapes and giving jeans a stone-washed look without using pumice stones. The group uses 214,000 tonnes of raw materials, 3.4m gigajoules of energy, 4m cubic meters of water, 7,700 tonnes of packaging materials and distributes 61,300 tonnes of products. The eco-productivity index is only one aspect of the group's efforts to achieve 'sustainable production'. A second crucial factor is the achievement in recycling waste products. About 40 per cent of the water used at Novo Nordisk's main production facility in Kalundborg, Denmark, is recycled, mainly by selling it to farmers with sludge from the fermentation tanks. However, before the water reaches Novo it has already been used for cooling in an oil refinery, which passes it on as process steam to a local power utility. Only then does it arrive at Novo Nordisk - an example of industrial symbiosis, which economises on water resources from a nearby lake. Some 43 per cent of liquid waste was recycled in 1993, either as sludge for fertilising fields or as pigfood (inputs for fermentation include soya meal, sugar and maize flour) compared with 25 per cent in 1990. It was with mixed feelings that Novo Nordisk undertook to provide a corporate environment report, says Mads Ovlisen, group chief executive. The group has a long history of seeking to be a good global citizen on environmental questions; and the fact that Novo Nordisk is based in a country where environmental consciousness is well developed and environmental legislation is rigorous, has stimulated the group's interest in the issue. But, says Ovlisen, a detailed environmental report also provides information of use to competitors, prompting internal opposition to the report plan.</p>

			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: CGT on options DOES indexation relief on capital gains on quoted shares apply to the period between the grant of an option to acquire a share at its current price at a future date and the exercising of the option? I was granted the option in 1987 to acquire some shares under an Inland Revenue approved scheme and exercised the option in 1991. I then sold the shares and made a capital gain. The Revenue wish to charge capital gains tax on the difference in price between 1987 and 1991 with no indexation allowance. The cost of the option ranks for indexation from the month in which the option was granted to the month in which it was exercised. The cost of exercising the option is added to the indexed cost of the option, and the total ranks for indexation from the month in which the option was exercised to the month in which the shares were sold. If the shares were sold less than ten days after the option was exercised, however, the cost of the option ranks for indexation from the month in which it was granted to the month in which the shares were sold - and there is no indexation relief on the cost of exercising the option. Ask your tax office for pamphlet CGT13: The indexation allowance for quoted shares. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

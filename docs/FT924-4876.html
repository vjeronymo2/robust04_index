			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / International Company News: Granada aims to sustain computer recovery - Alan Cane on its battle with manufacturers for maintenance work LOOKING after other people's computers seemed a promising diversification for Granada in the mid-1980s when the television and leisure services group was 'dashing for growth'. Europe's computer users were then spending about Dollars 10bn a year on maintenance. Computer manufacturers, then as now, took the lion's share, but there was just under Dollars 1bn for independent, or third party, maintenance organisations to compete for. The sector was growing at about 15 per cent per annum, well ahead of most other services businesses. A string of acquisitions costing some Pounds 200m gave Granada instant market leadership in Europe, but the prospective gold mine quickly became a disaster. It failed properly to integrate the new division and in 1991 losses were Pounds 7.7m on revenues of Pounds 200m. Cash was bleeding out of the division at an appreciably faster rate. The computer services division's problems were compounded by the recession and difficulties in other parts of the group, including a heavy debt burden leading to sharp falls in both revenues and profits for the whole organisation. Mr Derek Lewis, the former Granada chief executive who was closely associated with the move into computing services, lost his job, the most public victim of the debacle. Now, under a new chairman, Mr John Curran, and after extensive surgery to bring overheads in line with sales expectations, Granada Computer Services seems back on track. It turned in pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.3m on revenues of Pounds 77.2m at the half-way stage, compared with a Pounds 3.6m loss last year. The group is due to report full-year results on Wednesday. Earlier this year the division secured a key contract with British Aerospace worth Pounds 12m over three years. As Mr Curran notes, it was not the value of the contract but the boost to the morale of the organisation that was important. Mr Curran is a 46 year old US-born computer industry veteran, in a business where experience, track record and connections are vital. Formerly with Mobil Oil, National Advanced Systems and Control Data, his later career has included a spell as consultant specialising in turning around ailing companies. Granada Computer Services was certainly ailing. It was formed between 1986 and 1988 by the acquisition of Computer Field Maintenance, SMS, Mainstay, DPCE and Wigo, all well respected companies. But Mr Curran arrived to find an uncordinated group of separate organisations, wracked by internal strife with multiple management systems, heavy overheads and no economies of scale. Support operations were replicated; each group had its own training centres. The individual companies were first class; DPCE and Computer Field had been pioneers in breaking the stranglehold the manufacturers had over computer maintenance. Granada's newly imposed management layer, however, lacked knowledge or experience of the maintenance side. Mr Curran moved swiftly once he believed the division could be salvaged. He brought in trusted senior managers from his previous existence and sacked 20 per cent of the 3,000 workforce in one week. It cost a one-off Pounds 15m but prepared the ground for this year's return to profitability. But can it be sustained? The maintenance battleground has changed significantly over the past four years. Attempts to build thriving businesses on the back of computer maintenance - notably Ferrari Computer Services - have failed. The European market for computer maintenance is still about Dollars 10bn - prices have fallen sharply - but growing at only about five per cent per year. There is renewed competition from the big hardware manufacturers, International Business Machines, Digital Equipment and now, the Japanese. Olivetti of Italy is also a leading player in maintenance but chiefly in the mid-range system area, while Granada is focused on mainframes and personal computers. The manufacturers are powerful - IBM's maintenance revenues alone top more than Dollars 4bn annually - and are well placed to use price as a competitive weapon. They are aggressively seeking to replace falling hardware sales with services revenues. Granada remains the independent European market leader with sales of about Dollars 300m, substantially bigger than the next largest independents Thomainfor (a subsidiary of Thompson CSF), Sorbus (owned joinly by ICL and Bell Atlantic) and Getronics of the Netherlands. Mr Curran's strategy for the future is based on two concepts: multi-vendor support and partnerships. The big manufacturers, he reasons, are hard to beat on their own ground  - servicing machines of their own manufacture where they have a natural advantage. But today many large customers buy their equipment from a diversity of manufacturers and are building multi-vendor networks of workstations and departmental computers to distribute computer power through their organisations. They are seeking a single partner who will take responsibility for ensuring that everything works efficiently together. But manufacturers' expertise tends to be limited to their own equipment. That, Mr Curran says, is where Granada's broad skills count: 'What we are good at is complexity management'. It will, however, need to beef up software skills to be completely convincing. The company believes that partnerships and alliances are the way ahead, especially with the growth of 'outsourcing', where a company passes over its data processing operations to a third party against an agreed level of service. The leaders in outsourcing in Europe include EDS-Scicon, Cap Gemini Sogeti and Sema Group. Granada is keen to form partnerships with companies like these with a view to offering a complete computing service - facilities management plus maintenance in one package. Granada Computer Services will have to develop its US business to become the global player that Mr Curran envisages, but all the parts of the operation seem at last to be pulling in the same direction. Last year it was at the centre of Granada's financial woes; this year it should prove a foundation for its profitability.</p>

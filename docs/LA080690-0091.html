"We're trying to promote healthy  lifestyles and raise the students' awareness and appreciation for healthier  lives."  </P> <P> The Wellness Project is a 24-week program targetting about 200 of the school's  350 seventh- to 12th-grade students, Gore said.  </P> <P> The program includes physical activities, instruction on physiology and  workshops on decision-making and self-esteem. Participants will also be  encouraged to teach what they have learned to other students.  </P> <P> The program at the Pleasant Valley District school for high risk students will  begin in September, Gore said.

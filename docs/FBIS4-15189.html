			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "News Bulletin" No. 472] </F>   [Text] Vilnius, April 6, ELTA -- Lithuanian Prime Minister  Adolfas Slezevicius and Agricultural Minister Rimantas Karazija  discussed the agricultural situation in Lithuania during a radio  programme on Wednesday [6 April].    They informed the listeners that there were about 110  thousand farmers in Lithuania. A half of the total try hard to  take maximum advantage of their land, others are waiting for the  time when they will be able to rent or to sell their land at  high price.    There are 200 thousand people who want to get their land  back. There are 3 thousand agricultural enterprises.  Unfortunately not all of them are economically strong, 11  percent of them will fall apart by the end of the spring.    The officials warned that part of the land might remain  unseeded this year. This firstly concerns the land which has no  owners and there is nobody who could rent it.    According to the estimations made by Agricultural Ministry,  the fuel for the seeding period alone will cost 100 million  litas. Extra money should be raised to liquidate the debts of  industrial enterprises. The sugar-refineries owe 46 million  litas. It is believed that the agricultural plague will be  reduced by the council for purchase and coordination of produce.</p>

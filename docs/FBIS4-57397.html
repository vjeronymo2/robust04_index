			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Beatriz Padron from the "Evening Information </F> Review" newscast; passages within quotation marks recorded]    [Text] In accordance with its policy of fostering and  promoting sustained progress in the scientific-technical area --  particularly, in peaceful uses of nuclear energy -- Cuba has  been playing for several years a pivotal role in the Arcal  [expansion unknown] project. Arcal is a program that includes  17 Latin American countries, which seek to give their  specialists access to state-of- the-art nuclear techniques and  enable them to study the use of those techniques in all possible  areas regarding the economic and social development of their  nations. Here is Daniel Codorniu, vice secretary of the SEAN  [Executive Secretariat for Nuclear Affairs], organization  responsible for the Cuban nuclear program, with details:    [Codorniu] "Arcal is sponsored by the International  Organization of Atomic Energy in order to promote cooperation  among various Latin American countries for the peaceful use of  nuclear energy. Cuba has participated in this program since  1987, and in the past years, our participation has increased.  During this period, the program has implemented 12 projects,  which are mostly related to the issue of applying nuclear  techniques to solve social and economic development problems and  establishing regulations and procedures to guarantee security  [words indistinct]."    Cuban technicians and specialists will have an opportunity  to  exchange views and results in this area during the 11th Arcal  Coordination Meeting to be held in Santa Fe de Bogota from 16-20  May.    [Codorniu] "During this meeting in Santa Fe de Bogota, we  will discuss plans for 1995 and 1996 in addition to reviewing  the program for the remainder of 1994. We are planning to  include some new programs that Cuba has been supporting because  they have a strong influence in our development. For instance,  we are proposing a new program called induced mutations related  with [word indistinct] and technology for improving crops in  Latin America. This new program supports the joint use of  nuclear and biotechnological methods to produce a better variety  of crops."    Other events confirm Cuba's advances in nuclear technology.  Daniel Codornieu believes the best example is Cuba's acceptance,  at the end of 1993, as a full-fledged member of the prestigious  American Nuclear Society's Latin American Division. The  American Nuclear Society also seeks to coordinate nuclear  efforts on the continent.    [Codorniu] "This is important because, as you saw [word  indistinct], the former program is basically linked with nuclear  applications in areas such as agriculture and medicine.  Although the Latin American division deals with application  concerns, it concentrates on energy problems -- the issue of  developing nuclear energy to generate electricity -- and  investigations in the area of nuclear energy [word indistinct].  As a result, we are also able to collaborate in the area of  nuclear security."</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency anticipates two possible exceptions to this practice. The first is where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> release of the chemical identity of a substitute constitutes release of proprietary information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In that event, the Agency will report generic chemical names based on chemical classes as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described in section V.C. The other exception would be in cases where the Agency believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a more general categorization is needed to account for the diversity of possible chemicals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used in a particular set of substitutes. For example, in the solvents cleaning sector, many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitutes are formulations composed of compounds drawn from several categories of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemicals. In this case, the toxicity profile of each chemical is similar to those of other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemicals in that class.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Decision categories. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 612, the Agency has considerable discretion in the risk management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decisions it can make in SNAP. In this final rule, the Agency has identified five possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision categories, as described below. Commenters suggested that there was confusion with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Agency's intent to designate some substitutes as acceptable subject to narrowed use limits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> versus unacceptable except for critical use exemptions. In response to these comments, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency has determined that the goal of both categories was to limit the use of a substitute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that had generally unacceptable characteristics yet provide relief for specialized applications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within an end-use where no other alternatives exist. Given the similarity in goals, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision categories have been streamlined by eliminating the category listed in the NPRM as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``unacceptable except for critical use exemptions.'' Those substitutes that were listed in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NPRM as proposed unacceptable except for critical use exemptions are listed as unacceptable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in this final rule, and the concerns which the critical use exemption petition process was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> created to address will now be addressed as part of EPA's responsibilities under the section 612(d)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petition process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Acceptable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Where the Agency has reviewed a substitute and found no reason to prohibit its use, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will list the alternative as acceptable in the end-uses for which the submitter provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information. Where appropriate, the Agency may provide some additional comment (e.g.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general recommendations encouraging recapture and recycling). However, these comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not conditions for use of the substitute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Acceptable subject to use conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As proposed in the NPRM, after reviewing a submission, the Agency may determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a substitute is acceptable if certain conditions on use are adopted. The Agency cannot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> predict at this time all necessary restrictions, but has imposed some conditions based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitute reviews already completed for this final rule. Several commenters supported the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application of use conditions as necessary in providing important guidance to companies in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reviewing alternative replacements for ODSs. While also supporting use conditions generally,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other commenters noted that they should be used sparingly, so as to create the minimum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uncertainty in the regulated community and encourage swift transition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency agrees with these comments. In this final rule, any conditions imposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will depend on the risks involved and the substitute and application in question. For example,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Agency may impose conditions on the use of a substitute and require recycling equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to limit workplace and ambient releases or require use of other control practices within a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain application. Where a substitute is found acceptable subject to conditions on uses, use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without adherence to the conditions in the relevant end-use is prohibited in this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Determinations of acceptability subject to use conditions will only be made pursuant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice-and-comment rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In implementing conditions on use, the Agency has sought to avoid overlap with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing regulatory authorities. EPA has taken a number of steps to mitigate this potential for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> duplication. First, EPA intends to restrict the use of conditions to cases in which clear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory gaps exist. Second, these existing regulatory gaps must render the use of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitute an unreasonable risk in the absence of any additional controls. Third, in the limited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases in which conditions may be necessary, the Agency will impose them only as a result of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formal notice-and-comment rulemaking. Finally, use conditions will be effective only until  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other appropriate regulatory controls are imposed under other authorities and will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withdrawn by the Agency when they are superseded by such controls.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Acceptable subject to narrowed use limits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency cannot restrict use of a substitute under SNAP if there are no technically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feasible alternatives to the use of an ozone-depleting compound. Thus, EPA may approve a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compound not for general use within a sector, but for use only within certain specialized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications within a sector end-use. EPA refers to these restrictions as narrowed use limits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, the Agency could list a substitute with a generally unfavorable environmental or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> human health effect as acceptable in certain specific metals cleaning applications in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solvents cleaning sector. This would allow transition away from the damaging ozone-depleting compounds to proceed, by allowing industry the flexibility to use in narrow niche  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications a substitute which provides the only means of transition. At the same time, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> narrowed use determination prevents a widespread shift of an entire sector to substitutes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which overall do not offer the risk reduction available through the use of other alternatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

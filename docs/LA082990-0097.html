			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> CHUCK NORRIS RETURNS WITH 'DELTA FORCE 2'  </P> <P> The last time around, Chuck Norris and his Delta Force, a special unit of the  U.S. Army, took on some Arab terrorist hijackers. This time, in "Delta Force 2:  Operation Stranglehold" (citywide), Norris and his cohorts zero in on the  world's wealthiest drug dealer, wanted in 17 countries.  </P> <P> If the first "Delta Force" played like a formula TV movie, the second is not  even that. Characterizations are so cardboard and stereotypical and plotting so  trite that there's not enough involvement generated to be impressed by dramatic  locales and elaborate parachuting and helicopter stunts. Indeed, it's  depressing to realize that several stuntmen lost their lives in making this  dull action/adventure that is most notable for its nonstop violence.  </P> <P> There's precious little opportunity for Norris to express that dry humor he's  developed over the years as he and others (notably, John P. Ryan's salty  general and Richard Jaeckel's stalwart DEA agent) try to nail down the elusive,  vicious drug lord Ramon Cota (Billy Drago, lean, angular and creepy, the  strongest presence in the picture). Norris' brother Aaron has directed the film  efficiently and energetically but without any personality. The body count on  screen is staggering, so immense as to be impossible to track. (The film has  been rated R for its extreme violence, but you have to wonder what they're  saving the X for.)  </P> <P> Filmed largely in the Philippines, "Delta Force 2" is set in the fictional  Latin American country of San Carlos. Curiously, the print caught at a preview  had in its end credits a different title: "Delta Force 2: The Colombian  Connection." KEVIN THOMAS  </P></p>

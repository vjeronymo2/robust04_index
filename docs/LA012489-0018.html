			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> JOYCE AND O'NEILL SHARE BILLING  </P> <P> The newly formed Trinity Theatre opens its first program with a blast of  unaccompanied Irish singing -- first in Gaelic, then in English -- by a woman  named Jacintha Friel. Wearing a warm shawl, warbling her plaintive tunes, she  transports her listeners across the water.  </P> <P> Next up on the program, titled "Voices From Joyce" and "Hughie," is Matthew  Sullivan's thoughtful recitation of the last great speech from James Joyce's  "The Dead" -- which filmgoers heard last year in the closing minutes of John  Huston's film of the same name. Sullivan's delivery is beautifully clear and  understated.  </P> <P> The same can't be said for Maria Hayden's performance of a monologue that Joyce  wrote for Anna Livia in "Finnegan's Wake." Although director Jim Kerrigan  places it into context in a brief introduction "so you're not totally lost by  the inaccessibility of it," most listeners won't be able to make heads or tails  of it. Hayden's stance and voice are full of oomph -- and the piece is fairly  short. But generally this is language that should be read (with footnotes), not  recited.  </P> <P> Eugene O'Neill's one-act "Hughie" follows intermission, picking up on the same  theme (the "shades" among us) as the excerpt from "The Dead." Kerrigan's  gambler is properly scruffy, but he swallows too many words and his morose  moments lack weight. As the night clerk (who says he hailed from Ireland,  instead of the text's Saginaw), Sean O'Connor is blissfully bored by Kerrigan's  patter. But he doesn't support the man's sudden change of mood near the end of  the play.  </P> <P>  At St. Ambrose Hall, 1261 N. Fairfax Ave., Saturdays and Sundays at 8 p.m.,  indefinitely. Tickets: $10; (213) 466-1767.  </P> <P> </P></p>

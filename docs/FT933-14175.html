			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Nobo shows 49% growth to Pounds 1.65m NOBO Group, a manufacturer of office and business products, returned profits of Pounds 1.65m pre-tax for the year to end-April, an improvement of 49 per cent over last time's Pounds 1.11m. The figure was helped by a Pounds 187,000 reduction in interest charges to Pounds 476,000. Turnover was static at Pounds 21.1m - Nobo disposed of its office furniture business in October last year. Turnover of the core business of visual aids and desk top accessories increased by 6 per cent. A proposed final dividend of 3.3p makes a 4.8p (3.5p) total. Earnings improved from 6.34p to 10.41p per share. Year-end gearing was cut to 32 per cent (60 per cent) helped by cash flow from the disposal and the placing of 526,660 new shares in March.</p>

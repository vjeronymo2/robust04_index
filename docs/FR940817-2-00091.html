			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the event that Ethyl wishes to undertake the testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to register MMT for unleaded gasoline, EPA will work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with Ethyl to resolve the details of all necessary test data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, once the data requirements for registration have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> duly established, EPA will not require submission of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional health effects and exposure data as part of a new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waiver application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VIII. Other Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Ethyl has stated that certain other considerations and data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with MMT use should be taken into account by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator in utilizing the discretion authorized under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 211(f)(4). These issues include (1) decreased emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of toxic air pollutants due to decreases in aromatic use when MMT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is substituted as an octane enhancer; (2) decreased refinery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions due to decreased reformer severity; (3) decreased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carbon monoxide (CO) and oxides of nitrogen (NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions, (4) increased crude oil yield and associated energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> savings, and (5) decreased levels of tropospheric ozone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with lower levels of reactive hydrocarbon emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission decreases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding CO emission decreases, EPA's analysis indicates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that examination of all of the available test data on the CO  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects of MMT shows a small (0.07 gpm or 2% of applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards <FOOTCITE>81</FOOTCITE> ) decrease attributable to the additive. <FOOTCITE>82</FOOTCITE>  With  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the exceptions of two vehicle models, the CO effects in both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directions were relatively small. The most significant exception  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to this general pattern is the test data from the 1988 Ford Crown  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Victoria 5L, which showed a decrease of 0.72 gpm (or 21% of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard). The other unusual vehicle was also a Ford Crown  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Victoria_a 1992 model with a 0.36 gpm decrease (11% of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard). The small average size and somewhat erratic nature of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the CO decreases seen in the vehicle sample lead to questions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about whether this small potential benefit is likely to actually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occur in the vehicle fleet.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 81 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> This effect was calculated by integrating emissions, separately for clear and MMT fuels, over the full range of mileage for which data were available, taking the difference between fuel groups within models to get a model-by-model effect, and then averaging these effects over model groups. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 82 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For a complete description the reader is referred to Air Docket A&hyph;93&hyph;26, II&hyph;A&hyph;14, ``Evidence of CO and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Emission Decreases Attibutable to MMT in Durability Testing Data''. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA also examined NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions changes demonstrated by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data which had been submitted by both Ethyl and Ford. The test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data for NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  show a more substantial and more consistent decrease  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for this pollutant than was the case for CO. The average across  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> models was 0.08 gpm or 8% of the standard. The largest decreases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were seen in the 1992 Ford Mustang 5.0L model and the 1988 Ford  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Crown Victoria 5L (each showing a 0.30 gpm decrease or 30% of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard). Other models with substantial decreases were the 1988  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ford Taurus (0.22 gpm or 22% of the standard) and the 1992 Buick  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regal 3.8L (0.19 gpm or 19% of the standard).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is difficult to clearly determine the effects which NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decreases of this magnitude might have on tropospheric ozone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrations, since such effects are influenced heavily by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mix of ozone precursors and the atmospheric chemistry of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular non-attainment areas. Modeling studies performed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA have shown that NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reductions in NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  limited areas can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significantly reduce regional ozone levels. However, although  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the regional ozone decreased, some urban areas showed slight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increases in ozone levels. It is not possible to quantify the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> degree of reduction in ozone associated with the introduction of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MMT in general because many factors affect ambient ozone. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order to achieve such a quantification, individual cities would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need to be analyzed to determine their VOC/NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ratios and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mobile source contribution to those ratios.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has therefore concluded that it is likely that in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -limited areas, ambient levels of ozone would decrease  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on the expected NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reductions resulting from MMT use. It  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is impossible to quantify the exact degree of these decreases or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the magnitude of the area which would be affected. <FOOTCITE>83</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 83 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For a complete description and response to Ethyl's comments, the reader is referred to Air Docket A&hyph;93&hyph;26, II&hyph;A&hyph;15, ``ORD's Response to Public Comments on the Reference Concentration for Manganese and on the Draft ORD Risk Assessment of MMT''. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Ethyl indicates that ``use of the Additive will result in as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> many as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 25 fewer cancer cases <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  [emphasis in the original]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attributable to automotive exhaust over the 1995&hyph;2010 span.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although ORD has not independently verified Ethyl's current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis, it is nevertheless possible to evaluate their analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by taking it at face value. Significant uncertainties are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inherent in any prediction of a net change in cancer risk. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, there are various models and assumptions underlying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated changes in carcinogen exposures. Assumptions must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made regarding the composition of gasoline at different times in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the future; projected fleet emissions must be estimated based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measurements from a few vehicles; the impact of MMT on such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions must be estimated. In addition, the relationship of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes in emissions is assumed to be related to population  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cancer risk, whether characterized in terms of the number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases in the entire U.S. population or in terms of individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit risk estimates, also has inherent uncertainties. According  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to Ethyl, the predicted reduction in estimated cancer cases is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0.6 to 2.0 cases per year. These represent upper bound  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimates, and thus the true impact is very unlikely to be higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and may in fact be less. Ethyl also predicts that the changes in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the probability of an individual contracting cancer is lowered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with MMT use from about 12 cases per 100,000 to 6 cases per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 100,000. Again these estimates represent upper bounds, so the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> true risk to an individual would not be expected to be higher and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could well be lower. In any case, the individual risk level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remains in the 10&hyph;5 range. Relative to the uncertainties in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cancer risk estimates as well as in the emission and exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aspects of Ethyl's analysis, the magnitude of the claimed change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in risk is comparatively quite small.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The accuracy of these estimates also depends very much on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the estimates of decreased aromatics use for individual refiners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Very significant changes are taking place in the refining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry to comply with various aspects of programs being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implemented pursuant to the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Programs such as the introduction of ``reformulated gasoline'' will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dramatically change the overall chemical and physical properties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of gasoline. Thus, estimates of aromatics usage associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refining are even more highly speculative over the next several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years as these programs are implemented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In any case, it is not possible to weigh these predicted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes in cancer incidence or in ozone formation against the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerns which have been explained above in relation to increased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manganese emissions. Therefore, the Agency disagrees with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ethyl's claim that it can be shown scientifically that a net  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public health benefit results from the use of MMT in unleaded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline. While the Agency agrees that such risk-benefit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comparisons can be important, the present data are inadequate for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this purpose. With regard to the potential risks associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inhalation exposure to manganese, the Agency's Risk Assessment as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described above indicates that there are insufficient data to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conclude quantitatively whether the increased use of MMT will (or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not) increase public health risk. With regard to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential reductions in cancer incidence and tropospheric ozone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels associated with MMT use claimed by Ethyl, the above  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis indicates that, while reductions are possible, the data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are too sparse to provide reasonable quantitative estimates of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the magnitude of such reductions. The estimated cancer reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not truly discernable as a quantifiable benefit. This is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because relative to the uncertainties in the cancer risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimates as well as in the emission and exposure aspects of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ethyl's analysis, the estimated magnitude of change in risk is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quite small, even when based on the ``upper bound'' cancer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimates. For ozone, it is not possible in general to quantify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the degree of reduction associated with the introduction of MMT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because many factors, including local volatile organic compound  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (VOC)/NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ratios affect ambient ozone levels. To achieve a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantification, all appropriate individual cities would have to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be analyzed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGELS, HOWELL STRIKE ONE-YEAR DEAL; MCCASKILL'S HEARING SET FOR MONDAY  </P> <P> The Angels and Jack Howell met more than halfway Wednesday, avoiding salary  arbitration by agreeing to a one-year contract that will pay the 28-year-old  third baseman $650,000 and a potential of more than $100,000 in bonuses.  </P> <P> Howell, who led the major leagues in fielding last season at .974 with only 11  errors, had filed for $780,000 against the Angels' figure of $525,000.  </P> <P> He earned $465,000 last year plus a $5,000 bonus for making more than 530 plate  appearances. His average slumped to .228, with 20 home runs and a 52 runs  batted in.  </P> <P> Howell's signing leaves pitcher Kirk McCaskill as the only Angel still  scheduled for arbitration. McCaskill, who earned $400,000 last season, filed  for $1,185,000; the Angels offered $750,000. McCaskill's hearing is set for  Monday. HELENE ELLIOTT  </P></p>

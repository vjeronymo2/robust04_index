			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / (CORRECTED) Opposition cries foul over Bombay scandal Correction (published 3rd August 1994) appended to this article. Opposition leaders yesterday accused the Indian government of letting off several cabinet ministers and bureaucrats criticised in a report on the Bombay stock market scandal of 1992. MPs stalled proceedings in both houses of parliament, rejecting what the government called its 'Action Taken' report, which it said 'overturned' the findings of a joint parliamentary committee into the scandal which reported in December last year. Its clause-by-clause response to the committee's report was tabled in parliament on Tuesday. The government rejected the committee's findings that it was, through inaction by the finance ministry and the Reserve Bank, India's central bank, responsible for 'a systems failure' that allowed the scandal to erupt. Staunchly defending Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, the government conceded that the scandal occurred because of a 'failure to check irregularities', but insisted that 'this failure was not due to inaction' on its part. The scandal, it said, highlighted 'weaknesses in the system' which it was 'in the process of correcting'. MPs who wrote the parliamentary committee report into the Rs40bn (Pounds 830m) scandal criticised failings throughout the financial system and held Mr Singh responsible for the shortcomings of officials entrusted with financial supervision. The committee spent more than a year investigating the affair, which erupted in April 1992 when evidence emerged that money was being illegally siphoned out of banks and into the stock market. Opposition members have demanded a withdrawal of the government's report, terming it an 'eyewash' and an 'assault on parliamentary dignity'. Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee, leader of the opposition from the Bharatiya Janata party, said the entire nation expected that the government would accept the parliamentary committee's report and take action against ministers, arrest guilty officials and initiate proceedings against others. 'But no such action has been initiated.' Mr Lal Krishen Advani, the Hindu party's president, yesterday accused Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, of 'shielding corruption'. On Monday the Reserve (central) Bank of India announced that it would impose penalties on several foreign and domestic banks indicted by the committee's report and its own investigations. The Reserve Bank has penalised 35 Indian and foreign banks by withdrawing the exemption granted to 78 commercial banks in April 1992 from maintaining a cash reserve ratio of 10 per cent. The Reserve Bank, which already holds deposits worth Rs300bn from these banks, will by its decision, impound a further Rs30bn, 10 per cent of the incremental growth of these deposits, by virtue of the waiver. Further, 20 of the 35 banks involved in the scandal have been served notices by the central bank for allegedly violating regulations. They have four weeks to contest the Reserve Bank's claims, failing which they will have to pay penalties totalling Rs1.47bn. Worst hit among the domestic banks is India's largest nationalised bank, the State Bank of India, which will have to pay a penalty of Rs112m. Among the foreign banks, Citibank may have to pay Rs500m in fines. Other foreign banks affected include ANZ Grindlays, Standard Chartered, American Express Bank, Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, Deutsche Bank, Credit Lyonnais, Barclays Bank of Nova Scotia, and the Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank. Representatives of foreign banks, who say it is too early to tell whether they will contest the Reserve Bank's claims, are more concerned about what one Bombay-based banker termed 'continuing harassment'. 'The government has clearly said in its report on Tuesday that the Reserve Bank is finalising further action against the foreign banks involved in the scandal,' he said. 'We have done everything in our power to stop the irregularities, if any, and the government would be giving us the wrong signal if they continue to slap on penalties.' A senior Reserve Bank official said yesterday that 'the bank as an organisation would end the matter here provided the banks don't contest our claims and pay the penalties due'. The official said the central bank would grant the 20 banks involved private hearings if any mistakes were detected in calculations or the banks felt the penalties were too harsh. CORRECTION The Financial Times of July 28 reported on international banks implicated in the Bombay financial scandal. Barclays Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia, Credit Lyonnais and the Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank were listed in error.</p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PREMIER BOWS TO SOVIET ASSEMBLY ON HIS NOMINEES  </P> <P> Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, bowing to the authority of the Soviet Union's newly  strengthened legislature, withdrew six of his ministerial nominees Tuesday  after they had been rejected by the committees of lawmakers that had examined  their qualifications and proposed programs.  </P> <P> Ryzhkov, speaking with reporters after the session of the Supreme Soviet, said  that he could not defend these nominees and would propose others in their  places.  </P> <P> "I agreed actually with the conclusions of the parliamentary committees," he  said. "I could not see any substantial proof that would enable me to defend  them."  </P> <P> This was the first time that the country's elected representatives had  scrutinized prospective ministers with any vigor, and their success in forcing  Ryzhkov to withdraw his nomination of the six they consider unqualified was an  important precedent in establishing the Supreme Soviet's authority over the  executive branch of the government.  </P> <P> Those rejected included the proposed chairman of the State Bank of the Soviet  Union, the longtime chairman of the State Committee on Physical Culture and  Sports, the current minister of culture and nominees to head the Oil and Gas  Ministry, the Water Resources Ministry and the State Prices Committee.  </P> <P> They had been attacked as unskilled in their jobs, politically insensitive and  bureaucratic in style.  </P> <P> In addition, two other nominees -- one who would have been the first deputy  premier responsible for agriculture and the other who would have headed the  Machine Tool and Instrument Ministry -- withdrew their names in anticipation of  defeat. A third, the chairman of the state ecology commission, refused even to  accept the nomination.  </P> <P> These were already among the country's most powerful men, and their  unprecedented defeat underscores the fundamental political shifts now under way  here.  </P> <P> The whole process of legislative hearings on their qualifications and proposed  programs is also seen as a major step to raise the competency of top government  officials and to make them answerable for their policies to the Supreme Soviet.  </P> <P> "I would not say that they were bad specialists or incompetent," Ryzhkov said  of those who were rejected. "They simply did not meet demands in one area or  another. Now, we have to think about new candidates."  </P> <P> Leonid I. Abalkin, an influential economist who was named deputy premier for  economic policy, supported Ryzhkov's action. "The decision to withdraw was  right for all six candidates," he said after the session. "These were not the  best people he could have chosen."  </P> <P> Ryzhkov had said late last week that he would fight for several of the nominees  who, he asserted, had been the "victims of emotions" during the often heated  committee debates. But in the end he apparently decided to avoid what would  have been a bruising political battle and to establish a working relationship  with the Supreme Soviet.  </P> <P> He went further during the day's debate and pledged to support new legislation  that would provide for an annual no-confidence debate, a feature of many  Western parliaments, in order to provide a regular review of the government's  policies.  </P> <P> With that, the Supreme Soviet approved the balance of Ryzhkov's 70-member  Cabinet, more than half of whom oversee sectors of the Soviet Union's  state-owned, state-run economy.  </P> <P> Now a full-time legislature with broad powers and no longer a "rubber stamp"  for ratifying Communist Party decisions, the Supreme Soviet is made up of two  houses with a total of 542 members elected from the larger Congress of People's  Deputies, which was given "supreme state authority" under President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev's political reforms.  </P> <P> The new ministers will be paid the equivalent of $1,230 a month, about four  times the average Soviet wage, Ryzhkov told deputies, but they could earn up to  50% more with bonuses through meeting performance goals.  </P> <P> The Supreme Soviet is scheduled to meet until early August with a 21-point  agenda that includes new laws on consumer protection, inventions, court reform,  the press, taxes, revision of the criminal code and other measures.  </P></p>

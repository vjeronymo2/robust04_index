			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Deutsche Bank It is easy to dismiss Deutsche Bank's DM500m loss provisions in connection with the Schneider affair as trivial in the broader sweep of events. The figure compares with total group provisions of DM3.3bn last year; even after the Schneider charge, provisions will be down in 1994. It is harder to dismiss the impact on Deutsche's image. Together the Schneider and Metallgesellschaft cases have revealed it to be less conservative than many of its admirers thought. At yesterday's annual meeting Mr Hilmar Kopper, Deutsche's management board spokesman, was reluctant to point fingers while official inquiries are still under way. At some stage, though, the bank will have to demonstrate clearly that it has put its house in order. One danger, if it does not, is that its share rating will suffer because its business is perceived as riskier. In the short term, though, the main concern is operating profit. During the first four months profits were running more than 10 per cent below the average rate for 1993 as a whole. The comparison may not be entirely fair for seasonal reasons, but the shortfall in trading income is clearly having a significant impact, while Mr Kopper said interest margins have narrowed further. His comments only serve to reinforce the view that Deutsche, like other German financial stocks, is less likely to out-perform now that interest rates must be coming within sight of their floor. Industrial stocks should show more impressive earnings performance as corporate restructuring and, eventually, economic recovery take hold.</p>

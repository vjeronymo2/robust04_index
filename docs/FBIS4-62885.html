			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report English by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>   [Text] Dushanbe 18 May TASS -- Armed provocations on the  Tajik-Afghan border continue. Several attempts by a group of  supporters of the Islamic Revival of Tajikistan movement to  force entry from Afghanistan through a number of sectors of  Pyanj and Moscow frontier guard detachments into the republic's  territory were thwarted by Russian frontier guards on the night  of May 18.    The same night the Tajik opposition militants shelled a  number of Russian border check points in the Shurobad direction  from the rear. The enemy weapon emplacements were neutralized by  the Russian frontier guard detachment shelling. There were no  casualties reported among the Russian servicemen.    ITAR-TASS was informed of these facts by military sources in  Dushanbe today. According to the sources, a large-scale  operation to uncover and neutralize militant groups of the Tajik  opposition, which penetrated the Tajik border territory during  the past few weeks, is underway in the Shurobad direction in the  zone guarded by the Moscow frontier guard detachment.    Tajikistan's Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Security and  Ministry of the Interior detachments are taking active part in  the operation together with the Russian frontier guards.</p>

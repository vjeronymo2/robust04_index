			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Observer: Sweet song of success However many British companies as well as voters look back in anger on what may ere long come to be known as 'the Lamont years', there is one enterprise that can celebrate them with a chorus of Je ne regrette rien not only heart-felt but melodious. Moreover the outfit's progress stirs modest pride in the breast of Observer, who first introduced it to the broader public just three weeks after Norman Lamont's installation as chancellor of the exchequer in November 1990. Called The New Company, it is admittedly unusual in that its members aren't in it for the money, all earning their living in various ways elsewhere. Their corporate interest lies in being amateur singers of such high ability as to be sought after to perform with professional orchestras. The reason for the company's existence is that - perhaps reflecting the present government's relationship with the electorate - professional conductors do not always treat their volunteer singers in a way they find acceptable. Hence half a dozen of them formed a self-managed choir, hoping to give top amateurs a stronger voice in deciding with whom, and in what, they performed. Far from leaving the company chanting Buddy can you spare a dime?, the revolt has led to increasing demand culminating in in a booking for a Promenade Concert on September 9, in which the founder directors will be joined by some 45 other part-timers on their books. Whether Lamont will by then feel like singing along with them is doubtful. They're performing Schiller's Ode to Joy in the last movement of Beethoven's Ninth.</p>

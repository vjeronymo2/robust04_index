			<p><P> July 31, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MINOR LEAGUE NOTEBOOK / DONNA CARTER;  </P> <P> PAQUETTE KEEPS HIS EYES ON THE BASEBALL NOW  </P> <P> Craig Paquette has had a full-length basketball court in the backyard of his  family's Garden Grove home since he was in seventh grade.  </P> <P> There he honed the shooting touch he used to average 22 points a game as a  senior at Rancho Alamitos High School in 1987.  </P> <P> But Paquette, 20, avoids the courts now.  </P> <P> "I'm trying to stop," Paquette said. "Last time I played, some guy twisted his  ankle. . . . I've got to stick to baseball."  </P> <P> Paquette plays third base for the Southern Oregon Athletics, the Oakland  Athletics' Class-A team in Medford, Ore.  </P> <P> Although he enjoyed high school basketball and had opportunities to play at  community colleges, Paquette knew his desire was to be a professional athlete.  And his best chance, he felt sure, was in baseball.  </P> <P> The Minnesota Twins drafted him in the 36th round out of high school, but  Paquette turned down the Twins' offer.  </P> <P> "I wasn't physically or mentally ready," he said. "I hadn't lifted weights. I  didn't think I was strong enough.  </P> <P> "Coming out of high school, (facing) a 6-5 guy on the mound throwing 90 (miles  per hour), I thought I would be a little scared up there. I got a bit  intimidated by the hard throwers."  </P> <P> That was more than two years ago. After playing at Golden West College,  Paquette was drafted by the A's this year.  </P> <P> And these days, it's the 6-foot, 185-pound Paquette who is doing the  intimidating in his first season of professional baseball.  </P> <P> Last week, he was in a brief two-for-15 slump that caused his batting average  to drop from about .380 to .330.  </P> <P> "I'm not hitting the ball really well," he said Tuesday. "Right now, I think it  is a mental thing. I'm trying to work too hard or thinking about every at-bat  instead of just going out there and trying to hit the ball. I'm jumping at the  pitch. I have to lay back, keep my weight back. I'm in a small slump right now,  but I'll get out of it."  </P> <P> He did.  </P> <P> He hit two home runs Wednesday night in a 9-0 victory over the Everett (Wash.)  Giants, and added a grand slam Saturday night in an 11-5 victory over the  Eugene (Ore.) Emeralds.  </P> <P> His .363 batting average leads the club, which leads the Northwest League's  Southern Division, and he is second in hitting in the league. He has a  team-leading 57 hits in 157 at-bats, and also leads the team in doubles with  14. He has hit seven home runs, and is second on the team in RBIs with 31.  </P> <P> Paquette also had the team's longest hitting streak earlier this year at 11  games.  </P> <P> "He has been swinging the bat well," Manager Grady Fuson said. "When he tells  you he went into a slump it's because he was hitting .380 and went down to  about .330.  </P> <P> "He has a chance to be a really good player. He has some great tools and a good  personality. He is not a high-and-low guy. He has an even temperament. He  doesn't get down on himself when he has a bad game."  </P> <P> Paquette is finding the Class-A life style more comfortable than he expected.  </P> <P> He had heard the minor league horror stories of players living six to an  apartment, sleeping on the floor and pinching pennies.  </P> <P> With the A's, he is part of a program designed to give young players family  support even though they are far from home.  </P> <P> Paquette and a teammate live with a family, and have their own rooms in a  single-story, three-bedroom home with a pool, a "nice-sized" living room and  family room -- "and a satellite dish," Paquette said.  </P> <P> "I prepared myself in my mind for the worst, and hoped it would be better than  I thought and it was," Paquette said. "A lot better. I'm pretty lucky to be  living with a family right now."  </P> <P> The family supplies the food, although Paquette says he cooks himself. And he  doesn't have to save his quarters for laundry.  </P> <P> Jim and Darla Arnsberg charge him $50 a month.  </P> <P> "Their son (Brad Arnsberg) is playing triple-A ball for the Texas Rangers, so  they are really baseball-oriented," Paquette said. "They know what it is like,  and they just want to be supportive."  </P></p>

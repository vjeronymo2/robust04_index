			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TAPER'S FESTIVAL FORAY PROVED TOO EXPENSIVE  </P> <P> A bit more than 3 years ago, the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles called a halt  to its play festival, New Theater for Now. It had begun in 1967 and was one of  the oldest in the country. The reason it ended? Lack of money.  </P> <P> "The only other thing around when we began was the O'Neill Center," says Gordon  Davidson, the Taper's artistic director. "We started the festival as a series  of Monday night readings, and then we expanded it."  </P> <P> Shoestring productions staged between major plays on the Taper Mainstage grew  larger with the financial backing of the Rockefeller Foundation, he says.  Perhaps the best-known play to come out of the festival during the late 1970s  was Luis Valdez's "Zoot Suit." But after the foundation dropped its support,  the festival became "a victim of its own success."  </P> <P> "People expected more and more," Davidson says. "More scenery, more costumes.  The playwrights wanted more. Everything seemed to grow. And it became more  expensive even with simple productions, because we are a full union house."  </P> <P> To cut costs, Davidson sought cheaper venues. New Theater for Now was produced  on a 20th Century-Fox sound stage, in a coffee house at USC and at the Aquarius  Theater. Eventually it returned to the Taper in the mid-'80s, the last time in  November, 1985.  </P> <P> Although Taper staff members maintain that the festival could be revived if  money is found, Davidson says he now prefers workshops and readings away from  the pressures of a public forum. He cites "Stand-Up Tragedy," a new play by  Bill Cain, as a successful instance of that thinking.  </P> <P> Cain's play went from a workshop last fall -- it was one 16 developmental  projects in the Taper Lab '88 NeWork Festival -- to a Taper, Too production in  March and is scheduled to open June 1 on the Taper Mainstage.  </P> <P> "That," Davidson says, "is a dream scenario for a playwright."

			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / US telecoms reform bill abandoned in Senate: Baby Bells' opposition forces sponsor to give up Efforts to pass the most sweeping overhaul of US telecommunications laws in 60 years appeared to die yesterday when the reform bill's chief sponsor in the Senate gave up his efforts to win passage. Senator Ernest Hollings, chairman of the Senate commerce committee, said he was abandoning efforts to bring the bill to a vote on the Senate floor this year because of opposition from the regional telephone companies. Although White House officials are still working to revive telecommunications reform, a version of which has already passed the House of Representatives, congressional aides said there was little chance of success. With only two weeks left until Congress's probable adjournment for the mid-term election campaign, there appeared to be no time left to work out a compromise. However, several senators are planning to sponsor similar bills in the next session of the senate. Mr Hollings's committee had agreed last month to a draft bill which would have established the timetable and conditions for allowing the Baby Bells - the regional telephone groups which have a near-monopoly on local telephone service in their respective areas - to enter other telecommunications markets such as long-distance telephone and cable television services. The Bells' activities are now restricted under the terms of the court order which created them 10 years ago by breaking up the original AT&amp;T monopoly. Although the Bells agreed to a compromise on the long-distance market that allowed the bill to make its way out of the commerce committee, they promised to fight for further changes on the Senate floor, especially over the terms of their entry into the cable market. Senator Robert Dole, the leader of the Republican minority in the Senate, had adopted many of the Bells' demands for further deregulation. On Thursday, he submitted a list of demands, some of them labelled non-negotiable, to Mr Hollings. Other senators had promised to fight other aspects of the bill, especially a domestic content requirement that would have obliged Baby Bells which wanted to start manufacturing telecommunications equipment - currently prohibited by the AT&amp;T court order - to site their factories in the US and buy most of their components there. Mr Hollings said that the Bells' opposition was 'mystifying in light of the number of provisions and changes we have made in the bill on their behalf'.</p>

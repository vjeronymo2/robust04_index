			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Rubin: markets will be reassured MR ROBERT RUBIN is one of the most eminent members of the Democratic party on strongly Republican Wall Street and his appointment to head the new White House economic security council should help to reassure US financial markets over Clinton administration policies. Co-chairman of Goldman Sachs since 1990, Mr Rubin presides over one of the largest and most consistently successful American investment banks. A lawyer by training, his 26-year career at Goldman has given him an intimate knowledge of most aspects of the capital markets. Aged 54, but with the appearance of someone much younger, Mr Rubin has a quietly-spoken, cerebral and rather self-effacing manner. These qualities, coupled with his lack of experience of Washington politics, may have ruled him out of contention for the high-profile post of Treasury secretary. However, he has a reputation as a thoughtful strategist and effective team leader. He is likely to apply Goldman's strong collegiate culture to the delicate task of consensus-building among the many economic voices clamouring for Mr Clinton's attention. In an interview with the Financial Times last summer, he described himself as 'very pragmatic' on most economic policy issues and a centrist on social affairs. He believes that one of the most critical domestic issues facing the US is to 'break the cycle of poverty and disaffection' in the nation's urban ghettoes. A lifelong Democrat, and the grandson of a party leader in New York City's Brooklyn borough, the wealthy Mr Rubin has long been a significant financial contributor to Democratic candidates and causes. He pinned his colours to Mr Clinton's mast last year, long before the governor seemed a serious presidential contender. He played an important behind-the-scenes role in ensuring the success of the Democratic party convention in New York which nominated Mr Clinton last July.</p>

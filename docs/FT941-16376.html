			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Salinas sacks interior minister President Carlos Salinas fired Mexico's hardline interior minister yesterday and put the foreign minister in charge of a commission to bring peace to the troubled southern state of Chiapas. The cabinet changes were the most dramatic response yet to last week's uprising in Chiapas, in which more than 100 people have died. While the army has gained virtual control of the area, the conflict continues in the hills and jungle around the former rebel strongholds. Mr Salinas replaced Mr Patrocinio Gonzalez Blanco Garrido, the outgoing minister of the interior, with the reputable attorney-general, Mr Jorge Carpizo. The foreign minister, Mr Manuel Camacho, resigned to take over a non-governmental commission to bring peace to the area. Mr Gonzalez, until last year governor of the state of Chiapas, has been widely attacked for failing to anticipate the uprising in Chiapas, and for his oppression of indigenous groups while running the state government. Mr Carpizo is a respected former head of the government human rights commission and national university. The cabinet change came as Mexico's stock market experienced one of its worse days in recent history. The market closed down 6.3 per cent in heavy volume, its biggest one-day fall in more than four years. 'The market is worried that the conflict in Chiapas may drag on and that it may not be confined to Chiapas,' said Mr Timothy Heyman, head of Baring Securities in Mexico City. 'The beginning of a dialogue would be construed as a very positive signal.' President Salinas said Mr Carpizo's mission would be to bring peace and respect for the law to Chiapas, and ensure that the presidential elections this August would be conducted according to the constitution and new electoral law. A government spokesman added that the removal of Mr Gonzalez sent a message of conciliation to rebel groups. 'At the same time that the stranglehold is being applied in the area of combat, the government is open to all avenues of dialogue,' he said. The government previously laid down conditions for talks with the rebels that amounted to unconditional surrender. It is still not clear if the government is willing to offer new conditions for negotiations. The Defence Ministry said late on Sunday that the military base outside San Cristobal de las Casas had come under renewed attack, and that on Friday rebels had launched another offensive against the city of Ococingo. Notimex, the state-owned news agency, reported two explosions next to a communications tower in Chiapas on Sunday night and three that damaged an electricity tower in the state of Mexico. The explosions followed four bombs in Mexico City over the weekend. Mr Samuel Ruiz, the bishop of San Cristobal, accepted a rebel request to mediate in talks aimed at ending the uprising. Mr Rigobertu Menchu, the Guatemalan Nobel prize winner for peace, rejected their offer.</p>

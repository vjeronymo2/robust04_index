			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lome, 10 Feb (PANA) -- Togo's second round  parliamentary election campaigning is due to start on Friday [11  February] and end on 18 February, it was officially announced  Wednesday evening in Lome. In the first ballot, parties with  links to President Gnassingbe Togolese People's Assembly [Rally]  (RPT) won a total of 35 seats while 22 went to the opposition,  according to provisional results published by the National  Electoral Commission (CEN) in Lome.    Still at stake are 24 seats in 12 constituencies which are  expected to be closely fought for by the two main opposition  parties, the Action Committee for Renewal (CAR) of Yao  Agboyibor, and the Togolese Union for Democracy (UTD) led by  Edem Kodjo, a former minister and secretary general of the  Organisation of African Unity (OAU).    A stiff competition is also expected between the RPT and the  New Forces Coordination (CFN) of Prime Minister Joseph Kokou  Koffigoh. A head-on collision between parties in the opposition  grouping and pro-Eyadema parties is also inevitable in 11  constituencies.</p>

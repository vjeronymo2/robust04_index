			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Economic Watch: German unemployment rises German unemployment rose slightly in February to a new post-war record of 4.04m, from the previous record of 4.03m in January. The pan-German unemployment rate was 10.5 per cent of the workforce. In western Germany the rate rose to 8.9 per cent in February, from 8.8 per cent in January, while the eastern German rate rose to 17.1 per cent, from 17.0 per cent in January. The increase in western Germany was below analysts' expectations and represented a slowing in the rate of increase. Unusually poor weather in the second half of February may also have contributed to the rise. However, revised figures for Germany's fourth-quarter gross domestic product showed a fall of 0.5 per cent from the previous quarter and a drop of 0.9 per cent from a year earlier. Seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in the European Union was 10.9 per cent in January, up from a revised 10.8 per cent in December and 10.0 per cent in January 1993. Among the under-25s, EU unemployment reached 21.1 per cent in January, up from 19.3 per cent in January 1993. Italy's private Isco economic research body forecast Italian GDP growth of between 1.2 and 1.3 per cent in 1994. The government target is 1.6 per cent, but Italy's chief accountant said the Isco forecast was realistic. Swiss car imports rose by 16.3 per cent in February 1994 to 21,521 cars, from 18,512 in February 1993. Total car imports for the first two months of 1994 came to 42,179, up 9.5 per cent from 38,531 in the same period of 1993.</p>

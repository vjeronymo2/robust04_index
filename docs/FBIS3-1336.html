They also rejected claims  that elements of the Ciskei Defence Force [CDF] wanted to  restore former Ciskei ruler Brigadier Oupa Gqozo to power as  "totally wrong and mischievous".    The TEC-appointed joint administrators of the territory  formally assumed control of the Ciskei at 10 AM, and on Thursday  evening President F.W. de Klerk signed a TEC-approved decree  that gave them sweeping powers.    The administrators, Mr Piet Goosen and Rev Bongani Finca,  said in a statement that all members of the former council of  state had quit. They also called on all civil servants to act  immediately to restore stability in the territory's  administration.    Earlier there were fears of a showdown between the CDF and  SA  [South African] Defence Force [SADF] troops who have moved into  the territory in armoured vehicles. It was reported that Ciskei  troops took up defensive positions inside the territory's  largest military base, one Ciskei battalion, when an SADF column  approached, and that the column later withdrew.    SADF officer Colonel Johann Engelbrecht said on Thursday  afternoon that the CDF was "out of control" and that its command  structure had "gone for a total loop". He said the commander of  the South African Force, Brigadier Toon Slabbert, had ordered  Ciskei soldiers to hand in weapons they had seized from  armouries.    "We are very gravely concerned about this.... There are  literally hundreds of weapons floating around, shotguns, R4s,  G3s." But in an exclusive interview with SAPA on Thursday  night, ten representatives of the CDF ranging in rank from  riflemen to senior officers, said they and their colleagues were  non-partisan professionals and would serve the present  administration and future government.    The represenatives, who spoke on condition of anonymity,  sent  a delegation to the Ciskei's newly appointed admsinistrators on  Thursday afternoon, and a follow-up meeting has been arranged  for Friday morning. "We are loyal to the TEC and therefore we  also support the newly-appointed administrators," one of the  delegates said.    It was in fact the Ciskei military that had pressurised  Brigadier Gqozo's government into joining the TEC. "I suppose  journalists and some politicians would like to see a war. We're  not going to give them that pleasure." At a press conference on  Thursday evening, Mr Finca confirmed he and Mr Goosen met the  CDF delegation.    "We were assured that all the rumours that suggested they  were resisting the change taking place were false. They want  the entire community of Ciskei to understand they are supportive  of the transition," he said. A senior officer in the delegation  said he had been in contact with the SADF, who had told him they  did not want armed CDF members to continue patrolling outside  the one battalion base. "We had no problem accepting that. The  soldiers are back in the base, and weapons control systems are  working."    He also said Brigadier Gqozo's resignation caught the entire  CDF by surprise. Not even senior officers were given prior  notification. There had initially been some dissatisfaction  because it was felt that he had abdicated a responsibility for  addressing lower ranks' pension and leave gratuity grievances.  However, they were now satisfied that the joint administrators  would address these issues.    Earlier in the day, the SADF moved into the territory in  force to secure key points, including Military Intelligence  headquarters and Radio Ciskei. A convoy of ratels [armored  vehicles] also kept a watchful eye on the Bisho stadium, where  ANC [African National Congress] regional officials addressed a  few thousand civil servants and supporters.    Speaking at a press conference on Thursday evening, a member  of the TEC task force on the civil service, Mr Zam Titus, said  the decree signed by President de Klerk gave the administrators  the authority to introduce laws in consultation with the  president and the TEC. It also scrapped sections of Ciskei's  constitution, and gave the administrators power to recover  public property from former ministers and the head of state.    He said it had to be made "abundantly clear" to all civil  servants that all existing laws, including those relating to the  public service, were still in operation. "If they don't act in  accordance with these laws, there are procedures which define  what must happen with errant civil servants."    Mr Goosen said that as far as he was aware the territory's  commissioner of police, Major-General Manyona Noqayi, had not  resigned. General Noqayi, who was held hostage by striking  police earlier this week, is to face fraud charges relating to  faked salary payouts.    "The appointment of a new commissioner is one of the matters  that will receive our attention at the soonest," Mr Goosen said.  The administrators also had what Mr Finca described as  "suprisingly positive" talks on Thursday afternoon with Ciskei  ambulance service workers, who earlier blockaded the entrance to  Ciskei's parliament and ministerial offices to demand pay parity  with their South African counterparts. They also met  representatives of the Ciskei police and nurses.    Rev Finca said a mechanism would be set up to deal with  civil  servants' greivances. An office for doing that would be in  operation on Monday. Asked if the administrators would be using  Brig Gqozo's former office, Mr Goosen replied: "Probably."</p>

			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / International Company News: Mercedes-Benz expands in Asia Mercedes-Benz of Germany, the world's leading heavy commercial vehicle maker, has started production in Indonesia of a new range of light-duty trucks and buses aimed at weakening the Japanese stranglehold on Asian commercial vehicle markets. The launch of the MB 700 marks a change in Mercedes-Benz's approach to developing new vehicles for the global commercial vehicle market, as it seeks to overcome the disadvantage of its high cost base in Germany. The MB 700 range of light-duty trucks (7.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight) has been developed to meet Asian cost levels with a system of global sourcing of components. The vehicles will be assembled in Indonesia by PT German Motors Manufacturing, a joint venture company in which Mercedes-Benz holds a stake of 33.3 per cent. It will be for the local domestic market and for export to other countries in south-east Asia and the Middle East. Output is planned to rise to about 5,000 trucks and midi-buses a year with sales of about 2,000 a year in Indonesia. Engines for the vehicles will be assembled in Indonesia from components produced by Mercedes-Benz's commercial vehicle subsidiary in Brazil. Transmissions and front axles are to be supplied by Tata Engineering and Locomotive (Telco) in India, while the rear axles will come from India from AAL, a licensee of Rockwell, the US automotive components supplier. Brakes and shock absorbers will be supplied from India, propeller shafts will be made by Spicer in the US, Mercedes-Benz Argentina will supply the mechanical steering system, optional power steering will come from Koyo in Japan, while cab parts will be supplied by Mercedes-Benz's Spanish subsidiary. The chassis frames and cabs will be assembled in Indonesia, and local components producers will supply wheel rims and tyres, the exhaust system, springs and truck and bus bodies. 'The supply of major components from a country with high wage levels such as Germany could not satisfy the cost target. New ways had to be found,' said Mr Klaus-Dieter Vohringer, Mercedes-Benz components production director. As part of its expansion in Asia the German group is also investing DM85m (Dollars 49.4m) to establish a central parts distribution centre in Singapore, which eventually will have the capacity for supplying more than 15,000 different replacement parts and components to markets in Asia. Mercedes-Benz is aiming to use the MB 700 range to expand its presence in several regions of the world with production of similar vehicles planned for Saudi Arabia, Turkey and South Africa. It is seeking a general manufacturing licence to begin assembly in Vietnam, and is targeting emerging markets in China and in the Commonwealth of Independent States. While Mercedes-Benz, the world's leading producer of trucks over six tonnes (gross vehicle weight), has a share of of 30 per cent of the west European market, 40 per cent in Latin American countries and 25 per cent of the US heavy truck market, it has an overall market share of only 1 per cent in south-east Asia. In addition to the MB 700 range of trucks and midi-buses from Indonesia, Mercedes-Benz is planning to supply a range of light commercial vehicles to Asian markets from South Korea. A version of its MB100 panel van, currently produced in Spain for sale in Europe, is to be manufactured by Ssangyong, the Korean vehicle maker in which Mercedes-Benz holds a small minority stake.</p>

			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Accountant fined by regulators A PARTNER in the insolvency division of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the UK's largest accountancy firm, has been reprimanded by his regulatory body for breaches of the law and of professional guidelines. Mr Adrian Stanway, based in Coopers' London office, was fined Pounds 3,500 and ordered to pay Pounds 1,750 in costs by the professional conduct committee of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. The action was brought in relation to his work as liquidator to JDC Stokes Civil Engineering between February 1990 and October last year. At a meeting held in August, details of which have just been made public, the disciplinary committee ruled that Mr Stanway failed to hold an annual creditors' meeting in accordance with Section 105 of the Insolvency Act 1986. It also ruled that he had breached the minimum standard of insolvency practice resulting in delays and unanswered correspondence from a creditor. Mr Stanway admitted the faults, arguing that although he had been partner in charge of the case, he had no personal control over the company's file and that there had been a systems breakdown and human error in the office. Coopers said it had taken disciplinary action against a manager and other staff in its Southampton office in connection with the case. It is believed Coopers will pay Mr Stanway's fine and plans no action against him. In separate proceedings announced yesterday, Mr Frank Shannon, a former finance director of Nissan UK, was excluded from membership of the institute. He was sentenced to three years imprisonment in July after he admitted cheating the Inland Revenue.</p>

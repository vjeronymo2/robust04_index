			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Refinancing Loans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule stated that the refinancing of a pre-rule escrow account would turn it into a post-rule account. One commenter indicated that a refinancing between the same lender and borrower should not change the account from a pre-rule to post-rule status. Four commenters questioned whether modifications or assumptions of pre-rule escrow accounts would result in a pre- or post-rule escrow account.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Congress amended RESPA in Section 908 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 specifically to change the definition of ``federally related mortgage loan'' to include ``any such secured loan, the proceeds of which are used to prepay or pay off an existing loan secured by the same property.'' 12 U.S.C. 2602(1)(A). This amendment became effective on October 28, 1992, its enactment date. As of December 2, 1992 (57 FR 49600), HUD's regulations withdrew the previous exemption for refinancing transactions from RESPA coverage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Thus, when HUD issued the proposed escrow accounting rule of December 3, 1993, refinancing transactions were covered by RESPA. HUD issued a final rule implementing the section 908 amendments of RESPA on February 10, 1994. In that final rule, the Department defined a refinancing to mean ``a transaction in which an existing obligation that was subject to a secured lien on residential real property is satisfied and replaced by a new obligation undertaken by the same borrower and with the same or a new lender.'' (59 FR 6506, at 6512.) HUD also adopted certain Regulation Z requirements for refinancing transactions with the same lender. This final rule uses the &sect;3500.2 definition to determine whether a transaction is a refinancing that requires post-rule treatment. If the transaction involves only a modification or other change to existing terms of a mortgage document, then it will remain a pre-rule account during the three-year implementation period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Fees for Escrow Accounts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several States Attorneys General commented that they were concerned that ``lenders, in the absence of *&blank;*&blank;* an express provision will try to circumvent the express limits on profiteering contained in the proposed rule by charging consumers annual maintenance fees.'' In response, the Department considered whether servicers would charge borrowers escrow account maintenance fees or document storage fees to defray lost revenue resulting from changes in accounting practices required by this final rule. An examination of the standard Fannie Mae-Freddie Mac Uniform Instrument (Section 2 of the Uniform Covenants) indicates that such fees are prohibited in most circumstances (except where interest is paid on escrow accounts and state law allows such charges).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The Department has not seen evidence that servicers, as a common practice, currently charge maintenance or storage fees in conjunction with escrow accounts. HUD's existing regulations for FHA insured loans already prohibit the FHA mortgagee or servicer from charging the borrower for servicing activities. 24 CFR 203.552(a)(12)(i). If the Department sees such fees develop with respect to any other loans to thwart the statutory and regulatory limitations, then HUD is likely to reconsider this issue in conjunction with applicable State law provisions. At this time, the Department intends to monitor the servicing industry carefully to insure compliance with Sections 8 and 10 of RESPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Servicer Estimates of Disbursement Amounts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Twenty-nine comments sought guidance on how to estimate disbursement amounts for the next year. They specifically questioned how to determine whether increases or decreases in amounts ``are known or should be known.'' They questioned how they ``should know'' a change in the charge. Twenty-two comments supported the use of estimates based on the prior year's actual disbursements modified by a defined CPI index. They also supported using actual increases or decreases, if known. Nineteen comments requested more explicit guidance, specifically questioning which CPI index to use. Five commenters requested an example of how to estimate a new payment for the ensuing escrow account computation period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  In the final rule, the Department provides that if the servicer knows the charges for the subsequent escrow account computation year, then the servicer shall use those amounts in estimating the disbursement amounts. If the charge is unknown to the servicer, then the servicer may use an estimate based on the preceding year's charge as modified by an amount not exceeding the most recent year's change in the national Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (CPI, all items). In addition, the final rule establishes procedures for estimating charges for new construction where the land and structure are unassessed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Provisions in Mortgage Documents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule stated that the mortgage loan documents prevail if the documents prescribe escrow account limits lower than those prescribed in the rule. Six commenters observed that the final rule should permit a cushion on all escrow accounts regardless of contract provisions in the mortgage document. Twenty-five commenters indicated that the final rule should explicitly state that a one-sixth cushion could be established when the loan documents are silent. Many commenters were concerned that the language in the proposed rule would alter the contractual terms between borrowers, lenders, and servicers, and they questioned inconsistencies with standard form Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA, and VA security instruments. Six comments indicated that the final rule should pronounce common standards for contract types that address the cushions allowed under Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA, and VA contracts, using standard contract language. The joint comments from the States' Attorneys General noted that, ``while HUD's proposed rule clearly states that where contracts provide for more restrictive cushions than the two-month aggregate cushion, the contracts control, however the proposed rule leaves unnecessary ambiguity as to which contracts those are, and how explicit the contract language must be in order for the contract to take precedence.'' One comment also stated that pre-rule loan documents that violate the final rule should not have to be revised or be considered a violation of RESPA if the servicer complies with the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The rule requires servicers to examine the mortgage loan documents to determine their escrow limits in preparing the initial escrow account statements. If the loan document provides that an escrow account may hold amounts ``up to the limits allowed by RESPA,'' HUD interprets this as permitting the full amount allowed by this rule. In the final rule, the Department clearly states that if the mortgage loan documents provide for lower cushion limits or less pre-accrual than the rule, then the documents apply. Where the mortgage documents allow payments to an escrow account in excess of those permitted under this rule, then this final rule and the statute control. Where the mortgage documents do not specifically establish an escrow account, whether a servicer may appropriately establish an escrow account is a matter for determination by State law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  If the loan documents are silent on the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> amount  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> of cushion or pre-accrual limits and the servicer establishes an escrow account under State law, then this final rule governs unless State law provides for a lower amount. A lower amount would be consistent with RESPA's maximums and could be seen as giving greater protection to the consumer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Aggregate Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule mandated aggregate account analysis for all escrow accounts established under mortgages closed after the final rule's effective date. Thirteen comments supported this position. Twenty-eight comments opposed a mandatory aggregate accounting method (15 banks, 7 mortgage companies, 3 associations, and 3 attorneys). Many comments stressed that increased costs associated with aggregate analysis_redesigning software, staff training, and additional administrative efforts_would be passed on to borrowers as either higher interest rates, higher origination fees, or escrow management/servicing fees. They also suggested that low- and moderate-income borrowers would be the most affected by cost increases. Four comments noted an inconsistency between HUD's rationale for requiring aggregate accounting and the conclusions in HUD's Phase II study results published in May 1991. They suggested that aggregate analysis could result in more overall funds being escrowed than currently result under single-item accounting. They claimed that because a majority of servicers currently escrow below the RESPA limitations, under this final rule they would raise their cushions to the maximum allowable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Although there will be some initial costs associated with a conversion to aggregate accounting, HUD believes that this cost is outweighed by the long-term consumer savings that will be accomplished. HUD believes that aggregate analysis will result in lower escrow balances in the long run. Moreover, the Phase II study concluded unambiguously that aggregate accounting results in lower escrow balances than single-item accounting with the same cushion and pre-accrual practices. HUD acknowledges that servicers who have maintained escrow balances below RESPA's limits may increase the accounts to the allowable maximum amounts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

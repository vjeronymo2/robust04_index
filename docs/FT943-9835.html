			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Arts: Portraiture seen in its own right - At the National Portrait Gallery Susan Moore is drawn to the faces for clues to history A national portrait collection is unlike any other art gallery. Here, it is the subject of a work of art that counts; artistic merit a happy accident. As the aspiring young British history painter Benjamin Robert Haydon put it in 1817: 'Portraiture is always independent of art and has little or nothing to do with it.' A portrait may easily indicate the wealth or status of a sitter, and offer a fair likeness. It may also reveal something of his or her character. The Romantic notion of the genius artist as uniquely capable of divining and representing the essence of an individual lingers on. We scan faces for clues to history. Where better to search for clues than in portrait drawings, the most immediate - and often the most intimate - response of artist to sitter? Some 100 rarely exhibited drawings from the collection of the National Portrait Gallery in London have returned home from a North American tour and a selection is now on show in St Martin's Place. This disparate display, ranging from Nicholas Hilliard's keep-sake iconic miniature of the Virgin Queen to Kitaj's pastel of the art historical knight Ernst Gombrich, is utterly compelling. Unlike other exhibitions, the captions are almost as rewarding as the works of art. At one extreme is the slick, formulaic chalk of Charles Dickens by one Samuel Laurence, the quintessential anodyne portrait that tells us nothing but shows that, in terms of portraiture, the great and the good do not invariably get their just deserts. In contrast, the 18th century poet William Cowper could not have hoped for a more sympathetic recording angel than George Romney. Romney considered this rare pastel as the nearest he had come to a perfect representation of life and character, and had taken great pains to express what he had often witnessed, 'the poet's eye in a fine frenzy rolling'. That said, informal attire - no wig - and the suggestion of a keen, nervous sensibility (Cowper was a manic depressive) were conventions widely applied to the portraits of writers and artists of the period. No lesser witness to the 18th century physiognomist's premise that character can be read in a face is the head of Somerset Maugham. Graham Sutherland offers an incisive analysis of the hard, thin lines that scour and sour the writer's face. Sutherland spoke of dovetailing the diverse and complex forms into a single rhythm that suggested 'the maximum action in repose'. In Lucian Freud's no less impressive study of the recumbent Arnold Goodman, scrutiny of form appears an end in itself. This is not a portrait of a distinguished law lord. From Freud's peculiar vantage point, Lord Goodman's head is simply an intriguing mass of fleshy folds, crags and cavernous nostrils complemented by wisps of untamed hair. Freud could never be accused of flattering his sitters. Not so Henry Lamb, who perhaps can be forgiven his outrageous if tentative idealisation of the Hapsburg features of his formidable mistress, Lady Ottoline Morrell. (John Singer Sargent, a seasoned hand at phiz-mongering, animated the mannish features of the composer Dame Ethel Smyth by imploring her to sing the 'most desperately exciting songs' she knew.) Elsewhere there is ample evidence of the advantages of some intimacy between artist and sitter. In the presence of Gwen Raverat, known since childhood, a young John Maynard Keynes sits reading, relaxed and oblivious to the artist's intent gaze. William Holman Hunt described his pencil portrait by Millais as 'totally different from all other sketches which my friends have done being unlike either a murderer, or a beer drinking pickpocket.' Edward Burney's watercolour of his older musician brother, Charles, playing the fiddle, is an astonishingly tender expression of fraternal affection. Ultimately, it is only in the self-portrait that the artist is both intimately familiar with his subject and under no obligation to pull his punches. We detect an old man's apprehension in the touchingly direct chalk on blue paper of the 70-year-old portrait painter, art theorist and collector Jonathan Richardson the Elder. Sir George Hayter belongs more to the Albrecht Durer school of self-portraiture. Arm in a sling after a riding accident, he cuts a romantic figure in his vaguely exotic dress, languidly puffing on an oriental pipe. David Bomberg, in contrast, is quite sure that he does not like what he sees in the mirror. The exhibition, sponsored by Philip Mould, Historical Portraits, continues until October 23.</p>

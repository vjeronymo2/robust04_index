			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIVE! FROM LONDON! POLITICAL ACTION WITHOUT PEER;  </P> <P> TV: BRITSH PRIME MINISTER CALLED 'PYGMY' ON WORLD STAGE. FILM AT 11.  </P> <P> I say, old boy, PBS suddenly has a rival for the Anglophile market. C-SPAN, the  cable network that transmits the House and Senate, is showing excerpts from the  British House of Commons. "Masterpiece Theatre" buffs may be slightly  disappointed: Only one man, the speaker, wears a wig. Still, the names, the  accents, the suits are magnificent.  </P> <P> Sir Fergus Montgomery complains of injustice to war widows, with reference to a  letter in the Times of London. A Scottish lady discourses earnestly about what  sounds like "genital affairs." Wait, make that, "general affairs." The Tory  benches are a forest of foppish pinstripes. The U.S. House of Representatives,  by contrast, generally goes in for silly diminutive nicknames ("Newt," "Vin")  and baggy suits of solid blue. In lieu of stripes, the American members festoon  themselves with pins and badges representing various political causes and  patriotic themes.  </P> <P> Disappointingly, there is not a lot of Wildean witticism in Parliament. Prime  Minister Margaret Thatcher's style, aped by a chorus of young Tory sycophants,  is one of heavy-handed sarcasm. "Perhaps we had better wait and see so we can  pontificate in the light of the facts," she sneers in response to a complaint  of some sort.  </P> <P> More entertaining are the old-fashioned class-war thrusts from venerable  members of the Labor Party. It's less Oscar Wilde than Clifford Odets. "The  minister can shake his head . . . don't shake your head at me. . . ."  (Colleagues: "You tell 'em, Frank!") "He's got a garage with a couple of cars  in it. I've got people back in my constituency who have to walk because they  can't even afford a flippin' bus." To a setup question to Thatcher from one of  the Young Sycophants (something like: "Would the prime minister agree that the  past 10 years have been the most glorious chapter of history since mankind was  expelled from Eden?"), a Laborite yells: "Get off your knees!"  </P> <P> Even among political opponents, there is far more debilitating politesse in the  American House than in the British one. Vast amounts of time are wasted  praising bipartisanship, thanking the member for his cooperation and so forth.  Watching several hours of a recent House session for comparison's sake, the  only actual disagreement I heard was a polite tiff between two Florida  representatives about which one had more "seniors" in his district.  </P> <P> The House of Commons show vividly demonstrates one advantage of the  parliamentary system: the distinction between the head of government and the  head of state. Margaret Thatcher, world-reknowned for her haughtiness,  undergoes a twice-a-week ritual of humiliation-by-questioning that would be an  unthinkable act of lese-majeste if inflicted on our "jes' folks" Presidents.  "Will the prime minister now make a public apology for this gross  incompetence?" Has she not been rendered "a pygmy on the world stage" by  something or other? Will she not "be swept from office and dumped in the  garbage" soon? All accompanied by cheers from one side, jeers from the other.  </P> <P> Thatcher gives as good as she gets, but the whole process has a democratically  healthy leveling effect. Indeed, after watching Parliament for a while,  C-SPAN's House of Representatives show suddenly seems like "Hamlet" without the  prince of Denmark. The lead character in the drama -- President Bush -- is  mentioned often but never appears.  </P> <P> "Question time" -- the twice-a-week session where the prime minister and her  Cabinet are interrogated by other members -- replaces two institutions of U.S.  democracy: congressional committee testimony by Cabinet secretaries and  presidential press conferences.  </P> <P> American Cabinet members justifiably complain of the time they spend preparing  for and appearing at hearings. Usually in these sessions the Cabinet member and  the interrogating politician are both just mouthpieces for aides, who can often  be seen on C-SPAN striking the classic Washington pose of leaning forward from  behind and whispering in the boss's ear. In Parliament, the questions and  answers are brief and there are no aides in sight.  </P> <P> As for the presidential press conference, Question Time would offer the perfect  answer to the perennial question, "Who elected Sam Donaldson?" Free of the need  to appear objective or fair, opposition MPs ask tougher questions than White  House correspondents would dare. Better-framed, too. "Why are there more young  people now begging on the streets of London and our other big cities?" Thatcher  was asked the other day. Could even Donaldson have put it so straight, without  a little speechlet to blunt its force?  </P> <P> C-SPAN, established a decade ago by the enterprising Brian Lamb, has turned  into a wonderful adventure in true-life political theater. Funded by the cable  industry and run on a shoestring, it fills the airtime between sessions with  what might be called "found democracy": committee hearings, think-tank  seminars, State Department briefings, a charity "roast" in honor of a bigshot  journalist, a showing of campaign commercials by the Democratic Senatorial  Campaign Committee, whatever's available.  </P> <P> And there's more fun ahead. Lamb was just in Jerusalem trying to get permission  to broadcast the Israeli Knesset. Mel Brooks, look to your laurels!  </P></p>

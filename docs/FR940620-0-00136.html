			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 13.3.5&blank;Laundry Facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section contains requirements for accessible laundry facilities. This provision requires laundry facilities and equipment within or serving accessible dwelling units to be on an accessible route. A minimum of one washing machine and clothes dryer provided in each common use laundry room serving one or more accessible dwelling units is to be front loading. The provision also requires that laundry equipment controls comply with ADAAG 4.27. Few comments were received on this section and no changes have been made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 13.4&blank;Requirements for Dwelling Units Accessible to Persons With Hearing Impairments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section provides that dwelling units required to be accessible by ADAAG 13.2(1) and 13.2(2) comply with ADAAG 13.4. Dwelling units that are required to be fully accessible, as well as those required to be accessible to persons with hearing impairments, must comply with this section. This section provides that alarms comply with ADAAG 13.3.2(10) which requires that emergency warning systems include both audible alarms complying with ADAAG 4.28.2 and visible alarms complying with ADAAG 4.28.3. An equivalent facilitation provision permits the installation of appropriate electrical outlets or connections so that visible alarms can be provided by the operator of the facility when they are needed by a tenant. An appendix note has been added which provides some alternative methods of alerting residents of emergencies. Such alternative methods may be required by the Department of Justice title II regulation implementing title II of the ADA and by HUD's regulation implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. This section also requires permanently installed visible notification devices serving all living, sleeping, dining, kitchen and bathrooms. Notification devices must include visible signals to alert occupants of incoming telephone calls or door knocks or bells. Such devices must have controls for deactivation in sleeping rooms and may not be connected to visible alarms. An equivalent facilitation provision permits telephone and other wiring to be installed at the time of construction to accommodate portable notification devices which are provided by the operator of the facility when needed by a tenant with a hearing impairment. Further, this section requires that permanently installed telephones be hearing aid compatible, have volume controls, and be equipped with a TTY. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In the NPRM, visible alarms were required to comply with ADAAG 4.28.4 (Auxiliary Alarms) regardless of the type of emergency warning system provided. The National Center for Law and Deafness recommended referencing ADAAG 4.28.3 (Visible Alarms) because either single station alarms, including smoke detectors, or building-wide alarms may be provided in a residential dwelling unit. A few commenters were concerned that single station alarms or smoke detectors would be required to be connected to a facility's central alarm. They stated that there would be a conflict in the technical provisions if no such central alarm system existed and further were concerned that single station alarms would be provided to persons with hearing impairments when a building wide alarm was provided to other residents of the facility. In the NPRM, equivalent facilitation provisions were combined at proposed ADAAG 13.4(2) for all elements required in dwelling units accessible to persons with hearing impairments. Commenters urged that provisions for equivalent facilitation be clarified so that single station visible alarms are provided when single station audible alarms are provided. Further, commenters suggested that the requirement was not clear as to what must be provided at the time of construction and what may be provided as equivalent facilitation. Finally, commenters questioned why permanently installed telephones were not required to be hearing aid compatible or to be equipped with a TTY but are required to have a volume control. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The provisions for visible alarms have been revised to reference ADAAG 13.3.2(10). For a more detailed discussion see ADAAG 13.3.2(10). Provisions for equivalent facilitation have been clarified and relocated to follow applicable requirements. Visible alarm and notification devices may be supplied by the operator of the facility during the tenancy of a person with a hearing impairment provided that appropriate outlets, connections and wiring are installed at the time of construction. A clarification has been added so that electrical outlets for single station visible alarms must be provided when single station audible alarms are provided; and connections to the facility's central alarm system must be provided to accommodate visible alarm appliances where a central alarm system is provided. Language has been added to clarify that an electrical outlet would not be sufficient to accommodate a visible alarm appliance that is part of a building wide alarm system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Provisions have been added to the requirement for notification devices so that all primary areas of the dwelling unit are adequately served. This does not require a device in each area provided that the signal is visible in the area. Additionally, for the convenience of the occupant a provision has been added requiring controls for deactivating notification devices in sleeping rooms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to telephones, this provision has been modified to reference ADAAG 4.31.5(1) and 4.31.5(2) which require that permanently installed telephones be both hearing aid compatible and have volume controls. In addition, a requirement that a TTY be provided has been added so as to ensure equal access by persons who are deaf or hard of hearing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A commenter urged that the guidelines include a requirement for peepholes in doors to units that accommodate persons with hearing impairments. The commenter reasoned that if a person cannot hear a spoken greeting through the door it is necessary to open the door to determine who may be seeking entry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A requirement for peepholes which are accessible to standing individuals has been added to this section. The provision is regarded as necessary to ensure a tenant's safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 13.5&blank;Requirements for Persons With Visual Impairments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 13.5 (Requirements for Dwelling Units Accessible to Persons With Visual Impairments) was reserved in the NPRM. This section has been eliminated in the interim final guidelines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The NPRM asked what provisions, if any, are necessary for residential housing to accommodate persons who are blind, as well as those with low vision. The NPRM requested supporting data or other information, including building codes, State or local requirements, and cost information. Individuals and organizations representing persons with disabilities were asked to provide recommendations based on their experience or expertise. Commenters proposed requirements that included: color schemes for baseboards, doors, and windows that contrast with the color of walls and floors; standardizing placement rather than color contrasting; controls to be located on the front, top or side of stoves; lighting fixtures which can accommodate 150 watt bulbs, with highly adjustable dimmers for tenants with residual vision; elevators that have Braille and large print, as well as a voice synthesizer to announce floors; tactile signage for car controls and hoistways in white characters on black background; edged stairs and handrails on both sides; signage in areas such as laundry facilities, garbage areas, restrooms, and lounges; a 10 inch allowable height for unlimited protruding objects rather than the 27 inch currently allowed; and air and heat thermostats, security and fire alarms, and visitor indicators and identifiers equipped with talking systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

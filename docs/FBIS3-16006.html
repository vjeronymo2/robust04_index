			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: By correspondents </F> Dmitriy Voskoboinikov, Igor Porshnev, and Vitaliy Trubetskoy]    [Text] The head of Russian diplomacy, Andrey Kozyrev,  believes that the incident involving the cancelled meeting  between President Boris Yeltsin and the former American  President, Richard Nixon, as the recent "spy scandal connected  with the Ames case", "must not be projected on political  relations." The ex-president's aides are to blame for the  incident, said Kozyrev in answer to Interfax's question after  his Thursday's meeting with his Italian counterpart, Julio  Andreatta.    According to Kozyrev, "Nixon's first mistake was to neglect  to address Russia's Foreign Ministry." "This is the usual  practice, the more so as we have known each other for a long  time. We would have oriented the ex-president correctly from  the very beginning, in regard to meetings with the opposition he  was seeking, too," Kozyrev said. "We, too, have to deal with  the opposition every day, and know it well. Had Nixon asked me  for a friendly advice, as a professional in the area of  international relations, I would have advised him to confer with  President Yeltsin first, particularly in view of the fact that  they have known each other for a long time, and find acceptable  and tactful ways to meet with the opposition leaders only  afterwards. There were no obstacles for such meetings."    He does not blame the American ex-president for what  happened, Kozyrev stressed. "We blame his aides, who ought to  have organized his trip with the help of their good friends in  Russia, who would have oriented Nixon professionally. Now his  aides have only themselves to blame," the foreign minister said.    According to him, "there is no point in politicizing the  errors of aides who did not manage to organize everything on a  proper professional level." "The blunders of Nixon's aides must  not cast a shadow on Russian-American relations," Kozyrev  pointed out.    With reference to his talks with the head of Italian  diplomacy, Julio Andreatta, Kozyrev said that they had focused  on the ways to organize the next G-7 summit with Russia's  participation. It's common knowledge that currently Italy is  the G-7's chairman.    "We focused our attention on how to move toward turning the  G-7 into G-8 at least in regard to political issues, where to do  without Russia is impossible," Kozyrev said.    According to him, the two sides also discussed the activity  of the CSCE, since Andreatta is the chairman of that  organization. They also considered such topics, as developments  in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the situation connected with Russian  troops withdrawal from the Baltic countries, and the observance  of Russian-speakers' rights there.    Former U.S. President Richard Nixon has no intention of  curtailing his visit to Russia and will remain in Moscow until  March 16, officials close to Nixon, who is on a private visit in  the Russian capital, told Interfax.    On Wednesday [9 March] President Yeltsin said neither he nor  any of the Russian leaders would see Nixon following his  meetings with opposition leaders -- Communist Party leader  Gennadiy Zyuganov and former Vice President Aleksandr Rutskoy.    "We will not seek meetings with Russian officials," one of  Nixon's aides told Interfax. He said Nixon would attend a  formal reception at the U.S. Embassy late on Thursday and speak  to embassy officials at 1200 on Friday. He will later meet with  Russian deputies including Irina Khakamada.    Asked if Nixon was planning to meet LDP [Liberal Democratic  Party] leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, one of his aides said "no  agreement has been reached, though Zhirinovskiy's  representatives were in contact with the American side."    The aide said that although Nixon arrived in Moscow in a  private capacity, this did not prevent him from maintaining  contacts with the U.S. Embassy here.    A meeting between a representative of another state and the  opposition leader in a democratic country "must not be viewed as  a provocative act," the leader of the Democratic Party faction  in the State Duma, Nikolay Travkin, told Interfax in comments on  President Yeltsin's refusal to meet with the former U.S.  president, Richard Nixon.    As Travkin said, the fact that "somebody came and conferred  with the opposition must not irritate the head of state who  claims the role of democrat and builder of democracy."</p>

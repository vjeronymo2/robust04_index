			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Drug stocks fall on Merck warning DRUG stocks on both sides of the Atlantic tumbled yesterday after Merck &amp; Co, the sector's biggest company, warned that earnings growth this year would be slower than expected. The US group also revealed its first-ever job reduction programme when it announced 1,000 of its 38,000 employees would be made redundant this year. Yesterday Merck's shares fell Dollars 2 1/4 to close at Dollars 32 3/4 . In London, Glaxo Holdings closed down 17p to 597p in spite of news that its migraine treatment Imigran had been given technical approval in France. Merck blamed the slowdown on increasing competition in the US and healthcare cost-containment measures worldwide. It also cited currency movements. The announcement followed last week's similar warnings from Eli Lilly and Marion Merrell Dow, the US drug groups. The group said the effects would be seen in the first-quarter results and would be particularly noticeable in the first half. Analysts downgraded earnings growth predictions for Merck during 1993 from as high as 16 per cent to about 10 per cent. Merck has been hit both by its undertaking not to increase prices by more than inflation and the growing ability of bulk healthcare providers to negotiate drugs discounts. Sales have also been affected by health reforms in Germany. In the US, the price of some drugs are falling due to the growing power of bulk healthcare providers called health management organisations (HMOs). These account for about half of the US market. 'The drugs groups have dug their own grave,' explained Mr Hermant Shah, pharmaceuticals analyst at HKS &amp; Co in New York. 'They have been launching more medicines with little additional therapeutic benefit. That has allowed the HMOs to trade one drug off against another, driving down prices,' he said.

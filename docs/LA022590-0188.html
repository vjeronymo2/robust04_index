			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: LEAN TIMES FOR FOREIGN LANGUAGE FILMS;  </P> <P> A WINDOW ON A WORLD LESS ORDINARY THAN OUR OWN IS IN DANGER OF CLOSING; IT'S UP  TO FILMGOERS TO KEEP IT OPEN  </P> <P> Where did you learn about life? When did you first have a glimpse that politics  could be a literal life-and-death matter, and that sex could have a sheen of  sophistication? For many of us, the answers to those questions are "Z," "Jules  and Jim" and a dozen other titles of provocative movies that came to us from  over there.  </P> <P> For a lucky or daring few young Americans in the Eisenhower and Kennedy and  Johnson years, the world was discovered first-hand. With knapsacks on their  backs and their thumbs outstretched, and with eyes and minds open, they invaded  Paris and Venice and Athens and Stockholm and allowed those cultures to soak  in. For the rest of us, the window on a world less ordinary -- or certainly  less predictable -- than our own has always been foreign films.  </P> <P> Intimate details of life in other countries were the riches in the background,  in case your attention ever wandered from Jean Moreau or Anna Magnani or  Jean-Paul Belmondo. Sexuality wasn't the only plus to come from "The Lovers,"  in spite of those edifying goings-on in the moonlight. One could also get a  glimpse of the houses and the philosophy of France's very rich and if, by  American standards, those blank-faced stone country houses seemed so plain, so  un-ostentatious, perhaps that was just the point.  </P> <P> Architecture or attitudes could be absorbed almost subliminally. The French  upper-middle class was on lavish display in "Murmur of the Heart." For  Americans, it was a cinch to identify with "Murmur's" Italian emigre mother  with her sprinkle of freckles and her free-spirited behavior when the  opposition was that entrenched French right wing in those days of Dien Bien  Phu.  </P> <P> We've gotten information from every frame of even the most unpretentious  import. "The Grand Highway" provided the color of geraniums that a French  petit-bourgeois would put on her kitchen table. "Adalen '31" gave a feeling for  the spare, scrubbed beauty of a modest Swedish villager's house, not all that  removed from the Russian summer country places in "Oblomov." We could learn  niceties of behavior that might save face: after countless public bath scenes  in Japanese movies, it's handy to have learned that one soaps first, then soaks  in the tub.  </P> <P> There's a gray cloud over all this free experience today. If you've wondered  what Philippe Noiret has been up to -- all these months before "Cinema  Paradiso" -- or hungered for the modest French policier or the satisfying small  Italian comedy, you'll realize that slowly, these pictures have been squeezed  out of our movie-going menu.  </P> <P> We can still find the heavily promoted major interest foreign films: "Jean de  Florette," "Hotel Terminus," "Au Revoir Les Enfants." But the solid  second-level staples, memorable but not stellar, are another matter. Moreover,  there are great films from the world cinema that have either never made it  here, or played so briefly that they might not have been here at all. Their  disappearance feels like an affront. Haven't these films always been part of  our lives? Won't they continue to be?  </P> <P> Well, that's not the certainty it once was. Realize it or not, we've been  sliding into the lean years of the foreign language film. At the year-end  meeting of the National Society of Film Critics, the most heated discussion  centered around the continuing decline of foreign-language film distribution in  this country.  </P> <P> Robert Laemmle, whose family-owned theaters were the nurturing place of foreign  cinema in Los Angeles even before the days of "Open City," calls 1989 "the  worst year ever for specialized film exhibition." This, despite the performance  of the major successes: all the Pedro Almodovar films; "Little Vera"; "The  Story of Women"; and the strong showing of "Camille Claudel," which will  undoubtedly get a further boost from its pair of Academy Award nominations.  </P> <P> The reasons for this slump are complex and interlocking. Ever since the 1950s,  foreign films were a way for Americans to measure the almost touching depths of  our own innocence. Foreign films, we knew, had "adult themes," from which one  could learn an inordinate amount about life -- in private and without the need  of a passport.  </P> <P> We could find in them information that our own screens, reserved for films with  behavioral seals of approval from the Production Code, couldn't give -- a view  of politics and sex, poetry and philosophy older and deeper than our own. And  so we flocked to "The Seventh Seal," and "The Conformist," to "Bitter Rice" and  "The 400 Blows," to "The Battle of Algiers" and "Mr. Hulot's Holiday," to  "Knife in the Water" and "Hiroshima, Mon Amour."  </P> <P> Also, in those halcyon times, foreign film-going was simply part of the life of  a college campus. Friday or Saturday nights meant a foreign movie and hours of  debate in a coffee house afterwards. More than one sophomore affected a  world-weariness that was more Antonioni's than his own. And on virtually every  campus you could find a film society, whose hard seats and 16mm prints  nevertheless created passionately opinionated young moviegoers.  </P> <P> This was a smart hard core. They knew the works of Godard and Truffaut and  Rossellini and De Sica as well as they knew the movies of Howard Hawks and John  Ford, and they could, and frequently would, debate the merits or the  deficiencies of their idols until the sun came up.  </P> <P> Well, the world has turned. In the mid-'60s, the Production Code buckled and  with an explosion from within, nudity and language and controversial content  were no longer cinematic taboos in Hollywood. Suddenly we had films like  "Bonnie and Clyde," "Midnight Cowboy," "Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice,"  "McCabe and Mrs. Miller," "The Graduate" and "Easy Rider" throwing a new light  on our past and our present. Such film makers as Arthur Penn and Hal Ashby,  Mike Nichols and Robert Altman appeared, to distract Americans from their  fixation on European cinema.  </P> <P> At first, in spite of their gritty subjects, these films had a sleek,  American-movie look, those smooth surfaces that our film makers had, after all,  worked for decades to perfect. Only John Cassavetes swam against that expected  perfection and you can read the outrage with which his films were greeted in  the mainstream reviews of the time.  </P> <P> Now, with the energy and the direction of the American Independent movement,  our screen has stretched again. Browse from among "My Dinner With Andre," "Blue  Velvet," "Matewan," "Dim Sum," "River's Edge," "sex, lies and videotape,"  "Stranger Than Paradise," "Drugstore Cowboy," and "Do the Right Thing" and  you'll see the themes or the visual styles that were once considered "foreign."  </P> <P> Yet even at their most arresting, these films could only stand in the shadow of  "Fanny and Alexander," "Ran," "The Makioka Sisters," "Night of the Shooting  Stars" or "Wings of Desire."  </P> <P> To darken the picture, there are now far fewer companies left in the  specialized film field. Many of the pioneering plungers and risk-takers,  distributors and exhibitors whose fervor to bring the world's films to American  audiences was almost messianic, are dying out; among some of the few that are  left there's an alarming tendency to apply marketing surveys and bottom-line  conservatism to a field where those statistics least apply.  </P> <P> Then there's the matter of broad-based audiences. Schools and colleges haven't  demanded intellectual curiosity from their students for decades and so  generations of kids have gotten through high school and into college quite  without that spark. Among today's television-fed, ultra-conservative college  students, the ideas that created film societies are as dead as disco, and you  couldn't get them to a subtitled film. Gary Meyer, whose Landmark Theaters are  in the heart of college towns nationwide, reports that it's hard enough to lure  the baby boomers, who grumble but at least still go; college and high school  students absolutely balk at subtitled films.  </P> <P> So we have a vital age group with virtually no general knowledge about the  non-mainstream movie past, with television as their only common cultural  reference point, and the richness of foreign films completely lost to them. And  we have just tottered out of the Reagan years, a high-water mark in the  celebration of insularity and smugness. It's not surprising to hear from a  lecturer at a UCLA graduate-level film class that not one of his 28 students  had ever heard of "Children of Paradise," much less seen it.  </P> <P> What's left is a broad older audience, baby boomers and their elders,  apparently growing every year if one believes statistics, who are unafraid of  subtitles and who think of foreign movies as old, welcome friends. However, the  marketplace harbors one last sticking point before this audience gets what it  has grown accustomed to.  </P> <P> Video companies, commercial television and pay-TV -- those lucrative and  sometimes lifesaving ancillary markets -- are markedly disinterested in  subtitled foreign films. It makes their distribution even more of a roll of the  dice than in the past. According to Julian Schlossberg, president of the New  York-based Castle Hill Productions which distributes both domestic and  foreign-made films, "An American movie can have a limited or even a tepid  release in theaters and still do well from sales to video, to cable, or to TV.  But if a foreign film doesn't do extremely well theatrically, it has virtually  no life afterwards."  </P> <P> Taken together, these are a few of the reasons why, within the past two years,  we've seen less of those fine "small" films that dot film festival catalogues  and provide modest runs at the box office. To have fewer films like "Angi  Vera," "Hanussen" or "Sundays in the Country" seems an unconscionable loss.  Additionally, there is a backlog of world-class films, most of them festival  winners abroad, that have never had theatrical release, among them: Theo  Angelopoulos' "Landscape in the Mist," Hou Hsiao-Hsien's "A City of Sadness" or  Krzysztof Kieslowski's towering "Decalogue," his ten separate films on the Ten  Commandments. The irony is that this is the most dynamic cultural climate we  have ever lived through. What a sorry time to lose the most revealing way we  have to understand the politics and the culture of the world beyond our own.  </P> <P> This has been our uncheerful and immediate past. The slightly brighter side is  that we may, at last, have a blooming foreign film spring. From what it has  been possible to see at the Toronto Film Festival and at Park City, the major  imports scheduled are stronger than any time in the last 18 months. Most of  them are by recognized directors: Denys Arcand's "Jesus of Montreal," (just  chosen as an Academy Award nominee); Bertrand Blier's, "Too Beautiful for You";  Coline Serreau's "Mama, There's a Man in My Bed"; Almodovar's latest, "Tie Me  Up, Tie Me Down"; Bertrand Tavernier's "Life and Nothing But." Jane Campion's  groundbreaking "Sweetie" has just opened, and before long we'll have the pure  delight of veteran actor/director Maurizio Nichetti's "The Icicle Thief."  </P> <P> This slate looks hopeful. AFI/Fest also arrives in mid-April, and from director  Ken Wlaschin's advance word, it appears to be one of the strongest programs set  for this city in many seasons. (The festival will include the Kieslowski  "Decalogue.")  </P> <P> But the straitened period we've just been through leaves one to make some  cautionary observations. Most importantly, just because they've become integral  to our lives in the past, it isn't possible to take foreign films for granted.  Those of us in Los Angeles hardly need to be reminded of that, after the  disappearance of KFAC and the Z Channel.  </P> <P> We've just seen ordinary people work miracles abroad; this may be the era when  the supportive foreign film audience has to turn activist, on a slightly less  life-and-death scale. In the hair-trigger economics of exhibition and  distribution, audiences may have to work faster too.  </P> <P> It may not be possible to wait for the third or fourth week before moseying out  to a foreign film that sounds intriguing. And to wait for it to come to video  is to risk seeing a dubbed version -- or nothing. The leisurely pursuit of  foreign films may have become a meaner, tougher game; more than ever, it's  going to be up to the fans to turn out or see the franchise disappear.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Toronto, 21 Jun (EFE) -- On 21 June, the Canadian  and Argentine Governments signed a nuclear cooperation treaty  that will allow Argentina to broaden its program for the use of  nuclear power.    The document was signed during a special ceremony attended  by  Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien and Argentine President  Carlos Menem, who is paying a three-day visit to Canada.  According to the agreement, Canada may provide special  technology and cooperation in the nuclear field to Argentina.    The agreement will allow Argentina to make better use of its  nuclear resources for strictly peaceful purposes, especially in  the energy field, according to official Canadian sources.    Canadian Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet said during the  ceremony that the agreement "marks the beginning of a new phase  of the relationship between the two countries."    The minister announced Canada will sell Argentine technology  and equipment for the installation of a second nuclear plant in  addition to granting aid for the research being carried out by  Argentine experts.    The agreement was signed after Argentina this week signed  the  nuclear nonproliferation treaty in which the signatory countries  agree to use nuclear power strictly for peaceful purposes.

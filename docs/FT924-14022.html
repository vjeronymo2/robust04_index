			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / World Trade News: US comes top in services output - Advantage greatest in airlines, banking and telecoms THE productivity of many large service industries is still higher in the US than in other leading industrialised countries, a study* by McKinsey Global Institute, part of the management consultancy group, shows. The study finds the US advantage is greatest in airlines, retail banking and telecommunications, where productivity is as much as twice the levels in other countries. The study estimates that, despite official claims that liberalisation has made Britain's telecommunications industry more efficient, its total productivity was only 54 per cent of US levels in 1989 and also trailed Japan and France. However, Germany is close to US productivity levels in retailing, while in full service restaurants France was the world leader. Productivity in fast-food restaurants varied little between countries. The study, based on a year-long research project, concludes that many of the most important variations in productivity are due to differences in national regulatory systems and labour market policies. In general, productivity was highest in those countries where policy encouraged competition and labour market flexibility. Fewer gains were to be achieved by applying advanced technology than by introducing efficient organisation and management. The study compares recent international productivity records in five service industries. These are: Airlines: On a weighted average of six different measures, including ground handling as well as in-flight service, European productivity was only 72 per cent of US levels. The gap was smallest in airport handling and widest in ticketing, sales and promotion. Though part of the US airlines' advantage reflected superior scale, geographic route structures and the mix of services demanded by the market, the biggest reason for their higher performance was efficient organisation of labour. However, the study found that the 'hub-and-spoke' route structure favoured by large US airlines since the industry was deregulated reduced their productivity. Retail banking: Overall productivity in Britain and Germany was only two-thirds the level in the US. In Britain, the difference was blamed mainly on weak competition, and in Germany on the commercial banks' extensive networks of small branches. The study found that US banks offered customer service in their branches comparable to the two other countries and had invested more heavily in information systems and automated teller machines. Restaurants: Though the US ranked highest in terms of throughput per employee, France scored best in terms of value added per employee. The study found no clear explanation for these differences. Retailing: Overall US productivity was narrowly ahead of Germany and almost twice the level in Japan. Performance reflected the degree of concentration of the industry in each country, income levels and industry structure and organisation. However, property costs and scale economies were relatively unimportant. Telecommunications: The US advantage was largely due to superior capital productivity. US telephone networks handled four times more calls per dollar of investment than those in France and Germany, and twice as many as those in Britain. France, Germany and Japan achieved labour productivity close to US levels, though Britain's performance was only 58 per cent of the US. The study suggests British Telecom is heavily over-staffed. *Service Sector Productivity; McKinsey Global Institute, Washington DC.</p>

The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decontamination area shall consist of an equipment room, shower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area, and clean room in series. The employer shall ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees enter and exit the regulated area through the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decontamination area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Equipment room. The equipment room shall be supplied  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with impermeable, labeled bags and containers for the containment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and disposal of contaminated protective equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Shower area.

The showers shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjacent both to the equipment room and the clean room, unless  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the employer can demonstrate that this location is not feasible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Where the employer can demonstrate that it is not feasible to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> locate the shower between the equipment room and the clean room,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or where the work is performed outdoors, the employers shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure that employees:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Remove asbestos contamination from their worksuits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the equipment room using a HEPA vacuum before proceeding to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shower that is not adjacent to the work area; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Remove their contaminated worksuits in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment room, then don clean worksuits, and proceed to a shower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is not adjacent to the work area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Clean change room. The clean room shall be equipped  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a locker or appropriate storage container for each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employee's use. When the employer can demonstrate that it is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feasible to provide a clean change area adjacent to the work area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or where the work is performed outdoors, the employer may permit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees engaged in Class I asbestos jobs to clean their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protective clothing with a portable HEPA-equipped vacuum before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such employees leave the regulated area. Such employees however  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must then change into street clothing in clean change areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided by the employer which otherwise meet the requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Decontamination area entry procedures. The employer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall ensure that employees:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Enter the decontamination area through the clean room;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Remove and deposit street clothing within a locker  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided for their use; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Put on protective clothing and respiratory protection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before leaving the clean room.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) Before entering the regulated area, the employer shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure that employees pass through the equipment room.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Decontamination area exit procedures.

Whenever food or beverages are consumed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the worksite where employees are performing Class I asbestos  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> work, the employer shall provide lunch areas in which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airborne concentrations of asbestos are below the permissible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure limit and/or excursion limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Requirements for Class I work involving less than 25 linear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or 10 square feet of TSI or surfacing ACM and PACM, and for Class  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> II and Class III asbestos work operations where exposures exceed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a PEL or where there is no negative exposure assessment produced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before the operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The employer shall establish an equipment room or area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is adjacent to the regulated area for the decontamination of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees and their equipment which is contaminated with asbestos  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which shall consist of an area covered by a impermeable drop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cloth on the floor or horizontal working surface.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The area must be of sufficient size as to accommodate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cleaning of equipment and removing personal protective equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without spreading contamination beyond the area (as determined by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> visible accumulations).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Workclothing must be cleaned with a HEPA vacuum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before it is removed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) All equipment and surfaces of containers filled with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ACM must be cleaned prior to removing them from the equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> room or area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) The employer shall ensure that employees enter and exit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the regulated area through the equipment room or area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Requirements for Class IV work.

Otherwise employers of employees cleaning up debris and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material which is TSI or surfacing ACM or identified as PACM  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall provide decontamination facilities for such employees which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are required by paragraph (j)(2) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

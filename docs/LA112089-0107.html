			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ROYALS;  </P> <P> EDITOR FIRED FOR ROYAL PHOTOS  </P> <P> The publisher of The People newspaper said today that he has fired its editor  for publishing photographs of Princes William and Harry that were deemed to be  "not acceptable."  </P> <P> Wendy Henry, who was appointed six months ago by publisher Robert Maxwell to  edit the Sunday tabloid newspaper, had no comment on her dismissal.  </P> <P> The front-page photos showed 7-year-old William in a pose captioned: "Willie's  sly pee in park," and a series of pictures of 5-year-old Harry in a tussle with  schoolmates.  </P> <P> Their parents, Prince Charles and Princess Diana, issued a statement deploring  them as an intrusion into the boys' privacy and a security concern.  </P> <P> The photos appeared to have been taken in a garden square at the school the  boys attend.  </P></p>

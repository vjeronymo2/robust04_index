			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / People: Volex goes to Dobson Park for its chief executive . . . again Volex, the electrical interconnection products company, has found a replacement for Howard Poulson, its chief executive who was headhunted by Farnell Electronics in May. He is Oliver Chapple (right), until the beginning of August chief executive of Dobson Park Industries, the industrial electronics and mining group. Poulson himself was the main board director responsible for the industrial electronics division of Dobson Park before moving to Volex. According to Bill Goodall, Volex chairman, Poulson is 'a good strategic thinker'; he describes his replacement as having 'considerable UK and overseas experience which has been both at the operational and strategic level'. Ken Hooper, the finance director, adds that Volex's strategy remains the same as it had done under Poulson, but that this year was one of consolidation and settling in the the group's recent acquisitions, particularly Icontec and Component Manufacturing Systems in the US, and Mayor, the 60 per cent-owned Singapore-based maker of data and power cord assemblies. He says the Volex board had been 'disappointed' when Poulson left, but appreciated that he had moved to a group 'five times our size'. Before the Dobson Park post, Chapple was group director of business development at T&amp;N, and before that spent 20 years at Varity Corporation.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with SGS-Thomson Chief Executive Officer Pasquale </F> Pistorio by Marc Nexon; place, date not given: "SGS-Thomson  Equipped To Take on The Competition"]    [Text]    [Nexon] How do you see the situation of SGS-Thomson?    [Pistorio] Today we have the answer to the question that was  being asked seven years ago about the survival of the company:  SGS-Thomson has managed to recover and has become a  structurally-sound group. Debt has been reduced to less than  $300 million from the $900 million of two years ago. Cash flow  has been positive for two years now. On the technological  front, today we have some undeniable advantages. At Crolles,  near Grenoble, we have a plant the likes of which few groups in  the world can pride themselves on.    In 1993 we moved into the world's top three producers of  EPROM [erasable programmable read-only memory], one of our  specialist products. We are also a world leader in mixed and  power technologies. You may not know, for example, that last  year SGS-Thomson filed 327 patents -- one-third of the number  filed by IBM and almost twice as many as were filed by the whole  of the German microelectronics industry. That should be  stressed. However, that does not mean we can now rest on our  laurels.    [Nexon] What ambitions do you have for SGS-Thomson?    [Pistorio] The group must continue to grow faster than the  market. If we want to hold five percent of the world  semiconductor market at the end of the decade (currently we have  2.7 percent), then we need to increase SGS-Thomson's revenues by  a factor of four. This is a major challenge, but one that we can  meet. I am committed to making SGS-Thomson one of the 10 world  leaders in this area within two years. On condition, of course,  that we do not drop our guard.    [Nexon] What if there is another downturn in the market, as  people are predicting, in two years' time?    [Pistorio] SGS-Thomson now has the means of remaining  profitable. Even if the components market falls, we will remain  positive. Our aim now is to increase our profitability over the  average for the microelectronics industry. In 1994 our profits  will, in principle, be better if the favorable trend continues.  If, on the other hand, the market takes a downturn in the  second half, the situation will be different.    [Nexon] Do you intend competing with Intel in  microprocessors  and with the Japanese in dynamic memory (DRAM)?    [Pistorio] We are currently involved in the microprocessor  business, but it is true that we are not active on the mass  microcomputing market. We are currently seriously considering  this option. We will make our final decision in the next few  months. We do not want to rush into things because we are  talking about a long-term strategy. To enter this market we  could broaden our alliance with the American manufacturer Cyrix.  Where dynamic memory is concerned, the answer is clearly no.  There are too many competitors, and there is even competition  in Europe. It is a vast market but it is not a strategic one  today. It is possible to obtain a high level of technological  know-how without gaining expertise in this type of component.    [Nexon] It is rumored that your public shareholders in Italy  want to pull out...    [Pistorio] There is nothing that makes me think our Italian  partners want to pull out. On the contrary, they should find  the company's results rather reassuring.    [Nexon] So there are no new partners on the horizon, for  example Texas Instruments or Motorola?    [Pistorio] None. Any conjecture about transferring a share  of our capital to the Americans is quite unfounded.    [Nexon] Are you still assured of receiving the remaining  $500  million for your recapitalization now you have returned to  profit?    [Pistorio] That is a decision for the shareholders, but I am  confident. It is precisely because they felt the full potential  of the company that they released an initial slice of $500  million. Indeed, the performance of SGS-Thomson justifies new  investment. In any event, to maintain accelerated growth we  will need external financing.    [Nexon] People are also talking about a possible flotation  on  the Paris stock exchange...    [Pistorio] Our expansion and our profitability mean that we  are going to need capital. The group's situation is likely to  encourage investors. Today the conditions have come together in  such a way that we can start to think about a flotation.  Personally, I am in favor. I have made my views known to my  shareholders, but it is they who will decide.    [Nexon] What about the $1 billion contribution promised by  the French and Italian governments for R&amp;D?    [Pistorio] The public authorities are giving positive signs  about their desire to maintain the R&amp;D effort. The actual sum  will depend on the different projects put forward. We have to  remember that this aid will on average finance one-third of the  cost of the R&amp;D for the group's main technological projects  approved by the pubic authorities.    [Nexon] Can we expect to see a major European alliance for  components, in particular with Siemens?    [Pistorio] We are open to all cooperation agreements.  Moreover, we are working with Siemens in the context of the  European research program JESSI [Joint European Submicron  Silicon Initiative]. However, we should remember that our  respective strategic interests are different, especially since  we decided not to venture into the area of flash memory.  Siemens has just made a large investment in Dresden (former  East Germany), but we are not interested in participating. For  our part, we are involved in a major R&amp;D cooperation project  in  Crolles with Philips and the CNET (France Telecom). Managing  such a program with three partners that big already requires a  lot of work. For the time being, our agreements with Siemens  remain on a case-by-case basis. The defense of the European  electronics industry does not necessarily come through  partnership deals.    [Nexon] How is your industrial restructuring program going?    [Pistorio] It is complete. Five years ago we had 22  factories. Today we have just 15 sites. However, we have a  great need for new capacity. If we had had it last year, our  revenues would probably have been up by 50 percent instead of by  30 percent. As a result, we will be deciding on fresh  investment in the next six months. This year we must are to  start building a new assembly plant in Asia, probably in China.  Demand is burgeoning on the Chinese market. We will therefore  also need to build at least two more distribution plants  (modules) in the next five years, including one in the United  States. Nor must we forget our investments at Crolles. Some  $250 million has been invested so far, and an additional $150  million is currently being assigned. By the end of next year, a  total of $600 million will have been invested on this site.    [Nexon] In which zones do you want to build up your  presence?    [Pistorio] In 1993 our sales outside of Europe topped 50  percent of revenues for the first time ever. However, that is  still not enough. Our aim is to reach 65 percent by the end of  the decade by strengthening our position in the United States  and Asia, where demand is very high. We generate $650 million  in revenues with American customers. We hope this year to top  the $1 billion mark. Our presence in Asia will also be  strengthened through the development of our activities in Japan.  Staff numbers should quickly rise to around a hundred.    [Nexon] Seven years after the merger, would you say that  SGS-Thomson is now out of trouble?    [Pistorio] Absolutely. The company now has considerable  resources including on the human level. Last year we took on  850 people in France and Italy, and we are continuing to recruit  this year. The group is now capable of reacting quickly and of  adapting to changes in the market while preserving its culture  and warmth.  <H5>  Pasquale Pistorio </H5>   "I still have some fifty or so years ahead of me," jokes  this  58-year old Sicilian. At the controls of the French-Italian  manufacturer for seven years now, this rotund and friendly man  who despairs of ever finding a winning diet, does not intend  hanging up his boots just yet. "He is boiling over with ideas  for his group," a government representative said of him. His  latest hobby horse is ecology. "SGS-Thomson must be the first  company to eliminate CFC's from its products from 1996," he  insists. Over the years, Pasquale Pistorio has won the respect  of his shareholders. In his view, the European electronics  industry deserves to be fought for, all the more so since "the  Japanese have definitively lost their market leadership to the  Americans."</p>

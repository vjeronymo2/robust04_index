			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Economic Watch: French annual inflation at 1.8% French consumer prices remained stable in June, compared with May, giving an annualised inflation rate of 1.8 per cent, according to Insee, the national statistics office. June's figures, which were released yesterday, showed the continued weakness of inflationary pressures in France, despite the emergence of economic recovery. The weakness of price pressures in June was partly the result of the food and manufactured goods sectors, both of which saw a slip in average prices compared with May. Unemployment in the European Union was steady at 17.7m people or 10.9 per cent of the workforce in May, unchanged from February, the EU's statistical office announced. In May last year the rate was 10.5 per cent, Eurostat said. Since the start of this year the rate of unemployment has risen in Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, Luxembourg and Portugal but it has fallen in Denmark, Spain, Ireland, the Netherlands and Britain, Eurostat said. Greek consumer price inflation fell to 10.9 per cent year-on-year in June from 11.0 per cent in May, the National Statistics Service said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ana Trescina: "Trauma and Economic Loss: The </F> Medical Profession is Again Sounding the Alarm, this time over  Needless Deaths"]    [Text] Many inhabitants of Lithuania die from accidents,  poisoning, and trauma. The first and second places in these sad  statistics are held by diseases of the circulatory system and  cancer, respectively. Doctors are also concerned by the fact  that there are many more suicides than homicides. Very many  children and teenagers die needlessly (in this age group,  accidents are the most common cause of death), as do men (three  times more than women), and rural dwellers (1.85 times more than  urban dwellers).    Medical statistics prove that deaths caused by trauma are  increasing every year: In 1988, there were 2665, while in 1992,  there were 3344. Medical professionals think that the number of  needless deaths is increasing due to the free trade in alcohol,  which is often of inferior quality. This assertion is supported  by statistical data: The number of accidents and suicides began  to increase in 1988. Yesterday members of the medical community,  having called a press conference, announced to reporters that  they plan to deal with the problems of the prevention of trauma  and suicide at the governmental level by creating an interagency  trauma control council. It would consist of representatives of  the ministries of Health, Social Security, Interior,  Transportation, Industry and Commerce, Agriculture, and  Construction and Urban Planning. Also planned is a program of  public education and training, the reorganization of the  delivery of medical services and the work of the  traumatology-orthopaedics departments, equipping them with  diagnostic and treatment tools, the creation of an effective  system for the medical and social rehabilitation of trauma  victims as well as a system of suicide prevention. Without a  doubt, the new council will come out in favor of a state  monopoly on alcohol.    We can be sure that the government will take an interest in  the creation of the council, for trauma in the workplace causes  an annual loss of 250 million litas.</p>

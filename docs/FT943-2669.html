			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / FT Guide for the Serious Investor (7): Not a basket for all of your eggs - Hedge funds / A look at the place of an instrument that has disturbed world markets Hedge funds, which have been widely publicised both for contributing to the turmoil in the financial markets in the first half of the year and for offering potentially high returns, are limited not just to the serious investor, but to the seriously-rich investor, because minimum investments are high. Most investors in hedge funds are high net worth individuals - although some funds are also trying to attract institutional money. But even the very wealthy should not think of placing all their eggs in the hedge-fund basket. Investment in hedge funds only makes sense as part of a diversified portfolio of investments. According to International Advisory Group (IAG), a company based in Nashville, Tennessee, which conducts research into US and offshore hedge funds, a typical fund has a minimum investment of Dollars 375,000 and assets of Dollars 15m, and has been running for four years. The manager himself usually has more than Dollars 500,000 of his own money invested in the fund, and management fees are relatively low at about 1 per cent, while performance fees are around 20 per cent. But what is a hedge fund? The term no longer has a specific and generally accepted definition. Originally, hedge funds were US equity funds which 'hedged' against market declines by holding short, as well as long, positions. However, in order to enhance returns, some funds started to make use of leverage - exaggerating potential gains and losses - and also to take large bets on the direction of markets. These techniques are used by some of the largest and best-known funds, such as George Soros' Quantum fund, which has Dollars 10bn under management. They are generally known as 'macro' funds, because investment decisions are based on macro-economic considerations. Such funds came into vogue partly because fund managers found that, in order to make substantial returns in highly liquid markets such as the foreign exchange market and the bond markets, leveraged positions were needed. The techniques they use were developed on the proprietary trading desks of Wall Street banks and brokerages, which take positions in the markets with their own capital. Without funds, individual investors would not be able to take a view on markets such as the oil market or the currency markets. But the techniques used by funds which place themselves in the hedge-fund category are quite diverse. For example, while the so-called 'macro' funds take leveraged positions in the world's bond and currency markets, others concentrate on areas such as stock-picking, emerging markets and distressed securities. Further complicating the scene are futures funds, which have a different history but often use similar techniques to hedge funds. Futures funds, which started in the US commodity futures markets, are defined by their use of derivative contracts. Some, but not all, argue that futures constitute a separate asset class, the performance of which is not correlated with other markets. Futures funds, sometimes called derivative funds, also use a variety of different techniques, and may concentrate on a specific market or use 'quantitative' techniques to invest in a wide range of markets. Both hedge and futures funds are usually structured as off-shore funds, which means that they cannot be marketed directly to UK investors. However, there has been a trend to list funds on overseas exchanges such as Luxembourg or Dublin. Nevertheless, for UK individual investors who do want to put their money into hedge or future funds, deciding which fund to choose is a tricky business. With other investments, such as investment trusts, investors typically make choices based on the reputation of the company involved, which is usually long-established. This is much more difficult with hedge funds, not only because of their much shorter history, but also because they are often based on the trading prowess of an individual. In reality, UK investors who do buy such funds usually do so because of a friend's or acquaintance's recommendation. While 'marketing' is forbidden, funds in practice rely on word of mouth to do their marketing for them. The problem is that an excellent record of, say, several years is no guarantee of future performance, particularly in this field where gains and losses tend to be exaggerated. In addition, 'the investment management community here is geared up to provide a product which follows a market, such as a UK equities growth fund,' according to Mr Adam Parkin, managing director of LCF Edmond de Rothschild Fund Management, which runs two funds - Integral Managed Futures (with Dollars 9m under management) and Integral Hedged Assets (Dollars 13m). The option taken by many investors is to buy multi-manager funds - that is, funds which are invested with, say, half a dozen hedge-fund managers pursuing different strategies. Some companies set themselves up solely to choose fund managers on behalf of clients, often giving themselves titles such as 'manager of managers'. They argue that the process of choosing managers in this specialised area is similar to the demands of stock-picking in the equities market, requiring extensive research and analysis. While the fees charged for such services are often considered to be high, the approach does offer clear advantages, given the volatility of earnings of hedge funds and futures funds. 'We are big proponents of the multi-manager funds, because they do spread the risk,' said Mr Dixon Boardman, managing general partner of Optima Funds, which have about Dollars 600m under management. 'You will never be the top of the pops, but you will never be the bottom either.' For example, Optima's macro multi-manager fund, investing in the currency markets, is down 5 per cent this year, which, while not impressive, is not the disaster seen by other funds either. According to research by IAG, macro funds have posted the best average returns over the past five years, with an average of 30.6 per cent, substantially higher than for other types of fund such as market-neutral at around 12 1/2 per cent or aggressive-growth (often concentrating on smaller cap companies expected to grow rapidly) at around 18.3 per cent. However, in the difficult first six months of this year, macro hedge funds lost an average of more than 10 per cent. But over the past five years, perhaps surprisingly, IAG found the average risk of loss for the macro funds was among the lowest, at 5.3 per cent, compared with 5.5 per cent for market-neutral arbitrage funds and 13.3 per cent for aggressive-growth funds. However, the risk of loss does not necessarily provide an accurate pointer for future performance. 'Hedge funds have inherent in them an element of risk that is not present to the same degree in many other investments,' IAG points out. 'That risk is the future use of bad judgment by the fund manager, relating to highly concentrated portfolio positions and/or leverage.'</p>

			<p>940305 FT  05 MAR 94 / Liverpool oilfield supply base named West Hornby Dock in the port of Liverpool has been chosen as the site for a shore supply base to support the Liverpool Bay oil and gas development. The base will be the main point through which equipment and materials will pass on their way to the offshore site during the project's construction, drilling and operational phases. The first oil should begin to flow in November 1995. The first gas is due a month later. Competition for the supply base was fierce, with at least eight west coast harbours vying for the contract. About Pounds 40m will be spent each year to support the Liverpool Bay development once it becomes operational. Between 20 and 25 permanent jobs will be created at the base, said Hamilton Oil, the field's operator.</p>

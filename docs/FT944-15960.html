			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Strong response on BT3 - At a glance Investors in BT3 (the third tranche of shares in British Telecom) responded strongly to the call for the third and final instalment on the shares, due last week - 94 per cent paid up by the due date, compared with 91 per cent for the second call on BT2, and 88.5 per cent for the second instalment on shares in the regional electricity companies. Shares of investors who do not pay on time are taken by the Treasury, sold, and the proceeds returned less costs. Shareholders paid a total of 410p; BT shares last week were trading at just under 400p.</p>

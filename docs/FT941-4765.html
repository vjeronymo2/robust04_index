			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Paris to privatise Bull and AGF The French government yesterday confirmed that it plans to privatise Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the insurance group, and Groupe Bull, the troubled computer company, after the forthcoming sale of Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the largest French insurer. However Renault, the motor group, was omitted from the latest privatisation list, published yesterday. Its absence appeared to confirm reports that Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, favoured postponing its sale until after next spring's presidential elections. Renault's omission fuelled speculation about a rift between Mr Balladur and Mr Gerard Longuet, his industry minister. Mr Longuet said in an interview in Tuesday's edition of Ouest France, a leading regional newspaper, that he hoped the group would be sold 'as quickly as possible'. However, Mr Balladur and Mr Charles Pasqua, the hardline interior minister, are believed to have advocated delay on the grounds that the privatisation could be politically sensitive at a time of rising unemployment and social instability, given Renault's status as an historic battleground for French workers' rights. The delay also reflects concern about the condition of the French stock market, which has been volatile in recent weeks. 'French equities are very jittery,' said Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, chief French economist at Salomon. 'The French must be worried about the risk of swamping the market with yet more equity.' Moreover, the success of the first phase of the privatisation drive has given Mr Balladur some flexibility over the timing of future issues. His government originally budgeted to raise FFr55bn (Pounds 6.3bn) from its 1994 share issues. It has already yielded FFr33bn from last month's sale of the Elf-Aquitaine oil group, with another FFr28bn expected from the UAP issue. This means that the government will beat this year's financial target even before selling its AGF stake, which should be worth FFr15bn. Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, yesterday said the proceeds of the AGF issue were needed to recapitalise a number of state-controlled companies. The value of the Bull privatisation is more difficult to assess given that it is likely to be phased into several stages, including a small public offer and the sale of minority stakes to industrial partners.</p>

			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> MURDERER EXECUTED IN ALABAMA  </P> <P> Arthur James Julius, turning both thumbs up as a "goodby to the world," was  executed early today in Alabama's electric chair for raping and murdering his  cousin while free on an eight-hour pass from prison in 1978.  </P> <P> Julius, 42, died almost nonchalantly at 12:21 a.m. inside the Holman Prison  execution chamber, wearing a white sweat suit, flip-flop sandals and a purple  ribbon given to him by an anti-capital punishment group.  </P> <P> Julius was the 119th person to be put to death in the United States, and the  seventh in Alabama, since the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in  1976. The execution was the 15th in the nation this year.  </P></p>

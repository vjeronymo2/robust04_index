			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CANDIDATES QUICKLY TARGET BROWN'S SEAT;  </P> <P> POLITICS: WOULD-BE SUCCESSORS OF THE 58TH DISTRICT ASSEMBLYMAN POP UP WITHIN  THREE DAYS OF ANNOUNCEMENT HE WON'T RUN AGAIN.  </P> <P> Eager to take advantage of Dennis Brown's decision not to run for reelection to  his 58th District Assembly seat, would-be successors are sprouting like desert  wildflowers after a spring shower.  </P> <P> Within three days of Brown's announcement last week that he will not seek  another term, three Republicans announced they would run in the June primary,  while two Democrats have also indicated they will compete for the seat.  </P> <P> Long Beach City Councilwoman Jan Hall, Long Beach physician Seymour Alban and  Huntington Beach Mayor Thomas J. Mays said they will pursue the Republican  nomination. On the Democratic side, Joel R. Bishop, a Long Beach computer  systems analyst, and Luanne Pryor, a public relations firm owner who ran  unsuccessfully for mayor of Long Beach, are expected to mount campaigns for the  seat, which represents Signal Hill and parts of Long Beach as well as  communities in Orange County.  </P> <P> A three-term City Council member who also ran for mayor two years ago, Hall  announced a month ago that she would not seek another term on the council but  remained interested in other political positions.  </P> <P> "An opportunity has presented itself to continue to serve the public at the  state level, an opportunity to continue the work I have pursued for the past 20  years," said Hall, who heads the California Commission on the Status of Women  and recently resigned her position on the board of directors of the Southern  California Rapid Transit District.  </P> <P> The primary will be the political debut for Alban, a 65-year-old orthopedic  surgeon and past president of the Long Beach Medical Assn.  </P> <P> "I'm interested in California health and I think I can make a major  contribution," said Alban, adding that he had previously considered the seat  but decided against challenging Brown, a staunch conservative whose voting  record earned him the nickname "Dr. No."  </P> <P> "I think there are times when it should be 'yes,' " said Alban, who noted he  was pro-choice on abortion issues.  </P> <P> Mays, an ambitious 36-year-old, moved swiftly to capitalize on his sudden  visibility from last month's oil spill.  </P> <P> "It's been a crazy couple of days, but late Tuesday I decided the time is right  to take a chance and go for it," Mays said Wednesday. "I was setting my sights  on 1992, but Dennis' announcement Monday accelerated my plans. Nobody thought  Dennis would bow out."  </P> <P> All but Brown's closest friends and political allies were surprised by the  veteran lawmaker's decision not to seek reelection after representing the  heavily GOP district since 1978. But Brown, 40, said he wants to pursue other  interests, perhaps returning to the brokerage business.  </P> <P> Mays is the only Orange County-based candidate in the race so far. The mayor, a  lean former surfer with a boyish face, appeared almost daily on national  network TV as he answered questions about the oil spill and its effect on the  beaches of "Surf City." About 394,000 gallons of oil spilled from the tanker  American Trader on Feb. 7 when it struck one of its own anchors about 1.3 miles  southwest of Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> Mays likes to describe himself as a conservative with a "strong bent for the  environment." He contends that "politics and bickering" have stymied attempts  by Sacramento lawmakers to make serious headway in solving important  environmental concerns, a theme he says will be the centerpiece of his  campaign.  </P> <P> Hall, too, mentioned environmental issues, saying she has "fought to clean up  the air we breathe and move toward alternative fuel sources" while on the rapid  transit board.  </P> <P> Hall resigned from the transit board in late January to work for a private  consulting firm, creating controversy when she announced that she would oversee  the company's lobbying contract with the transit district. Her former board  colleagues subsequently cancelled the contract, anxious to quiet criticism that  the arrangement smacked of revolving-door favoritism.  </P> <P> Staff writer Steven R. Churm contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEXT STEP  </P> <P> The deadline for filing election papers, which would have been Friday, has been  extended until Wednesday because of Assemblyman Dennis Brown's announcement not  to stand for reelection in the 58th District.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratunac, Zvornik, 6 Jan (TANJUG) -- Throughout  former Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croats have been seeking military  assistance from the Serbs, TANJUG learned today from  high-ranking circles of the army of the Srpska republic [VSR].  The same sources note that units of the regular Croatian Army  and the Croatian Defense Council have for days been engaged in  combat activities against the Serb side, especially in the  region of Posavina.    In reference to Muslim-Croat clashes, the same sources  insist  that the Serb side has not and will not interfere in the  months-long fierce clashes between former allies.    The same source also drew attention to an increase in the  number of helicopter flights to the Muslim enclaves of Zepa and  Srebrenica by the so-called army of Bosnia-Herzegovina, despite  the existing ban.    As stressed by the Srpska army sources, the UN Protection  Forces [UNPROFOR] Command is well aware of this, especially as  blue helmet units are deployed in these enclaves. The Serb side  has already warned UNPROFOR Command of this but there has been  no appropriate reaction.    VSR antiaircraft defense units will therefore in the future  take measure to prevent all Muslim helicopter flights  contravening the flight ban, the high-ranking VSR sources warned.</p>

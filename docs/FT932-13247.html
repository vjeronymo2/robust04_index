			<p>930423 FT  23 APR 93 / International Company News: Distributor takes lead in bid for drugs wholesaler COOPERATION Pharm-aceutique Francaise, a small French independent drugs distributor, has emerged as the leading company in a consortium to make a counter-bid for Office Commercial Pharmaceutique, France's largest drugs wholesaler. OCP is subject to a FFr2.12bn (Dollars 391m) friendly takeover from Gehe, the German distribut-or. CPF, with a turnover last year of FFr2.3bn, has concluded an agreement with the Bourely family, which owns 15 per cent of OCP. Under the agreement, the family can sell its shares in OCP and will not participate in the consortium. If the CPF bid is successful, the family will not sell its shares for two years and can nominate a member of a three-man board. One director will be appointed by CPF and the third will be chosen jointly by the Bourely family and CPF. At the end of two years CPF will buy the Bourely shares.</p>

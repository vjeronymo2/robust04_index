			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Atom technology body makes profit formerly the UK Atomic Energy Authority - made a net profit of Pounds 16.8m in the year to 31 March 1992, its first surplus since 1987. Last year AEA reported a Pounds 40m net loss. The 1991-92 results, announced yesterday, show that state-owned AEA is expanding its sales of non-nuclear industrial technology rapidly to make up for the decline in government-funded nuclear research. Total turnover has been steady for the past five years at about Pounds 440m a year, while the industrial division's sales rose from Pounds 85m in 1990-91 to Pounds 105m in 1991-92 and a projected Pounds 130m in 1992-93. AEA is a candidate for privatisation in the mid 1990s - although there has been speculation that the government may want to break it up first into separate nuclear and non-nuclear businesses. Mr Brian Eyre, chief executive, said in an interview that he welcomed privatisation 'though not at the expense of breaking up the organisation'. He said: 'If it was broken up, we would lose many of our strengths, and I would be fundamentally opposed to that.' Mr Eyre said there were many examples of AEA's nuclear and non-nuclear divisions working together - for instance, similar technology was used to clean up chemical and radioactive wastes. AEA is also expanding overseas, with international sales up 16 per cent to Pounds 44m in 1991-92. It has made its first overseas acquisition: O'Donnell, a specialist US engineering consultancy bought for Pounds 2.2m. It will use AEA O'Donnell, as it is now called, as a route into the American market. Meanwhile the UK workforce continues to contract. The number of people employed fell by 1,000 during the year to 9,750.</p>

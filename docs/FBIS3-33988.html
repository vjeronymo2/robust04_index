			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [First Friday prayers sermon by Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, </F> head of the judiciary, in Tehran on 28 January -- recorded]    [Excerpts] In the name of God, the compassionate, the  merciful. [passage omitted] I would like to indicate another  point and, in reality, tell you about my own belief and then say  several sentences on the general deputization [niyabat-e 'ammeh  -- reference to eminent Shiite religious scholars guiding the  ummah on behalf of the disappeared imam]    I say that the imam of the age, may God hasten his advent,  who has the responsibility for managing the Shiites -- or the  Islamic ummah -- is, we say, our 12th Imam. He is alive,  observant and present. He awaits and is waited for. He will  spread justice throughout the world by his presence. Perhaps it  should be said that the Islamic ummah is managed through his  imamate. Taking into cosideration our Islamic knowledge, it  must be said that the lives of human beings are connected with  the existence of the imam. Speaking more carefully on this  matter, it must be said that the existence of the totality of  life [jahan-e hasti] is connected with the existence of the  imam. [passage omitted]    Regarding the type of guidance and leadership under the  conditions of absence [the time during which the 12th imam has  absented himself], for example in our time, we think that if the  imam of the age observes that a problem is going to emerge so  that the foundations of shar'iah -- and under our conditions,  the foundations of sovereignty -- are threatened he will give  guidance by any reasoning possible and in any way possible. He  will correct the mistake. He will guide so that the danger does  not come about for the Shiites or the Islamic ummah.    At the beginning of the great absence we came across a  problem when a jurisconsult would issue a fatwa [religious  edict]. Then it would become clear that he has made a mistake  and the imam of the age would eliminate the mistake even before  the jurisconsult realized. And then when he did realize he  would inform him that you do your work; you issue your fatwa;  you perform your duty and we will perform ours.    That is why I tell you that, especially in crucial issues,  if  it comes to a point where decisionmaking or action requires  guidance and the person who actually has the responsibility for  the ummah has a problem in making a decision or it is difficult  for him or there is a possibility of making a mistake, then the  imam [of the age] must come to his aid. We believe that during  the Islamic revolution in Iran the leader of the revolution, the  departed imam [Khomeyni], may God Almighty be satisfied with  him, made use of such guidance time and again; especially in  crucial and dangerous issues where decisionmaking is most  difficult. I noted in another session that all of the imam's  friends -- even the members of the Revolution Council who had  been appointed by the imam -- wrote to him saying that  conditions are not right; do not come to Iran. The conditions  are severe and that is not possible. It is not possible to  foresee what will happen. He replied forthrightly: I will  definitely come and if I am to be killed, I should be killed  among my own people. And when he set foot on the Iranian soil  and when his face was first sighted from the plane -- take  careful note of that; I note some meticulous observers have been  most careful [in this] -- a very deep tranquillity could be  sensed in the imam. Those who are acquainted with psychological  matters can read a person's mind from his face. With utmost  calm as if there was no problem. As if he saw that with his  coming the victory of the revolution was final and there would  be no problems either. [passage omitted]    In my view and in my belief this issue [Khomeyni's decision  to come to Iran] is a sign of the so-called divine guidance  [ershadat-e gheybi] by the imam of the age, God's peace be on  him, to aid and guide his deputy -- the person who has taken on  the responsibility -- to the extent that he himself [the imam of  the age] manages affairs according to principles and there will  not be any problems. If there is to be an issue that will be to  the detriment of the umma, his imamate requires that he does not  abandon his ummah and guides his deputy. [passage omitted]    His imamate requires that in the vital issues concerning  the ummah the deputy must be guided even if it means somehow to  take over his heart, his thoughts, and his brain. The absence  does not mean severance; that he has sat in a corner and the  jurisconsults administer. That is not so. Those jurisconsults  who take the responsibility of managing are under special  conditions where they must, so to speak, have that privilege.    I have very little time. Nevertheless there are several  issues that I must tell you, so I'll try to be very concise.  Let me say something in this same regard.    During the absence [of the imam of the age] grand  jurisconsults became the imam's general deputy and manage the  ummah. The deputization was given by title; that is the title  of jurisconsult. And at any time the titles are many and can be  many. There are jurisconsults. In our time there are many  jurisconsults and those titles and conditions are true in their  case. In al-Najaf, in Qom, in Mashhad, in various cities where  Shiites are present. [passage omitted on history of imamate]    Eventually, thanks be to God, all those skirmishes and  confrontations by jurisconsults and deputies of the 12th Imam  with the governments came to fruition in our time with the hands  of the departed imam [Khomeyni] and in reality a government in  the name of the Islamic Republic of Iran was founded in the name  of the imam [of the age]]. [passage omitted]    When the Islamic government was founded it meant that during  more than 1,000 years of confrontation with rulers infidelity  vanished and Islam came. It was not like a dynasty vanishing  and another dynasty appearing. That is most important.  [passage omitted]    The Islamic Republic of Iran means infidelity vanished in  the  government and Islam replaced it. The jurisconsult who has the  responsibility of sovereignty of Islam is a theologian, a deputy  of the imam [of the age] and acts according to Islam and must  observe all the Islamic conditions. He himself is subject to  Islamic laws and regulations. It is Islam that rules, not the  individual. Under such circumstances I have a question: If  during 1,000 years our jurisconsults, our religious scholars  throughout the Islamic cities used to answer the people's  religious problems, used to receive the religious tax and spent  it on religious matters, act in areas that they were allowed to  act and would say they had no duty in the areas were they could  not act, and the tyrant rulers used to act at the time of the  sovereignty of Islam, a jurisconsult somewhere cannot set  himself up as a judge. [as received] He cannot say that there  is a judicial system in the Islamic Republic and someone has  been appointed as its head by the leader and they are  administering the judicial system, but I am a religious scholar  and wish to set up a judicial system in Shiraz [capital of Fars  Province]; I can get involved in matters of jihad and war and  peace; get involved in collecting tax.    My insistence that the conditions before and after the  establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran have changed and  differ is for this point. If today grand jurisconsults are  sources of emulation and issue fatwas, nothing is wrong with  that. Let them issue fatwas: A particular prayer must be said  once or three times. That is not crucial, let them issue  fatwas. What is wrong with that? [passage omitted]    But if under the conditions of sovereignty of Islam a  jurisconsult -- for example in a corner of say this Islamic  state of Iran -- should say, after the leadership has announced  that there should not be any ties with such and such country,  that: he is a jurisconsult and I am a jurisconsult. He is  talking nonsense when he says there should be no ties! I say  there should be! The leadership says war must be waged. He  says: no it should not. The leadership says the government can  set a tax. The jurisconsult says no it cannot. [passage  omitted]    What will be the result? Will not the result be for Islam to  vanish and infidelity to come and rule once again? The question  is one of government, and not one of nongovernmental issue. The  multiplicity of sources of emulation and grand jurisconsults  poses no problems for the community. During the life of the  imam [Khomeyni], also, there were many jurisconsults. Not only  did none of them interfere in government affairs, but they gave  support to the government. They used to say that whatever the  imam says we accept. They either did not interfere in  government affairs, or they offered support. [passage omitted]    I say that the multiplicity of grand jurisconsults for  sources of emulation is no problem. But multiple sources of  emulation who seek to somehow confront the leadership, interfere  in government affairs, involve their fatwas in government  affairs and undermine the government means once again separating  politics from religion and a return to some people issuing  fatwas somewhere and the people acting on their fatwas while  others are ruling somewhere else according to worldy matters.  All the 1,000-year troubles of the great religious scholars and  grand jurisconsults which came to fruition by the hands of the  departed imam will be destroyed again. I say this must be  carefully looked into.    That is why I say that those jurisconsults who are presented  as sources of emulation must be aware of the times. They must  respond to the realities existing in the community. They must  recognize the friends and foes of the Islamic ummah. They must  distinguish the plots that the enemies of Islam hatch for Islam  and the Muslims. That is why the departed imam easily and  frankly said says that if a jurisconsult does not know the  issues of the time and is incapable of distinguishing them in  his view he fails to be a jurisconsult. [passage omitted]    That is why when I claim that a lofty jurisconsult, an  exalted jurisconsult, an administering and adroit jurisconsult,  a jurisconsult who is aware of today's world of Islam and has  adequate and complete experience, that is, the exalted leader,  His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, is at the very least, of the  same rank as others who are being considered. Of course this  debate belongs to follow the Grand Ayatollah Araki [chosen to  replace Grand Ayatollah Golpayegani as a source of emulation],  may God Almighty preserve him. When I make a claim, this is the  point I base my claim on. That is, the issue must be judged in  its totality. [passage omitted]</p>

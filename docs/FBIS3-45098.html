			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Taiwan's total foreign trade for 1994 is expected  to grow 7.5 percent from a year earlier to a record high of  US$175.6 billion, but its trade surplus may shrink to a 10-year  low of US$7.1 billion, the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT)  forecast yesterday.    Based on the BOFT predictions, the island's exports would  increase 6.9 percent from 1993 to US$91.3 billion this year,  while its imports would rise 8.23 percent to reach US$84.2  billion, due to increased market liberalization here.    The same forecast indicated that exports to mainland via  Hong  Kong would maintain a robust annual growth of 21 percent to  reach US$22.95 billion this year. The major reason cited is the  strong market demand in the mainland triggered by increased  Taiwan investment there.    Imports from Hong Kong, however, would post a marginal  expansion of 1.5 percent to reach US$1.75 billion, as  manufacturing industries in the British colony are gradually  hollowing out.    The resultant trade surplus in favor of Taiwan would hit a  record high of US$21.2 billion, the BOFR predicted.    Meanwhile, exports to the United States are expected to  witness only a negligible expansion rate of 0.77 percent in 1994  to reach US$23.6 billion. However, the United States would  remain the largest export outlet for Taiwan-made products.    Imports from the United States are predicted to enjoy a much  higher growth of 10.67 percent to reach US$19.5 billion this  year.    As a result, the island's trade surplus with the United  States would drop to a 10-year low of US$4 billion, compared  with a high of US$16 billion to US$17 billion seen some six  years ago.    By contrast, Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan is projected  to reach a new high of US$15.8 billion in the new year. Imports  from Japan would increase 6.9 percent to US$25 billion, and  exports to that country would grow only 2.2 percent to US$9.1  billion.</p>

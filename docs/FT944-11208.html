			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (27): Patience is paramount - Doing business in China Doing business in China today is dramatically different from ten years ago. As China continues its dizzying rush toward modernization, many of the rules have changed. Into this fluid and chaotic situation pour senior executives from countries all over the world. In an atmosphere reminiscent of a gold rush, China has become an intensely competitive free-for-all in which foreign companies are fighting for market share, skilled personnel and office space. 'Everyone is focusing on China - companies see it as having a huge market potential,' said Phil Carmichael, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing. 'Everyone's competitor is focusing on China and they are willing to undercut each other. Your real market competitors are the foreign manufacturers your company faces elsewhere.' Companies seeking to do business in this environment will find that in many ways conditions have improved dramatically. One result of the China boom has been a striking improvement in the logistics of doing business, with better infrastructure, easier access to faxes, copiers and international phone calls, and greater availability of taxis and minibuses. Moreover, after a decade and half of exposure to the outside world, the Chinese are much more open to dealing with foreigners and there is a greater effort to make public rules and regulations. In another significant change, managers in state-run factories have more power to make their own decisions and even own a stake of the equity. The work force is more mobile and foreign companies are able to hire well-qualified local staff of their choosing. For all of the changes, though, certain fundamentals of doing business with the Chinese have not changed. For newcomers, good advice is to look outside the main cities of Beijing and Shanghai to see the real chaotic China where basic infrastructure lags well behind its economic development and aspirations. 'If you only go to Beijing and Shanghai and zoom around in taxis, you'll get a distorted picture,' says Anne Stevenson-Yang, chief representative of the US-China Business Council. Experienced China traders also say that having patience is still an absolute necessity. Under tremendous pressure to produce results because of the high cost of being in the country, foreign businessmen often cannot move slowly enough to adapt to the market. 'China moves incredibly slowly,' says Steve Crandall, president of Crandall Ford International, a dealership representing the American auto giant in Tianjin. 'A standard USDollars 500,000 negotiation here takes seven 12-hour days.' Negotiations about purchases of imported products will often start with what would be considered a given in western countries. For example, car sales discussions involve such basics as whether a motor would be included in the price. In addition, the approval process for using foreign exchange to buy imported products can take a year or longer as it goes through the bureaucracy. 'If a person comes in today, he or she won't see results for 12 to 15 months,' says AmCham's president Phil Carmichael. 'If your company has put up one to one to Dollars 1.5m up front and doesn't get an immediate return, that doesn't mean your rep is not going a good job. He could be sowing seeds for your company the following year.' Looking for a compatible partner is one of the most challenging assignments and one that often goes easily wrong. Businessmen stressed the importance of not entering into a deal with the first individual claiming to have special contacts. 'A lot of companies are sent off on the wrong track because they know one American or overseas Chinese who claims to have good connections with bureauracy,' says Stevenson-Yang. 'Even if he has good connections in one ministry, this could become a liability if you 'tie your horse to only one wagon.'' Researching the background of potential partners is vital to avoiding problems later. Many sources of information are available, including embassy commercial sections, other companies in similar industries, consultants, and even reports from ministries that rank domestic companies' performances. Another common pitfall is racing to sign a letter of intent without investigating other options. Although these documents are not legally binding, the Chinese present them internally as proposals for joint ventures. The Chinese would rather negotiate with foreigners than tell their own officials to give up a point. 'Be careful what you sign,' a western attorney warns. 'It may look innocent enough, but it may come back to bite you.' Investors should carefully weigh the benefits of establishing a wholly-owned enterprise or a joint venture. While joint ventures may be a suitable option, even with a large equity stake, they are often an uneasy marriage, with problems arising over profit distribution, management, and the number of workers. Partners need not always be in the same industry as the foreign company as long as both parties have a common vision. Baskin Robbin's, an American ice cream maker, relies on its sales agent, a subsidiary of the military-run Great Wall Company which is involved in satellite launches, for its knowledge of how to work the bureaucracy in order to bring its American-made ice cream through customs. A tight property market has made office premises and residential accommodation in Beijing almost as expensive as those in Hong Kong. There are long waiting lists for every first class building in the capital, but a downturn is expected in mid-1996 as more commercial space becomes available. Until then, the best practice is to remain flexible, sign only short term leases and look for creative alternatives, such as renting space from a customer. With executives working long hours and travelling on the road much of the time, China is not an easy place for an unoccupied spouse. Spouses with Chinese language skills have a reasonable chance of finding a job with a joint venture company or one of the many western companies doing business here. But for those who do not, taking crash courses in Chinese can help with basic communication. Other options can include pursuing a particular interest, or, for a fluent English speaker in today's climate, marketing that ability to land a job as an English teacher or polisher.</p>

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (16): Northern Electric turns on to maps - Utility, Power supplier / Disparate sources of information and replicated, duplicated data made it almost impossible to deliver specific, up-to-date details to users who needed, often urgently, to access or maintain equipment. GIS came into its own as a way to digitise the information Maintenance of accurate records is a chore for any organisation. For Northern Electric, supplier of electricity in the north-east region of England, the problem is escalated by connecting paper-based data with spatial diagrams of the network, writes Claire Gooding. Updating maps, sometimes in three different scales, was a time-consuming operation. Since the 1920s Northern Electric has kept paper-based records of assets, routes of cables, wayleave agreements, technical descriptions, and other maintenance details. Disparate sources of information, and replicated, duplicated data made it almost impossible to deliver specific, up-to-date details to users who needed, often urgently, to access or maintain particular equipment. 'Like every other utility, we have historically had information, but it's been a major problem maintaining its concurrency,' explains Ian Homer, GIS project engineer. 'It takes a large amount of effort and manpower to keep the information in step.' Homer's service on the industry body, the Electricity Council (now the Electrical Association), had given him an inside view of what might benefit Northern Electric. 'What we wanted was an integrated plant and circuit database, an intelligent model, and GIS was the only way.' At one time, Northern Electric used real models, miniatures of the network, but, like any form of information, the maintenance of the model was itself a problem. 'Traditional database technology wasn't man enough. We could record information about plant, but not cable and overhead lines: it wasn't easy to establish connectivity,' explains Homer. He masterminded the ILIAD project, (Integrated Line Information and Asset Data), a classic GIS prototype that would create a single integrated database to locate all its assets and associated information. Nearly 20 GIS products were reviewed, but narrowed down to a shortlist of software from Unisys, ICL, Intergraph, Smallworld and ESRA. Northern Electric chose Smallworld because of its promising data conversion tools, unique at the time of selection two years ago. GIS came into its own as a way to digitise the information: a job beyond ordinary Computer Aided Design tools. 'Data conversion used to be the biggest cost of GIS, but it's not so any more, as we've proved with screen-digitising tools,' comments Homer. Around 200 of Northern Electric's 4,500 employees use the system, currently available on nine workstations, but likely to expand as works management and financial systems become fully integrated. A valuable result of the exercise has been a unique reference for each customer-premises, a permanent, precise identifier which may prove as useful to finance and marketing as it is to the asset system. The main business benefits, says Homer, have been in efficiency. 'We can reproduce maps and plans to any scale without replicating and maintaining three separate scales, a great saving of manpower. We can do current work more efficiently, giving customers notice of planned interruption to the supply, because the identifier gives us an automatic trace of who is connected, at which point, and can even issue notices automatically.' Now the database is in place, Homer argues that it could be used more widely for optimising the use of assets, identifying spare capacity, and even for the better targeting of potential customers. in marketing exercises. The process of validating the company data has itself been valuable, checking the consistency and accuracy. It has also given Homer's team a realistic grasp of what's involved in providing a GIS, before other departments start getting their own bright ideas for using the information. 'We know all of the questions before we roll out full scale,' says Homer.</p>

			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Asian nations facing challenges EUPHORIA over China's recent economic growth contrasted sharply with concern at the challenges faced by other developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region at the Indonesia, Asia-Pacific and New World Order conference in Bali yesterday. China has 'basically solved the problem of feeding and clothing more than 1.1bn people,' said Mr Li Luye, director general of the Centre for International Studies in China. 'People are convinced. . . China's goals of reform and opening up are attainable.' Chinese delegates called for a move toward greater East Asian economic co-operation. But other delegates noted a reluctance among many Asian nations to establish far-reaching trade agreements and saw China as a potentially destabilising force in the region. They pointed to slow implementation of the free trade area within the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean), which encompasses Indonesia, Thailand, Brunei, the Philippines, Singapore and Malaysia. The benefits of Asean in terms of increased trade and flows of foreign investment had been minimal, delegates said. Mr Ajit Singh, Asean secretary general, said China had been drawing foreign investment away from South-East Asia. Editorial comment, Page 13</p>

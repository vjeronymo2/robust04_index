			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Marriage bureau for business angels - In a Nutshell The chancellor made the UK far more attractive for business angels by introducing incentives in last month's budget. But how does the business seeking finance track down this elusive and largely anonymous breed? And how does the angel know where to find suitable investments? The answer is a marriage bureau. Hot on the tail of Kenneth Clarke's budget the British Venture Capital Association, has produced a guide to these introduction services. Compiled by Colin Mason of Southampton University and Prof Richard Harrison of Ulster Business School, the guide says the business angel can provide the first rung on the financing ladder.

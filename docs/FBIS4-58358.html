			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Iqbal 'Ali 'Abdallah: "Yasin Nu'man Tells </F> AL-HAYAH: There Are Military Movements Aimed at Eliminating All  Southern Units in the North"]    [Excerpts] Aden -- In the first statement by a leading  Yemeni Socialist party [YSP] official on the serious military  situation in some Yemeni areas, Dr. Yasin Sa'id Nu'man, chairman  of the YSP Central Committee Secretariat, has told AL-HAYAH that  there is an "attempt to eliminate the southern military units  present in northern governorates, beginning with the 5th Brigade  and the 3rd Tank Brigade in 'Imran. There are continued  provocations aimed against the other units, especially the  Basahib Brigade in Dhamar." [passage omitted]    He stressed that, "despite the continued attempts to lift  the  siege on the southern brigades in the north and the remaining  units of the 3rd Brigade in 'Imran, these efforts have been  obstructed by a rejectionist position from the other side and  the military command belonging to the General People's Congress  [GPC] led by Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman  of the Presidential Council." [passage omitted]    He added: "We hold the GPC leadership fully responsible for  all the dangers and seditions that may afflict the homeland as a  result of these actions."    The chairman of the YSP Central Committee Secretariat urged  "political forces and the Dialogue Committee to condemn these  ugly actions in order to prevent a repetition of the tragedies  on which this leadership has embarked."

			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Bid to reshape security council THE UNITED Nations general assembly yesterday made its first formal move to expand membership of the security council, where Germany and Japan among others are seeking permanent seats. In a decision adopted without voting, the assembly called for written comments by states on a 'possible review' of security council membership and further discussions at the 1993 session. The resolution, introduced by India - which also believes it should have a permanent seat - referred to the council's 'increasingly crucial role' in the world and a need to revitalise and restructure UN organs. The 15-nation council's exceptionally busy schedule over the past 2-3 years, with meetings now being held every few days, has left the 179-member general assembly in a political and diplomatic backwater. The decision is a shot across the bows of such entrenched members as Britain and France, whose global influence has waned since the UN was set up in 1945. Many UN delegates believe that substantial restructuring now is inevitable, despite coolness from London and Paris. Japan, Brazil, Egypt, Indonesia and Mexico, all claimants to a permanent seat, were among the resolution's sponsors. Under the UN charter, the US, Russia, Britain, France and China are permanent members of the security council, with veto powers. But the veto right has become somewhat academic since none of them has exercised the prerogative for more than two years. Canada is to withdraw its peacekeeping force from Cyprus after 28 years because of commitments elsewhere and the lack of progress in Greek-Turkish negotiations, Reuter reports from Ottawa. Ms Mary Collins, junior defence minister, told parliament the Canadian contingent of 575 troops stationed in the critical Nicosia sector would start leaving next June. The withdrawal would be completed by September. British, Danish and Austrian troops would continue the UN peacekeeping mission in Cyprus. Canada told the UN in September that its patience and resources were running short.</p>

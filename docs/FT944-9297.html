			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Mr Greenspan takes charge Sensible it may have been. Surprising it was not. With the Congressional elections now behind him, few doubted that Mr Alan Greenspan would decide to raise US interest rates at yesterday's Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting. In the end, he did a little more than many expected. The three-quarter point rise in both the discount rate and the rate on Federal funds - the largest increase since 1980 - will not please everybody. But Mr Greenspan is not there to please. He is there to keep inflation broadly stable, as the US recovery matures. To date, there is little to suggest that he has got much wrong. The Federal Reserve chairman is attempting a difficult feat with highly imperfect tools. Mr Greenspan would like to engineer a 'soft landing' for a healthy economy, now well into its fourth year of expansion. The five rate rises since the beginning of the year, which preceded yesterday's change, have so far failed to bring the annual rate of growth in real GDP, currently 3.8 per cent, to the 2.5 per cent historically associated with stable inflation. News of another rise in factory operating rates in October did little to dispel investors' belief in the economy's underlying vigour. Before yesterday, they have increasingly condemned Mr Greenspan's efforts as lethargic, especially in light of persistent downward pressure on the dollar. Yet the fact that interest rate changes have most of their effect a year or two after the event makes this judgment a lot easier to assert than to prove. Mr Greenspan has been slower to raise interest rates in the current upturn than his predecessor in the early 1980s. But, if one were judging by history alone, one would have to call this year's tightening pre-emptive. There is only anecdotal evidence of a pick-up in consumer prices, which grew at an annual rate of 3 per cent in September, little above its cyclical low of 2.7 per cent. Growth in the narrow measure of money supply, one of the more useful forward predictors of inflation during the 1980s, has fallen steadily over the past year, to a mere 1 per cent annual rate. This anaemic narrow money growth has come with stronger expansion of lending and rapid job creation. Clearly, many of the old rules for gauging future inflationary pressures no longer apply. Unfortunately for Mr Greenspan, he has had to improvise, before an unusually attentive - and critical - audience in Washington and the financial markets. Over the past several decades, the real rate on Federal funds has averaged 2 per cent. Yesterday's rise - the largest single increase Mr Greenspan has sanctioned in his career as Federal Reserve chairman - took it significantly above that level, for the first time this cycle. It is unlikely to be the last increase that Mr Greenspan is required to make in the months ahead. With luck, however, his uncharacteristic decisiveness will curb future inflation as well as his market critics.</p>

			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Fierce fighting marks revolt in Mexican state Heavy fighting raged again yesterday between the Mexican military and a group of armed peasants continuing their war against the government after taking over six towns in the southern state of Chiapas on New Year's Day, Reuter reports from San Cristobal de las Casas. A pitched battle was taking place in Ocosingo, 35 miles east of San Cristobal. The military said two soldiers and 27 peasants had died. The official death toll in this increasingly bloody rebellion stood at 86. However, one state official told Reuter that the toll among soldiers alone could be as high as 150. Government soldiers were patrolling San Cristobal, the largest town in the area, taking control of the centre and all roads in after rebels calling themselves the Zapatista National Liberation Army pulled out on Sunday. Military helicopters could be seen shooting at peasants in the mountains surrounding the area. A steady rattle of gunfire came from troops fighting on the ground. Chiapas interior minister, Mr Rafael Gonzalez Lastra, claimed in a television interview that the rebels had pulled out of all but two of the captured towns, but federal officials said that had not been confirmed. The official news agency Notimex reported that a former Chiapas governor, Mr Absalon Castellanos Dominguez, and two family members had been kidnapped from his ranch on Sunday. It also reported an attack on an army base. The armed insurrection helped push Mexico's stockmarket down by 3.9 per cent yesterday. Analysts blamed the sharpness of the fall on events in Chiapas. The stock price of Telmex, the largest private Mexican company, fell by 3 per cent in trading in New York. In Washington it was announced that the US ambassador to Mexico had sent a team to the south to assess the situation and check the safety of US citizens. The peasants, who declared war on the government following their capture of the six cities, including San Cristobal, say indigenous people have been victims of genocide. They are demanding land reforms and a new government. A rebel leader also told reporters they opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement, which took effect on New Year's Day, apparently out of fear that it will harm Chiapas' already poor economy. Chiapas has been the site of numerous conflicts involving indigenous groups and farmers and ranchers in recent years. Estimates of the number of armed peasants range from 600 to 2,000. President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, in his first public comments since the uprising began, told legislators that the violent acts in Chiapas 'delay the real solution to social needs'. But, he added: 'We know that needs and inequalities persist. We know that benefits and opportunities still are not tangible realities for many.'</p>

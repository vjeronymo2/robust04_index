			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> SMC was once predicted to be headed for extinction, but continues to have steady growth in usage despite numerous setbacks. The SMC Automotive Alliance trade group forecasts an 18-percent gain in SMC use in MY 1993, from 147 million pounds to 173 million pounds, on North American-produced vehicles ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ward's Auto World <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , September 1992). New SMC applications continue to grow, including roof, doors, and a rear hatch on GM's Pontiac Firebird and Chevrolet Camaro sports cars, a unique plastic-and-steel-body hybrid. Ford's new Mark VIII hood is made of SMC for MY 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Aluminum use in automobiles grew steadily, representing an estimated average of 178 pounds of the content of United States cars for MY 1993 (Ward's Auto World, September 1992). Most applications are in engine blocks and heads, transmission casings, steering systems, shock absorbers, bumper systems, and other non-structural components. Aluminum is used more not only for body panels but for structural components, as well. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Audi engineers say the body-in-white of the next generation V8 model (codenamed 300), which will feature an all-aluminum body and spaceframe, is half the weight of a conventional steel unit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the first time, an aluminum-head version of GM's 5.7L V&hyph;8 engine is used on vehicles other than the Corvette. The new F-body cars use castings from CMI International, Incorporated in Southfield, Michigan, to help reduce weight. Aluminum heads also are offered for the first time in the Oldsmobile Ciera and Buick Century 2.2L. The aluminum 2.2L I&hyph;4 engine replaces the 2.5L 4-cylinder cast iron engine. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ford is by far the most aggressive United States manufacturer in its plans for aluminum usage, especially in body-panel applications. It uses about 350,000 aluminum hoods per year on large cars such as the Mercury Grand Marquis, Ford Crown Victoria, and Lincoln Town Car. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The cylinder heads for Chrysler's new 24-valve, 3.5L V&hyph;6 engine are also aluminum. These applications are currently being used in LH cars_Dodge Intrepid, Eagle Vision, Chrysler Concorde, New Yorker, and LHS_which use about 200 pounds of aluminum, compared with an industry average of less than 180 pounds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Even as the use of plastics grew, steel continued as the primary material in United States-built family vehicles, comprising well over 50 percent of the weight of the average passenger car according to Ward's 1993 Automotive Yearbook. GM's Cadillac Division has a new steel-intensive Fleetwood, and Fleetwood Broughams use stainless steel on the lower side trim and plated stainless steel trim on all the wheel openings. The Nissan Altima and the Chrysler LH cars, each, use more than 1,500 pounds of steel per car (Ward's Auto World, September 1992). Steel increases to 1,900 pounds per vehicle for the new Mercury Villager and Nissan Quest minivans. Chrysler uses almost as much steel on its new Jeep Grand Cherokee wagon. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applications for P/M grew steadily in recent years, and several new and expanded applications were introduced in MY 1993, including the connecting rods used in GM's 5.7L V&hyph;8 engines. This marks the first time GM used P/M connecting rods in any of its North American powerplants. The new rods add 12 pounds of P/M per engine. The average United States-built car contains about 25 pounds of P/M. Ford currently is the industry leader in P/M applications; it has P/M connecting rods in two of its engines, a V&hyph;8 and the 1.9L 4-cylinder (Ward's Automotive Yearbook, 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Magnesium use increased this model year when Chrysler added magnesium engine-accessory mounting brackets on its Jeep Grand Cherokee and LH cars. Ford, meanwhile, is expanding its use of magnesium steering-column parts, and GM is employing 18 pounds of magnesium components in its Northstar V&hyph;8 engines The average domestic vehicle contains about 6 pounds of magnesium (Ward's Auto World, September 1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> United States manufacturers formed a research partnership, under the United States Council for Automotive Research (USCAR) direction, that will explore the use of new materials. The consortium, called the United States Automobile Materials Partnership (USAMP), will seek to reduce vehicle mass for improved fuel economy, emissions, reliability, safety, crashworthiness, and recyclability by expanding application of new materials. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USAMP states that to improve fuel economy 8&hyph;10 mpg through mass reduction in a 4,000-pound car, weight will have to be cut 1,000 pounds. USAMP targeted aluminum as the primary metal in its program to reduce vehicle mass though ceramics, engineered plastics, magnesium/titanium, and steel are also being studied. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Summary <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Due to the stabilization of oil prices and supply, consumer demand in MY 1993 shifted slightly to more powerful and roomier passenger cars and light trucks. The auto industry, responding to this shift, increased the horsepower of its engines and shifted production mix to moderately larger cars. There were some considerable technical gains, particularly in lightweight material usage, that contributed to improved fuel economy for several models. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;4571 Filed 3&hyph;2&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;59&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

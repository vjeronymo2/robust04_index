			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yiftah Shafir, a nonconventional weapons </F> proliferation expert at Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Center for  Strategic Studies: "A Chinese Slap in the Face of the Clinton  Administration"]    [Text] Ten days ago the PRC conducted a nuclear test at  the Lop Nor testing facility in northwest China. This was the  second test conducted by the PRC in less than a year. The  Chinese test was a slap in the face of President Clinton, who  only recently retracted his resolute demands from the Chinese  leaders with regard to arms exports and human rights.    The slap in the face is particularly stinging at this point  in time when the United States is worried about North Korea  developing a bomb, seeing that without the PRC's agreement and  assistance it will be impossible to enforce any sanctions  against North Korea and that nobody knows how to pressure North  Korea to terminate its nuclear program except through sanctions.    The Chinese test is particularly hurtful because preventing  the proliferation of nuclear weapons is a cornerstone of the  Clinton Administration's foreign policy. An integral part of  this policy is the moratorium on nuclear tests and the efforts  to bring about the signing of an international pact banning such  tests in 1996.    The moratorium began back in November 1992, when the U.S.  Congress forced a nine-month ban on nuclear tests on President  Bush's administration. After those nine months, Congress  permitted only 15 such tests to be conducted until 1996 and  banned nuclear tests altogether afterward. It was President  Bush who signed the ban, known as the "Hatfield Amendment." In  January 1993, the ball was passed to Clinton, who initially  extended it until September 1994.    The moratorium on nuclear testing was accompanied by a  poignant argument between Congress and the U.S. military  establishment. The argument used by advocates of nuclear  testing was the need to maintain the high level of expertise for  laboratory workers and arms developers. As for the tests  themselves, it was decided to conduct three tests to check the  reliability of the weapons and nine tests to increase the safety  of existing weapons. Another proposal was a compromise to  satisfy all sides and limited the tests to "small bombs" not  exceeding one kiloton.    However, the opponents ultimately had the upper hand. They  saw the ban as a trump card in the struggle to prevent the  proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. What the  opponents saw was "deranged" countries, which at present include  Iran and North Korea, with Pakistan, India, and Israel as  potential candidates. Another reason for the ban was the  ratification of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT)  scheduled to expire in 1995, at which point the countries will  meet to discuss its extension and perhaps even to change some of  its clauses. Tests would put the "nuclear" countries in an  awkward position when urging other countries to evince restraint.    However, for the ban to have the desired effect all the  nuclear countries have to maintain a united front. Such a front  existed until the Chinese test last October. With Russia the  problem is negligible: what could not be achieved in the days  of the Soviet Union, can easily be attained from Yeltsin, who  desperately needs all the U.S. support he can get.    With Britain the problem is even easier. Although the  British nuclear establishment wants to go on with the tests and  the Tory government supports it, the British have a "tiny"  technical problem: they test their bombs in Nevada, and without  U.S. permission they can hold no tests. Hence, a problem  remains with the two "enfants terribles": France and China.  France has for some time adopted an independent policy,  inconsiderate of its allies' opinion (not to mention public  opinion).    In spite of all the threats, the Chinese test last October  did not upset the moratorium and Russia and France did not hold  any further tests. However, there is no certainty that what  happened eight months ago will recur today. The global  moratorium remains a house of cards built on the principle of  "not-the-first-to-test." Back when the moratorium was extended,  Clinton ordered the labs "to maintain the ability to resume the  testing." Yeltsin also ordered his labs to prepare two to four  nuclear tests, and in recent months Russia has been leaning  toward an independent policy unconnected to the United States.  In France, Mitterrand will have a harder time resisting the  pressure of the Army and the right-wing government to resume the  tests.    The ball is now in Clinton's court. Adherence to the  moratorium will enable him to come to the NPT deliberations next  year with a clean record. Pressure on Russia may make Yeltsin  rein in his nuclear establishment despite his indebtedness to  the Army and his desperate need to keep employed those nuclear  scientists who have not yet emigrated, and may also help keep  France in line. Permission to resume the tests will undoubtedly  enable the British to test their bombs. France will waste no  time joining the party, and the price will be paid by the whole  world in 1995.</p>

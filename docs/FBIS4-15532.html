			<p>BFN     [Text] Continuing provocations at the Tajik-Afghan border  are aimed at frustrating the inter-Tajik talks being held in  Moscow. The statement was made by the chief of the information  department of the Tajik Foreign Ministry Zafar Saidov at a  briefing in Dushanbe.    He believes that the process of the return of Tajik refugees  to their homeland is becoming steady. However, this does not  suit the interests of the armed Tajik opposition and its  militants are trying to frustrate the process. Saidov said that  the check point of the Russian border guard troops, was shelled  in the morning of April 7, from the vicinity of the port of  Sherkhan (Afghanistan) where about 700 refugees are amassed  waiting to return to their homeland.    Saidov said that the Russian border guards showed restraint  and did not retaliate. This is another manifestation of who  wants to restore peace in Tajikistan and who does not, he added.</p>

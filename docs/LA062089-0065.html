			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THATCHER PARTY ROUTED IN EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT VOTE  </P> <P> Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives were reeling Monday after  British voters, selecting delegates to the European Parliament in Strasbourg,  France, gave the party its lowest share of a national ballot this century.  </P> <P> As the final returns were announced, Thatcher aides tried to dismiss the  convincing victory by the rival Labor Party as a routine protest vote midway  through the prime minister's third successive term of office.  </P> <P> Independent analysts acknowledged that the practical effect of the Tory defeat  may be minimal because of the Strasbourg body's limited powers. But they said  the psychological impact could be crucial, strongly confirming a buildup of  Labor momentum first suggested in public opinion polls earlier this year.  </P> <P> Thatcher avoided the press during a normal working day Monday, but she termed  the election results "disappointing" in a handwritten note to the Conservative  Party chairman, Peter Brooke. Brooke conceded that he "may well have made  mistakes" during a heavily criticized election campaign and offered to resign.  </P> <P> An ebullient Neil Kinnock, head of the Laborites, burst into song in his native  Welsh language at an early morning champagne victory celebration. Labor had  promoted the European elections as a referendum on Thatcher's policies.  </P> <P> Later, Kinnock dismissed the possibility that the prime minister can still turn  the tide with a widely anticipated reshuffling of her Cabinet.  </P> <P> "They haven't got many aces to put in place of the jokers," Kinnock said.  Referring to Thatcher, he added: "The one card in the pack that won't be  reshuffled is the queen. And it is the queen that is their most basic  weakness."  </P> <P> Kinnock charged Thatcher's government with "arrogance" and "superficiality" and  said of the prime minister's anti-socialist legislative program: "She has gone  much too far."  </P> <P> If the vote for delegates to the European Parliament were repeated in a British  general election, according to an analysis by British Broadcasting Corp.  television, Labor would emerge with a 26-seat parliamentary majority. That  compares with a 100-seat majority that the Conservatives currently hold in the  650-seat House of Commons.  </P> <P> Britons went to the polls to elect their representatives in the European  Parliament last Thursday. But the last returns were not announced until late  Monday.  </P> <P> The final count showed that Labor won more than 40% of the vote, up nearly 4%  from its showing in the last European elections in 1984. Thatcher's  Conservatives, meanwhile, got slightly more than 34% of the votes cast, down  sharply from almost 41% five years ago.  </P> <P> The results mean that Labor will send 45 of Britain's 81 representatives to  Strasbourg, compared to the Conservatives' 32. In 1984, the figures were just  the reverse.  </P> <P> The remaining four British seats went to small nationalist parties in Scotland  and Northern Ireland. In all, there are 518 members of the Strasbourg assembly  elected from 12 West European nations.  </P> <P> Because of its limited powers, the European Parliament has been described by  some as a toothless forum for inflated oratory or, at best, the conscience of  the Continent. However, it is playing an increasingly visible role as Europe  tries to tear down barriers to free movement of goods and people by 1992.  </P> <P> Thatcher has been an outspoken critic of those who want to see the European  Community evolve into a political entity more akin to a "United States of  Europe." She fears that leftists in the European Parliament might push through  legislation that could undermine the anti-socialist political revolution she  has engineered in Britain since first taking office in 1979.  </P> <P> At the least, Labor activists hope to use their newly won clout in Strasbourg  to put political pressure on Thatcher. One newly elected delegate gleefully  predicted that he and his Labor colleagues at the European Parliament will make  Thatcher "tear her hair out" in frustration.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Deeply Disappointed'  </P> <P> The government's secretary of state for Scotland, Malcolm Rifkind, conceded in  a television interview here that he was "deeply disappointed" after Scottish  Conservatives lost the two Strasbourg seats they previously held. However,  Rifkind stressed that the party has come back from mid-term defeats in the past  to win "thumping" victories in general elections -- "and I have no doubt the  same will happen this time."  </P> <P> The government is not required to call a new general election until 1992,  giving it as much as three years to turn the political situation around.  Another ameliorating factor in the Strasbourg results was the unusually low  voter turnout, 36%.  </P> <P> Still, Rifkind's Cabinet colleague, Energy Secretary Cecil Parkinson, took a  more cautious line.  </P> <P> "We've not done well," he said. "This is a warning to the government. . . . We  have got to get inflation under control. We have got to stick together. We have  got to make sure the electorate understands the consequences of electing a  Labor government."  </P> <P> What has been termed the Thatcher "economic miracle" has appeared to be  unraveling of late, with inflation climbing to an 8.3% annual rate, the highest  for any European Community nation. Also, labor strife seems to be on the rise,  symbolized by the transportation unions that have been disrupting London train,  bus and subway traffic with a series of 24-hour strikes throughout the spring.  </P> <P> Former Conservative Prime Minister Edward Heath, a vocal and longstanding  Thatcher critic, blamed the loss on "scare-mongering" by the prime minister.  Her warnings against allowing the European Community new powers that could  override national interests backfired, he said.  </P> <P> "The prime minister has always underestimated the importance of the European  Parliament," Heath added. "She treats it with contempt."  </P> <P> The political left also made gains elsewhere in balloting for the Strasbourg  assembly, apparently winning a wafer-thin parliamentary majority. Socialists  picked up 15 seats in the European Parliament while the center-right parties,  which had dominated, lost 33 seats.  </P> <P> The one exception to the Parliament's leftward drift occurred in West Germany,  where the far-right Republican Party, enlisting strong support in the  conservative southern state of Bavaria, was projected to win six seats.  </P> <P> The biggest winners, however, were the environmentalist Greens and their  allies, which nearly doubled their Strasbourg representation to 39 seats from  20 in 1984.  </P> <P> The Greens made an exceptionally strong showing in Britain as well, gaining 15%  of the popular vote. However, they could not muster a plurality in any  electoral district, and because of this country's winner-take-all system,  Britain's Greens will not be represented in the new European Parliament.  </P></p>

			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US and Russia allay uranium glut worries FEARS THAT a vast additional supply of uranium would be released from military stockpiles following the sudden ending the cold war and collapse of the former Soviet Union have been allayed by the US and Russian governments. They have initialled an agreement for the conversion of highly-enriched uranium (HEU) from dismantled Soviet nuclear weapons to low-enriched uranium (LEU) for use as commercial nuclear fuel. The agreement specifically mentions that this 'will have no adverse impact on US consumers or the mining and processing industries'. The deal will be greeted with relief by western uranium producers, who are suffering severely from weak demand and prices depressed by imports from Russia. The US and Russia have given themselves 12 months to complete an implementing contract which will provide for, among other things, the conversion of at least 10 tonnes of HEU a year in the first five years and no less than 30 tonnes a year subsequently. The HEU will be bought by the US Department of Energy for conversion in the US and sale for commercial purposes. Uranium has only one application - for nuclear energy. Demand depends entirely on nuclear generating capacity in the 25 countries using that form of power. The US Department will also buy for resale any LEU produced from HEU converted in Russia. Observers suggested that the deal might escape attack by environmentalists because of its 'swords into plough shares' flavour. But the method by which the HEU will be transported to the US might be a sticking point, they said. It is understood that the US Energy Department would substitute the Russian material for higher-cost uranium produced for it in the US. This would lower the department's cost of production. Mr David Kay, director-general of the Uranium Institute in London, pointed out yesterday that the US-Russian agreement 'ensures that not all the HEU will be entering the market at once but it will be released over many years. This arrangement seems guaranteed to have a zero impact on the market by ensuring there is no vast new capacity'. He said early estimates that dismantling nuclear weapons would provide about 100,000 tonnes of uranium - or about two and a half times last year's western world sales of 38,000 tonnes - were proving wide of the mark. It was now suggested that the US and Russia would each release about 500 tonnes in this way. Funds generated by the US-Russian deal will be used by the Russians partly to upgrade the safety of their nuclear reactors and partly to build facilities in Russia to convert HEU to LEU. Spot prices of uranium oxide are now well below the production costs of most mines at USDollars 7.75 a lb. Prices peaked at Dollars 45 a lb in 1978. The market changed dramatically in the 1980s when brokers and other intermediaries began to act for their own accounts. By selling material from the huge stocks available in the west and latterly from Russia they have become important alternative suppliers.</p>

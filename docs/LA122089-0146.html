			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> SENATOR APOLOGIZES FOR DEALINGS  </P> <P> Sen. David Durenberger (R-Minn.) apologized to the people of Minnesota today  for a book publishing deal and outside speaking engagements that have come  under scrutiny by the Senate Ethics Committee.  </P> <P> "I did that which was legal. But if I give it a smell test, or the light of day  . . . its linkage with honorarium made it look inappropriate," Durenberger said  at a news conference. "This suggests to people some kind of inappropriate  conduct."  </P> <P> Durenberger, who does not face reelection until 1994, said he will not resign  and expects to be vindicated by the ethics panel. He also said he will pay back  any money beyond that deemed allowable, although he expects the ethics panel  will not find that any money should be returned.  </P> <P> Durenberger said he was putting four sons through college and was going through  a divorce during the time of the possible infractions.  </P></p>

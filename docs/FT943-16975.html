			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Hosanna in oasis: Bruce Clark follows the trail of western diplomats to an Orthodox Christian enclave in Turkey An unusual number of black limousines with diplomatic plates have been spotted recently in the winding alleyways of Fener, a rundown stretch of waterfront on the Golden Horn of Istanbul. Travelling in these august vehicles have been foreign ministers, or top diplomats, from France, Italy, the US and Greece; and the man they visited is Patriarch Bartholomew I, senior spiritual figure among the world's 160m Orthodox Christians. For a churchman who keeps a low profile, at least in his native Turkey, the 270th Patriarch of Constantinople is receiving an impressive flow of callers. At the same time, the 53-year-old prelate - a shrewd, genial and erudite figure who speaks six languages - is getting some less desirable sorts of attention. The windows of his residence, a wooden mansion where the scent of floor-polish and fresh flowers mingles with more pungent odours from the street, are continually broken by stones, apparently cast by local hotheads. Attacks on him in the Turkish press have increased since the March elections, when an Islamic-leaning party captured the municipality of Istanbul. In May, three small bombs were discovered on his doorstep. There is a growing threat to the delicate compromise that allows the Patriarchate, a 1,600-year-old legacy of Byzantium, to remain on the soil of mainly Moslem Turkey. That in turn explains why he is getting so many high-level visitors: for the importance of the Patriarch, and his right to remain in Istanbul, is increasingly clear to the governments of the world. With the parting of the Iron Curtain, a much older division - between eastern and western Christendom - has recovered its relevance in the affairs of Europe. The ancient rift between Orthodox Christians (who include most Serbs, Russians, Greeks, Romanians and Bulgarians) and Roman Catholics (who include most Croats, Slovenes and Slovaks) is now an issue in modern geopolitics. It is stoking passion in former Yugoslavia and threatening to divide western and eastern Ukrainians. So for diplomats as well as theologians, it matters more and more what the Patriarch says; and also where he resides. His existence as a tiny island of Christianity in a Moslem Turkish sea is precarious; and for that reason, he has a vested interest in advocating ethnic and religious tolerance. Interviewed in his dignified but far from luxurious quarters, he presented the Orthodox view in much more conciliatory language than is generally heard in countries where his flock are the majority. On the future of Turkey, a country of which he is legally obliged to be a loyal citizen, he is a strong advocate of the liberal, pro-western ideals of Kemal Ataturk, the state's founder. 'There are obstacles to Turkey's full entry into Europe, but they should be overcome. Turkey should become a full member of the European family, where she has so much to offer.' He welcomes the fact that some fundamentalists have been purged from Turkey's army and education system; but he is alarmed by the sight of women wearing Islamic dress, and by calls for Islamic law. 'The fundamentalists have become better organised, more emboldened . . . It will be harder now for anyone to rein them in.' Yet the Patriarch - in contrast with the frank intolerance of many churchmen in Greece and Russia - is an advocate of dialogue with the 'great monotheistic traditions' of Islam and Judaism as well as with the other branches of Christianity. Patriarch Bartholomew is unequivocal in denouncing the anti-Jewish prejudice which informs the public comments of some hardline Russian bishops. 'It is to be condemned, because it runs counter to religious freedom.' He acknowledges that links between the Orthodox world and the Vatican have deteriorated, because of jostling for souls in Romania and Ukraine. For three years, the Orthodox side has suspended talks about theological matters until quarrels over believers and buildings can be settled. Yet he continues to make conciliatory gestures, even at the risk of appearing 'soft on Rome' to his flock. This week he sent an envoy to the Vatican who was warmly greeted by the Pope. As for the Anglican churches, he predicts, with a certain mischievous relish, that they will soon accept the Eastern view on the key theological dispute, concerning the significance of the Holy Spirit, which divided East and West in 1054. 'We say that the truths of the undivided Church are as follows: alpha, beta, gamma, delta . . . You have added certain things - where do you get them from?' But as he speaks, his measured Greek phrases are almost drowned out by another sound, carried across the sweltering air: a muezzin is calling the Moslem faithful to prayer.</p>

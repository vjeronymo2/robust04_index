			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "E.W.": "Trilateral Commission Debates Energy </F> Industry and Budget Sector--A Meeting Without Decisions"]    [Text] After more than five hours of debate,  representatives of trade unions, employers, and the government  failed to come to common decisions regarding prices of energy  carriers and the level of salaries in the budget sector. The  commission will return to the problem of the budget sector  before the end of the week, while specific decisions regarding  prices of energy carriers are to be made on 6 June, which is  when the Main Statistical Office, the Central Planning  Administration, and trade unions will present materials  regarding the proportion of Polish families' budgets spent on  energy expenditures.    An increase in prices of energy carriers is a life-or-death  issue for the energy industry, Deputy Finance Minister Waldemar  Manugiewicz stated after the debate was over. He reported that,  in line with government plans, the level of economically  justified prices shall be reached in the energy industry in the  year 2000. Before that date, however, investments necessary for  modernizing the branch will total approximately 3,000,000  billion zlotys [Z]. The trade unionists reminded participants  in the meeting that over 40 percent of Polish families spend  between 12 and 18 percent of their incomes on energy, while, in  families whose incomes do not exceed Z1.2 million [per month],  the amount reaches 20 percent. Solidarity is of the view that  official regulation of energy prices has an inflationary effect:  Enterprises are aware of planned increases in advance, and they  decide to increase prices on their products beforehand. The  trade union suggested that energy prices be frozen for a year  against inflation.    The government's proposal of a law regarding the regulation  of salaries in the budget sector raised reservations of the  trade unions and employers. According to the document, the  Council of Ministers is supposed to present to the Trilateral  Commission proposals for percentage-based remunerations in the  budget sector for a following year,. The commission would then  have a month in which to arrive at a joint position. If no  agreement were to be reached within 30 days, the government  would take into account the amounts in line with its proposals  in the budget for the following year. The government also  presented a proposal for regulating the powers of the Trilateral  Commission. As A. Baczkowski informed, the principle of  consensus is supposed to be the main principle of decisions. If  the parties do not reach an agreement, the position worked out  by them would only be of an opinion value for the Council of  Ministers and the parliament; it would not influence the shape  of the final decisions, Baczkowski explained. We do not agree  with the proposition because we think the government may come up  with a low level of salaries, Solidarity argued. The All-Poland  Trade Unions Agreement [OPZZ] also opposed the proposal by  saying that the issue of salaries in the budget sector cannot be  a reason for problems that occur every year. According to the  OPZZ, the only acceptable solution would be to design minimum  financial guarantees for the budget sector.</p>

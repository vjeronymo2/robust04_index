			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Books: Biographia Trollopiana - The latest life of a Victorian writer TROLLOPE by Victoria Glendinning Hutchinson Pounds 20, 551 pages IN AN ideal world there would be some sort of central mart of exchange to which biographers could apply for information about who else was working on the same subject. This would be particularly helpful when the relevant sources were in the public domain. Official biographers who are given first and exclusive access to a person's papers are in a different situation. Their work cannot be pre-empted. They may or may not produce books worth reading, but at least there is no danger of being forestalled. When Lord Beaverbrook invited me in 1950 to write the life of Bonar Law, whose papers he owned, I felt safe on that score - if not on others. I was in a more perilous situation in 1958 when I decided, unprompted, to embark on a biography of Disraeli, whose official life had been completed in 1920 and whose papers had been open to inspection for many years, though in physically daunting conditions. I saw no way of ascertaining what might be in the pipeline and resolved to take a risk, but I was momentarily dismayed when a US professor published a book on Disraeli's youth which anticipated a discovery I thought I had made about Disraeli's early sexual imbroglios. Luckily for me the book was by a toiler in what Paul Johnson has described as the 'Eng. Lit. Crit. Industry', and therefore unreadable. These personal reflections are prompted by the remarkable outburst of Biographia Trollopiana which has occurred in the last four years. When Victoria Glendinning began her research in 1988 she had no idea that three other authors - all of them American, as it happens - were busy in the same field and had been for several years. The last serious life of Trollope, by James Pope-Hennessy, had appeared in 1971. There is no obvious reason for the revival of interest, no centenary or other significant date, yet the appearance of four biographies, of which this is the latest, coincides with the foundation of the Trollope Society of London and New York which is publishing a uniform edition of the novels. It also coincides with the placing of a memorial in Poets Corner in Westminster Abbey and with a Prime Minister who is a Trollope fan (not the first to be) and who took for holiday reading, no doubt as a relaxation from perusal of the Treaty of Maastricht, The Small House at Allington, which Victoria Glendinning, if she had to make a choice, would place among the seven best of all the novels. I have read only one of the three earlier biographies, Richard Mullen's Anthony Trollope, A Victorian In His World (Duckworth 1990). Reviewing it for the Financial Times I described it as 'a great literary biography, one of the best to appear in recent times. It is unlikely ever to be superseded'. I would stand by that verdict. Victoria Glendinning has not superseded Mullen, nor has she made any such claim. What she has done is to write a perceptive and sensitive study of Trollope's life and writings from a slightly different angle. Mullen saw the key to Trollope in his desire to be respected not only as a novelist but as a serious writer who wanted to influence public life. Hence the importance of his non-fiction works and, apart from those, his important role as a Post Office official - inventor of the pillar box - and his unhappy foray into politics when he stood in 1868 as an unsuccessful Liberal candidate for the infinitely corrupt seat of Beverley. Mullen saw Trollope's travel books and articles on British and US politics as 'the best portrayal of his personality . . . I see his non-fiction as the key to his fiction.' There is a great deal in this interpretation and Richard Mullen's use of the travel books and his full analysis of the affairs of the Victorian Post Office are very illuminating. Victoria Glendinning's emphasis is rather different. She sees him as a man with an outer and an inner life. Behind the bluff, noisy, seemingly extrovert clubman, raconteur and shrewd man of business, there was a highly emotional person who understood affairs of the heart, the ways of men and women, the balance of power between the sexes in and out of marriage, with an acumen unrivalled among the Victorian novelists. She does not underplay his public life but emphasises that it was balanced by another aspect, and she makes full use of his novels and autobiography to explain it. The publishers make something of the first biography of Trollope by a woman and Glendinning seems to believe that his wife Rose has been neglected by previous writers. These matters of 'gender' can be overdone. In fact there is just as much, if not more, about Rose in Richard Mullen's book. Trollopians should have both these biographies on their bookshelves, but if they have space or money for only one I would, at the risk of the charge of male chauvinism, advise Mullen's. His book is longer by 200 pages, more scholarly in terms of notes and index, and equally well written. The major sources in both books are the same and inevitably there is a great deal of overlap. It was brave of Victoria Glendinning to go ahead in the knowledge of these forthcoming works but Trollope admirers will be glad that she did. Whether the market can sustain four biographies of the same person in four years is another matter. That is something for authors and publishers - especially the latter - to consider, not for reviewers. The Collected Shorter Fiction of Anthony Trollope, containing 42 short stories, edited by Julian Thompson, will be published next month by Robinson Publishing (Pounds 25, 959 pages)</p>

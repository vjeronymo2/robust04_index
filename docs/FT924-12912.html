			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: RHM/Hanson It is peculiar that RHM managed a gain of only 2 per cent yesterday after announcing a demerger designed to unlock shareholder value from its brands. If there were that much value to be unlocked, then presumably the shares would have risen much more. The company's supporters may argue that the small rise reflected profit-taking by speculators who are not prepared to hold on for a long ride. Maybe there is also now less risk of the shares falling back towards last month's low of 135p if Hanson walks away. But the decision to unbundle is a tacit admission that there is little prospect of a rival bid for the group as a whole. It does not put Hanson under any particular pressure. RHM was always going to have to make some effort to persuade Hanson to increase its 220p offer. Demergers can sometimes tip the balance against a bid - as was the case with last year's Williams' bid for Racal - but it is unlikely to do so in this case. The theory is that existing shareholders rather than Hanson would benefit from the valuation premium on change of control. But the demerger plan is still only in outline form. Who knows what the individual companies will be worth once it is complete? One cannot judge all brands by the 25 times multiple Philip Morris is paying for Freia Marabou or the 23 times Campbells Soup is offering for Arnotts of Australia. RHM does own a few strong names such as Sharwood's, but most are national brands. Many have seen better days. It is hard to imagine Bisto or Atora suet taking the European single market by storm. Unless buyers are found for the demerged units, the brands will be managed by the same people who have been in charge so far. Hanson may well have to increase its offer but not by much before it will pay shareholders to take the cash and run.</p>

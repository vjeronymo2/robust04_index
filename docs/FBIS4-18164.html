			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Thomas Michelsen: "Surplus Threatens To Grow"] </F>   [Excerpt ] The grain surplus could increase by 50 percent  when Sweden becomes a member of the EU [European Union]. The  surplus is expected to grow from today's 1 million tonnes a year  to 1.5 million tonnes.    When we join the EU, farmers will again be able to cultivate  areas of land that are currently undergoing so-called  conversion. These are fields for which farmers have received  compensation from the state to remove from production. But once  inside the EU these fields could again be used for grain  production under EU rules. The surplus could be sold to other  countries using the EU's export subsides.    However, the EU will also demand that a certain percentage  of  farm land be allowed to lie fallow. Nevertheless the net  increase in land used for growing grain could be 130,000  hectares, with the increased harvest around 500,000 tonnes.    This emerged at a farmers' day hosted by Agriculture  Minister  Karl Erik Olsson in Katrineholm yesterday.    Olsson's message to the farmers present was twofold: On the  one hand the Swedish conversion system was useful and would  continue to be needed in the future. It was a good thing that  fields have been taken out of food production. On the other  hand farmers should be actively involved and compete within the  EU -- that is, increase their production once again. The  agriculture minister also expressed the hope that the increased  grain harvest can be used to feed even more hogs and chickens.  Here too production could be increased.    The agriculture minister is very satisfied with the results  of the negotiations in Brussels. However, the Skane farmers  complained that they did not get the increased sugar quota they  had wanted.    "But once they have received payment for their beets they  will be happy," Olsson said, as the price of sugar will rise  dramatically when we join the EU.    "I am sufficiently satisfied with the negotiations to  recommend membership in the EU," the agriculture minister said.  "And there are 10 million farmers in the EU. There is  therefore no need to fear any shortsighted or abrupt changes in  the EU's agricultural policy."    Olsson praised the results of the negotiations and said that  they are economically advantageous for Swedish agriculture: We  have not sought membership in the EU to become poor, but to do  well economically.    He also defended the favorable economic package against the  Social Democratic criticism of the past few days.    "It is unfair, as Goran Persson has proposed, to target  punitive measures on Swedish agriculture. The results of the  negotiations are not that good. It is only fair that Swedish  farmers should be allowed to produce on the same terms as the  EU's farmers," Olsson said. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIR TRAFFIC PLAN CALLED ALREADY DATED  </P> <P> The use of computer systems based on older technology could make a planned  Southern California aircraft tracking facility obsolete even before it opens,  the General Accounting Office said in a report issued this week.  </P> <P> As a result, air traffic controllers may find their radar screens flickering,  showing insufficient data or blanking out at critical moments, the report said.  </P> <P> The report, prepared for congressional subcommittees reviewing the Federal  Aviation Administration's appropriations requests, criticizes the agency for  not heeding a similar GAO report last year that singled out the Los  Angeles-Orange County air space as having the worst computer-related aircraft  tracking problems.  </P> <P> The latest report also echoes last year's National Transportation Safety Board  study showing that the Los Angeles-Orange County area leads the nation in near  mid-air collision reports and is dependent in part on an outdated, inadequate  FAA radar facility at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station known as Coast  Terminal Radar Approach Control.  </P> <P> FAA officials said Tuesday that they are still analyzing the GAO report and had  no formal reply.  </P> <P> At an estimated cost of $114 million, the FAA plans to consolidate radar  tracking facilities at Los Angeles, Burbank, El Toro and Ontario by moving  operations to Miramar, near San Diego, by 1995.  </P> <P> The GAO report, entitled "Air Traffic Control -- Inadequate Planning Increases  Risk of Computer Failures in Los Angeles," said that FAA officials have refused  to consider computer solutions that would solve the computer capacity problem  because the agency does not want to rewrite or develop software to run on new,  state-of-the-art hardware and expend the "additional time they believe would be  required to undertake such an effort."  </P> <P> The study accused the FAA of refusing to use proper growth rates for projecting  future air traffic.  </P></p>

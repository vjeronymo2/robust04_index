			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Barratt more than doubled to Pounds 11.3m - Marketing campaign planned for this summer will involve four show villages The housing market recovery in the UK is gathering pace, with sales and prices expected to rise further in 1994 according to Sir Lawrie Barratt, chairman of Barratt Developments which more than doubled pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.8m to Pounds 11.3m in the six months to end-December. Earnings per share increased from 2p to 4.4p, enabling Barratt to increase its interim dividend to 2p (1p). Turnover rose by 25 per cent to Pounds 218.2m (Pounds 174m). Sir Lawrie also announced the group's biggest marketing campaign, which will take place this summer and include the construction of four separate show villages to take advantage of the recovery and launch the company's new range of designs. The Barratt chairman came out of retirement three years ago after the group began to incur heavy losses. He said yesterday that the group was on course to achieve its target of increasing production from 5,000 to 8,000 homes a year by June 1996. Sir Lawrie will become non-executive chairman from the beginning of August. Mr Frank Eaton, chief executive, said the company was in good shape to finance its expansion with net debt of only Pounds 53.4m, including off-balance sheet loans, representing gearing of 27 per cent. He expected sales by UK housebuilders to rise by about 10 per cent in 1994 with UK house prices rising by 7 per cent and up to 10 per cent in south-east England. The group completed 2,302 UK sales in the half year, 14 per cent more than in the corresponding period. Operating margins rose from 6.3 per cent to 8.6 per cent. The group said it had continued to buy land at prices which would provide satisfactory margins, acquiring 4,593 plots at an average price of Pounds 14,457 during the first half, equivalent to 19.9 per cent of the present average selling price of Pounds 72,500. Total UK land holdings had risen by 11 per cent since last June to 15,079 plots representing 2 1/2 years supply at current production rates. The southern Californian housing market was expected to remain much more difficult although US losses had fallen by 50 per cent to Dollars 700,000 (Pounds 480,000). There was also a Pounds 300,000 loss on leisure and time-share activities. This was more than offset by profits from commercial property sales and the group's Scottish contracting operations. COMMENT Frank Eaton deserves much of the credit for the turnround at Barratt. Good housekeeping in terms of reduced costs, shrewd land purchasing and Sir Lawrie's marketing skills has provided UK operating margins of about 11 per cent currently. This should rise further next year, putting the group at the top end of the range for a large national volume builder. On pre-tax profits of Pounds 33m this year the group is on a prospective p/e of 20, falling to 14 times earnings of Pounds 50m in 1994-95. On this basis much of the stock's virtue is already in the price but still worth a buy if only because Barratt historically has performed well during an upturn.</p>

			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Chile slow to get chilly: FT Ski Expedition Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a round-the-world expedition. This week they arrived in Chile. Arriving in Chile, winter seemed far away. It was if Portillo, one of the highest and most famous ski resorts in South America, was reluctant to be stirred from hibernation. Just 48 hours earlier we had been baking in the heat of the Mojave desert in California - and the temperatures in the Andes would not have been out of place in the Californian summer. Recently, in the northern hemisphere, we have seen many ski resorts 'put to bed' for the summer, but this is the first time we have seen one being woken up for the winter. In spite of being surrounded by peaks of 19,000ft and more, Portillo, close to Argentina, was still in its summer slumber. Lucy and I, on the other hand, although anxious to ski, were keen to hang on to what was left of our brief summer. We were rewarded with a blue-sky day and a powerful sun which glittered on the icy and almost bottomless waters of the Laguna del Inca just outside our chalet. David Purcell and his brother Henry, both originally from New York, had been praying for a heavy snowfall so that they could open Portillo on time. And the following day, a leaden sky might have given them cause to cheer. But David Purcell did not like what he saw. 'High overcast,' he said. 'That's exactly what we don't want. We need either snow or clear blue skies so it gets cold enough to make snow. When it's like this it doesn't snow and we can't make snow either. Some resorts would open with the snow we already have, but we'd rather wait.' Open or not, Henry, who has been in charge at Portillo since 1968, was kind enough to run one of the chairlifts just for Lucy and me so that we could ski our compulsory daily run. He and his daughter Elisa even kept us company, while his black labrador Sally romped down the slope with us. Then the prayed-for snow started falling with a vengeance, completely contradicting the weather forecast. Tentatively, the Purcells opened a single Poma lift. After stagnating with minimal skiing for 8 1/2 days, Lucy and I were even more boisterous than Sally. We skied relentlessly through falling snow until the lift closed. I expected to feel dismay at being plunged back into winter again so soon, but the familiar feeling of warm blood tingling in my veins on a cold day, and the sharp intake of mountain air, came as a pleasantly invigorating surprise. Now we are looking forward to trying the rest of Portillo's lifts, including the unique Va et Vient lifts, Rocas Jack and Condor, specially designed for inaccessible, avalanche-prone terrain, and skiing some of Chile's steepest slopes - with the possible exception of the Kilometro Lanzado, on which French Olympic champion Michael Prufer skied at 135.264mph. This is a wild, windswept place. And much as we miss the Californian summer, we are glad to be here.</p>

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo With the election of Mr Tsutomu Hata as prime minister scheduled for today, the political situation has stabilised. The government bond market is in for a quiet week ahead of the 'Golden Week' holiday which starts Friday. Investors are expecting a slew of economic data, but business year-end distortions are likely to complicate interpretation of the figures. Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo points out that 'the need to publish so many figures ahead of the holidays may lead to information-overload'. Leading indicators of business sentiment for February will be announced on Tuesday, with March industrial production data and large-store retail sales released on Wednesday. On Thursday, there will be the March consumer prices index, labour statistics, housing starts, and construction orders. Although bond prices may see volatility amid low volumes, the disruption is expected to be limited, due to support from domestic institutional investors, who this month announced plans to allocate funds to the domestic bond market. The industrial production data are among those likely to be affected by year-end factors. Corporations are likely to have pushed up output to boost the figures, and lowered prices to raise shipments.</p>

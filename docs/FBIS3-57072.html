			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Jan 20, BNS -- Lithuania's Future Forum  will soon register its faction in the Lithuanian parliament, MP  [member of parliament] Aleksandras Bendinskas told reporters  Thursday [20 January].    Bendinskas, who is a member of the forum, said the matter  will be decided by all representatives of the organization in  parliament. The forum participated in parliamentary elections on  the list of Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDLP]. In  Bendinskas' words, the forum currently holds 22 seats.    A possibility to form a new faction appeared when the  parliament amended its statute and allowed to create faction  regardless of affiliation in pre-election lists.    Up until now, the ruling LDLP faction had 71 seats and  enjoyed an absolute majority. If it loses 22 members, as well  several others who intend to leave it during faction  reregistration, the ruling faction will become almost equal to  the rightist opposition coalition in size. There is a  possibility, however, that the ruling majority will remain as  unified as earlier when dealing with key issues.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "'Udayy Dismisses Five Journalists"] </F>   [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- 'Udayy Saddam Husayn,  son of the Iraqi president, has prevented five Iraqi journalists  from exercising their profession and decided to dismiss them  from the the Journalists Association he heads. Among these  journalists are Lutfi al-Khayyat and Ahmad Sabri, both members  of the association's council. The decision came the day after  the announcement in the Iraqi press that 'Udayy had been chosen  as chairman of the Youth Union. This is his latest post, as he  also heads the Students Union, the Journalists Association, the  Olympic Committee, the Football Association, and the cultural  grouping supervising the Writers Union and the Artists Union.  He also heads the Saddam Engineering College and supervises  Baghdad University, al-Mustansiriyah University, the Saddam  Medical College, and the Scientific Research Center. He is also  chairman of the meat company in al-Dawrah and the meat company  in al-Mahmudiyah. In addition to the declared 13 posts he also  assumes undeclared political and security tasks.</p>

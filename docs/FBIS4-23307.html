			<p>BFN     [Text] Two hundred and sixty-five of the approved 273  delegates to the Constitutional Conference have been cleared to  represent their various districts at the conference which takes  off late this month. Announcing the full results of last  Saturday's [28 May] conference district election to choose  delegates to the conference, the chairman of the committee, Mr.  Bernard Mba, disclosed that elections did not hold in five  constituencies in Ogun State and one each in Ondo, Kaduna, and  Rivers States. He commended the conduct of the election, noting  that the ward elections were devoid of hooliganism, (?thuggery),  violence, and molestation, noting that there was also no room  for money politics or sale of votes during the elections.    Among the notable politicians who were elected to the  conference were Retired Major General Shehu Musa Yar'Adua,  Alhaji Abubakar Atiku, Dr. Alex Ekwueme, Chief Emeka Ojukwu, and  Chief Stephen Lawani, the former deputy chairman of the defunct  NRC [National Republican Convention. Others are Mr. Emmanuel  Nsan, a former health minister, Professor Eric Ofia, Chief  Edmond Udekwu, and retired Air Commodore Jonah David Jang, a  former military governor of the former Gongola State.    Meanwhile, by-elections are to be conducted in some parts of  the states where such elections were not held. By-elections  will be held in Kaduna State on the 11th of this month, for  Sabon Gari and Makassi Districts. Similarly, fresh elections at  both ward and conference district [levels] will be held between  11 and 13 June in Ogun and Ondo States.</p>

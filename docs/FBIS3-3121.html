The meeting passed a draft resolution on the government work  report made by Premier Li Peng to the legislature. The  resolution will be sent to NPC deputies for examination before  being submitted to the NPC general session for a vote.    The Presidium meeting also heard and passed examination  reports made by Liu Suinian, chairman of the NPC Financial and  Economic Committee, on: implementation of the 1993 plan for  national economic and social development, a draft 1994 plan for  national economic and social development, implementation of the  state budget for 1993 and a draft state budget for 1994.    The NPC Financial and Economic Committee, Liu said, believed  that the guiding idea, principle and key points of the 1994  national economic and social development plan are correct and  that measures put forth therein are feasible. In the process of  carrying out the national plan, he said, any partial adjustment  of the plan has to be reported to the NPC Standing Committee for  examination and approval.    On this year's budget plan, the committee maintains that its  guiding principles for budgetary arrangements are correct, Liu  said.    The principles, he said, provide for expenditures on key  projects and undertakings that will promote national economic  and social development. At the same time, the budget provides a  necessary financial guarantee for the smooth progress of major  reform measures and strengthened macroeconomic controls, he said.    The meeting also passed a draft list of candidates for by-  election of members to the NPC Standing Committee to be handed  over to the deputies for examination.</p>

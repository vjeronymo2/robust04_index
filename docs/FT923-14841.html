			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Unions urged to recruit harder UNIONS are in danger of losing any influence in industry or society because of their dwindling membership, Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the AEEU engineering and electrical union, warns his members today. Unless unions start recruiting hard, Mr Laird writes in the union's journal, 'the current merger-mania will amount to little more than rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic'. The AEEU itself - recently formed through a merger between the AEU engineering union and the EETPU electricians' union - has seen engineering membership drop by 11 per cent over the past year. Mr Laird says unions have lost a total of 3.5m members since 1979 and there are now just under 10m union members, representing 38 per cent of the directly employed workforce. 'Unions in Britain are less effective than even our dwindling numbers would suggest,' he adds. 'Our 10m members are split into 20 large unions, dozens of smaller unions and hundreds of staff associations.' Arguing for further mergers, Mr Laird points to the problems faced by manufacturing employers who still 'have to deal with three or four manual unions and two or more staff unions'. Although union membership in Germany is lower than in Britain, effectiveness is increased by single unions in each sector, he adds. 'Here in Britain we are still trying to compete against Germany with a Victorian trade union set-up. Mergers have taken place in a random and unco-ordinated way,' he writes. In a barely disguised swipe at some of the poaching activities of his own electricians' section, Mr Laird says the union should not be 'interested in petty squabbles with the general unions about a few thousand members here or there on the periphery of industry', but should be 'reaching out and recruiting the unorganised'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sixth installment of the "basic contents" of the Hanoi </F> 20-25 January Midterm National Party Conference Resolution]    [Text] It is necessary to establish the all people's funds  to repay those who have served the nation with merit.    We must formulate policy to regulate the wealthy, motivate  mass organizations and individuals to voluntarily participate in  various humanitarian and charitable activities.    Efforts must be made to enhance the citizens' duties,  strengthen the community's responsibility to society, and  develop our nation's tradition of benevolence.    -- What are the key measures formulated to effectively  fight corruption?    The key measures include efforts to:    -- review, amend, or supplement mechanism, policies, laws,  and procedures governing the activities of state agencies and  government employees while trying to overcome loopholes in the  management system;    -- renovate and consolidate financial management and  bookkeeping;    -- streamline the mechanism, cut unnecessary expenditure,  and guarantee sufficient salaries for wage-earners;    -- consolidate education and training for cadres and party  members to heighten their revolutionary morality;    -- strictly carry out inspection, investigation, and  control of agencies concerned and mass organizations to promptly  detect corruption cases; and    -- promptly and seriously deal with those who are involved  in corruption, especially in serious cases, in accordance with  the law and regardless of their rank and position.    5. Strengthen national defense and security    While integrating our efforts for national construction, we  must attach importance to national defense and security to  satisfactorily protect the fatherland; defend national  independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; maintain  national security and politico- social stability; and adhere to  the socialist construction orientation.    It is necessary to firmly grasp and continue to  satisfactorily implement the common task of maintaining national  defense and security, thoroughly understand the guiding thoughts  set by the party Central Committee's Third Plenum, carry out the  all people's comprehensive and protracted struggle to foil all  schemes and acts of the "peaceful evolution," rebellion, and  power seizures.    6. Continue to broaden external relations.    We must develop the achievements in external relations and  continue our independent, sovereign, open-door foreign policy  and diversified diplomatic activities. Efforts must be made to  win more friends and reduce differences to create favorable  conditions for national construction and defense, while  positively contributing to the common struggle of people in the  world for peace, national independence, democracy, and social  progress.    7. Building the law-governed state of Vietnam that of the  people, by the people, and for the people.    What are the characteristics of the law-governed state of  Vietnam?    It is the state of the people, by the people, and for the  people in which all aspects of social life are governed by the  law. This will lead our country to progress in accordance with  the socialist orientation. The law-governed state of Vietnam is  established on the basis of strengthening and expanding the  all-people's great unity bloc comprising workers, peasants, and  the intellectuals under the party leadership.    In format, the law-governed state upholds the law and  respects the three branches of power namely legislative,  executive, and administrative powers, which is similar to the  bourgeoisie law-governed state. We also study and apply some  rational aspects of the bourgeoisie law-governed state.  However, the characteristics of our law-governed state are  different from the bourgeoisie law-governed state. As far as  the nature of class is concerned, our state is established on  the basis of the working class as symbolized by the leadership  of the party, the vanguard unit of the working class. The party  formulates lines and policies, and leads political organizations  to implement them. Because our law-governed state is  established on this basis, it has unique characteristics of a  state that is of people, by the people, and for the people,  resting on the worker-peasant-intellectual alliance. The state  serves the interest of the laboring people and the nation, while  the bourgeoisie law- governed state naturally protects  capitalism and serves the interests of the bourgeoisie class.  It cannot represent the interests of the working class and the  laboring people. Our state upholds the law and manages all  social activities through the law. The characteristics of our  laws are different from those of bourgeoisie laws. Our laws are  aimed at developing our nation in accordance with the socialist  orientation, while the laws of the bourgeoisie state are aimed  at protecting capitalism.</p>

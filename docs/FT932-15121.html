			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / A sherry by any other name BRITISH SHERRY is to be called 'fortified British wine' from the end of 1995, the British Wine Producers' Committee said yesterday. Disagreement over the name almost reached the European Court of Justice last year. Spain argued that UK excise duties were used illegally to discriminate in favour of British sherry, which contains less alcohol than the Spanish variety. Spain dropped the court action when the government promised to stop calling the British product 'sherry' after 1995, and to reduce the duty difference to 25 per cent by the end of 1996. Genuine Spanish sherry must come from the Jerez region and be matured for three years in wooden casks. British sherry is made in vats from reconstituted grape juice imported from Cyprus and elsewhere. Mr Tony Grayson, chairman of the committee, said the term fortified British wine 'will be understood and readily accepted by consumers, who are particularly loyal to the product type'.</p>

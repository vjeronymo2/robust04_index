			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Affairs of the Art: Fonteyn as Juliet was passion itself - Ballet The performance that changed my life was a Fonteyn-Nureyev Romeo and Juliet. Later, I saw yet finer performances of this ballet, and truer accounts of Kenneth MacMillan's choreography. This one was, in fact, full of faults; and I knew that at the time. Fonteyn was 56, and I could tell at once that she was nothing like Juliet's 14. At times, in the ballroom scene, one could see the strain, even pain, that the choreography sometimes caused her. I had seen that Romeo twice before, and I could tell that she was sometimes dancing revised choreography. And yet, and yet . . . Fonteyn poured so much energy into being 14, that from the first I had to suspend disbelief. I had never seen her before, and I was used to seeing one or other of Nureyev's usual ways of treating his partners: either like worthy competitors, or as if they were lucky to share the stage with him (most other dancers). With Fonteyn, however, he showed nothing but a sense of privilege. Humility in Nureyev] It was extraordinary. One of the moments when they changed the choreography occurred when, during the balcony scene, he kissed the hem of her dress. In MacMillan's choreography, this is just a marvellous fleeting moment, snatched while Juliet is rushing radiantly across the stage. Nureyev and Fonteyn, however, played it for all it was worth; and I recall it now in such detail that it is as if they played it in slow motion. He knelt, took the hem of her dress as if it were the Holy Grail, and kissed it like a supplicant. And she stood there, looking down at him in wonder, as if this amazing gesture had changed her life forever. She stood there in profile to the audience; then suddenly she raised her arms and held them, stretched up above her head, looking straight upwards into heaven, as if proclaiming her new joy into eternity. This was marvel enough, but it was surpassed by what followed. Suddenly, like a wave crashing, she brought her hands down. Down with the music; down over her face; down over her neck; down over her body; down until her arms were stretched down to the floor. And she still stood there, looking before her in rapture. Around Covent Garden one could hear a gasp - the kind of gasp I have only ever heard at Fonteyn performances. It was as if we had seen passion itself break over her in tidal force. There were other such astounding moments in that performance, but I did not know that night just how my life had been altered. The next day, however, and every day for the next six weeks, images of Fonteyn kept bursting in on me: suddenly all I could see was some blinding vision of Fonteyn, Fonteyn, Fonteyn. I have always loved the way that after images of physical movement can come back and possess one, but never again has a performance so haunted me. After that I had no choice. As Frederick Ashton liked to say about seeing Anna Pavlova, 'She injected me with her poison; and there was an end of me.'</p>

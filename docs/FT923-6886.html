			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Lloyd's syndicate costs show steep increase THE COSTS of doing business at the Lloyd's of London insurance market rose sharply in 1989, the most recently closed year of account, according to figures released yesterday. The figures were prepared by the Association of Lloyd's Members, the biggest organisation of Names, the individuals whose assets support the market's capital base. They show syndicate expenses increased 45.3 per cent in 1989, following a 40 per cent rise in costs in 1988. Mr Roger Pascall of the association said: 'Year on year this is a staggering increase. Across the market costs must come down. Returns to Names must improve - and quickly.' The figures show that about 40 per cent of Lloyd's underwriters earn Pounds 100,000 a year or more. The number of underwriters earning more than Pounds 100,000 rose to 162 from 153 the previous year. Of the 387 syndicates in the association's survey, 146 paid their underwriters between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 99,999, with an average remuneration of Pounds 77,943. The figures show that Mr Bob Wallace, of non-marine syndicate 386 managed by Janson, Green Management, was the highest earner on the market with a total remuneration of Pounds 412,183. Six underwriters earned more than Pounds 300,000. More than 24 underwriters earned more than Pounds 200,000. Profit commissions included in the salaries, which were paid in the 1991 calendar year, relate to the 1988 underwriting year when Lloyd's reported a Pounds 510.9m loss. Lloyd's reported total losses of Pounds 2.06bn in the 1989 year. Under Lloyd's three-year accounting rules the losses were unveiled to Names in June. Syndicate expenses of Pounds 561m were equal to 28 per cent of the insurance market's Pounds 2.06bn loss. Mr Pascall said the costs of running syndicates was 'disproportionately high'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION political editor] </F>   [Text] Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind today lashed out  at armchair critics who claimed the warring factions in Bosnia  could be bombed into submission by NATO air strikes.    He denounced the suggestion as "facile," adding: "I am not  the slightest bit surprised that those who have put it forward  have been discredited."    He claimed the United Nations would have sustained far  higher  fatalities and injuries over the last few months if it had not  been prepared to use the force available to protect its own men.    But in a wide-ranging interview on the BBC Radio 4 "The  World  This Weekend" programme Mr Rifkind warned: "Do not expect there  to be good progress in all directions. This is a very messy,  bloody war. The idea it can be sorted out in some neat,  clinical way is a nice aspiration, but totally unrealistic."    Mr Rifkind stressed the United Nations role was peacekeeping  and humanitarian.    "You have siren voices claiming that the United Nations  should turn itself into a warmonger and impose a peace on  someone else's civil war."    He urged those countries which had pledged more troops to  Bosnia to "get their act together a bit more quickly."    Earlier, Mr Rifkind described the events in the Gorazde area  as "a very serious deterioration."    "The most important priority are the negotiations taking  place at this moment, as we speak, which are designed to allow  the UN to send a force into Gorazde itself to help stabilise the  situation and ensure there is no further deterioration."    He said the British Government took the view that the  primary  use of air power was to defend UN forces. "It is quite a  foolish mistake to suggest that the occasional use of air power  can have decisive implications for the future of the war in  Bosnia. That is not the UN's role, nor should it ever be the  UN's role because air power by itself could not do that."    But he added: "The right of self-defence is a fundamental  right and British forces, ever since Day One, have made  abundantly clear that they are prepared to fight back, if  necessary, to defend our people."</p>

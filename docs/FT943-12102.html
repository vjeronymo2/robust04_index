			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Management: Advisers feel the pinch Recession has blunted the growth in western Europe's Pounds 5.74bn management consultancy market, which has expanded by just 7 per cent over the past two years, according to a report* by Alpha Publications, an independent research company. It predicts that the pace of growth will increase by an average of 11 per cent a year over the next six years, although this is well below the expectations of a few years ago. It attributes the lower growth projections to recession, a slowdown in the growth in IT services and social legislation imposed by the European Union. However, some trends are likely to expand the market, such as privatisation, growth in international consulting projects stemming from increased cross-border competition and new fashions such as business process re-engineering, customer loyalty programmes and delayering. The slowdown in Europe's economies has steered consultants away from long strategy projects towards offering advice that gives a quick payback by cutting costs or improving performance. The recession has encouraged the restructuring of manufacturing companies, making them currently the largest users of management consultancy, accounting for 38 per cent of the total market, followed by private-sector services such as banking and communications at 26 per cent. The 30 largest consultants account for about 60 per cent of the total market, down from two years ago when they accounted for 63 per cent. The chief reason for this change is the increase in the number of small new consulting operations, formed by executives made redundant in the recession. *The Market for Management Consultancy Services in Western Europe.

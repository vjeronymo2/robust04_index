			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Globex hit by Liffe decision Globex, the electronic futures trading system developed and operated by Reuters, the financial information and news group, was dealt a further blow yesterday when Liffe, London's financial futures and options exchange, said it had decided against joining. Liffe's decision comes one month after the Chicago Board of Trade announced it was pulling out of Globex despite a new agreement designed to revitalise the system and lighten the financial obligations on participating exchanges. Following the CBoT's departure, only the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and France's Matif remain as Reuters' Globex partners. However, the DTB, Germany's futures exchange, is expected to make a decision today on whether it will join Globex. Simex, Singapore's futures exchange, is also having talks with Globex. Mr Nick Durlacher, Liffe's chairman, said the board's decision reflected its main priority, which was to increase the distribution of Liffe's products outside European time zones. 'Regrettably, the terms on which our participation in Globex were offered would have denied us further development of our preferred linkage strategy and would have meant withdrawal from our Euroyen discussions with Tiffe, Tokyo's financial futures exchange,' he said. Liffe would also have been precluded from extending its automated trading system beyond its current hours of use. 'These restrictive conditions were totally unacceptable to the Liffe board,' Mr Durlacher said. Ms Rosalyn Wilton, Reuters' managing director for transaction products, said although she was disappointed that Liffe was not going to join Globex, she believed that its future was not dependent on the participation of large exchanges. Nevertheless, observers said Liffe's participation would have gone a long way towards providing the critical mass which Globex needs to survive. Mr Alastair Smellie, a media analyst with the US investment bank, Lehman Brothers, said: 'It is a disappointment, there are no two ways about it. The success of Globex is dependent on a critical level of volume.' Reuters is believed to have invested Dollars 100m in Globex. Its shares fell 7p to 485p yesterday.</p>

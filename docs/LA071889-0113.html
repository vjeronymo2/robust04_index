			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. AND SOVIETS REPORTEDLY AGREE ON PLAN TO BAN CHEMICAL WEAPONS  </P> <P> The United States and the Soviet Union have reached agreement on key elements  of a treaty banning chemical weapons, including a timetable for destroying them  and procedures for inspecting chemical factories, according to the New York  Times.  </P> <P> The newspaper, citing Bush Administration officials, said in today's editions  that the superpowers' recommendations will be submitted to the 40-nation  Conference on Disarmament in Geneva.  </P> <P> A State Department official told the newspaper that the two sides have agreed  in principle on "a mathematical formula" prescribing the amounts and types of  chemical weapons to be destroyed over a 10-year period.  </P> <P> They also reportedly agreed on procedures for highly intrusive surprise  inspections at sites where one country suspects the other of cheating.  </P> <P> The draft treaty would ban the development, production, possession and transfer  of chemical weapons.  </P> <P> The Geneva Protocol of 1925, adopted after poison gas in World War I produced  1.3 million casualties, prohibits the use of chemical weapons, but not their  manufacture or stockpiling.  </P> <P> Under the U.S.-Soviet agreement, some chemical weapons and production equipment  would be destroyed annually, but each country could retain some weapons to  protect itself until the end of the 10-year transition period.  </P> <P> If it is ratified, the new agreement could curtail the spread of chemical  weapons by making it more difficult for Third World nations like Libya and Iraq  -- prime suspects in the use or manufacture of such weapons -- to obtain them,  the newspaper reported.  </P> <P> The United States and the Soviet Union also agreed to a comprehensive exchange  of data on chemical weapons, including sites for their production and storage,  said James H. Granger, the deputy head of the U.S. delegation to the Geneva  conference.  </P></p>

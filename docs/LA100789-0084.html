			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> READING COMES TO LIFE FOR CHILDREN HUNTING FOR TREASURE IN MUSEUM MAZE  </P> <P> Bea Thurber was tired of seeing kids throw aside books in favor of video games.  Shouldn't reading be as much of an adventure as playing Super Mario Brothers?  </P> <P> With the help of a local artist, architect and writer, Thurber created a  life-size, three-dimensional adventure book. The Creative Journey Maze lets  children trek through its winding corridors, creating their own adventure story  as they go.  </P> <P> The maze will open to the public today at the Children's Museum of San Diego.  </P> <P> As they enter the 600-square-foot creation of vividly painted passageways and  alcoves, children are challenged to find three clues that will help them  recover the queen's stolen jewels. The clues are numbers that unlock a safe  where the missing jewels are kept.  </P> <P> On their journey, the young travelers encounter a variety of choices as they  read the signs posted to guide them. Should they travel by plane or train?  Follow a trail through the Bat Cave or brave the Woodsman's Lodge? Take advice  given by the red parrot, or his contrary counterpart, the blue parrot.  </P> <P> "Explore. But remember, people have disappeared in here," warns one sign. There  are so many twists and turns in the maze, it is not hard to believe the  warning.  </P> <P> Should the players reach the maze's end without finding the treasure, the game  is not necessarily over. They can simply return to the beginning and start  their journey again, this time choosing a different route and creating a  different story about the queen's lost jewels.  </P> <P> "For many kids today, reading is something that they only do in school," said  Barbara Broderick, a museum executive. "This way, reading is seen as something  outside the classroom that is a good, fun thing to do."  </P> <P> Thurber, a reading teacher and the museum's director of exhibits, said she had  become increasingly distressed with the mostly "dry, boring, meaningless" books  students were reading in school. Often, the author's narrative didn't allow  them to participate, she said. Thurber wanted students to determine the outcome  of their stories.  </P> <P> The maze allowed her to do that by combining reading with a three-dimensional  structure. While traveling through the maze, children are asked to read signs,  make choices, and create a story rather than let an author make the decisions  about whether the best route will take them through a jungle, a desert or a  volcano.  </P> <P> In the maze, each child becomes the main character. The story unfolds as the  youngster decides which paths to take and what will happen. He could even  become lost in an Arabian marketplace or get eaten by a grizzly bear. He might  have to escape from an Egyptian tomb, or a bawdy late-night cafe.  </P> <P> "I wanted to give the children the sense that reading and paying attention to  words is exciting and necessary. In an adventure story, it's necessary for  survival," Thurber said.  </P> <P> Because there is no correct route through the maze, children cannot make a  mistake -- another plus, Thurber noted.  </P> <P> To design the unique labyrinth, Thurber recruited local artist Phil Matzigkeit,  architect and designer Kotaro Nakamura and writer Bart Thurber, who is her  husband and an English professor at the University of San Diego.  </P> <P> The team spent hours brainstorming, deciding how the story should fit with the  childlike artwork painted by Matzigkeit, a muralist. Then, Nakamura devised a  way to mount the panels to give children more options in creating their  adventure story.  </P> <P> While writing his often-funny, tongue-in-cheek script for the maze, Bart  Thurber used a computer program that allowed him to write the story in separate  vignettes.  </P> <P> Once completed, the computer mixed the 24 episodes Thurber devised, creating  myriad options for students to follow through the maze.  </P> <P> The project, the museum's most ambitious in its six-year history, also drew the  interest of the San Diego County Edition of the Los Angeles Times, which  donated $45,500 to build the maze.  </P> <P> "This project is a joyful expression of two of The Times' favorite causes: kids  and literacy. It's also an expression of two of the museum's favorites:  learning and fun," said Phyllis K. Pfeiffer, the edition's general manager.  </P> <P> The maze is designed for children who can read, up to age 12. Younger children  can enjoy the maze by walking through and looking at the pictures. Or an adult  can accompany them and read the story aloud.  </P> <P> The Children's Museum is inside the La Jolla Village Square shopping center.  Cost is $2.75 a person, $1.25 for senior citizens. Children under 2 are free.  </P></p>

			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Telephone banking It is easy to gain the impression from reading the advertisements that telephone delivery of financial services is the coming thing. Yet uncertainties remain where banking is concerned. While Midland Bank's Firstdirect is proud to point to the number of bills it pays, it remains remarkably coy about customer balances in its accounts. The suspicion is that while it offers a convenient and cheap transaction service, it finds it harder to attract retail deposits. That would be natural for two reasons. People tend instinctively to prefer placing their savings in an actual branch rather than dispose of them remotely down the phone; users of telephone banking tend to be professional people who are unlikely to leave money lying idle in current accounts. That raises the question of whether the efficiency advantage of a low-cost transaction service outweighs the cost of forgoing some of the profits from cheap retail deposits that flow readily into a branch network. If it does not, Firstdirect may not become a real money spinner, while Barclays and National Westminster would be right to talk more of bolt-on services. Yet the conclusion changes again when one considers the industry trend away from using cheap deposits to subsidise current account transaction services. Most expect this will eventually lead to charges on current accounts. When that happens, organisations like Firstdirect, which are already set up to provide a value-for-money transaction service, will have a distinct edge.</p>

The response on the New York Stock Exchange was swift:  Industrials on the Dow Jones Index fell close to 100 percentage  points in one day.    The American economy finally picked up some growth momentum  in the third quarter of last year after a languid 32-month  spell. As if to show it had lain dormant long enough, the  economy burst into activity in a great release of all the  frustrated energy pent up over the years. U.S. GDP growth rate  in the fourth-quarter hit 5.9 percent. Before Christmas,  factory inventories dropped to a new low for the previous 20  years; 83.5 percent of industrial plants were operating; and the  average work-time in the manufacturing sector was the highest  since World War II. Economists generally agree that when  industrial plant use reaches 85 percent, manufacturers will  start to feel the pressure of rising prices due to labor and raw  material shortages. It was this concern over inflation that  prompted the recent raising of short-term interest rates.    Despite the fact that the Clinton administration's economic  policy of increasing taxes, reducing expenditure, and cutting  budget deficits was the main cause of the revival of the  American economy, interest rates played a more direct role in  the recent strong growth within a relatively short time. The  government determination to cut financial deficits reduced  government borrowing, releasing funds into capital markets. The  rate of return on the 30-year Treasury bonds -- the cornerstone  for long-term interest rates -- dropped accordingly, leading to  a fall in short-term interest rates such as the mortgage rate,  consumption credit rate, and rates for corporate debentures.  Interest rate cuts reduced private and corporate debt burdens,  encouraged car and house purchases, and promoted rapid growth in  investment, bringing to light the whole manufacturing sector.  However, private consumption growth in 1993 far exceeded income  growth. Behind the wave of consumption were worries about  interest rate hikes. As the American economy is still in the  grip of the borrowing-consumption pattern, there is always a  chance that the interest rate will be raised again. This lends  a certain short-term and fleeting character to the current  interest rate-powered economic growth.    This is not the whole story of the dilemma for American  economic growth. As most Western countries are still in  recession, demand in the growing American economy has risen,  while demand in its overseas markets remains sluggish. This may  help ease shortages on raw material markets and inflation  pressure, but it may also increase the U.S. trade deficit and  sag the momentum of economic growth.    Amid general recession among Western countries, economic  growth in East Asia and Latin America has injected new vitality  into the world economy. Moreover, economic growth in these  countries is no longer one based on borrowings. Now they  sustain their economic growth more with savings and direct  investment and spend no more than they earn. With low labor  cost and effective participation in the world economy, an  increasingly larger number of technology- and labor-intensive  products from Asian countries and regions are becoming not only  self-sufficient, but also gaining a position in international  markets. Their purchases from Western countries of high  value-added capital goods are determined by their balance of  trade. In this sense, they appear first as producers, then as  consumers on the international market.    The year 1993 was a year of intense restructuring for  American corporations. To position themselves for competition,  firms spent their funds on information equipment which reduced  manpower and cut again intermediate-level management staff and  labor. The restructuring, therefore, was focusing on lowering  product cost instead of increasing employment opportunity.  Numerous white-collar workers became unemployed at a time of  economic revival, and newly created jobs were mostly odd or  part-time jobs. Reductions in high- paying and stable  employment greatly restricted consumption power in society, thus  weakening the dynamics of American economic development.    Owing to these factors, the American economy in 1994 may  very  likely find itself in a state of low-speed growth, its annual  economic growth rate estimated at around 3 percent. In a world  economic system which is increasingly integrated, the American  economy will have to wait for the revival of the Western economy  and economic development of developing countries for effective  growth. Meanwhile, more and more countries are entering market  competition. Whoever wants to have a lot of room for maneuvering  and the luxury to advance and retreat as he wishes must acquire  an advantage in high technology or cost cutting. To stay  competitive in the international market, American firms will  have to be further internationalized, work harder to be more  responsive, and cut costs. Returns on the scale of economy are  lowering, and medium and small firms can look for long-term  development. But Americans should not expect any rise in their  income level, which is high enough for now. This is an  adjustment process wrought with pain.</p>

			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Violence in Bombay subsides ELEVEN people were killed in an eighth day of Hindu-Moslem clashes in Bombay yesterday, and hospitals reported at least 500 had died in week-long rioting in India's commercial capital, Reuter reports from Bombay. Security forces relaxed curfews imposed on riot-hit areas for six hours and Bombay police chief Shreekant Bapat said the level of violence was substantially lower than over the past few days. 'There is a very substantial improvement in the overall situation. This is reflected by more and more people and buses on the roads.' Defence minister Sharad Pawar ruled out imposing a state of emergency in the city of 12m people, which had been suggested by business leaders and editors who saw in the riots a concerted attempt to drive out Moslems. He told a press conference that the city was returning to normality after a week of frenzied riots in which hundreds of people have been stabbed, and countless homes, cars and shops set ablaze. Mr Pawar said it would take another two or three days to restore order completely.</p>

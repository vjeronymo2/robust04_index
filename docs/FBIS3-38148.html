			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of a letter from Cypriot President Glavkos Klirdihis </F> to UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali issued on 28 January]    [Text] Your Excellency, Thank you for your letter of 17th  December 1993. I did not consider it necessary to reply to your  question whether my side accepts the principles of the package  of the Confidence-Building Measures as set out in paragraphs 37,  38, 42 and 43 of your report of the 1st July 1993, document  S26026, because as Your Excellency is aware during the talks  held in New York from 24 May to 1 June 1993, the position of my  side was that we accepted the proposal made by you i.e. the  placing of the fenced area of Varosha under the United Nations  administration including policing and the return of its  inhabitants and the opening and functioning of the Nicosia  Airport by the United Nations.    We stated clearly then that should the Turkish Cypriot side  accept the same deal, we would be prepared to discuss in detail  the modalities for implementing the Confidence-Building  Measures. For the sake, however, of avoiding any  misunderstanding regarding my position now, I state  emphatically, clearly and unequivocally that I accep? the  principles of the package of the Confidence-Building Measures as  set out in paragraphs 37, 38, 42 and 43 of your report of the  1st July 1993 (S/26026) and that I am ready to start talks on  the modalities regarding their implementation as soon as the  Turkish side clearly and unequivocally makes the same acceptance.    His Excellency Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali, Secretary-General of  the United Nations Organization, New York.    Your Excellency will recollect that it was clearly stated by  you that nothing in the deal should contain elements which would  constitute or could be interpreted as constituting direct or  indirect recognition or giving either side political advantage.    You will also recollect, Excellency, that it was common  ground that although t?e Confidence-Building Measures were  necessary in order to facilitate a solution and thus should  precede the solution, they would not constitute the solution  itself and that negotiations should continue on the substance of  the problem.    Permit me now, Your Excellency, to refer to the Turkish  position. Mr. Denktas raising security concerns of his side  stated categorically that he could not agree to the whole fenced  area of Varosha to be handed to the United Nations and that he  wished to retain the part of the area north of Democratia  Street. With respect to that area he stated that he intended to  colonise it.    On the Nicosia Airport issue his position was that parallel  to the Nicosia Airport the occupied Tymbou Airport "Ercan" and  the occupied ports of Famagusta and Kyrenia should operate  legally. Your Excellency, pointed out that what Mr. Denktas was  asking was contrary to the rule that nothing in the  Confidence-Building Measures should imply recognition or give  political advantage either to the one or the other side.    Mr. Denktas insisted that he was not authorised by his  "Parliament" to negotiate beyond those positions. He had asked  for 15 days to return home for instructions. He promised that  he would endeavour to persuade his side to accept the deal as  proposed by Your Excellency and that at the end of the 15 days  he would give an answer.    During his return, speaking to his "Parliament," he rejected  the deal as proposed by Your Excellency and did the same when  addressing the Turkish National Assembly. Since then he  purported that he could not reply because it was necessary to  hold "elections."    I regret to say, that he has not replied even today in a  straight forward manner whether he accepts the deal as proposed  by Your Excellency and in fact after wasting seven months, the  position is as follows:    On the question of the fenced area of Varosha he still  raises security concerns which he wishes them to be taken into  consideration. It is clear that he is not prepared to state  that the entire fenced area of Varosha is to be handed to the  United Nations alleging security concerns, and at the talks he  will insist that the area north of Democratia Street must be  denied to its inhabitants even if they were to return under  United Nations administration.    During my first meeting with Mr. Joe Clark on the 24th  January, I asked whether Mr. Denktas is prepared to state that  the entire fenced area of Varosha is part of the deal and Mr.  Joe Clark did not think that Mr. Denktas would state so. To a  further question of mine whether Mr. Denktas would raise the  question at the talks regarding the area north of Democratia  Street, he felt certain that he would. From what was said  during my second meeting with Mr. Joe Clark, which took place on  the 25 January i.e. after Mr. Clark saw Mr. Denktas for a second  time, I formed the clear impression that Mr. Denktas still  raises security concerns with regard to the area north of  Democratia Street.    As you know, Your Excellency, the reconstruction of Varosha  will cost more than one billion dollars and Mr. Denktas is  asking that Varosha be returned ?nder his administration should  there be obstacles in the enjoyment of the benefits of the  Nicosia International Airport by the Turkish Cypriots. The cost  of rebuilding Varosha, which was looted by the Turkish side and  was left as a ghost town for almost 20 years to go to ruin, is  to be paid by the Greek Cypriots who will have to rebuild their  properties. Which Greek Cypriot will spend money for the  rebuilding of Varosha knowing that the administration may be  handed to the Turkish side?    Furthermore, Mr. Denktas in his letter to Your Excellency  raises the issue of "lifting through practical measures the  embargo that has been weighing so heavily on the Turkish Cypriot  side" thus again he brings back the question of accepting a  legitimate status for the occupied ports and airport in the  north and the indirect recognition of the Turkish Cypriot  break-away state.    Finally, the sixth paragraph of Mr. Denktas's letter to Your  Excellency may reasonably be interpreted as meaning that, even  if we were to agree on the Confidence-Building Measures, we  would have to leave them aside in order to consider how they fit  into the comprehensive settlement of all aspects of the Cyprus  problem.    Your Excellency will recollect that at the end of the  negotiations in New York last June, I stated clearly that I  would not accept to discuss the Confidence-Building Measures  unless the Turkish side accepted the deal which was proposed by  you, i.e the total fenced area of Varosha and the functioning of  the Nicosia International Airport, under United Nations control  and that the issue of direct or indirect legalisation of the  occupied ports and airport was out of question and out of the  deal offered by Your Excellency. That was my position then,  that is my position now.    I do not propose at this stage to make any observations on  the several other issues Mr. Denktas raises in his letter to  Your Excellency, until I have clear answers to the following:    a. Does he accept, irrespective of the so called security  concerns, that the entire fenced area of Varosha will be handed  to United Nations for administration and policing and that the  Greek Cypriot inhabitants will return to their homes and  properties?    b. Does he abandon any notion that my side should recognise,  either directly or indirectly through practical measures, a  legal status of the occupied ports and airport in the north?    C. Does he accept that any Confidence-Building Measures  agreed will be implemented without waiting to see how they fit  in the integrated, comprehensive and whole solution of the  Cyprus problem?    I would like to draw the attention of Your Excellency to the  fact that seven valuable months have been lost and that instead  of discussing the modalities of how to implement the  Confidence-Building Measures, we are back to where the talks  broke last June when Mr. Denktas did not accept the proposal  made by Your Excellency and is still now not accepting it.    With regard to the security concerns of Mr. Denktas, which  he raises in his letter to Your Excellency both in connection  with the final solution and with regard to the  Confidence-Building Measures, I wish to point out that there are  also serious security concerns of the Greek Cypriot Community  both with regard to the final solution and with regard to the  Confidence-Building Measures. Since both sides admit serious  security concerns, it is obvious that we should discuss and  solve our security concerns before anything else instead of  finding them as an impediment in every step we make for  progress. If Mr. Denktas is ready to discuss the security  concerns of both sides I am ready to join issue.    Though I stand firm that the deal as proposed by Your  Excellency i.e. the entire fenced area of Varosha under United  Nations administration and the functioning of the Nicosia  International Airport under United Nations control is accepted  by me and I am ready to discuss modalities for the  implementation of the Confidence-Building Measures,  nevertheless, in view of the non acceptance of the deal as  proposed by Your Excellency by the Turkish side, and in view of  the fact that seven months have already been wasted, and in  order to save time, I propose that until the Turkish side makes  up its mind on the issue of the Confidence-Building Measures, we  revert to the discussion of the substance of the problem  beginning with the security concerns of both sides, which appear  to be the real obstacle and the thorn in any progress. I  believe that confidence will be created and progress will be  fade once the security concerns of both sides are met.    Please accept, Your Excellency, the assurances of my highest  consideration.    (Glavkos Kliridhis)    President of the Republic of Cyprus</p>

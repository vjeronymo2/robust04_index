			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 27 May (EFE) -- Lima Mayor Ricardo Belmont,  who is an independent, today announced his candidacy for the  presidency of Peru for the 1995 general elections.    During a news conference, Belmont said his decision is a  result of "a deep reflection that leads me as a Peruvian to  follow my conscience." He said: "There is no way back, the  speculations are over. I will run as an independent, without  alliances with any groups."    Belmont referred to Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori who,  according to all political observers, will run for a reelection  and whom Belmont has described as "promoting the division, not  the unity of the Peruvian people."    Belmont is complying with a second term as Lima mayor after  being reelected last January. He said he has not yet begun his  campaign and that he will totally engage in a campaign "once the  game rules are clear."    "No matter what the polls, Congress, or the media say,  Belmont will run in the elections," said Belmont, founder and  leader of Obras political movement.    Last month, he announced he would not run although some  sectors considered him a probable candidate.    The Lima mayor became one of the harshest critics of  President Fujimori after the government passed a law cutting  municipal income which, according to Belmont, prevents him from  implementing more than a dozen works he considers essential for  Lima.    Opposition members considered the law seeks to neutralize  Belmont's capability of action as mayor and to prevent him from  carrying out works that would allow him to gain support for a  probable presidential campaign.    Cusco Mayor Luis Caceres has also announced his candidacy  for  the presidency. According to the polls, former United Nations  Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar is Fujimori's  strongest contender if he decides to run. Perez de Cuellar has  said it is too early to decide.</p>

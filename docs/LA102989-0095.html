			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHEAST ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> WEBB, KELLY LEAD NO. 11 TENNESSEE OVER LSU  </P> <P> Tennessee Coach Johnny Majors had a hard time singling out a turning point  Saturday, there were so many.  </P> <P> Chuck Webb, who rushed for 134 yards in 30 carries, ran for three touchdowns,  Greg Amsler scored twice, and Carl Pickens ran a kickoff back 93 yards as the  11th-ranked Volunteers outlasted Louisiana State, 45-39, at Baton Rouge, La.  </P> <P> Tennessee is 6-1 overall and 3-1 in the Southeastern Conference. LSU is 1-6 and  0-3, the Tigers' worst start since 1956.  </P> <P> "There were so many plays, I can hardly think about when the big play was in a  game like that," Majors said. "Without a question, the kickoff return had to be  as big a play as any we've had this year."  </P> <P> LSU led 14-0 at the end of the first quarter, but Tennessee came back to go in  front, 28-17, early in the third.  </P> <P> Volunteer quarterback Andy Kelly, who during a stretch in the first half had  nine consecutive completions, led the comeback.  </P> <P> LSU built its early lead on a pair of touchdown pass plays by Tommy Hodson --  30 yards to Tony Moss and two yards to Eddie Fuller.  </P> <P> Hodson also hit Fuller with a 23-yard scoring pass midway through the fourth  quarter and connected with Todd Kinchen for an 11-yard touchdown with 26  seconds left in the game.  </P> <P> Hodson, who holds almost all of LSU's passing records, had his first 300-yard  passing game and first rushing touchdown. He threw for 438 yards, completing 31  of 49 passes.  </P> <P> After LSU took a 17-14 lead on a field goal with 19 seconds left in the half,  Pickens took the ensuing kickoff at his seven-yard line, started up the middle,  swung to the right sideline and broke into the clear at midfield. He got a key  block on kicker Pedro Suarez at the 25-yard line.  </P> <P> Tennessee scored twice in the third quarter, a one-yard plunge by Webb and a  two-yarder by Amsler sandwiched around Hodson's two-yard scoring sneak for LSU.  </P> <P> Webb scored his final touchdown on a three-yard run in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Auburn 14, Mississippi State 0 -- James Joseph rushed for a career-high 172  yards and one touchdown in 35 carries in what otherwise was a defensive  struggle that the No. 16 Tigers won at Auburn, Ala.  </P> <P> After a scoreless first half, Mississippi State was forced to punt from its six  after taking the second-half kickoff.  </P> <P> The Tigers quickly drove 48 yards, with quarterback Reggie Slack scoring from  the two.  </P> <P> Joseph, a redshirt junior, later scored on a one-yard run to cap an 81-yard  drive that followed a missed 29-yard field-goal attempt by Joel Logan. The kick  hit the left upright.  </P> <P> Auburn is 4-2 and 3-1; the Bulldogs are 4-3 and 1-3.  </P> <P> Mississippi 24, Vanderbilt 16 -- For a third consecutive week, Ole Miss used a  fourth-quarter comeback to pull out a victory, using touchdown runs by Russ  Shows and Tyrone Ashley in an SEC game at Oxford, Miss.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, Ole Miss scored a touchdown with 31 seconds to go defeat Georgia  and then a week ago beat Tulane on a touchdown with four seconds to play.  </P> <P> This time around it was a relative laugher.  </P> <P> Ole Miss trailed 10-0 at halftime and 13-10 early in the final quarter against  nine-point underdog Vanderbilt.  </P> <P> But Mississippi drove 70 yards in 11 plays with Shows, a backup quarterback,  scoring from three yards on an option play to make it 17-13. Ole Miss went 79  yards in just four plays for the clinching touchdown, a 16-yard run by Ashley.  </P> <P> Ole Miss, 6-2 overall, its best record at this point since 1971, is 3-1 in the  SEC. Vanderbilt is 1-6 and 0-5.  </P> <P> Georgia 34, Kentucky 23 -- Rodney Hampton scored touchdowns on runs of 18, 20  and 35 yards as the Bulldogs continued their domination of the Wildcats in this  SEC game at Athens, Ga.  </P> <P> It was the Bulldogs' 11th victory over the Wildcats in the last 12 years and  saddled Kentucky with its 15th consecutive road loss in SEC play.  </P> <P> Hampton gained 184 yards in 31 carries and also caught four passes for 43  yards.  </P> <P> Hampton's third touchdown came with 2:45 left in the game and was followed by  Kentucky's biggest play of the day, a 100-yard kickoff return by Kurt Johnson.  </P> <P> Georgia (4-3 and 3-2) got its other touchdown on a 34-yard pass play, Greg  Talley to Arthur Marshall.  </P> <P> Kentucky (4-3 and 1-3) hasn't won an SEC road game since beating Tennessee,  17-2, in 1984.  </P></p>

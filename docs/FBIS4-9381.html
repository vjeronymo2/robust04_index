			<p>BFN     [Text] Novi Sad, 25 Apr (TANJUG) -- If NATO abuses UNPROFOR  [UN Protection Forces] forces it will topple the United Nations,  which will become an instrument of NATO and the United States  [as received], Momcilo Krajisnik, president of the assembly of  the Srpska republic, has told Novi Sad Radio.    Krajisnik stresses that the Srpska republic has long been  demonstrating that it is ready to cease fighting and make peace  and find a peaceful solution in ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina. However,  everything that is being displayed in the media and ultimata  testifies to an intention to vilify the Serbs and satisfy  certain interests that lead to war rather than peace.    It is ever more evident that the intention is to achieve a  certain goal -- set in advance -- namely, by ultimata with the  help of NATO, the United States, and UNPROFOR, the Muslim side  should achieve everything it has militarily failed to achieve in  the battlefield.    Gorazde and the situation surrounding it, Krajisnik  cautioned, was just a launch pad for Muslim forces and their  intervention in the direction of Cajnice, Visegrad, and Srbinje  (Foca). The support of NATO, the United States, and the UN for  such an escalation can lead to one thing only -- fierce war,  Krajisnik said.    He noted that the leadership of the Srpska republic had  successfully finished their negotiations with Yasushi Akashi,  the UN secretary general's special envoy, but these agreements  were not being honored and that solutions are being forcefully  imposed on the Serbs. This is something the leadership of the  Srpska republic cannot accept, since this is something that the  Serb people on the soil of Bosnia-Herzegovina cannot accept  either because they are fighting for their survival and will not  succumb to any ultimatum or force.</p>

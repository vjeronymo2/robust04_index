			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / The UK's half-exposed economy How open is the British economy to international competition? What proportion of British production has to keep abreast of foreign competition; and what proportion is more insulated? These are extremely important questions in relation to the value of an anchor such as the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) in lowering and then stabilising inflation. They are equally important outside the ERM, if we are to gauge the ultimate inflationary potential of sterling's 16 per cent effective devaluation since Black Wednesday last September and the impact of future exchange rate changes. It is scarcely credible that during more than a decade of ferocious debate about the pros and cons of ERM membership, hardly anyone on either side bothered to make any estimates of how open the British economy really is - which would have been far more valuable than the actual debates. To make such estimates, it is not enough to look at exports or imports as a proportion of gross domestic product. For just as important are the products which are made at home but for which imports could easily be substituted. An article by Chris Mellis in the February Bank of England Bulletin* takes the bull by the horns - or nearly so. Nearly so, because the author has for statistical convenience used the weights in the Retail Prices Index as a basis, even though they are based on consumption rather than production. The author starts out by dividing the RPI into goods and services (omitting, of course, mortgage interest payments), as goods are more exposed to trade than services. For one measure of 'tradeables' he excludes seasonal foodstuffs and taxes on drink and tobacco. For another measure he excludes all food, drink and tobacco. The two variants make quite a lot of difference. In the first case, the proportion of tradeables is 67 per cent; in the second, it is only 40 per cent. The truth must lie somewhere between the two. Food and drink are obviously subject to international competition, but perhaps less so than other goods after taking into account the very large element of transport and distribution services in their retail price. As a rough approximation, one might say that the openness of the British economy is a little over 50 per cent. The first finding to emerge from the Bank of England analysis is that the tradeable sections of the RPI increased less rapidly than the rest of the index - in fact, about 2 percentage points less since 1983. This is hardly surprising in view of the lower rate of productivity improvement in the services which make up the bulk of non-tradeables. The differences are in the same direction in other European countries although they seem a little smaller. Even Germany was not able to secure an annual rate of price increase for tradeables averaging less than 2 per cent in the best period of the 1980s. Of course, few sectors of a relatively open economy can be insulated for ever from international influence. If wages are held down in the tradeable sector, labour will tend to move to the more sheltered areas, thus holding down labour costs and thus prices there, too. It is reassuring, therefore that sophisticated statistical tests showed some transmission of inflation rates from the traded sector to the rest of the economy. If the UK could achieve something similar to German performance consistently and not just in recession years, the overall rate of inflation would fluctuate at about a rate of 3 per cent or 4 per cent. Not surprisingly, the gap between UK tradeable and non-tradeable price increases has been at its largest in years when the real exchange rate has been at a peak, thus limiting the ability of producers in the open sector to pass on cost increases. In 1992, the UK divergence was about 3 percentage to 4 percentage points. The downward pressures were specially noticeable in clothing, footware, leisure and household goods. The Bank author believes these exceptional developments may have been connected with membership of the ERM, as this could have influenced expectations in the tradeable sector. It is also possible, however, that tradeables simply reacted more strongly to recessionary forces. In any case, I do not see how anyone looking at the charts and tables in the Bulletin can regard the exchange rate as just a price like that of tomatoes instead of the main link between inflation rates in Britain and those overseas. *Tradeable and non-tradeable prices in the UK and the European Community  -----------------------------------------------                   UK INFLATION RATE  -----------------------------------------------                              Non-              Tradeables   tradeables  Total  ----------------------------------------------- 1975-83        12.5         15.6      13.4 1984-92         4.5          6.1       5.0  ----------------------------------------------- Source: Bank of England  -----------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Threat to miners' gala mounts The survival of the Durham Miners Gala, Britain's biggest and most evocative annual working-class rally, looked further in doubt yesterday after a the Durham Miners Association executive concluded that it could not afford to finance the event this year. Faced with the demise of the Durham coalfield and the consequent loss of income, it is to appeal to the trade union and labour movement to try to stage this year's 110th gala. The northern region executive of the Trades Union Congress will discuss the appeal today. But Mr Dave Hopper, general secretary of both the association and the National Union of Mineworkers' north-east area, said after yesterday's meeting that, if this year's gala were held, it would constitute a 'dignified end'. He said: 'It wouldn't be the Durham Miners Gala without Durham miners. 'I think the gala will be at an end. It won't be continuing in its present form.' At issue is not only the Pounds 20,000 needed to mount the Durham city event but its identity as a socialist rally well to the left of the present Labour party leadership. Past gala speakers include some of Labour's most notable politicians, such as Keir Hardie, Clement Atlee and Harold Wilson. In earlier years it staunchly promoted Labour policy. The 1949 gala programme, for example, urged miners to avoid strikes and 'irresponsible' wage claims to ensure a Labour victory in the 1950 general election. But the 1984-85 miners' strike and Labour's shift to the right have strained that relationship. The party leader has not attended the gala since 1987. Mr Dennis Skinner, leftwing Labour MP for Bolsover and one of the gala's most popular and regular speakers, said yesterday: 'I would be talking, if I were there this year, about drawing up a Labour manifesto to tax the rich.' In spite of the gala's emotional resonance, it looks improbable that other unions will provide unconditional funding. Mr Bob Howard, northern TUC secretary, said: 'If it was to be without control of the mainstream TUC and Labour movement it's unlikely that would be acceptable.'</p>

			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Singapore (3): On the crest of a wave - Electronics profile: SGS-Thomson SINGAPORE is continually worried about losing its competitive edge. Nowhere is this more keenly felt than in electronics, which accounts for almost 40 per cent of total manufacturing output and more than 40 per cent of domestic exports. Concern focuses on rising wage levels and insufficient growth in productivity. But Mr Milivoj von Somogy, head of Asia Pacific operations for the European electronics giant SGS-Thomson, disagrees. 'In Singapore we can work 365 days per year. That's not possible in Europe. It's not only costs - it's the quality of labour we have here as well. And despite rising wages our total labour costs here are between Dollars 4 and Dollars 6 per hour - that's not so bad for the type of high tech work we are doing.' SGS-Thomson started low cost assembly operations in Singapore in 1969. In 1982 it built its first wafer fabrication plant and now produces about 100m pieces per month of various computer chips from its Singapore operations. Though core technology development is still carried out in Europe, SGS-Thomson's Singapore operations now employ 1,500 to produce increasingly sophisticated so called 'front end' products. Another 3,200 are employed in 'back end' operations in nearby Malaysia. 'Initially low labour costs brought us to this part of the world,' says Mr Somogy. 'Now we can source the bulk of our materials here, there is the expertise available and most importantly sales in this region are growing so fast it's a problem to meet demand.' Other electronics businesses tell a similar story. Companies that in the 1960s were assembling black and white TV sets have evolved to design and manufacture a comprehensive range of final products, sub-assemblies, components and parts for both industrial and consumer electronics industries. More than 250 electronics companies in Singapore produced an estimated SDollars 31bn worth of goods last year, a 6 per cent rise over the 1991 figure. Products cover almost the entire electronics sector, from consumer goods to disk drives, semiconductors and printed circuit boards. Singapore now accounts for about 50 per cent of total world output of computer disk drives, with about 18m unit drives valued at SDollars 8bn produced last year. This represents an increase of 28 per cent in volume terms over the 1991 figure. After an industry shakeout in 1991 and a dip in trade in the first half of 1992 overall industry growth surged by 13.9 per cent in the third quarter of the year, a trend which was continued through the end of 1992. Strong growth is expected to continue through 1993, with an expected upturn in the US, Singapore's biggest export market, absorbing more than 40 per cent of total industry exports. As the electronics industry has become more regionalised, Singapore has developed into the main electronics re-export centre in south-east Asia. Re-exports now account for about 25 per cent of Singapore's total electronics exports. The electronics industry faces various challenges. Neighbouring countries - particularly Malaysia and Thailand - have successfully developed their own electronics industries and threaten Singapore's export competitiveness, particularly in consumer electronics. Singapore has continuously sought to upgrade its activities. New electronics centres such as Penang in Malaysia are already tempting some companies to move certain operations out of Singapore. Some employers complain of an increasing incidence of 'job hopping' among electronics workers. There is also concern about government restrictions on importing labour and the costs incurred by a special foreign workers levy imposed by the authorities. Electronics is still a sector overwhelmingly dominated by the multinationals. But more efforts are being made to integrate local concerns into the production process. The government recently set up an Institute of Microelectronics to assist the local electronics industry in spearheading research and development and to train skilled R &amp; D personnel. Despite some problems investor confidence in Singapore's electronics industry continues to be maintained. Investment commitments in the industry in 1992 reached SDollars 1.4bn - more than 40 per cent of total investment committed. Companies such as SGS-Thomson realise that more investments and an ever stronger presence in the region are vital to take advantage of opportunities in the Asia-Pacific, the world's fastest growing market. 'In terms of sales of our semiconductor market in the Asia Pacific has caught up with Europe,' says Mr Somogy. 'In the Singapore/Malaysia area our sales now exceed those of either France or Britain and are the same as those of Germany. China is opening up and presents a tremendous market. I don't see much change in the growth trend in this region for the next 10 to 15 years. 'We had 33 per cent growth in the Asia Pacific last year and expect a minimum of the same growth again. It's no longer a question of orders. Instead it's a question of whether we can supply fast enough.'</p>

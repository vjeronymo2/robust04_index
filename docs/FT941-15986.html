			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / UK Company News: All-round rise puts Jacques Vert at Pounds 0.8m An all-round improvement with the retail division returning to profits was behind an increase from Pounds 186,000 to Pounds 833,000 in interim pre-tax profits at Jacques Vert, the women's wear supplier. Mr Alan Green and Mr Jack Cynamon, joint chairman, said that spring/summer orders for its Jacques Vert and Jacques Vert Plus labels were at record levels. Turnover for the six months to October 30 was higher at Pounds 21.2m, against Pounds 19.5m, which included Pounds 1.08m from discontinued activities. A property revaluation resulted in a charge above the line of Pounds 400,000. There was, however, a Pounds 255,000 turnround in exceptional items. Last year there was a charge on activities to be discontinued of Pounds 215,000 against a credit this time of Pounds 40,000, the result of Pounds 130,000 loss on disposal offset by a previous year provision of Pounds 170,000. Borrowings were halved from Pounds 3.9m to Pounds 1.7m. Interest charges fell to Pounds 156,000 (Pounds 273,000). The company said it was the second year there had been a significant fall. Two years ago net debt stood at Pounds 6.1m. After a tax charge of Pounds 381,000, against a credit of Pounds 200,000, earnings per share were 4.8p (4.2p). The interim dividend is raised to 1.5p (1p).</p>

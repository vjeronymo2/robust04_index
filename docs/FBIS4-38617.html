			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, 31 May (ITAR-TASS) -- The official visit to  Russia by a delegation of the National Assembly (parliament) of  the State of Kuwait, led by Assembly Speaker Ahmad 'Abd-al-Aziz  al- Sa'dun, continued today. The leader of the Kuwaiti  delegation met deputies and representatives of State Duma  committees.    The first scheduled meeting, at which bilateral political  cooperation was discussed, was held with V.P. Lukin, chairman of  the International Affairs Committee. The sides noted mutual  interest in establishing close political contacts and spoke in  favor of continuing relations at the level of parliamentary  groups.    The activity of the Economic Policy Committee was described  by its chairman S.Yu. Glazyev, who stressed that particular  importance is attached to the development of Russian-Kuwaiti  trade links. He announced that the committee is working on a  law on foreign trade activity and domestic investments, which  will facilitate economic cooperation between Russia and foreign  states, including Kuwait.    Members of the Kuwaiti delegation touched on matters of  mutually advantageous cooperation in the oil industry, the  military sphere, and the sphere of construction and industrial  technologies. They called on the Russian parliamentarians to  adopt as quickly as possible laws which would make it possible  to avoid dual taxation and expressed the wish that Russian  companies step up their activity in the Kuwaiti market. The  guests noted that stability is an important factor in the  economic growth of Russia.    Sergey Glazyev noted that as a result of the economic  sanctions against Iraq, Russia, had lost $15 billion. The  Kuwaiti parliamentarians responded that they regard it as  important to consider the issue of paying compensation for  Russia.    The Committee for the Budget, Taxation, Banks, and Finance  was represented by its chairman M.M. Zadornov. He said that  Russian deputies are extremely interested in the experience of  the Kuwaiti parliament which has proved itself in the role of  opponent to the government in the budgetary sphere. Also of  importance for Russians is Kuwait's experience in concentrating  receipts from oil exploitation in the state budget.    The Kuwait delegation held a meeting with the Democratic  Party of Russia [DPR] grouping, which was represented by G.Yu.  Karelin. He described the present-day Russian political  situation, stressing that the DPR is a centrist party and holds  to a pragmatic line on the economy. The parliamentarians  touched on the issue of the aftermath of the Iraqi aggression,  and the speaker of the National Assembly of Kuwait called on  those assembled not to support proposals aimed at lifting the  economic embargo from Iraq, since it is not observing post-war  agreements.    The same topic was the subject of a meeting with the  "Russia's Choice" grouping, led by Y.T. Gaydar. He welcomed the  guests, saying that he was glad about the nascent formation of  interparliamentary links and considered the visit to be an  important contribution to the development of Russian-Kuwaiti  relations.</p>

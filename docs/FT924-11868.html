			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Treasury may disclose secrets THE TREASURY is con-sidering publishing more details about its secret assessments of the economy, carried out monthly with the Bank of England, as part of a new policy of openness. The option is one of several under discussion as Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, attempts to make it easier for financial markets and the public to understand the basis for economic policy after the shock of the pound's devaluation. Mr Lamont is expected in his Mansion House speech next Thursday to give information about efforts to make policymaking at the Treasury more open. Under one idea being studied by the Treasury, a version of the minutes of the Treasury's monetary assessment committee, which meets about the middle of each month and considers the main econonomic indicators affecting policy, would be published some time afterwards. The committee is chaired by Sir Terry Burns, Treasury permanent secretary, and includes senior monetary officials from the Treasury and the Bank. Other members include Mr Alan Budd, Treasury chief economic adviser, and Mr Tony Coleby and Mr Ian Plenderleith, two of the Bank's directors. Among the indicators considered by the committee in its monthly reviews are growth in the money supply, retail sales, the state of the housing market and other - anecdotal - evidence that can shed light on demand and inflation pressures. The Treasury will not want to publish advice given by specific officials to mini-sters because doing so would infringe Civil Service convention. The Treasury could find a way round that by publishing a broad assessment.</p>

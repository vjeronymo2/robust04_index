The only thing of concern to citizens is whether the [exit  tax] will lead to new shortages. Now that the election is over,  stores are empty again. But what cannot be found in stores can  be bought at open-air markets. The goods come from Turkey,  Greece, and other neighboring countries. Not even soap can be  obtained in Yugoslavia without smugglers.    This is underlined by the case of gasoline. If it were not  for smugglers, lines several kilometers long would form at gas  stations, and rationing coupons would have to be introduced. A  gasoline smuggler commented on the government decision to impose  an exit tax on local Radio 202: "I smuggle gasoline from  Hungary. I have a friend in Subotica, and after each border  crossing I leave gasoline at his place. After a few days I  transport it by truck to Belgrade to sell it at a price of two  or three German marks [DM]. Now I will lose DM60 if I make six  border crossings. For each transport I have to pay DM30,  totaling DM180. That makes a daily cost of DM240. I will  continue to smuggle since I am unemployed, but from now on, a  liter of gasoline will cost from DM5 to DM6 in Belgrade."    The same will be true for other smuggled goods. However,  there will be only a few buyers able to pay the new, higher  prices. Therefore, there will be fewer who support their  families by smuggling. It seems that the Yugoslav Government has  introduced the most efficient blockade of Yugoslavia. Once  again, it will replenish its coffers and empty the pockets of  its citizens at the same time.</p>

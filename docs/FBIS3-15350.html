Apart from publications in the Israeli press, Reuters  recently quoted Israel's Justice Minister David Libai as saying  that "the Lithuanian Government must bear responsibility for  punishing war criminals and returning Jewish property stolen and  confiscated in World War II."    The Lithuanian Foreign Ministry is still trying to obtain  the  official text of the Israeli minister's statement, but did not  have it as of noon Wednesday.    In an interview with Lithuanian TV, Paleckis said relations  with Israel must be based on the future as it is done in  relations with Russia, Germany, Poland and other countries, but  not on the past. "There is every possibility to have very good  relations with Israel."    Vidmantas Vaicekauskas, senior investigator of the  Lithuanian  Prosecutor General's Office, said "this soap bubble about the  lawfulness of rehabilitation is only a pretext,...everything  lies in property problems of Jews."    Restitution in Lithuania is applied only to Lithuanian  citizens who permanently live in the country.    Vaicekauskas said the Lithuanian legislation does not  provide  for a possibility to open a branch office of the Simon Wiesental  Center in Lithuania because it is "a social organization of a  foreign state."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "King Husayn's Oman, Qatar Visits"] </F>   [Text] His Majesty King Husayn's talks in Oman and later  in Qatar are especially important given Jordan's major pan-Arab  role in the Arab arena. Oman and Qatar are important players  both in the Gulf and in the wider Arab arena.    King Husayn's Oman visit should further enhance the common  outlook shared by his majesty and the sultan of Oman on Arab  issues at this critical point in Arab history, a time when the  Arabs need to exert themselves in the interest of increased  solidarity and common understanding.    The role being played by Jordan and Oman in the context of  containing the Yemeni crisis is an indication of a common  perspective on the challenges facing the Arab nation. This  makes His Majesty King Husayn's visit to Oman doubly important.    His majesty's visit to Qatar is no less important,  especially  given that it will be his first since the Gulf crisis, which, if  it were not for the bold and enlightened stands of such Arab  states as Qatar, might have torn the fabric of inter-Arab  relations to shreds.    We are optimistic and hopeful that King Husayn's talks in  Oman and Qatar will yield dividends for a brighter Arab future.  We are confident that the kind of pan-Arab sense of  responsibility typical of the courageous leadership in Oman and  Qatar will go a long way toward furthering Arab solidarity,  irrespective of the obstacles that have piled up along the way.</p>

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Man In The News: Just what the doctor ordered - Adovan Karadzic Dr Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, reviled throughout the world for their policy of 'ethnic cleansing' in Bosnia, at last appears to have been outmanoeuvred. Against his own most fundamental convictions, and certainly those of his hardline colleagues, he will be forced next week to defend before his own parliament a constitutional agreement for Bosnia imposed on him by his closest ally, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president. The shock-headed psychiatrist, whose specialities are neurosis and depression, may also be fighting for his political life. If the Bosnian Serb assembly, composed largely of the kind of extremists which make Mr Karadzic look moderate, reject the plan proposed by the international mediators in Geneva, he has threatened to resign. Given the general unreliability of his promises, it is perhaps more likely that he might be jettisoned by Serb military leaders, unwilling to give up the substantial territorial gains they have made at the Moslems' expense. It is a matter of supreme irony that Dr Karadzic should have been put in such a difficult position by the man who personifies his ideals of Serbian nationalism and a greater Serbia. To the surprise of most observers, with the exception perhaps of the mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, who had meticulously prepared such a scenario, Mr Milosevic exerted extraordinary pressure to make the Bosnian Serb leader change his mind. 'They really did twist Karadzic's arm unmercifully,' a seasoned diplomatic observer said afterwards. Indeed, the normally loquacious Mr Karadzic was reported to have been reduced to virtual incoherence at the end of the talks early this week, when he saw the prospect of a Serbian 'state within a state' evaporate - at least on paper. Like many psychiatrists, the man whom Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, the outgoing US secretary of state, said should be one of those to be tried for war crimes, has something of a split personality - a Jekyll and Hyde. Though, physically, an intimidatingly large bear-like figure, many of his visitors have been seduced by his personal charm. He has written, published and likes to talk about poetry - he did so last year on a BBC arts programme - and, incongruous though it might seem, he plays the Serbian lyre. He is a family man. His wife Lilyan is also a psychiatrist and his two children, both in their 20s, also study medicine. At one stage, Dr Karadzic was even the official doctor to the Sarajevo football team. Those acquainted with the Bosnian Serb leader stress that 'he enjoys the good life'. He is reputed to have rented a villa for his family in Geneva for the duration of the peace conference, though he himself tends to stay in a hotel during the main negotiating sessions. 'He is capable of anything - good or bad,' in the words of a Yugoslav-born observer. 'He lies unconsciously in order to please his interlocutors, and he probably persuades himself that what he says is true.' The examples of Dr Karadzic's capacity to play havoc with the truth are manifold. He has, in turn, fiercely denied allegations of ethnic cleansing and the existence of detention camps into which thousands of Moslems have been herded, and then promised to open them to inspection and even to close them. At the same time, the Bosnian Serb propaganda machine, based in Pale, near Sarajevo, has been disseminating the most horrific stories about alleged Moslem atrocities, most of which have never been confirmed by independent sources. At the Geneva negotiations, journalists may report his statements, but rarely believe them. This week, he made the throw-away remark as he went into the meeting at which he rejected the Vance-Owen constitutional proposals: 'I am hoping for a compromise.' A few hours later, after Mr Milosevic had done his work in a tete-a-tete meeting, he accepted the proposals - on condition that they were approved by the Bosnian Serb assembly. Many believe that the reasons for Dr Karadzic's primitive form of Serbian nationalism in a region held up, in the past, as an example of successful ethnic integration, can be found in his origins. He is, in fact, not a Serb. Born in a mountainous region of Montenegro, he came to Sarajevo to find fame and fortune, but found it difficult to penetrate the intellectual Moslem elite. In a country divided into relatively sophisticated Moslem city dwellers and a rural population dominated by the Serbs, Dr Karadzic, of peasant origin, found a much greater affinity with the Serbs. However, he did not emerge into the political limelight until 1990 when, after a spell in prison for the misappropriation of government funds (Dr Karadzic claims it was for anti-communist activities), he helped found the nationalist Serbian Democratic party, with the explicit objective of uniting all Serbs within a greater Serbia. The objective has never changed. While the mediators have insisted in the Geneva negotiations on a unitary, if decentralised Bosnian state, divided into 10 semi-autonomous provinces, Dr Karadzic has fought tooth and nail for his vision of a simple ethnic division of the country into three communities (Serb, Moslem and Croat). In his view they should each be allowed to form 'a state within a state' with full powers in domestic and international affairs. Implicit in his proposal is the expectation that the Bosnian Serbs would merge with Serbia simply when they decided to do so. Dr Karadzic's great idol, Mr Milosevic, appears temporarily prepared to abandon this dream, mainly because it is in Serbia's interests to persuade the international community to lift its sanctions. This has been the biggest blow suffered by the Bosnian Serb leader in his short political career. Yet he knows that, unless his own supporters and military leaders completely abandon him and force him to resign, he can live to fight another day. There are enough controversial elements of the package which remain to be negotiated - the map of the provinces into which the country will be divided and the terms of a cessation of hostilities  - to enable him to spin out the talks and even to provoke their breakdown. Mr Milosevic willing, of course.</p>

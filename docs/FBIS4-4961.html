			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] President Suharto and Netherlands Prime  Minister Ruud Lubbers held talks at Merdeka Palace in Jakarta  this morning. Minister/State Secretary Murdiono briefed newsmen  on the outcome of the talks between the two leaders.    [Begin Murdiono recording] As scheduled, President Suharto  held talks with his guest Ruud Lubbers this morning. President  Suharto was accompanied by the minister/state secretary and the  foreign minister, while Prime Minister Lubbers was accompanied  by the Netherlands foreign minister. The talks, which covered a  wide range of topics, lasted for quite some time. Here is a  summary of what they discussed:    The talks concentrated on bilateral, regional, and  international issues. President Suharto gave a general  explanation of Indonesia's development proposals, strategy, and  target under the first 25-year long-term development master plan  which has been completed, and the development target under the  second long-term development master plan. President Suharto  explained to Lubbers in detail about our national development  achievements so far which provided a basis to enter the next  development phase, which is known locally as the take-off  period. This period is known as the second era of national  awakening. The president also explained in detail our  achievements in creating and maintaining national stability to  support economic growth and to provide an equal distribution of  wealth to the people.    Prime Minister Lubbers expressed high appreciation for  Indonesia's development achievements during the talks with  President Suharto. He was amazed by President Suharto's ability  to provide accurate figures on all topics.    The head of state also briefed Lubbers on Indonesia's ideas  on the role of the Nonaligned Movement, NAM, and the Asia  Pacific Economic Cooperation, APEC. Meanwhile, Lubbers also  told President Suharto about developments taking place in Europe.    After explaining in detail Indonesia's development  achievements so far and the government's plans for the future,  President Suharto then invited Netherlands businessmen to  participate in infrastructure development such as the  construction of an electric generating station, and  telecommunications and port facilities here on a build, operate,  transfer basis because Indonesia has a limited capability to  develop such areas of infrastructure independently. President  Suharto also asked Netherlands investors to set up joint  ventures with Indonesian businessmen by utilizing resources  available in the country. He said the products can be marketed  in Europe as well as in the Asia-Pacific region. [passage  omitted]    Also today, President Suharto offered the Netherlands, a  developed country, to contribute efforts to solve the foreign  debt problem faced by Third World nations. [passage omitted]    President Suharto also extended an invitation to the  Netherlands to join South-South cooperation, which according to  his own concept is within the framework of tripartite  cooperation. Briefly, it is difficult to promote cooperation  among countries in the South due to limited funds available in  some countries. Indonesia has vast experience in achieving  self-sufficiency in rice production and it has accordingly  offered to share its experience with several African countries.  This is intended to enable African farmers to know clearly  about what we do here, and it will be possible if they come to  Indonesia and live with our farmers. However, Africa does not  have enough funds to send its farmers here and at the same time  we cannot afford to bring them here. Under such a situation, we  hope that a third party -- a developed country -- will sponsor  the program. This is what President Suharto meant by tripartite  cooperation.    In his response, Prime Minister Lubbers said that the  Netherlands is willing to promote bilateral cooperation in the  fields of economy and investment because his country has the  capability to do so. At the same time, Lubbers also said that  there should be cooperation between the Navies of the two  countries, both in shipbuilding technology as well as in  training personnel. President Suharto welcomed this idea and  reiterated that Indonesia is determined to give high priority to  economic development besides paying attention to developing  security and defense.    At the start of their talks, Prime Minister Lubbers conveyed  greetings from Queen Beatrix to President Suharto. [end  recording] [passage omitted]</p>

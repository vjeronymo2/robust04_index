			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / S Korean leader turns to reformers SOUTH KOREA'S president-elect, Mr Kim Young-sam, yesterday appointed a group of reformists as his senior advisers in the Blue House, the executive mansion. The appointments indicate that Mr Kim will pursue economic and political changes promised in last year's presidential election. There has been considerable speculation in Seoul about whether Mr Kim would pursue reforms since his power base in the ruling Democratic Liberal Party is weak. Mr Kim did not join the DLP until 1990, when he merged his opposition party with the government of President Roh Tae-woo. The new presidential aides, some of whom have criticised Mr Roh's policies, will play a key role, since Mr Kim appears determined to re-assert the power of the Blue House over the bureaucracy. The Blue House, which strictly ruled the country under the former military dictatorship, has seen its power diluted under Mr Roh, who promoted bureaucratic decentralisation as part of his democratisation programme. Mr Kim, however, believes that the bureaucracy is hindering political and economic reforms. Mr Park Kwan-yong was appointed as chief presidential secretary, the most influential post in the Blue House. Mr Park is a close confidant of Mr Kim and holds a parliamentary seat in Pusan, the new president's home town. He joined the DLP in 1990 after being an opposition MP and began his political career by serving as an aide to Mr Li Ki-taek, who now heads the main opposition Democratic Party. He has criticised the National Security Law, which has been used to punish domestic dissidents, and has promoted inter-Korean relations. Mr Park Jae-yoon was appointed as the president's economic adviser. A former director of the Korea Institute of Finance and professor at Seoul National University, he has advocated financial deregulation to improve the country's economic performance. Mr Choo Don-shik, who has argued for political reform as an editorial writer for Chosun Ilbo, the country's largest newspaper, will the adviser for political affairs.</p>

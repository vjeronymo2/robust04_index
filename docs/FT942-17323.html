			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Bristol &amp; West head was paid almost Pounds 1/2 m to quit Bristol &amp; West, the UK's tenth largest building society, has paid out almost Pounds 500,000 in compensation for loss of office to its former chief executive, a near-record payment for a building society. Mr Tony FitzSimons, who left abruptly last September, received Pounds 415,000 in compensation for loss of salary, and a further Pounds 69,000 in enhanced pension contributions. The society's annual report and accounts also reveal that Bristol &amp; West has a three-year contract with a company run by Mr FitzSimons for consultancy services at a rate of Pounds 50,000 a year. The society's 1992 results saw a drop in pre-tax profits to Pounds 39.1m from Pounds 67.4m, as it had to triple provisions for possible bad debts on mortgage lending to Pounds 74.1m, having been badly hit by the fall in house prices in the south of England. Mr John Wriglesworth, societies analyst at stockbroker UBS, said that Bristol &amp; West had been 'dogged by over-expansionist lending in the heady days of 1989 and 1990, and over-zealous spending both on acquisitions - notably Hamptons, the estate agency - and on technology in the branch network'. This had resulted, he said, in a loss of confidence in a traditionally strong society, although under Mr John Burke, formerly deputy chief executive who succeeded Mr FitzSimons, the society's performance was already improving. From his appointment as chief executive in spring 1989 to his resignation last autumn, Mr FitzSimons was a controversial figure. In December 1992, for example, he said that Bristol &amp; West would become the first society to price new mortgages according to the borrower's age and family status. The payments to Mr FitzSimons - who served less than five years - are rivalled only by the Pounds 641,000 paid to Mr Scott Durward, who resigned from Alliance &amp; Leicester, the UK's fourth largest society, in 1991 after ten years as chief executive. A more typical payment to an executive director leaving a large society would be about Pounds 250,000. Bristol &amp; West said yesterday that the board thought it was 'in the society's interest' to make it possible for Mr FitzSimons to depart without being required to serve out his two-year notice period, and the compensation payments reflected this. Bristol &amp; West said there had been other occasions, though not at chief executive level, when a senior executive who had left the society had undertaken consultancy work because of specialised knowledge and experience. Going through a tendering process before awarding a contract to Mr FitzSimons' company 'would not have been relevant', it said. The society's 1993 results, announced last month, showed both the scale of its poor results and the beginnings of recovery. Its pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 41.3m, helped by a fall in bad debt provisions to Pounds 63.3m, while its 1992 results were restated - in the light of new accounting standards - as just Pounds 14m.</p>

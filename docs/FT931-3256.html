			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / International Company News: IRI plans more share deals to cut huge debts SENIOR executives at IRI, Italy's biggest state holding company, facing consolidated debts of over L70,000bn (Dollars 43.61bn), are determined to push through further complex share swaps among subsidiaries, despite severe criticism from the stock market and investors. The attacks follow weekend leaks that IRI plans to cede to its Stet telecommunications arm for three years the dividend on its 57 per cent stake in the ordinary shares of Banca Commerciale Italiana, the big bank which is a future privatisation candidate. The transaction will allow Stet, which is highly profitable, to offset tax credits on the dividends against its tax bill and provide a net return of 23 per cent. Meanwhile, IRI, which is facing crippling losses following difficulties at many of its industrial operations, will receive a L340bn payment in return. Although shifting tax credits within a group to lower its overall tax burden is commonplace in Italy, IRI's plan has produced a barrage of criticism. The attacks on the deal range from claims that it will block BCI's privatisation to suggestions that corporate tax avoidance is immoral. 'I don't know what they're complaining about', said one banker closely associated with the transaction. 'Half of corporate Italy does this; it's the 22nd deal of the kind I've done'. Financial engineering of dividend payments also reflects the six-year period Italian companies have to wait before they receive tax credits from the government. When eventually paid, the money attracts interest at far below market rates. IRI has about L3,700bn in tax credits outstanding, implying that it could undertake a large number of similar transactions. However, bankers point out that not all the credits are suitable, and the overall amount that could be in the short term is about L1,000bn, of which L340bn will come from the Stet deal. IRI has a number of cash-rich subsidiaries which could be used for similar exercises. One obvious candidate is Sirti, the network engineering arm of Stet, which has a cash pool of about L1,000bn.</p>

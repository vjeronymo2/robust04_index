On August 2, 1994, the Commission adopted a Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making (FNPRM) in CC Docket No. 93&hyph;22 (released August 31, 1994; FCC 94&hyph;200) proposing changes to rules governing the provision of information services through 800 numbers and pursuant to a presubscription or comparable arrangement. The proposed amendments are intended to protect consumers from apparently fraudulent and deceptive practices associated with the provision of these services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The Commission's rules governing interstate pay-per-call and information services were adopted in 1993 to implement the Telephone Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act of 1992, 47 CFR 228 (TDDRA). The TDDRA requires that most interstate information services must be offered exclusively through telephone numbers beginning with the 900 service access code and generally prohibits the use of 800 numbers to provide information services. However, under the statute, 800 numbers may be used to provide information services pursuant to a presubscription or comparable arrangement. In an effect to control potential abuses of the presubscription provisions, the Commission explicitly defined presubscription as a contractual agreement between an information provider (IP) and a fully informed caller who agrees to purchase information services under the terms and conditions offered by the IP. Nonetheless, complaints before the Commission indicate that IPs are apparently charging telephone subscribers for calls placed to 800 numbers without ascertaining that the subscriber who is charged is, in fact, the caller who agreed to purchase the service. IPs apparently read the Automatic Number Identification (ANI) of the originating telephone line to charge the call to the subscriber to that line without regard to whether the subscriber has placed the call. The Commission expressed particular concern that such practices threaten the public perception of 800 numbers as being toll-free, a perception and reality that Congress clearly sought to maintain through the TDDRA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The Commission thus proposed to adopt more stringent requirements governing the establishment of presubscription arrangements and the use of 800 numbers to provide information services. Specifically, &sect;64.1504 would be amended to state explicitly that the rule protects not only callers to 800 numbers, but also subscribers whose telephone lines may be used to place calls to 800 number information services. In addition, &sect;64.1504(b) would prohibit the use of 800 numbers to connect callers to any information service that is not provided under a presubscription or comparable arrangement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The Commission also proposed to modify the definition of a presubscription or comparable arrangement contained in &sect;64.1501(b) to require that such arrangements be established only with a legally competent individual and executed in writing, unless charges are authorized to a credit or charge card generally accepted for the purchase of consumer goods, entertainment, travel, and lodging. Section 64.1510(b) would be amended to prohibit common carriers from billing subscribers for presubscribed information services without evidence of the written agreement. The amendment would also require common carriers to address bills assessing presubscribed information services charges only to the individual who entered into the presubscription agreement. Finally, carriers performing billing services for IPs would be required, without exception, to separate charges for presubscribed information services from charges for telecommunications services and to display for each information service charge: (1) The type of service and the service provider's name and business telephone number; (2) the telephone number actually called; (3) the amount of the charge; (4) the date and time of the call; and (5) for calls billed on a time-sensitive basis, the duration of the call. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The Commission recognized that these proposals would impose new burdens on both common carriers and IPs that have not engaged in the abuses described above but, nonetheless, concluded that these burdens are outweighed by the need to protect subscribers from bills for services that neither sought nor received. The Commission encouraged parties opposing the proposals to identify and quantify, with specificity, any expected burdens and to describe alternative means of protecting consumers. Finally, the Commission urged interested parties to discuss whether the proposed rules adequately protect consumers or whether other measures are necessary to guard against deception and evasion by IPs, particularly when an IP and common carrier are commonly owned or have close business ties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

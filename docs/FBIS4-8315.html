			<p>BFN     [Text] Vidin, April 12 (BTA) -- The representatives of the  Bulgarian state institutions controlling the implementation of  sanctions along the Danube and the officials of the Western  European Union [WEU] ended their formal meeting.    The participants focussed on the measures that would ensure  efficient control over the application of sanctions along the  Danube and specified the actions which the teams of the WEU and  the Bulgarian institutions should take in case of embargo  busting, BTA was told by Vasko Vasilev, deputy head of the Vidin  Customs.    The representatives of Bulgaria and the WEU shared the  opinion that each specific conflict should be resolved by  peaceful means in order to protect the population and the  population centres and prevent any environmental disaster along  the river.    It was agreed that a similar meeting should be held in  Bucharest, where the WEU representatives would talk with  Romania's governmental commission to specify the actions to be  taken in a case of embargo busting and their coordination by the  Bulgarian, Romanian and WEU teams.</p>

			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH  </P> <P> While the Japanese stock market averages move up and down chaotically, U.S.  stocks continue to hold their own on low volume, said Irving Katz, director of  research at Thomas Green/San Diego Securities.  </P> <P> The time is drawing near for U.S. companies to release their first quarter  earnings, and expectations are that many of them will report a decline in  profits, Katz said.  </P> <P> As a result, American stocks continued to show little change in price.  </P> <P> San Diego stocks seem to be dividing into two tiers, with the only major  movements of one point or more, up or down, being made by the stocks of larger  companies that have attracted institutional investors. In contrast, smaller  capitalization stocks are hardly moving in price, Katz said.  </P> <P> On the upside this week were: Magma Power, gaining back the $2 it lost the  previous week; Xytronyx, up $1.375, and Chart House Enterprises and Cubic  Corp., each up $1.25.  </P> <P> On the downside, Price Co. stock reacted to its recently reported flat  second-quarter earnings, dropping $2; Rohr Industries, one of the unfavored  defense stocks was down $1.875, and HomeFed Corp., Maxwell Laboratories and  Molecular Biosystems, each were down $1 .  </P> <P> New lows were recorded this week by Advanced Marketing Services at $5.75;  Agouron Pharmaceuticals at $8, and Synbiotics at $3.125.  </P> <P> A good gain was made by Beeba's Creations, up $.375 after reporting excellent  second-quarter earnings of $.27 per share, versus $.22 for the comparable  quarter last year.  </P> <P> Computer &amp; Communications Technology (CCT) was the largest percentage  gainer of the week, gaining $.375 to close at $.875 as it announced it would  merge with Sunward Technologies, a private company. Sunward will own 55% of the  outstanding stock of the combined companies.  </P></p>

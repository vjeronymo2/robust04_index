			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Angolan rivals still battling for Huambo ANGOLAN army troops and rebels are still fighting for control of Huambo, despite an announcement by the government that Unita leader Jonas Savimbi's stronghold had been captured and he had fled, Reuter reports from Luanda. The state daily newspaper, Jornal de Angola, reported yesterday that Unita forces still controlled residential areas of the city, where most of its leaders lived. Unita's radio station said the group's entire leadership was still in Huambo, a provincial capital 500km south-east of Luanda. 'Government forces are still under fire and have sustained heavy human and material losses,' it said. An army communique on Saturday said government troops had captured Mr Savimbi's headquarters and his supporters were fleeing. There was no independent word on Mr Savimbi's whereabouts.</p>

			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GAY LIBERATION  </P> <P> Two July 1 book reviews -- of "Coming Out Under Fire" by Allen Berube, and  "Better Angel" by Forman Brown -- call for comment:  </P> <P> To state that "The Mattachine Society . . . was formed by a group of veterans  in 1950" omits those who were not veterans. Careful study of that important  development must wait for thorough examination of the 25 file drawers of  Mattachine Society records in ONE's Baker Memorial Library and Archives.  </P> <P> The delightful account of "Better Angel" not only is valuable in its own right  but by dating from 1933 has recorded how much liberated thinking had been going  on long before World War II.  </P> <P> W.

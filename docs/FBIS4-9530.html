			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 27 Apr--According to Marek Pol, minister of  industry and trade, the miners' strike is politically motivated.  The condition for the strike to be discontinued was the  annulment of the decision on the transformation of mines into  holding companies. This had taken place, but the strikers had  put forward further demands, Pol said on Polish Radio Three on  Wednesday.    The industry minister stressed that he had decided to annul  Decision No. 30 [on setting up holding companies] after talks  with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak, who shares his opinion that  transformations to modernize the economy are necessary. The  minister also hopes that the workforce in the striking mines  will come to this conclusion.    Marek Pol said that it was not possible to prepare a  schedule  for resolving strikers' demands in 48 hours. The fulfilment of  the demands from the mining sector by the government would mean  that the state is being run by the trade union, and "such a  situation is not considered normal anywhere in the world."    The minister blamed the union for causing the deterioration  of moods among the miners because the unions passed on  incomplete information to the workforce of the mines about the  conditions for transforming the industry. According to Pol,  information about conditions should reach each miner  individually.</p>

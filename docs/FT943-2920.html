			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Weatherstone hands over Morgan reins Sir Dennis Weatherstone, chairman and chief executive of JP Morgan, will retire at the end of this year after five years in which the US institution has transformed itself into a leading international investment bank. Sir Dennis' retirement after he turns 64 in November, and the appointment in his place of Mr Douglas Warner, who is 48, comes a year earlier than expected. Analysts and rivals said the timing did not appear to be the result of internal dissent. Mr Warner, who has been the bank's president since the start of 1990, had been expected to take over. The transition, which Sir Dennis described as 'boringly uneventful', had been planned for some time. He added: 'I am very healthy, very happy. The bank is in very good shape.' Wall Street yesterday complimented Sir Dennis for JP Morgan's advances in investment banking. The past year, though, has seen Morgan's reputation sullied by its entanglement with Banesto, the Spanish bank taken over by the Bank of Spain last year. 'With the benefit of hindsight it (the Banesto investment) doesn't look too good,' Sir Dennis said. 'I don't think it was our most glorious moment . . . But it was a long-term investment, and we realised it was high-risk. We're not going to go through our business and not make any mistakes, anywhere.' He said investors in Morgan's Corsair fund, which invested in Banesto, may yet do 'very nicely' out of the deal. Mr Warner fits the Ivy League mould of Morgan executives better than Sir Dennis, a Briton who left school at the age of 15. Mr Warner, educated at Yale, has been with the bank throughout his career. He ran the bank's London operations in the late 1980s. In the past five years he has been involved more on internal matters as chief operating officer. Austria's bank adviser, Page 24</p>

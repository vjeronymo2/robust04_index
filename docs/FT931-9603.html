			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Rothmans to merge Far East tobacco interests ROTHMANS International plans to merge its tobacco interests in Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong into a single regional company to strengthen its attack on the Far East's developing cigarette markets. The move would provide the new company, Rothmans of Pall Mall, capitalised at more than Pounds 1bn, with cash resources and management expertise to accelerate the exploitation of cigarette markets in China, Vietnam, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. In what Lord Swaythling, Rothmans International chairman, described yesterday as a 'constructive reconstruction,' the group would integrate its wholly owned Hong Kong-based interests with the operations in Malaysia and Singapore in which the group has a 50 per cent stake. The new company, with ownership equally divided between Rothmans International and public shareholders, would have an estimated Pounds 242m cash - currently held by the Malaysian and Singapore companies - to develop production, sales and distribution in the growth markets. Mr Nyren Scott-Malden, analyst at BZW, said yesterday: 'This is a clever plan which would bring more coherence to the Far East operations. It would enable the group to use the cash built up in the mature markets of Malaysia and Singapore to exploit the biggest growth markets in the world.' The Hong Kong subsidiary has rights to the markets in China, which accounts for a third of world cigarette consumption with 1,700bn cigarettes a year, Japan (320bn), South Korea (96bn), Hong Kong and Taiwan. The Singapore company has access to markets in Thailand, with consumption of 40bn cigarettes a year, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Burma. Rothmans International has already invested heavily in the Hong Kong-based development. Trading losses of Pounds 16m, reflecting the establishment of distribution networks and marketing costs, were written off last year. Lord Swaythling said: 'It takes a long time to turn developing markets into profit. We believe that this plan would quicken the process by using the full management and cash resources available in the region.' The merger will require the approval of public shareholders who hold 50 per cent of the Malaysian and Singapore companies, as well as that of regulatory authorities in Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia. Establishment of the new organisation, to be incorporated in Bermuda and managed from Hong Kong, is expected to take at least nine months. The company would seek listings on the Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore stock exchanges. Directors would be drawn mainly from the present Malaysian and Singapore boards and regional executives would play an active role in developing the group. Rothmans Malaysia, capitalised at MDollars 3bn (Pounds 800m), made pre-tax profits last year of MDollars 326.6m on sales of MDollars 1.1bn Rothmans Singapore achieved pre-tax profits of SDollars 48.3m (Pounds 20m) on sales of SDollars 161m in the nine months to March 1992. It is capitalised at SDollars 750m. Rothmans International said yesterday that the merger would result in some initial dilution in the earnings attributable to public shareholders in the present Far East companies but should enhance the potential for future growth. 'The expected financial strength of the new company would be such to indicate that a higher pay-out of dividends should be appropriate in future,' it added.</p>

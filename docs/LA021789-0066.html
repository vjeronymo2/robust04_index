			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SANTA CLARITA SCHOOL TAX DEAD;  </P> <P> STATE HIGH COURT REFUSES TO HEAR DISTRICTS' APPEAL  </P> <P> Santa Clarita Valley school officials expressed disappointment and frustration  Thursday after the state Supreme Court let stand a lower court ruling that  voided a special tax on new development to build schools.  </P> <P> "Obviously I'm not happy," said Clyde Smyth, superintendent of the William S.  Hart Union High School District, one of five valley districts that had hoped to  collect millions of dollars from the tax, which was overwhelmingly approved by  voters in 1987.  </P> <P> The tax, roughly $6,300 on each new home, was declared unconstitutional by a  state Court of Appeal in November. A three-judge panel said it was illegal  because it unfairly applied only to future residents of the Hart, Newhall,  Castaic, Saugus and Sulphur Springs school districts.  </P> <P> The appellate court also said the tax exceeded a state limit on developer fees.  State law allows districts to collect $1.50 per square foot on new homes for  school construction.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Court Refusal  </P> <P> The Supreme Court refused Thursday to hear the districts' challenge to the  appellate decision.  </P> <P> Sandie Loberg, president of the Hart board of trustees, said the Supreme Court  failed to respect the voters' wishes. "I think the voters made a statement in  this community," she said. "I find it extremely discouraging."  </P> <P> The court's decision leaves the valley's schools with few funding alternatives,  Loberg said. "Where it goes from here I don't know," she said.  </P> <P> School officials estimate that the valley will need $210 million by 2000 to  build four high schools, four junior high schools and five elementary schools  to absorb more than 15,000 new students. Present enrollment is about 22,000  students.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Hart trustees said the valley's school districts may have to ask  residents to tax themselves to pay for new schools in the rapidly growing  region. The Supreme Court's decision will obviously force the districts to  consider such a tax proposal seriously, Smyth said.  </P> <P> A school tax would require two-thirds approval to pass, he added.  </P> <P> Moreover, the Santa Clarita City Council recently agreed to place a tax measure  on the November ballot to raise money for new roads. That proposal, which would  increase annual property tax bills between $75 and $200, must be approved by  the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors to reach the ballot.  </P> <P> The tax on new development, although struck down Thursday, funneled some funds  into Santa Clarita Valley's schools.  </P> <P> While some developers refused to pay the tax pending the outcome of the lawsuit  by the California Building Industry Assn., other developers paid it, agreeing  not to seek a refund if the tax were declared unconstitutional. The Hart  district alone received $10.5 million from four developers building new homes  in the valley.  </P></p>

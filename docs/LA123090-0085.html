			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WAIT IN LINE  </P> <P> In your "Anti-Immigrant Sentiment Protested" article of Dec. 10, you only once  stated that the two major groups trying to bring the border problem to  attention in Washington, D.C., are concerned about "illegal immigration," not  those who do the paperwork and wait in line like other honest citizens of all  nations of the world.  </P> <P> I give "open arms" to any immigrant who enters this country through the border  checkpoints for people, autos, aircraft or ships.  </P> <P> Anyone entering this country illegally, I support giving the chance to plead  his or her case to the government as to why he or she had to enter the country  illegally.  </P> <P> But I also support the right of this nation to throw out all those who fail to  register with the U.S. government after they enter illegally or after a hearing  are found without a defense in why they should be allowed to stay in this  country when millions of other honest citizens of all nations of the world wait  in line.  </P> <P> LT.

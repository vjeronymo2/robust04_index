			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / Arts: Today's Television There is surprisingly little opera on television these days, considering how popular it is supposed to have become in the last few years. (I suspect too much significance has been attributed to that single snatch of 'Turandot' used in the World Cup sig tune, yet opera surely is more popular). But today brings the real thing: Otello (7.25 BBC2), live from Covent Garden with Domingo in the title role, Kiri Te Kanawa as Desdemona, and Sergei Leiferkus making his debut in the role of Iago. The occasion, sponsored by Boeing, is particularly special since it marks the 80th birthday of Sir Georg Solti who conducts at the Royal Opera House in the presence of the Prince and Princess of Wales. The work is sung in Italian with English subtitles. In the interval (about 8.40) Jeremy Isaacs, director of the Opera House, talks to Solti about his career. C4's arts magazine Without Walls (9.00) ends its sequence about sexuality with Howard Schuman examining claims that DH Lawrence was a homosexual. The second half is devoted to 1961: the year of the E-type Jaguar. Omnibus (10.25 BBC1) provides a profile of artist Avigdor Arikha whose work has progressed from abstract to figurative.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     INCS Inc. (3-2-1 Sakado Takatsu-ku Kawasaki City, president  Shinjiro Yamada, Tel. 044-819-2419) has developed software that  makes it possible to use data measured by CT scans for rapid  prototyping (RP). It has begun a service using that RP system to  create solid models of skulls using light-hardened resin. Price:  &yen;150,000 each. Light-hardened resin models of skulls are  beginning to be used in simulations meant to improve results of  neurosurgery which requires high levels of technical skills.  INCS entered this field in anticipation of increased demand. In  January 1994 INCS will introduce a service using CT data to  produce NC data for processing the ceramics appetite [sic] in  areas deficient in skull and so on.    Skull models made by RP can be very useful when they are  used  prior to neurosurgery for decisions on surgical order and for  practice in cutting open and removal using instruments just as  in actual surgery.    The newly developed software adjusts for data lost due to CT  scans measuring in two millimeter intervals. When CT scan data  is sent to INCS, its model creation service will do everything  from adjusting data to building models. It has already done this  for Keio University Hospital.    D-MEC (Chuo-ku Tokyo), a company 100%-owned by Japan  Synthetic Rubber, also has a skull model creation service and  makes 100 per year. In October the Central Social Insurance  Conference (an advisory body of the Central Medical Association  and the Minister of Health and Welfare) recognized the ``Plan  for Surgery Based on Life-Sized Solid Models of Intestines'' --  a plan submitted by two medical institutions (including Keio  University Hospital) for consideration of pre-surgery diagnosis  and surgical planning using life-sized solid models -- as a new  advanced form of medical treatment. Accordingly, it is  anticipated that demand for RP models of skulls will increase.    Process data on appetite in deficient portions of skulls is  revised on the basis of CT scan data and is created after being  transferred to CAM (computer aided manufacturing). Thus RP  technology can be used from diagnosis to treatment.</p>

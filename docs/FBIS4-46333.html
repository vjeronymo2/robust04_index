			<p>Bomb  <H4>    Daily Views Malaysia, Iran Role </H4>  <F P=102> BK0806131694 </F> <F P=103> BK0806131694 </F> <F P=104></F>    BFN     [Editorial Report] Bangkok MATICHON in Thai on 8 June  carries an editorial on the arrest by Thai police of three  Iranian suspects in the foiled attempt to car-bomb the Israeli  Embassy in March.    MATICHON's 800-word, page 2 editorial is entitled: "The  Arrest of C-4 Bomb Suspects." It urges the police to prove that  the three arrested suspects are real terrorists and not just  scapegoats. "Since the suspects are foreigners listed as members  of international terrorist groups, the government should, in  order to give more weight to the arrest, seek cooperation from  the Malaysian Government for more information on the suspects as  it was found that they once lived in Malaysia. Cooperation from  Malaysia would enhance Thailand's credibility in doing justice  to the arrested terrorists," MATICHON says. It also wants the  government to contact Iran on the issue. "Iran is another  country which should be able to supply Thailand with information  about the suspects who hold Iranian passports," says the  editorial. It adds: "Anyway, we cannot expect much from Iran  since it is natural that Iran would rather be cautious and try  to demonstrate that it has nothing to do with activities by  international terrorist groups."    The paper stresses it cannot accept the fact that terrorists  have chosen to carry out their operations in Thailand. "The  Thai Government must make it clear to the parties fighting in  this century-old war of genocide that they cannot carry out  sabotage in this country thus exposing the Thai people to  danger. If they want to fight with each other to the last of  their men, let them do that somewhere else, not in Thailand,"  the paper says. It adds that the Thai Government must also make  that policy known to those countries which support international  terrorism, and have them relay the message to terrorists not to  come to Thailand.</p>

			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: High street demolition Kingfisher's results last week showed clearly how the new accounting standards will cut retailers' profits. Until now companies could revalue properties in their balance sheets, and also count the full difference between the original purchase price and the disposal price as a profit. Companies conveniently did well both ways. Property revaluations strengthened the balance sheet while disposal gains flattered the profit and loss account. Now profits - or losses - are measured on the difference between carrying cost in the balance sheet and sale price. For Kingfisher the change turned a profit of Pounds 20.6m on property in 1991-92 into a loss of Pounds 11.4m. The problem particularly affects groups with large long-standing property holdings. Woolworth's high street stores and Sears' shoe shops are good examples. Indeed, Sears is the retailer most affected by the change. It realised property gains of Pounds 92m in 1991 and 1992 - some 40 per cent of reported profits. Those profits will be substantially lower when restated on the new basis. Sears' decision to cut its dividend last year thus looks to have been all the more inevitable given that the payment was not even covered before the change. Large investors have in the main stripped out such profits from their calculations. Smaller investors may be more shocked by the change - however much companies try to pretend that it is merely technical. Other sectors may also be in for a surprise. The brewing and leisure sectors have similar property portfolios, yet the full significance of the change does not yet appear to have sunk in.</p>

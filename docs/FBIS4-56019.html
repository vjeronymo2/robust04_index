			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Mariya Tsenkova from the National </F> Assembly]    [Text] This is an Assembly session that will be decisive  for the government. At the beginning of today's session Filip  Dimitrov, leader of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS], made a  statement on behalf of his faction in which he asked Prime  Minister Berov to resign. An attempt to repeat the  no-confidence vote will be viewed by the SDS deputies as a  violation of the Constitution. If this is allowed it will  represent a danger for Bulgaria's democracy, Dimitrov said.    Replying to the statement, Velko Vulkanov of the Bulgarian  Socialist Party [BSP] demanded that the 19 May vote on  structural and personnel changes in the government be annulled,  and asked National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov to  resign for what Vulkanov described as a violation of  parliamentary practice.    BSL leader Zhan Videnov assured the hall -- the SDS deputies  and Aleksandur Yordanov had already walked out -- that there  will be a debate on the draft resolution proposed by the  government on a framework agreement with parliament.    The political forces that support the cabinet are now  holding  consultations at the invitation of Prime Minister Berov, who  still has not come to the National Assembly. It appears that  the Movement for Rights and Freedoms [DPS] will participate in  the consultations. The deputies of the New Alliance for  Democracy [NSD] are divided. Part of them will probably  participate in the consultations, while others demand separate  talks with the prime minister.</p>

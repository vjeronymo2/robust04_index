For pregnant women who were examined at the  hospital it was found that 7 percent had the AIDS virus. There  were many that were not examined by the hospital, and it was  thought that the figure might be higher than this.    Dr. Anan said the reason for the increased spread of AIDS in  the seven provinces of the lower South was that there was still  little awareness of AIDS prevention in any group. The use of  female prostitutes caused more and more wives to acquire the  virus from their husbands. Changing the custom of using  prostitutes, if it were possible, would reduce the incidence of  AIDS. [passage omitted]</p>

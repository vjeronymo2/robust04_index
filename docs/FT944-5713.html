			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Army set to privatise its support vehicle fleet The armed forces' fleet of 95,000 support vehicles is to be operated by the private sector, with the military paying for the vehicles by the hour. Mr Roger Freeman, the defence procurement minister, said yesterday that he was committed to early action to move the fleet of non-combat Land Rovers, trucks, vans and cars into the private sector with a pilot study being conducted next year 'as a minimum'. The fleet will probably be sold to a private company and then leased back to the Ministry of Defence with the private contractor responsible for maintenance and replacement. The ministry had expected to spend about Pounds 450m replacing the fleet over the next 10 years, but this will now be done by the private sector with the MoD paying an annual fee to use the vehicles. However, Mr Freeman was lukewarm about a similar recent proposal from British Aerospace to refurbish and operate the Royal Air Force's ageing Hercules transport aircraft fleet and to charge the MoD for its use by the hour. He said: 'Leasing military aircraft is more difficult and there are many other factors to take into account.' Leasing of non-combat vehicles has been championed by the RAF which has been accused of dragging its heels over previous 'market-testing' initiatives involving the private sector. However, the idea has been opposed by the army, which has a much larger vehicle fleet. Mr Freeman said that once the pilot was completed 'it would be natural for the support fleet to be managed on a tri-service basis'. The minister was speaking after a seminar in London yesterday to promote privatesector involvement in defence operations. The 'Competing for Quality' initiative is designed to get a minimum of Pounds 2.3bn, or about 10 per cent, of the MoD's current work done by private companies before the year 2000. Private involvement will range from joint ventures and management contracts to fullscale privatisation. Mr Freeman said: 'I don't see why we shouldn't get well beyond the Pounds 2.3bn target. Pushing on with vehicle leasing is one way of demonstrating clearly that we are serious about this.' Already on the list for market testing is the operation of the Royal Navy's tug and tanker fleet, the provision of logistics information systems to the army's quartermaster general, and engineering support for the RAF's Hawk jet trainers. The private ownership and operation of training aircraft could also be added to the market-testing list. So far companies have been reluctant to become involved, partly because they feel commercially sensitive information could be used against them. Mr Freeman said the MoD was designing more flexible ways for companies to make bids or suggestions without sacrificing secrecy.</p>

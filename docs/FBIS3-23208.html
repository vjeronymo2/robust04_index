Senator Fuad Char Abdala had just left the scene when  the bomb exploded. According to the polls, Fuad Char Abdala is  the Liberal Party candidate who will receive the most votes in  the 13 March legislative elections. Char Abdala had presided  over the closing ceremony for his political campaign at the  aforementioned location.    The "Rancho Tropical" in southern Barranquilla was destroyed  by the fire sparked by the bomb. Owner Guillermo Min told the  police that he had no enemies, thus he believes that the attack  was aimed at Char Abdala. The senator was the development  minister between 1988 and 1990 and now hopes to be reelected to  the Senate.    Fortunately the bomb was thrown 30 minutes after the  political event had ended, and the liberal leader's followers  had already left the scene. The five people who were injured  sustained minor cuts when several windows were broken. The  individuals were taken to a medical center, where it was  determined that none had suffered serious injuries.</p>

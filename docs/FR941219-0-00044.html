			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Though Grizzly Bay and lower Suisun Bay are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> important areas of delta smelt habitat, habitat conditions elsewhere in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Suisun Bay and upstream in the Estuary are just as important for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spawning, larval and juvenile transport, rearing and adult migration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Habitat for each life stage is essential for the recovery of the species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and is contained in this designation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 13:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter thought additional flow requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not be needed in July or August to protect larval and juvenile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delta smelt from being entrained in the State and Federal water projects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> since delta smelt remain in particular locations despite flow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service recognizes that juvenile and adult  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delta smelt, when given the opportunity, may remain in especially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> productive areas such as Suisun Bay, after the mixing zone has moved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upstream. However, flows may be required in the July-August period to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protect delta smelt present in the south and central Delta from being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entrained in the State and Federal projects, and to avoid jeopardy to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 14:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One respondent noted that the distribution of delta  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smelt is not determined by flow alone. The commenter cited 1993 tow-net  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and fall midwater trawl collections that found delta smelt upstream of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the mixing zone near Decker Island, and found delta smelt considerably  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> downstream of the mixing zone in Suisun Bay.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service agrees that the distribution of delta  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smelt is not based exclusively on flow. When delta smelt are located in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suitable, productive habitat, they may not travel with the mixing zone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as it moves upstream, or downstream. After being transported to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> productive rearing habitat, delta smelt may remain and take advantage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safe and productive nursery areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Delta smelt do not become ``trapped'' in the mixing zone, but may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remain in particular areas. In the text of the final rule, the Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clarifies this point by referring to the salt and freshwater mixing area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as the ``mixing zone,'' rather than the ``entrapment zone,'' to clear any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> misconception that delta smelt and other estuarine species are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated exclusively or somehow become trapped within the vertical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circulation currents created by the saltwater-freshwater interface.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This type of circulation pattern is important because it mixes nutrients  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the ocean and inland areas, resulting in a productive estuarine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ecosystem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The pattern of delta smelt distribution described by the commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is consistent with distribution patterns in earlier years when dispersal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of delta smelt was greater following wetter springs (Sweetnam and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Stevens 1993). In 1993, about half the delta smelt population remained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Suisun Bay throughout the summer, even though the 2 ppt isohaline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retreated upstream (Herbold 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 15:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter objected to the Service's use of EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed water quality standards as the factual and scientific basis for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the delta smelt's critical habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service has not based critical habitat for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the delta smelt on EPA's water quality standards. Space requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for delta smelt population growth, cover, and shelter, as well as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> salinity, were described in detail and were included as primary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constituent elements in the proposed rule to designate critical habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the delta smelt in 1991, well before EPA promulgated its proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards. Since 1991, the EPA and the Service have been working  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> together to coordinate each agencies' actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 16:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Another commenter thought the Service simply identified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the delta smelt's entire geographic range as critical habitat without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considering whether the designation was essential to the conservation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the species. Other respondents believed the Service did not distinguish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between areas of critical habitat that are essential and nonessential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the conservation of the delta smelt, thereby including marginal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas not necessary for delta smelt recovery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service agrees that critical habitat is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited to the specific areas within the geographic area that contain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the physical and biological features needed by the species. As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed in more detail at comment 37, below, the Service has described  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> river, channel, slough and bay water habitats essential for the recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the smelt. Without these areas of habitat, the delta smelt cannot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survive or reproduce, rear, or be transported between other suitable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Neither the Act or its regulations requires the Service to rank or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identify areas of habitat that are more ``essential'' than others when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical habitat is designated. In the ``Primary Constituent Elements'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section of this rule, the Service has specifically described the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importance of habitat for each life stage of this annual species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Without adequate habitat for each of these life stages, the delta smelt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not survive or recover. The Service may highlight and propose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific management actions to protect and rehabilitate certain areas in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the recovery planning process, such as areas in Cache Slough and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lower Sacramento River complex identified by one commenter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the Service did not simply designate critical habitat based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the entire geographic range of the delta smelt. At the time the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service expanded the critical habitat boundary in 1994, larval delta  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smelt had been located as far north as the confluence of the Sacramento  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> River with the Feather River. This area was not included in the revised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed critical habitat boundary. Based on recent unpublished data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (and brought to our attention in a comment), delta smelt in these most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upstream observations may have been misidentified as pond smelt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hypomesus nipponensis,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> or wakasagi). Portions of San Pablo Bay, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Napa River, and western Suisun Marsh known to support the species are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not included in the critical habitat designation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, California Department of Fish and Game biologists  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contacted the Service with new information that in 1993, delta smelt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were found spawning as far upstream as Sacramento. Based on this new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information and the importance of this spawning habitat in some years,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Service expanded critical habitat in the 1994 proposal to extend to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these important areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 17:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter thought the Service did not identify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas currently occupied by the smelt.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Delta smelt presently occur throughout the range  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designated as critical habitat. Delta smelt also occur outside the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legal boundary of the Delta, in the Sacramento, San Joaquin, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mokelumne rivers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 18:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One respondent questioned the need for critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat, since delta smelt populations had increased seven-fold in 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

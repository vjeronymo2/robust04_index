			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Renaud Girard report: "Red Carpet for Qian Qichen"] </F>   [Excerpts] The French Government of cohabitation did  everything in its power for Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen  who arrived in Paris on Saturday [22 January] morning for a  three-day official visit.    The man who has the rank of vice premier in Beijing had  access to all hierarchical levels of French diplomatic  decisionmaking: The Elysee [presidential residence] and then  the Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry] the day before yesterday,  and the Hotel Matignon [prime minister's office] this morning.  In addition, to complete the success of his visit, Mr. Qian  Qichen will give a luncheon at his embassy in avenue George-V  for U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, himself on an  official visit to Paris.    Saturday's talks were "constructive and positive, in a very  warm atmosphere," according to the Chinese delegation spokesman.  In diplomatic language, when the expression "frank exchange of  views" is not used it means that no unpleasant subject was  raised. The Tibet, Hong Kong, and Taiwan questions were not  raised.    With regard to respect for human rights in China, the French  leaders showed much greater discretion than they had four or  five years ago, the time when the republic invited the students  who had escaped from the Tienanmen Square massacre and the  ensuing police repression to hold a march on the Champs-Elysees.    [French Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe, for whom "France does  not use double-talk," nonetheless expressed the hope that  China's economic progress will be accompanied by progress in the  sphere of human rights. [passage omitted]    During a wide-ranging "review" of major international  issues,  Mr. Juppe and Mr. Qian Qichen discussed the situation in Bosnia  at length. The Chinese minister must not have been particularly  embarrassed, because Beijing, despite its seat as a permanent  member of the UN Security Council, has always carefully kept out  of the numerous abortive Western attempts to end the Serbian  aggression against Sarajevo.    The former Yugoslavia is a very long way from China for  which  the best policy in the Balkans is still abstention.  Nonetheless, the French minister expressed the hope that the  big powers will be more committed to supporting the Twelve's  plan for Bosnia -- which is consistent with the Owen-Stoltenberg  UN plan for a partition of the young republic into three  ethnically homogeneous areas.    The UN Security Council is a real possible sphere of  agreement for Chinese and French foreign policy. According to a  French official, the two ministers "agreed that a reform of the  Council was necessary to take account of the changes which have  taken place in the world since 1945, but that, at the same time,  it was necessary to maintain the current status of the permanent  members." Indeed, without daring to say it openly, France and  China are opposed to the expansion of the Council to new  permanent members.    Beijing has no desire to see Tokyo -- its hereditary enemy  and rival -- gaining political influence equivalent to its own.  Paris (like London) has always given a cool reception to the  idea of giving up its right of veto to a Europe whose political  efficacy still has to be demonstrated. It is therefore probably  in New York that the first fruits of the Franco-Chinese  "normalization" will be produced.</p>

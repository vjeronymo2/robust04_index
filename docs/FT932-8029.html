			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / International Company News: Japanese textile groups under pressure KURABO Industries, a leading Japanese textile company, reported an 87.5 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Y230m (Dollars 2.1m) for the year to March, reflecting the harsh times facing the industry, which is under assault from imports from China and other Asian countries. Sales fell 9.6 per cent to Y130.5bn. The company is hoping profits will increase to Y500m this year, butadmits that sales will be flat. A rationalisation programme will continue. The company is attempting to diversify into areas such as information systems and chemicals, but the slowing of the Japanese economy has put these businesses under extreme pressure. Meanwhile Shikibo, a cotton spinner, reported a pre-tax loss of Y4.4bn, less than the previous period's loss of Y5.4bn, but another sign of the distress in the industry, which is pressing the government to impose controls on imports. Six members of the Shikibo board have resigned and new heads appointed for its property, textile, industrial material, and business development divisions. The board was cut from 14 to 10 members. Sales were down 11.8 per cent to Y68.4bn, and are forecast to fall further to Y64bn this year. A pre-tax loss of Y3bn is expected.</p>

			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / College 'efficiency' revealed OXFORD University and Imperial College, London, are among the 10 universities which make the highest call on public funds per student, according to figures published yesterday. Tables produced for the Higher Education Funding Council for England, published in The Times Higher Education Supplement, show the amounts received by higher education establishments. The figures are meant as a broad indicator of efficiency, but they make no attempt to take quality into account. They suggest, however, that new universities, which converted from polytechnics last year, do not deliver their service significantly more cheaply than older universities. The 10 costliest general higher education bodies include six former polytechnics, five of them in Greater London, two colleges of London University (Imperial and Birkbeck), and Oxford and Essex universities. The most efficient spender was Chester College of Higher Education, while the rest of the top 10 included four former polytechnics, three other higher education colleges, and two 'old' universities. Among further education colleges, the most expensive higher education courses were provided by the City of Westminster College, followed by Westminster College, London, and Hounslow Borough College. The cheapest further education college was Cordwainers, in Hackney, London, followed by Worcester and Herefordshire technology colleges. St Bartholomew's Hospital in London, which is threatened with closure in the autumn, is shown to be the most efficient specialist institution, while the most expensive were the Royal Academy of Music and the Royal College of Art. The council intends to publish details of relative costs for each subject next week, but does not intend to publish the broader league table. The council added that it was not yet fully confident the figures took all factors of efficiency into account, which was why it had not wanted to publish them, but said they were the 'best shot yet' at measuring efficiency. Members of the council's performance-indicators working party suggested that funds from other sources should be taken into account, The Times Higher Education Supplement said.</p>

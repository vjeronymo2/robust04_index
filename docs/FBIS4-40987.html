			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: correspondents Igor </F> Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] Russia's Foreign Ministry believes that if Iraq  formally declared respect for Kuwait's sovereignty and  recognized the demarcated frontier, the chances of lifting the  international sanctions against Baghdad would look brighter, a  senior Russian diplomat told an Interfax interviewer on Tuesday.    He stressed that these sanctions could not last forever and  would have to be dropped sooner or later best of all by  civilized means.    In his words, "even now there is an explicit erosion of the  sanctions." "For instance, there is evidence of the Turks  siphoning oil from the oil pipe-line, going from Iraq. In other  words, an appropriate process is underway, and the world  community should take it under control," he said.    He argues that the UN Security Council should set a  six-month  term for monitoring Iraq's compliance with the Security  Council's resolution. "Even now one can say that Baghdad has  fulfilled the UN Security Council's resolution 687 on  disarmament in full. After this term, the UN Security Council  could discuss the possibility of lifting or softening the  sanctions. The Security Council imposed them, and it was for it  to abolish them," the diplomat stressed.</p>

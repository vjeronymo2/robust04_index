			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / International Company News: Mannesmann knocked by telephone network costs MANNESMANN, the German engineering group, yesterday said that profits on continuing operations dropped by almost a half to DM339m (Dollars 212m) from DM625m last year. This was about a third of the DM1bn net profits which the group made in 1990. At the parent company, net profits dropped to DM244m from DM389m. Mannesmann blamed the drop in profits on the costs of setting up its mobile telephone network. It said it would cut its dividend from the DM9 per share paid in 1991 to DM6. As already announced, turnover rose to DM28bn last year from DM24.3bn in 1991. Mannesmann said that the costs of developing the telephone network were DM340m last year, up from DM235m in the previous year. Further details were not disclosed, but the group has said that its steel tubes, trading and vehicles components divisions were all loss-making last year. The engineering and plant business made profits, while earnings from electrical and electronic engineering were unchanged. The figures benefited from a return to profitability at the group's Brazilian operations which had been in deficit for two years. The group's total order intake rose to DM27.8bn from DM25.3bn. The steep fall in profits reflects the worldwide fall in demand for capital goods as well as the German recession. Analysts criticised the company's aggressive move into the troubled car components sector. VDO Adolf Schindling, the components company bought in October 1991, this week announced it would be shedding 1,300 out of 8,300 jobs this year and would make substantial losses. Mannesmann's shares fell DM2.30 to close at DM249.20. Kaufhof Holding, one of Germany's biggest retailing groups, reported that profits rose by more than a third last year to DM222.4m. Turnover rose by 14.7 per cent to DM20.5bn. The group is proposing to pay an unchanged dividend of DM12 for each ordinary share and DM13 on its preference shares. Kaufhof gave no reasons for the profits expansion but in February attributed it to a strategy of expanding into high-growth niche markets, reducing its dependence on department stores.</p>

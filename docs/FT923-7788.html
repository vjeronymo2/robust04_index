			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Sterling Sterling's fall against the D-Mark has been slowed this week by the strength of the escudo and the peseta within the ERM. But at DM2.8155 it is now less than four pfennigs away from its absolute floor of DM2.7780. Perhaps more important psychologically is its proximity to the DM2.80 resistance point. Were it to breach that level, the market would begin to ask itself serious questions about the government's readiness to live up to its commitment to the DM2.95 central rate. There is, of course, no formal obligation on the authorities to do anything until the currency is at its absolute floor, but some in the market would be looking for a response if the divergence indicator against the Ecu reached minus 75 (it is now minus 71). Given the severity of the blow to confidence that would follow from a base rate rise, it is natural for the authorities to hold their fire. Pressure on sterling may yet abate, especially if the dollar manages to stage a recovery. The risk remains, however, that lack of official action will simply provoke the market into testing the absolute D-Mark floor. The task facing the authorities might be easier if the UK were not so hooked on base rates as an indicator. Continental central banks often seem more flexible in the range of signals they can send to the markets.</p>

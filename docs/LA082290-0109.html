			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CITY OKS AWARD OF 1ST ARENA CONTRACT, A CLUB PARKING LOT  </P> <P> The City Council voted 4 to 1 Tuesday to award the first construction contract  for the $100-million Anaheim Arena to Clayton Engineering Inc. of Laguna Hills.  </P> <P> The $335,000 contract was awarded to construct a temporary parking lot for the  Phoenix Club.  </P> <P> The club's existing parking lot will be the site of the arena construction.  </P> <P> The 20,000-seat sports arena will be developed and managed by the Ogden Corp.  of New York and owned by the city, under agreements signed by the City Council  in June.  </P> <P> The city of Santa Ana, in the meantime, is proceeding with plans to build a  similar arena. Both cities hope to attract basketball and hockey teams. Most  authorities agree that Orange County can support only one indoor sports arena.  </P> <P> Anaheim City Councilman Irv Pickler cast the dissenting vote against the  parking lot construction contract Tuesday.  </P> <P> "I feel we shouldn't be putting money out for those items. I've said this  before," he said.  </P> <P> Work on the temporary parking lot -- to be built east of the arena site -- is  scheduled to begin in September and be completed by Nov. 15. Officials hope to  complete the arena, to be located on Douglass Road, near Anaheim Stadium, by  the fall of 1992.  </P></p>

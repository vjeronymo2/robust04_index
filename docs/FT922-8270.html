			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Brazil plans radical tax devolution to states and cities THE Brazilian government will outline radical proposals this week to halve the number of federal taxes and shift responsibilities for many public services from the federal government towards states and municipalities, report Stephen Fidler and Christina Lamb in Braslia. The reforms, aimed to enable the government to balance its books consistently, are seen as crucial for the success of Brazil's economic stabilisation programme. Mr Ary Oswaldo Mattos Filho, co-ordinator of the Fiscal Reform Commission, said in an interview that the proposals will be presented across the country to mass public meetings throughout next month. The final version will go to Congress only after municipal elections in October. This means the government will have to continue to rely on tight monetary policy as its main weapon against inflation for at least the next six months. According to Mr Oswaldo, the main thrust of the reform will be to devolve greater responsibilities to the states and municipalities, transferring services such as health and education from the federal government. It would reduce the number of major taxes to eight from 15. Under the proposals, the federal government would raise taxes in two ways - via excise duties on items such as fuel, cars, tobacco, drink, electricity and telephones; and through income tax. It would also broaden the base and lower the rates of the current income tax, reducing heavy payroll taxes on companies, a focus of legal controversy. For the states, the main source of revenue would be value-added tax and, for municipalities, a property tax applied to rural and urban areas. Under the 1988 Constitution, about half of tax revenues is transferred to the states and muncipalities, but without clear definition of their responsibilities. 'We cannot reduce the transfer of funds but we can pass to them the jobs they could perform better', said Mr Oswaldo. 'At present, one cruzeiro leaving Braslia for schoolbooks has to go through so much bureaucracy that it is worth only a few cents by the time it reaches its destination.' He stressed that the planned decentralisation would 'improve efficiency and bring the citizen closer to the provider of services'. He believed it would be politically popular because mayors and governors could win electoral support for building and running good schools and hospitals.</p>

			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A COACH TO BASH ONE  </P> <P> I am only 26 and was not around for the birth of the now famous and widely  accepted "gutty little Bruins" notion, but I don't subscribe to it.  </P> <P> UCLA was 5-4-1 against USC in the 1980s, and three of the four losses were by a  total of nine points. The Bruins had an average margin of victory of 11.2  points in their five wins over USC.  </P> <P> I'm sorry to confuse USC fans with the facts, but UCLA had the upper hand in  the 1980s. I wish the "gutty little Trojans" better luck in the 1990s.  </P> <P> MICHAEL WEISS, Westwood  </P></p>

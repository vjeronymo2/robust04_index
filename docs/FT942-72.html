			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / International Company News: Senior creditors threaten to seize Trizec assets Trizec's senior creditors have threatened to seize the Canadian property developer's assets unless a group of recalcitrant junior debenture holders drops its opposition to a CDollars 1.3bn (USDollars 937.5m) debt restructuring plan. The junior debenture holders, led by three large US investment funds, are the only group holding up the proposed recapitalisation. However, even if they vote against the plan, their objections may be brushed aside by an Alberta court, whose approval is required for implementation. Under the plan, control of Trizec would pass from Toronto's Bronfman family to Horsham, the holding company controlled by Canadian entrepreneur Mr Peter Munk, and Argo Partnership, a limited partnership managed by New York financier Mr Gerald O'Connor. Horsham and Argo will together inject as much as CDollars 1bn into the company. Much of this will be used to provide a cash payment to creditors unwilling to accept Trizec securities. The senior debenture holders, led by Union Bank of Switzerland and including other European investors, noted in a court affidavit that, despite receiving less than all the principal and interest due to them, they had agreed to allow more than CDollars 100m to be distributed to junior debt holders. Votes on the restructuring plan are scheduled for next Tuesday and Wednesday. The senior debt-holders said they planned to enforce their security as quickly as possible, 'in the event that any class of stakeholders does not approve the plan by the requisite majority'.</p>

			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOLL ROAD WARRIOR;  </P> <P> WILL CALIFORNIANS PAY TO AVOID SNARLED FREEWAYS? LIBERTARIAN BOB POOLE IS  FIGHTING TO GIVE THEM THE CHANCE  </P> <P> IT'S A WARM, humid August morning at the Sacramento headquarters of Caltrans,  where a small group is meeting in a utilitarian conference room to discuss what  for California is a drastic idea: abandoning the state's exclusive reliance on  freeways in favor of a mix that includes private toll roads. Caltrans assistant  director Carl Williams, who is chairing this meeting, introduces Bob Poole to  his fellow committee members as the man who "fired my imagination on this."  </P> <P> By "this," Williams means a radical -- though as yet almost entirely  unpublicized -- plan passed by the California Legislature in June as part of  the governor's $18.5 billion transportation bill. It would authorize private  companies to build four demonstration tollways in the state: one in northern  California, one in the south and two up for grabs. Unlike conventional toll  roads of the sort seen for decades back East, or even three Orange County  public toll roads scheduled for completion in the mid '90s, these would be  financed entirely with private funds and operated by private corporations.  According to what investors are telling Williams in preliminary conversations,  charges would run around 20 cents per mile for roads and perhaps 75 cents per  mile for tunnels and bridges.  </P> <P> Wherever feasible, these tollways would also take advantage of new technology  that would allow drivers to attach a vehicle identification card the size of a  credit card to the inside of their windshields, where they could be read by  radio transmitter/receivers as the cars sailed up the on-ramps. Users might  then get a monthly toll bill (not unlike a utility bill) or have the fees  charged to to their credit cards.  </P> <P> Investors would have up to 35 years to recoup their investment and anticipated  profits, then the state would take over the toll facilities.  </P> <P> As Bob Poole sees it, such toll roads could eventually cover the most congested  areas of California, much as they have in Italy, France and Spain where,  according to Poole, some 5,000 miles of privately financed toll roads have been  built since WWII. Although the plan is still in its infancy, Caltrans expects  consortiums of investment bankers and construction firms to submit 30 to 100  proposals in the next year, including ones for a toll tunnel under Laurel  Canyon; a cars-only second deck on critical sections of the Ventura and San  Diego freeways; and a new bridge across San Francisco Bay near the Oakland  airport, with office buildings on its suspension towers. Construction on the  projects won't begin for another three years.  </P> <P> Not everyone is impressed by the tollway idea. Some see the unrestricted use of  freeways as an egalitarian issue, and feel that when it comes to freedom of  mobility, no one should have more of it than anyone else. And then there are  the practical objections. "We are overbuilt in highways already," says Stanley  Hart, a spokesman on transportation issues for the Sierra Club. "And anyone  investing in such a project ought to have his head examined." Why would anyone  pay to use a toll road if there was a freeway alternative? If it was up to him,  says Hart, "I'd put my money in CDs and say the hell with it."  </P> <P> SITTING BEHIND his desk at the Reason Foundation in Santa Monica, Bob Poole has  the straightforward honest rectitude of a graduate student in engineering.  Which is fitting, since he spends a good part of each day taking phone calls  from people asking advice on everything from contracting out municipal  street-sweeping services to privatizing the Tennessee Valley Authority.  </P> <P> For Poole, who takes credit for coining the word "privatization" in his 1980  book, "Cutting Back City Hall," all this is heady stuff. Back in the '70s,  libertarians like Poole were widely regarded as free-market fanatics who went  around wearing "Taxation is theft!" buttons and for whom life held no greater  joy than sitting up all night debating such matters as whether their  free-market philosophy gave them the moral right to oppose private ownership of  nuclear weapons.  </P> <P> But times have changed. The tax revolt of the '80s left many politicians so  traumatized by the shortage of tax dollars that they are now more open to  free-market alternatives. As a result, Poole, 45, who is both president of the  Reason Foundation and publisher of Reason magazine, gets calls from the White  House, federal transportation officials, assorted legislators, investment  bankers, former Drexel Burnham Wunderkind and alleged crook Michael Milken (the  featured speaker at the foundation's annual banquet this fall), and, most  satisfying of all, from the awkwardly named Caltrans Privatization Advisory  Steering Committee.  </P> <P> "It's a kind of vindication," says Poole, who presents his ideas in a low-key,  non-threatening manner. "Ten or 15 years ago, we felt like a voice crying in  the wilderness . . . And these days, we are saying basically the same kinds of  things and now we seem to be part of a worldwide trend."  </P> <P> FOR SOMEONE who hopes to fundamentally change the way the government conducts  its business, Poole is a reserved, private sort of guy. He builds model trains  in his spare time (there's a hand- lettered "Keep Out" sign on the door to his  train room in his Beverlywood home). When the master of ceremonies for the 20th  anniversary of Reason magazine went around last year trying to collect funny  anecdotes about Poole, he didn't come up with a single one -- which is not  surprising to Poole's colleagues. "Bob is not a warm fuzzy person," says former  Reason editor Marty Zupan. "He's the kind of person who gets excited by ideas."  </P> <P> And the most exciting idea he ever heard was the philosophy advanced by Ayn  Rand in the novel "Atlas Shrugged." Reading it during the early '60s while  studying mechanical engineering at MIT, Poole discovered a world that to him  seemed brilliantly clear, moral and above all, based on reason. After receiving  his master's degree in 1967, he got a job as a weapons-systems analyst at  Sikorsky Aircraft in Stratford, Conn., where he was dismayed to discover that  aerospace companies "were large bureaucracies and very dependent on government  contracts." Declining to spend the rest of his life in a room with 500 other  engineers "learning more and more about less and less," in 1969 Poole put his  money where his free-market ideology was and decided to try writing, submitting  an article on airline deregulation for a fledgling libertarian magazine called  Reason. Seeing it published "was very exciting," says Poole. "I said to myself,  'This beats the hell out of engineering.' "  </P> <P> Deciding on a new career in public policy, Poole applied to such think tanks as  the RAND Corp., the Hoover Institution and finally the General Research Corp.  of Santa Barbara, where he studied private alternatives to public services.  "What really got me," says Poole, "was the private fire department in  Scottsdale, Ariz. My God! That was damn impressive."  </P> <P> Poole took a first step toward founding his own think tank in the fall of 1970,  when with five other investors he bought Reason magazine from its founder, a  Boston College journalism student named Lanny Friedlander. Poole then spent the  next eight years publishing it out of his bedroom.  </P> <P> Despite the magazine's unwavering commitment to the free market, in the early  days the owners didn't know enough about marketing to run ads on the back  cover. And for a magazine aimed at a popular audience, their article titles  tended toward the arcane: "Counterintuitive Behavior of Social Systems" and  "Chicago Monetary Tradition in the Light of Austrian Theory."  </P> <P> Even so, circulation inched upward. Color was introduced. And in 1978, Reason  was incorporated into a nonprofit educational foundation. The only problem was,  by the mid-'80s, the foundation seemed to be floundering -- for a think tank  with national pretensions, Santa Barbara was too small.  </P> <P> There was an obvious alternative. In 1986, Poole brought Reason to Los Angeles.  Despite some initial misgivings about living in a purported intellectual black  hole, Poole and his wife (a budget analyst in the UCLA chancellor's office),  quickly discovered that Los Angeles was the place to be.  </P> <P> The foundation's budget increased from $1.2 million to $1.9 million. The media  began asking Poole for quotes. And all the while, the foundation continued a  steady drumbeat of reports and articles on the advantages of selling off the  airports, jails, fire departments, garbage collection, the Postal Service and  the Tennessee Valley Authority. Then in May, 1988, Poole published his landmark  transportation report: "Private Tollways: Resolving Gridlock in Southern  California."  </P> <P> UNLIKE SO MANY other transit planners who long ago gave up on automobiles in  favor of heavy-rail transit, Poole rather admires freeways. They made a great  contribution to California. They opened up the state. Not only did they permit  a kind of untrammeled mobility never before possible, they were a concrete  metaphor for the open-ended, soaring spirit of Southern California.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, Poole felt, they were a metaphor that didn't work anymore. How  could anyone look at a freeway and feel his spirit soaring when, by 1986, 40%  of California's urban roads were operating at a stop-and-go pace. By the year  2010, argued Poole, the population of Southern California was expected to  increase 36%. Average freeway speeds would drop from 35 to 11 mph. Billions of  dollars' worth of fuel and time would be wasted annually in freeway gridlock,  even as exhaust fumes poisoned the drivers. If there was a solution, it was  clear to many that it wasn't just building more freeways.  </P> <P> "You can't build your way out of congestion," argues Peter Gordon, assistant  dean of Urban and Regional Planning at USC. "When you add (freeway) capacity,  you're simply inviting back all the people that congestion had driven away  before." The freeway is filled to capacity practically from the day the ribbon  is cut, and in no time at all you're back to where you started, except now  there's more congestion, more pollution, a huge new debt and no net gain in the  quality of life, he says.  </P> <P> But by using toll roads with new automatic vehicle identification technology  and congestion pricing, one could, argued Poole, raise the tolls enough during  rush hours to divert non-essential traffic to cheaper off-peak hours.  </P> <P> Although politicians tend to be a bit leery of an idea like congestion pricing,  to economists it makes perfect sense: When you undercharge for anything, the  product gets overconsumed at certain peak times and underused at others, which  is why movie theaters charge less for matinees and phone companies cut the  rates at night.  </P> <P> And the problem with not charging for a scarce commodity like freeway space,  argues USC's Peter Gordon, is that it encourages people for whom time is not an  issue, like shoppers and other casual users, to drive the freeways at peak  hours, thereby penalizing people who have no choice.  </P> <P> To Poole, private toll roads with congestion pricing were a "win-win"  proposition for everyone concerned. And in May, 1988, the Reason Foundation  sent hundreds of copies of his report to public officials and private firms.  </P> <P> The time was right. As a result of the federal budget deficit and rapidly  approaching end of the federal interstate highway program, says Bruce Nestande,  a member of the California Transportation Commission and former Orange County  assemblyman, there was no more federal aid in the pipeline for building new  freeways. In the meantime, says Nestande, the state was so far behind in  upgrading 20- and 25-year-old freeways that just to keep them from further  deterioration would require "a 15-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax tomorrow  morning."  </P> <P> To try to hold back the tide, Gov. Deukmejian pushed for a $1 billion stopgap  highway bond issue on the June 7, 1988, ballot. When it was narrowly defeated,  Bob Poole wrote an Op-Ed piece for the Los Angeles Times, pointing out that  privately funded toll roads were already in widespread use in Europe, Asia and  Australia. Even the $12 billion tunnel under the English Channel was being  financed by private sources. Given the fact that nothing else seemed to be  working, Poole argued, maybe it was time to look at this alternative.  </P> <P> As soon as Poole's article appeared, he got calls from both the governor's  office and Caltrans assistant director Williams, who asked Poole to send him  his private tollways report. "We were impressed," says Williams. And Caltrans  promptly drafted a bill that Danville Republican Bill Baker gladly agreed to  sponsor.  </P> <P> As it turned out, the Baker bill became a bargaining chip in the governor's  $18.5 billion gas tax compromise. Some Republicans agreed to accept the gas tax  if they could get these demonstration tollways as part of the compromise  package. And while some Democrats resisted the idea of making drivers pay to  use highways, they were willing to swallow the plan if they could get a  9-cents-a-gallon gas tax. At the same time, lots of other legislators from both  parties didn't care one way or the other about the ideology -- they just wanted  to do something about congestion. As a result, the bill made it through the  legislative process virtually unchanged.  </P> <P> Which is not to say that private tollways might not face opposition somewhere  down the road. Despite having voted for the gas tax compromise, David Roberti  (D-Los Angeles), President ProTem of the Senate, calls toll roads "foreign to  our way of life." "There are certain functions the government is responsible  for," he says, "and every time privatization comes up there should be strong  opposition." Why, ask other critics, should wealthy people have the right to  whiz to work on uncluttered expressways, while the rest of us fume and suffer  on the freeways?  </P> <P> In response, Poole contends that critics should remember that he is not  proposing to take anything away -- he is merely offering a choice. No one will  be forced to use toll roads if he doesn't want to and, in any case, the  projects won't involve any public money. Under the circumstances, asks Poole,  what's so awful about letting "fat cats in their BMWs willingly pay a bunch of  extra money to use their cars?" To the extent that they draw traffic off the  freeways, everyone has better mobility. "And I think that is a hell of a good  deal for everyone concerned."  </P> <P> As for objections that private toll roads will never be built because no one  will risk their money in such a wild-eyed plan, Poole points to a long and  growing list of major investment banking and construction firms that have  already expressed interest in the projects, including a consortium of Japanese  banks and insurance firms that recently wrote to Caltrans: "We understand you  are considering a southern (San Francisco Bay) crossing. Do you think it would  be possible for any of this financing to be Japanese?"  </P> <P> In fact, says Kenneth Olson, vice president for public finance at Goldman  Sachs, which is both the underwriter and an equity investor in a $150 million  Dulles airport toll road extension in Virginia, he would be very surprised if  all the major investment banking firms weren't taking a close look at private  tollways: "The competition to participate in financing will be intense."  </P> <P> Some people may ridicule privately financed toll roads now, says Poole, but  wait until the first project goes into operation and everyone sees how  profitable it is. Then, he says, the arguments will shift overnight from  "They're going to go broke" to "What right do they have to get so rich?"  </P> <P> As for Poole, he doesn't expect to spend all his life preaching the toll road  gospel. Once the projects are launched, he intends to shift his focus to such  matters as privatizing airports and the Postal Service, building private energy  companies and selling the Tennessee Valley Authority.  </P> <P> All over the world, he says, governments are discovering the advantages of  selling off bloated bureaucracies to private enterprise: "Why should the TVA be  off limits?"  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tunis, 18 Feb (MENA)--Citing informed Palestinian  sources in Jerusalem, the Tunisian newspaper AL-SABAH reports  that Faysal al-Husayni and several other Palestinian leaders  inside the occupied territories have rejected an Israeli offer  to provide them with police guards. The Israeli authorities  warned the Palestinian leaders that they might be attacked by  members of fanatical Jewish organizations.    The Palestinians sources said the warning was repeated  following the recent progress in the Palestinian-Israeli  negotiations and the imminent implementation of the transitional  period.    The sources pointed out that Israeli rightist groups and  parties are very critical of the statements made by al-Husayni  and other figures pertaining to the Palestinian determination to  establish a Palestinian state that has its capital in Jerusalem.</p>

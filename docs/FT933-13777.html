			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Sudden influx of boat people upsets UK BRITAIN yesterday expressed concern to China over a sudden influx of about 600 boat people of Vietnamese origin who have arrived in Hong Kong from China in the past two weeks. The refugees from China's Guanxi province, some of whom have lived there for up to 15 years, have told the Hong Kong authorities that they were fleeing after their homes had been destroyed. The reason was not known. Mr Alastair Goodlad, Foreign Office minister, called in China's charge d'affaires, Mr Zheng Jinjiong, and asked the Chinese government to take all necessary steps to stop the flow of people and to take back those who have arrived in Hong Kong. Mr Zheng undertook to report back to Beijing. The boat people are being put in two Hong Kong detention camps. Foreign Office officials said there was no question of sending them to Vietnam. On two previous occasions, in 1987 and 1988, people of Vietnamese origin who landed from China were returned to China. A resurgence of illegal immigrants would worry Hong Kong, which is seeing a steady reduction in the number of Vietnamese in its camps. Since it set up repatriation schemes with the Hanoi government, only 34 boat people have landed in Hong Kong from Vietnam in 18 months, compared with 19,000 arrivals in 1991. So far this year, over 3,500 have voluntarily returned to Vietnam, compared with 12,000 last year. About 40,675 are left in Hong Kong.</p>

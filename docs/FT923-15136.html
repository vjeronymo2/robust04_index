			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Privatisation in Eastern Europe (11): The back of the pack - Romania In spite of the adoption of an ambitious privatisation law last August, the country has yet to privatise a single company in the state sector which still accounts for more than 90 per cent of industrial production. Romania lags well behind its central European neighbours in starting privatisation. In spite of the adoption of an ambitious privatisation law last August, the country has yet to privatise a single company in the state sector which still accounts for more than 90 per cent of industrial production. The private sector which contributed 24 per cent to gross domestic product last year is concentrated in trade and tourism. Although an inheritance law has been re-established and over 70 per cent of agricultural land is now in private hands, the government has yet to decide whether private residences expropriated by the former communist regime should be retained by tenants or restored to their previous owners. Nor has parliament, which has been locked in acrimonious in-fighting over the election laws for several months, completed the legislation needed for the six ownership funds which form the basis of the country's privatisation scheme. In spite of the political problems, the National Privatisation Agency (NPA), the government body responsible for organising privatisation, has accelerated the process since January and begun to implement existing legislation. It has initiated a pilot privatisation scheme involving 30 companies, begun to auction assets and started to distribute ownership certificates to the public. Under the privatisation law, Romanian citizens will receive, free of charge, 30 per cent of the capital of commercial companies which will be held in five Private Ownership Funds (POFs), or mutual funds. The remaining 70 per cent, earmarked for foreign and private investors, will be transferred into a State Ownership Fund (SOF). The SOF, loosely modelled on the German Treuhand, will be responsible for carrying out privatisation and for restructuring larger enterprises. The law stipulates the SOF must sell-off 10 per cent of its equity every year. An important element of the Romanian scheme is the 'commercialisation' of the state sector ahead of privatisation. In July 1990, 6,200 state enterprises became either joint stock or limited liability companies. These companies, which represent 55 per cent of state equity, will be sold-off under the privatisation scheme. The remaining 45 per cent will be taken up by 330 regie autonomes, state corporations, concentrated in strategic areas such as power, transport and telecommunications, which the government will retain with the right to sell them off directly. The NPA, which in the last financial year received nearly Dollars 5m from the European Community's Phare programme, admits there have been serious delays in starting privatisation but insists there is some justification. 'Our situation is entirely different to Hungary or Poland,' explains Mr Doru Tiberiu, the agency's general manager. 'Prior to 1989, Romania had the most highly-centralised command economy outside the former Soviet Union. Our reforms will therefore take much longer and we also need to place more emphasis on educating the population about the transition.' There are other reasons for stressing education and training. Romania, more distant from European Community markets and with a reputation for political instability, has not attracted much foreign investment. At the end of April, foreign investment since January 1990 was less than Dollars 350m. Delay in starting reform has held up foreign aid and loans, depriving the country of the funds it needs to undertake economic restructuring. Even with promised foreign credits of more than Dollars 1.5bn this year, Romania is still short of funds for privatisation. The POFs and SOFs will only receive three months of start-up advice from Lazard Freres, the French bank, before being left to manage their portfolios alone. However, western business consultants involved in the pilot privatisation scheme point to advantages in being a late starter. 'The transition of the former communist countries is a lot more complicated than we first imagined,' says Mr Nicolas Pelletier of Paribas, the French bank, which helped formulate Poland's Mass Privatisation Plan. 'Romania has taken the time to work out a good mechanism for privatisation and can draw on the experiences of the other countries. In the long term, this is far more important,' he adds. With the system still several months away from full operation, it is too early to evaluate comprehensively privatisation in Romania. At the same time, general elections and a political shake-up loom. The NPA may be pressing ahead but privatisation remains a contentious issue.</p>

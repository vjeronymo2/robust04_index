			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Suleiman Nimr] </F>   [Text] Zinjibar, Yemen, June 24 (AFP) -- Northern troops  are marking time on fronts around the besieged southern Yemeni  city of Aden, an AFP correspondent reported late Thursday [23  June] from the frontline.    "For two weeks now we have not moved a metre," said Colonel  'Ali Salim Muhammad of the 17th Brigade stationed here, 20  kilometres (12 miles) east of Aden. "We could easily enter  Aden, but we are waiting for the order from political leaders in  Sanaa," the colonel added. "For the time being, we make do with  bombarding military targets in Aden, especially the military  camp at Khor Maksar."    Aden hospital sources earlier reported that 30 people had  been killed Thursday and nearly 150 wounded as north Yemeni  gunners shelled the southern stronghold, prompting the south to  appeal for foreign intervention to break the stranglehold. The  bombardment began at dawn, continued through the day and was  still in progress as night fell.    Fierce fighting on the north and northwestern fronts  meanwhile left eight soldiers dead and 48 wounded after northern  troops launched two offensives, according to the city's other  hospitals. The north's second lieutenant, Mujahid 'Ali Husayn,  meanwhile said northern troops had moved some two kilometres  (one mile) forward on Saturday [25 June], after repulsing a  "desperate counter-attack by (southern) secessionists."    Colonel 'Ali Shaykh 'Umar, commanding officer in Abyan 25  kilometres (16 miles) east of Aden, admitted that "northern fire  has hit civilians by mistake," but said that was "very rare."  Since northern troops launched their unrelenting assualt on the  port a week ago 108 civilians have been killed and 387 wounded,  according to hospital officials.    Northern troops listened to patriotic songs played over a  loud-speaker mounted on a military vehicle as they fired shells  on Aden. But the songs did not drown out the explosions of  shells fired by the south's heavy artillery from the besieged  city.    Southern shells fell sporadically into the desert near the  brigade's positions, and southern warplanes buzzed Abyan  regularly, flying high to avoid northern anti-aircraft fire.  Burned-out remains of northern troop-carriers, destroyed in  southern air raids, were strewn around the dusty Al-Aslam region  some 15 kilometres (nine miles) from Aden. But northern  soldiers were visibly relaxed in the scorching sun, as they  washed themselves with scalding water from an enormous tank  mounted on a rickety lorry.    War broke out between northern forces loyal to President  'Ali  'Abdallah Salih and those of his southern rival 'Ali Salim  al-Bid on May 5. So far, all attempts to mediate a ceasefire  have failed.</p>

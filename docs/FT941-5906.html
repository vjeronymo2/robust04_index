			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Whistleblower wins compensation The building workers' union Ucatt has won one of the first industrial tribunal cases under laws giving workers redress for dismissal for raising health-and-safety concerns. Mr Matthew Harris, a timber-frame worker of Camberley in Surrey, was awarded Pounds 8,760 compensation by a Southampton tribunal which ruled he had been unfairly dismissed by Select Timber, a Basingstoke timber supplier. Mr Harris had complained of nausea and mood swings while working with the chemical, Lindane. He was dismissed after calling in a health-and-safety inspector.</p>

			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / International Company News: First-half fall at Ajinomoto First-half profits of Ajinomoto, Japan's leading food manufacturing company, were hit by the hot summer weather, the discounting boom and increased competition from imported foods due to the higher yen. Sales were flat at Y298.1bn (Dollars 3.07bn). Interim recurring profits fell 13.1 per cent to Y11bn in spite of a 3.1 per cent rise in operating profits, due to a 25.3 per cent fall in non-operating revenues. Profits from securities sales fell 51.3 per cent to Y1.5bn. Net profits fell 33 per cent to Y5bn due to appraisal losses on securities.</p>

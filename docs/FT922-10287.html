			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Mates considers ban on UDA MR Michael Mates, Northern Ireland security minister, said yesterday that the government was considering outlawing the Ulster Defence Association, the largest Protestant paramilitary group in Northern Ireland. Mr Mates' remarks came in an ITN documentary two days after the killing of a 26-year-old Catholic woman amid a rise in sectarian violence. The other main Protestant paramilitary group, the Ulster Volunteer Force, was banned in 1966.</p>

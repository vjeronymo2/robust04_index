			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / People: Rubik's new puzzle The Hungarian Investment Company, the investment trust run by fund managers John Govett, has recruited 48-year-old Erno Rubik, the inventor of the Cube and other puzzles, on to its board as its third Hungarian non-executive out of a complement of eight directors. He replaces Peter Reiniger, a Hungarian trade minister, who is now at the EBRD. Kevin Pakenham, John Govett's chief executive, says that one of the aims was to achieve as wide a mix of skills as possible; Rubik is someone who 'does not just look through a financial pair of eyes'. Other board members include Sir Bryan Cartledge, former ambassador to Budapest and then Moscow and now principal of Linacre College Oxford. Rubik, who is based in Budapest, is currently managing director of Rubik Studio, a business centre involved in product design and development, which he opened in 1988. He has indicated he is anxious to widen his circle of international business contacts and this is thought to be his first directorship of a foreign company. Since the trust was launched at the beginning of 1990, it has fallen 5 per cent in net asset value terms, but the Hungarian bourse, hit by recession particularly in the crucial German market, has fallen much further. The index, published only since the beginning of 1991, is down 30 per cent in nominal terms, while the consumer price index has risen 67 per cent.</p>

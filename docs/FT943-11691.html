			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / DTI will take no action against Archer The Department of Trade and Industry announced last night that it would not be taking any action against Lord Archer, former deputy chairman of the Conservative party, after allegations that he had been involved in insider dealing. In a statement the DTI announced that Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, had considered a report into possible contraventions of insider dealing legislation by Lord Archer at the time of the bid by MAI, the entertainment and financial group, for Anglia television group in January 1994. The DTI said that 'on the basis of the report and departmental and other independent legal advice' Mr Heseltine had concluded that his department should take 'no further action against any of the parties concerned in the investigation'. Lord Archer - formerly Mr Jeffrey Archer - later told reporters: 'I am grateful to have been exonerated and would like to thank so many friends, colleagues and well-wishers for their vigorous support following disclosure of the investigation.' The best-selling popular fiction writer insisted throughout the DTI investigation that he was innocent of the allegations. His wife, Mary, is a non-executive director of Anglia TV. Many Tory MPs believe that disclosure of the DTI inquiry into Lord Archer, which was leaked to a newspaper, ensured he would not be given a job in last week's government re-shuffle, although some believe a ministerial post is still a possibility. The DTI's subsequent decision to confirm that Lord Archer was under investigation was unprecedented, and met strong criticism from Tory backbenchers. The DTI said last night that it would not be publishing the inspectors' report into the allegations, which Mr Heseltine received on July 19. It also said that information on the case would, as a formality, be passed to the Stock Exchange and to the Securities and Futures Authority.</p>

			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> A domesticated, gallery-tamed brand of violence informs bronze pedestal  sculptures by Laura W. Russell. Jagged triangles bend in half and pierce  themselves, and smooth-edged ribbons of metal wind through tattered and  hole-ridden metal planes. But most everything is patinated in watery blue,  green, rose or yellow, and each self-contained bronze whirlwind sits politely  on a small base perched on sleek long metal legs.  </P> <P> Russell started out as a painter, edging into sculpture by working first with  paper and then bent plywood. The painted wood pieces eventually grew into  massive, aggressive wall sculptures that sometimes included areas of painted  wall. But it looks as though a lot of the energy of those works has drained  away in the bronzes. Rather than grabbing the space around them, the new works  are oddly self-contained. Their spiky edges have the look of calculated, flirty  garnishes, their overall structure has been simplified into formula, and even  their colors are sweeter. The net effect suggests a guileless bid to woo the  interior decorator crowd. (Marilyn Butler Gallery, 910 Colorado Ave., to Aug.  31.) CATHY CURTIS  </P></p>

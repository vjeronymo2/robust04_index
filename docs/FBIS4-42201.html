			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Finlay Marshall, PRESS ASSOCIATION News] </F>   [Excerpt] The Queen and Prime Minister today welcomed the  announcement that South Africa is to rejoin the Commonwealth  tomorrow -- after an absence of 33 years.    The Foreign Office described the decision as "a gold letter  day for the Commonwealth and for South Africa."    The Queen sent a message of congratulation to South African  President Nelson Mandela immediately the announcement was made,  and John Major sent best wishes from the Government.    South Africa's official return to the 50-nation community  was  announced in London by Commonwealth Secretary-General Emeka  Anyaoku, who told a news conference: "It is with a special sense  of joy that I announce that South Africa will from tomorrow  return to full Commonwealth membership after a break of 33  years."    Mr Mandela said immediately after South Africa's recent  general election that he would be seeking the country's  re-admittance to the Commonwealth, which it quit in 1961 amid  international criticism of apartheid.    The Foreign Office said it was hoped that South African  athletes would take part in the Commonwealth Games in Canada in  August, and that it looked forward to its contribution within  the organisation.

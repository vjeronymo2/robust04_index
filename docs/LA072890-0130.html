			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> JOBS PLUS HELPS OUT LOW-INCOME YOUTHS  </P> <P> About 300 students from 10 North County cities are working for government and  nonprofit agencies as part of the Summer Youth Employment Program operated here  by Jobs Plus.  </P> <P> The $600,000 program offers jobs to youths ages 14 to 21 who meet the federal  government's low-income requirements.  </P> <P> Jobs Plus director Linda Daughters said most of the workers receive minimum  wage.  </P> <P> Jobs Plus can also make job referrals for youths who do not come from  low-income families, said Vicky Casillas, a program coordinator.  </P> <P> "If they're 17 or 18 years old and have good transferable skills, we try to  place them in the private sector, whether they are eligible for the program or  not," Casillas said.  </P> <P> In addition to La Habra, the summer employment program serves Brea, Buena Park,  Cypress, Fullerton, La Palma, Placentia, Rossmoor, Los Alamitos, Stanton, Yorba  Linda and part of La Mirada. Daughters said summer school students are not only  eligible but are paid for attending classes in many cases.  </P> <P> Recruitment for the program began in the spring, when counselors visited  schools, held career days and posted flyers in libraries and other public  places.  </P> <P> The application process requires prospective workers to make two trips to the  Jobs Plus office in the basement of La Habra City Hall. Then they must go for  at least one job interview. A final visit to the office to pick up paper work  is required before reporting to work.  </P> <P> "It shows us if the kid will be responsible," Casillas said. "If a youngster is  willing to make three or four trips to City Hall before starting work, he or  she is likely to be a reliable employee."  </P> <P> Casillas said one of the objectives of the program is to show participants "the  importance of how education and work experience go hand in hand."  </P> <P> Youngsters interested in competing for one of about 20 remaining openings may  contact the Jobs Plus office at (213) 905-9744.

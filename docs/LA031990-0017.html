			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNOR'S HOUSING PLAN  </P> <P> I read with interest your editorial "Housing Relief With the Two-Step" (March  7).  </P> <P> I wanted to bring to your attention the governor's housing proposal which would  also assist in addressing the housing needs for moderate-income borrowers who  do not qualify for current programs and cannot obtain a conventional loan.  </P> <P> The governor's proposal is designed to make homeownership affordable to  Californians by providing secondary financing available in the amount necessary  to reduce either the principal or to lower the interest rate of the first loan  to the point where an eligible buyer can afford to buy a home. The program will  be administered by the California Housing Finance Agency.  </P> <P> Under the governor's proposal, first-time home buyers could purchase a home  with a minimum 5% down payment. Debt service on the first loan would be a  30-year fixed term at conventional rates. The second loan would accrue simple,  below market rate interest and would not be payable until the first loan is  repaid or upon sale or transfer of the property. The program is structured to  provide an option of an interest rate buy down, a deferred second mortgage, or  both in order to provide the most effective assistance to home buyers.  </P> <P> This program would generate $1 billion in new mortgage capital for purchase and  construction of housing in the high-cost areas of California.  </P> <P> It is estimated that this program will provide homeownership opportunities for  5,000 to 6,000 California families.  </P> <P> KARNEY HODGE  </P> <P> Director, California Housing Finance Agency  </P> <P> Sacramento  </P></p>

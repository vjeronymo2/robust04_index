			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Italian Government Bonds: Political crisis continues to cloud outlook IN THE past week, old-fashioned sets of scales have been spotted among the electronic gadgets on Italian bond dealers' desks. So close has the correlation between the lira/D-Mark exchange rate and the current prices of Italian bonds and futures become that some say it is now possible to compute the latter based simply on the former. Seldom has the link between the foreign exchange and bond markets been so close. But last week, bond and derivate prices plunged in inverse proportion to the rising strength of the D-Mark against the lira as Italy's political crisis grew more acute. Friday marked a nadir. Prices on the Milan futures market for 10-year bonds plummeted as prospects of finding a convincing replacement for the government of prime minister Guiliano Amato grew fainter. Simultaneously, the lira crossed the psychological L1,000 threshold against the D-Mark for the better part of the day before being quoted just a sliver stronger at L999.62, according to the Bank of Italy's indicative rates. Futures prices in Milan dropped to within sight of 92.50 - the latest technical floor - as trading reflected the lack of confidence in the immediate political outlook. Prices for futures had slipped steadily all week. But the sharpest declines came on Friday, when they fell by about L1.10 compared with Thursday's close. Analysts are wondering how much further they will drop. 'We think 91.50 is the next floor on a technical basis,' says one bond specialist at Euromobiliare, the Milan-based merchant bank. 'But until we can start talking again about a coherent economic policy in Italy, it's hard to be certain where the next floor is.' Prices are still well above the lows recorded during last September's currency turmoil, when futures on 10-year government bonds sank to 85.10. But the two periods are hardly comparable, given the general upturn in European bond prices that has taken place in the meantime. A price of 92.50 for the future implies a corresponding gross yield of 13.60 on the latest 10-year bonds. The risk premium on Italian paper is already 'absolutely comparable with that of last autumn,' says Euromobiliare's analyst. With political events dictating sentiment, no one expects an upturn at least until after the referendum on electoral reform on April 18. With last week's political consultations instigated by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro having failed to bring about a more broadly-based government, it is up to Mr Amato to soldier on at least until the referendum. 'Only then will the real process for creating a more representative government really start,' says a bond specialist at Banco Lariano. In spite of the achievements of the Amato administration, he thinks only a broader-based coalition will be able to take the unpopular, but essential economic, measures required to bring the budget deficit under control. A period of prolonged political uncertainty bodes ill for both the lira and bonds. 'We can't expect anything positive in the immediate future,' says the Banco Lariano analyst. Noting that recent interest rate cuts by the Bank of Italy have been closely linked to firm action on the economy and curbing the deficit, 'there's no chance interest rates will go down for the time being,' he adds. With widespread gloom about the political outlook for the fortnight ahead, dealers are looking to the post-referendum period for a possible upturn. Even then, prospects are uncertain at best. If a new government, including some of the present opposition parties, can be formed quickly, then the lira and government bonds should pick up. But the likelihood of agonising political horse-trading in Rome is just as strong. In that event, dealers may again have to bring out their sets of scales to see how much further bond prices could drop.</p>

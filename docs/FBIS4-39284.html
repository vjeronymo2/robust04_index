			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 4 TASS -- South Korean President Kim  Young- sam has received ITAR-TASS General Director Vitaliy  Ignatenko for an unofficial meeting to discuss aspects of and  prospects for Russian- South Korean interaction in information,  publishing and humanitarian spheres.    When heading the NOVOYE VREMYA journal, Vitaliy Ignatenko  was  a first Russian correspondent to keep contact with South Korean  opposition leader Kim Young-sam and used the journal to call for  the establishment of Russian-South Korean diplomatic relations.    ITAR-TASS sent its correspondent to Seoul before the  official  Russian recognition of South Korea, and he is still the only  Russian newsman in South Korea, a most dynamically developing  state of the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

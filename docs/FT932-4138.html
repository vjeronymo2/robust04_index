			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: Schiphol Airport flies in the face of flotation talk AMSTERDAM'S Schiphol Airport, with a new Triple A/AA1 rating, strong financial position and international reputation in such areas as efficiency and duty-free shopping, appears to be a prime candidate to become the next European airport to be either making or considering a stock market flotation. However, the lure of the private sector has no appeal for the airport, even as it enters the second phase of an ambitious multi-billion guilder, 15-year project to double in size by the year 2003. The scale of the investment might have persuaded other airports to look into attracting outside shareholders, but Schiphol - 76 per cent owned by the Dutch government, 22 per cent by the city of Amsterdam and 2 per cent by Rotterdam - is firmly against the idea. 'The answer is simply no,' says Mr Bart van Leeuwen, the airport's finance director. True, Schiphol tapped the international bond market last week for the first time in nearly 30 years, raising Fl 400m (Dollars 222m) towards consolidating short-term debt and paying for its heavy investment programme. But the airport, Europe's fifth largest, is happy being 'a private company owned by the government'. One key to Schiphol's contentment is that under government ownership it does not pay corporate tax. Dividend policy is another obvious advantage. For the past six years, Schiphol has paid an unchanged Fl 60 per share of Fl 1,000 even though operating profit trebled and net profit doubled over the same period. This minimal dividend has freed cash-flow for a Fl 4.5bn investment programme launched in 1989 and due for completion in the year 2003. Privatised airports, such as BAA in the UK or Vienna airport in Austria, must generate cash to satisfy their shareholders and to plough back into their operations, Mr Leeuwen says. Schiphol's firm opposition to privatisation, which is shared by its three public-sector owners, does not mean that it plans to remain aloof from the international capital market. Last week's 7-year 6.75 per cent Eurobond, led by ING Bank and supported by Schiphol's AAA rating from Standard &amp; Poor's and AA1 from Moody's, could be followed by bonds in future years, al-though Mr van Leeuwen is keeping an open mind. Until now, Schiphol has financed investments almost exclusively through private placements and internal cash flow. Its finances were lifted by its record performance in 1992, with net profit rising by 55 per cent to Fl 90m. This is in contrast to the loss-making KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, which accounts for nearly half of Schiphol's revenue and half its aircraft movements. Reflecting the difficult straits of the world's airlines, Schiphol raised its landing charges by just 1.6 per cent in April instead of the 3 per cent rate by which it would normally have increased charges to keep up with inflation. The first five-year phase of Schiphol's 15-year investment programme was completed last month, when the airport opened a Fl 550m extension to its existing terminal building, raising passenger capacity to 27m a year from 19m. According to the airport's investment projections, its financial obligations will start to exceed free cash flow around the turn of the century, when Schiphol is hoping to build a fifth runway to lift its capacity to more than 100 aircraft movements an hour from the current 70 to 80.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Trygve Monsen: "Brundtland: Conservatives No </F> Alternative"]    [Text] The Conservatives are no longer a total alternative  to the Labor Party, Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland told  the Norwegian Wire Service (NTB). Kaci Kullmann Five denied the  charge.    "This is an evasive maneuver on the part of the prime  minister. We are pursuing the same policy we presented before  the election. At that time, Brundtland said the Conservative  Party was the only government alternative," the Conservative  leader said.    In the NTB interview Brundtland said she was very satisfied  with 1993. "This has been a good year for the government, the  Labor Party and especially for Norway."    The prime minister said there is still a lot of turbulence.  She believes the Center Party will again emerge as a clear-cut  nonsocialist party when the EC issue has been clarified. The  Center Party is pursuing an EC strategy and laying all other  issues aside. When the EC fight is over, the Center Party will  be back in the nonsocialist camp, in her opinion.    "All parties act as special-interest parties and present  special profiles on individual issues. They pursue a critical  opposition policy. The election campaign has continued in the  Storting. We are not confronted with any comprehensive policy,  not even from the Conservatives. I feel the Conservative Party  is operating to a greater extent than before with random  political standpoints that seem unconnected. This developed  during the current year and we saw it clearly in the fall,"  Brundtland said.  <H5>  No Basis </H5>   The Conservative Party leader repudiated the prime  minister's  statements and asked her to be concrete when she criticizes the  Conservatives for not being a total alternative and trying to  present a "special profile on individual issues."    "I don't think she has any basis for saying this. We are  still pursuing the economic policy we announced before the  election. And when it comes to two major areas--defense policy  and education policy--we are continuing to work on what we  promised. We are following up the proposals from the Defense  Committee report that had broad majority support, and we think  there should be more serious study than fun and games in school.  Therefore we have proposed an increase in the total number of  teaching periods," Five said.    "The prime minister is quite preposterous and she also  disagrees with what her own party leader said in the Storting's  budget-balancing debate before Christmas. Thorbjorn Jagland  spoke of the Conservatives in quite a different way than she  does now," Five said.    The prime minister is optimistic about the prospect of  reducing unemployment.    "It now looks as if we will stabilize the unemployment  figures. In the last two months, jobless figures have flattened  out, and each weekly figure has tended to be lower than the one  in the same period last year. Now this year's and last year's  curves have crossed, and we are at a lower level than we were 12  months ago. This means that for the first time in several years  the January unemployment figure could be lower than it was a  year ago," she said.    Once again she stressed that the favorable development in  1993 is not due to an economic boost from other countries or  favorable oil prices.    "It is our own economic policy that has changed Norway's  circumstances," she concluded.</p>

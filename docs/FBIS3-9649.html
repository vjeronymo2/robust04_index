			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Slatinski, chairman of the National </F> Assembly National Security Commission: "Bulgarian Foreign Policy  Is Not Field of Infighting"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Bulgaria is following with  great interest the events around Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM].    The delay in recognizing Macedonia turned this country into  a  dangerous focus of tension. Bulgaria has no territorial claims  vis-a-vis Macedonia. The claim regarding the existence of a  "big" Macedonian minority in Bulgaria is absurd. For every  normal person, the Macedonian Slavs in our country are  Bulgarians. They share our past, language, culture, and blood.  One century ago, the great powers coldly and without a drop of  compassion cut a piece of living flesh from the body of the  motherland. Today Bulgaria's first concern must be turning  Macedonia into a state based on international law and separating  it from the disintegrating Yugoslav space. By simultaneously  recognizing Croatia, Slovenia, Macedonia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina  in January 1992, we provided valuable proof of our intention to  conduct an independent policy and of our conviction that the  countries in the region must have the same status and be equal  and sovereign if they abide by the UN laws and norms. The  statehood and free choice of a people -- this is the main and  leading factor in international relations. When a country like  Croatia, for example, is recognized, this is done without any  qualifications as to what part of the population is recognized.  The statehood of the entire nation is being recognized,  regardless of the people's ethnic origin or the manner in which  they themselves determine their self-awareness. This is an  internal issue of the country and its people and the personal  right to choice of every citizen. Refraining from interfering  in the internal affairs of any state, Bulgaria decisively  opposes every attempt to distort our history and every attempt  against our national memory and ancient values on which our  value system is based. Unfortunately, the statements of the  Macedonian leaders now contain precisely such attempts. To this  we could add the existence of certain articles in the Macedonian  Constitution to which we object, and the frequent cases of  anti-Bulgarian campaign in the Macedonian mass media. Thus, the  coincidence of positions with Greece on certain issues is hardly  an accident. It is a consequence of common concerns and  interests. Nevertheless, Bulgaria does not undertake unilateral  actions, such as the sanctions Greece imposed on Macedonia. We  are led by the principle of trying to understand a position even  when you do not share it. Now we are convinced that the  sanctions by no means facilitate abating tension in the region  and contradict our principle of good-neighborly relations.  Greece's remark that its act does not represent a precedent  (tacitly addressed at the United States) is a weak consolation.    Bulgaria strictly observes its commitments and will not  retreat from the firm position of noninterference in the  Yugocrisis. This is a clearly declared intention which today  enjoys the support not only of the political forces but also of  all Bulgarian people. However, I ask myself -- who could  guarantee that, at a negative development of the events in the  Balkan, a radically exacerbated situation, and direct threats of  Bulgaria's national security and interests, Bulgaria will remain  a passive observer?    One cannot make attempts against Macedonia, Bulgaria, and  the  Bulgarian population and demand that we remain passive and  indifferent.    Bulgarian foreign policy is not a field of infighting,  improvising, and behind-the-scene deals. Dispute everything,  history always sentenced our politicians justly. At this  crucial time, the cost of their decisions and choices is  exceptionally high. Perhaps higher than ever before.</p>

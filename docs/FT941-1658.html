			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Book Review: Time to concede the end of an affair 'SPECIAL' NO MORE Anglo-American relations: rhetoric and reality By John Dickie Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson 299 pages, Pounds 25 John Dickie was, until his retirement from the Daily Mail, the dean of British diplomatic correspondents. An unmistakeable figure, he always wore a fresh carnation in his button hole. Perhaps the Mail did not publish as much of his work as it should have done, but the Foreign Office always read him. He had a knack of hitting (more or less) the right targets on the right day. So it remains, now that he has turned more to books than journalism. 'Special' No More, his survey of Anglo-American relations from roughly 1939 to the present day, could scarcely be better timed. Dickie thinks that it is the end of the affair. Yet such have been the ups and downs in the relationship over the decades that it may be too early to be sure. Where Dickie scores is in throwing in the anecdotal evidence with the researched. He notes in passing that the 'iron curtain' was first used in print by Ethel Snowden, the wife of the Labour politician, on arriving in Petrograd in 1920. It is the same with the 'special relationship'. Few people are certain how it came into the language. Churchill used the term in a memorandum in 1944, but it was only in his famous speech in Fulton, Missouri, two years later that it became prominent. Even then, it is worth being clear what Churchill said. He spoke not of a special Anglo-American relationship, but one between 'the British Commonwealth and Empire and the US'. And there, with hindsight, were the seeds of future troubles. The special relationship was fostered during the second world war because of the joint desire to defeat Hitler and Japan. It may not have come about quite so soon without the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour. The British were in many ways an attractive ally. They were more advanced than the Americans in research on atomic weapons; they had an excellent intelligence service; and, as Bismarck had remarked long before, 'the most important fact of the modern world is that Britain and America speak the same language'. Yet it should have been apparent from the start that the relationship was unequal and that, after the war, some interests would diverge. The US, then as now, was as interested in the Pacific as in Europe. It was unlikely, given its history, to come to the support of the British Empire, and the Americans had their own ideas on the Middle East. For a while the personal relationship between Churchill and President Roosevelt flourished. Roosevelt's adviser, Harry Hopkins, even attended British cabinet meetings. But, as Dickie notes, by 1943 Churchill was beginning to feel a bit cut off from the mainstream of US policy-making. The Americans were not planning quite the same post-war world as the British. Again partially with hindsight, the British attitude to the American cousins seems to have been remarkably patronising. As the rhyme puts it: 'In Washington Lord Halifax once whispered to Lord Keynes, They have all the money bags, but we have all the brains.' Yet in foreign policy terms, or indeed in any other, that was never wholly true. To be sure, there were - and remain - great post-war examples of Anglo-American co-operation: the Berlin airlift for a start. Using some new information, Dickie tells how the two countries combined to overthrow Dr Mossadeq as prime minister of Iran. The British called it Operation Boot because the objective was to boot him out. The Americans refined it to Operation Ajax, but it still worked. Sometimes, personal relations were crucial. Sir Anthony Eden never liked the American Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles: this was one of the contributory factors to the Suez crisis in 1956. On the other hand, Harold Macmillan as the new prime minister repaired the Anglo-American relationship in double quick time, and became very close to President Kennedy. Thus the ups and downs continued, and there were policy divergences as well. Successive British governments refused directly to help the Americans in Vietnam. Lord Home was reviled in Washington for allowing the sale of Leyland buses to Cuba and even Lady Thatcher fell out with Ronald Reagan over the American invasion of Grenada - led incidentally by Major-General Norman Schwarzkopf, who subequently made his name in the Gulf war. The close co-operation between Britain and the US in that latter campaign came about partly by chance. Thatcher happened to be in Aspen, Colorado, with President Bush when the news arrived of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. There was a problem in the special relationship, however, that was growing bigger with time and should have been realised in London. British policy was more interested in Nato, where it could claim to be a bridge between Europe and the US, than in the development of the European Union. The Americans always knew this, but were usually too polite to say so in public. When Dean Acheson had a shot at it in his 'lost an empire, not yet found a role' speech, the British jumped on him, from Harold Macmillan downwards. Yet as the cold war ended, and the European Union continued to expand, there was no need for a bridge. What the Americans want is a Britain firmly in Europe. Dickie writes that John Major became prime minister to deal with all that: 'His first decision of cardinal importance was to commit himself to the EC in a way that Thatcher had refused to contemplate.' Given the events of the past few days, that looks like an uncharacteristically bad judgment from such a journalist. Dickie is a better reporter than he is leader-writer. Most of his book is a delight. Academics will be infuriated that, like many good journalists, he declines to give sources, but they look pretty first-hand to me.</p>

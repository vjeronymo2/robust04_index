			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Mutual satisfaction Aegon's Pounds 240m investment in Scottish Equitable gives it cheap access to the UK life assurance market while neatly side-stepping the lengthy process of demutualisation. The Scots get an overdue injection of capital without surrendering control - or the valuable with-profits fund, which retains its mutual status within the new company. That structure will doubtless appeal to other cash-strapped mutual life offices. UK banks and building societies are most likely to be copycat suitors. With conditions tough in continental Europe, other insurers may not be feeling expansive and, in any event, most mutuals need new channels of distribution as much as capital, so UK-based partners are more attractive. Whether Aegon is paying a fair price remains an open question. Since the with-profits fund is ring-fenced, it is buying only an interest in the unit-linked portion of the business. Yet both sides are coy about value embedded in that fund and past profits. A similar deal between public companies would surely demand a higher standard of disclosure. Scottish Equitable policyholders are being asked to take a lot on trust. Aegon shareholders might also doubt the wisdom of committing funds to UK life assurance just as banks and building societies are moving in. That inflow of capital must surely lead to diminishing returns. Without the support of Aegon, Scottish Equitable would have to abandon the dizzy pace of growth seen in recent years. Others must now find partners or face a squeeze. The evidence suggests no shortage of backers willing to take an optimistic view.</p>

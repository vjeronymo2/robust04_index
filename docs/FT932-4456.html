			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / A tide that's not for turning: Remedies for persistent and rising unemployment in Europe are proving elusive Unemployment in developed countries has risen by nearly 3m since the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development began its investigation into the causes of persistent joblessness in its member countries a year ago. The tally is expected to rise by a further 1m before the study is completed in June next year. By then, the OECD expects 36m people to be out of work, 8.5 per cent of member states' labour force. Little wonder that high and rising unemployment has become one of the most pressing political issues, particularly in Europe where the bulk of the unemployed reside. The OECD's latest economic forecast says that, by the end of 1994, the jobless total will have risen to 8.25m in the US and 1.7m in Japan - but 23m in the European community. The EC Commission, mindful of its commitment to European union, has recognised the potential threat to future economic and monetary integration that rising unemployment implies. A month ago, the Commission, under the direction of its president, Jacques Delors, announced a medium-term study of unemployment and competitiveness in the EC. Social affairs commissioner Padraig Flynn has since published a study-plan - the Community-wide Framework for Employment - to examine over the next 18 months the reasons for the low levels of employment as well as high unemployment in the EC. Why is unemployment in the OECD, particularly in Europe, so persistently high? The OECD's interim unemployment report, published last week, is strong on description and vague in diagnosis. But it is emphatic on one point: that active macroeconomic management is not the remedy. Pulling either the fiscal or monetary policy levers will not solve a problem which the OECD says is 'in large part structural'. Governments should aim, instead, to cut budget deficits and so reduce long-term real interest rates and encourage private investment. The EC's framework paper agrees economic growth alone will not reduce unemployment to more tolerable levels. While Europe's current monetary squeeze may be pushing unemployment higher than it might otherwise be, both the OECD and the EC have reasons to ignore current macroeconomic difficulties and focus on the medium term. For, as the record of the past two decades shows, the underlying jobless total has been rising regardless of the ups and downs of the economic cycle. Every OECD region has seen a trend rise in unemployment rates since 1960. The report points to a shift in developed economies away from manufacturing as a key reason for structural, or non-cyclical, unemployment. By the end of the 1980s, it says, one in five workers was employed in manufacturing, compared with one in four in 1960. The report suggests that some combination of competition from developing countries and technological change has reduced the demand for blue-collar, relatively unskilled, male labour at prevailing wage levels. Hence the rise in unemployment is concentrated among poorly educated men whose main contribution was brawn, not brain. The evidence suggests new technologies and production processes in developed countries, rather than low-wage competition from the developing world, have been the main reason for the decline in demand for unskilled labour. Developing country exports to the developed world have grown rapidly in the past three decades, but developing country trade remains too small to have a significant effect on employment, other than in a few sectors such as textiles. More important has been a shift, within manufacturing, towards more sophisticated technology and the employment of fewer workers overall. An increasing proportion of the remaining jobs are filled by better educated, white-collar workers. In the UK, the proportion of manual workers - both skilled and plant operatives - in total manufacturing employment fell from 56 per cent in 1971 to 50 per cent in 1990. Thus, technological change in the UK has reduced both skilled and unskilled manual employment. In US manufacturing, the employment of production workers fell by 2.2m to 12.3m between 1979 and 1989, while non-production employment increased by 0.2m to 6.7m. The shift occurred largely within existing industries as they upgraded technology and expanded the use of computers, rather than because old, labour-intensive industries were replaced by high-tech industries. The need, then, is for policies which create more skilled, and more attractive, jobs while enabling the unskilled unemployed to update their skills. Job creation is of particular concern in Europe. EC countries, the Commission's Framework for Employment explains, have a low rate of employment against other industrialised countries - less than 60 per cent of the working age population of working age is in employment, compared with more than 70 per cent in the US, Japan and in the countries of the European Free Trade Association, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Austria. Moreover, as the OECD points out, the EC's job-creation record in recent decades has, with the exception of the UK in the late 1980s, been dismal. Employment in North America has nearly doubled since 1960, but has grown by a mere 10 per cent in the EC. Member countries, the Commission says, need policies which deliver 'a more employment-intensive pattern of economic growth'. The paper suggests high non-wage labour costs in some continental European countries, employment taxes, inadequate training and rigid working patterns might explain this poor record. 'In the past we have tended to search for policies targeted only on the unemployed rather than on creating employment,' says John Morley, head of the Commission's Employment Policy Unit. 'We want to make the level of employment a target for policy.' Commission officials deny they are suggesting continental Europe embrace Anglo-Saxon-style labour market deregulation by removing obstacles to hiring and firing. 'Low levels of regulation tend to lead to low levels of investment in training and skills,' says Mr Morley. 'It is not clear where the right balance is, but it has to be struck.' But the EC's list of policy options is similar to the OECD's standard 1980s agenda, recounted in the interim report: more investment, encouragement of entrepreneurship, labour market flexibility, better training, more support for those job-searching and less generous unemployment benefits. Is this the same approach tried for more than a decade without great success? No, reply OECD officials. 'Ministers talk a lot about making labour markets more flexible and reforming unemployment benefit systems,' says one OECD official. 'But they don't actually do it - individual governments still manage things in a sloppy way.' Still, the OECD has not yet found compelling evidence that countries following its policy menu have noticeably lower levels of unemployment. Active labour market measures give the impression that governments are tackling the problem, acknowledges one senior OECD official, 'but the evidence does not suggest these measures are very effective in improving an individual's ability either to get a job or to secure a higher income.' A deeper problem for the OECD and European Commission is the mismatch between the attributes and attitudes of the unemployed, normally men, and those, often women, willing to take the kind of jobs created over the past decade. Those countries which have substantially increased employment in the 1980s, the US and UK in particular, have encouraged the creation of relatively low-wage service sector jobs shunned by the male unemployed and taken up mainly by female entrants to the market. The proportion of British women of working age who have jobs rose by 6.7 percentage points across the 1980s, but male employment fell by 2.6 percentage points. The US and the UK have substantially more women of working age in employment than, for example, France and Germany - nearly 60 per cent on average in the 1980s, compared with less than 50 per cent. The test for both the OECD and the EC is whether they can find solutions for the root unemployment problem facing all developed countries - how to find ways to re-employ unskilled men at wages they are willing to accept. For, while raising female employment may be a laudable policy goal, and labour market deregulation the fastest route to success, the evidence does not suggest that it is also a route to lower unemployment.</p>

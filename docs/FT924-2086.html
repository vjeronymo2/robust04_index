			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / European Court: Sex discrimination case opens Last week the European Court held the oral hearing in the second Marshall sex discrimination case. In the first Marshall case, the Court ruled that Miss Marshall was entitled to rely on the provisions of an EC directive in her action for wrongful dismissal on grounds of sex discrimination against her employers, Southampton and South West Hampshire Area Health Authority. Following the European Court's ruling, the case was remitted to the industrial tribunal to consider the question of compensation. Under UK legislation, the maximum compensation which could be paid at the relevant time was Pounds 6,250. The industrial tribunal assessed Miss Marshall's loss at Pounds 18,405, which included Pounds 7,700 in interest. The area health authority paid the capital sum, but appealed against the tribunal's award of interest. The appeal went to the House of Lords which referred it to the European Court. The case raises several important points, including the obligations of EC states to provide effective judicial protection of individuals' Community rights and what constitutes adequate compensation in such situations. The advocate general's opinion and the Court's ruling are expected next year. C-271/91: Marshall v Southampton and South West Area Health Authority. Frontier workers' rights clarified. The Court has provided further clarification of the position relating to social security benefits paid to individuals who are resident in one member state and work in another. The case concerned a woman who worked in Northern Ireland and resided in the Irish Republic with her husband and four children. She received child benefit in Ireland but then applied for it in Northern Ireland, where benefit levels were higher. The Northern Irish Court of Appeal referred the matter to the European Court. The general rule under EC law is that the laws of the country of employment apply. But where an individual has a family in the state of residence, they are entitled to family benefits provided by that state. This rule does not apply, however, when the family already receives benefits given on the basis of a professional or trade activity carried on in the state of residence by the person entitled to the benefits or by the person to whom they are paid. In this case the husband carried on a trade but he was not the person entitled to the benefits. His wife should therefore have been entitled to benefits in both Ireland and Northern Ireland. The Court ruled that the persons entitled to benefits included persons who had care of the children, which in this case was the husband, so the only benefits available were those from the Irish authorities. C-119/91: McMenamin v Adjudication Officer, ECJ 5CH, December 9 1992. Nestle/Perrier The European Commission's decision on the Nestle/Perrier merger is to be challenged in the Court of First Instance by representatives of the Perrier workforce. They argue that the merger should not have been cleared because it reduced the centres of competition in the bottled water market from three to two. They question the Commission's power to restructure the market through merger approval, and say that it should have prevented the disappearance of the third competitor rather than first allowing it to be destroyed and then requiring it to be recreated. They also say the Commission should have ensured the merger did not infringe 'fundamental social rights recognised by Community law' and claim they were not given a proper opportunity to participate in the proceedings.</p>

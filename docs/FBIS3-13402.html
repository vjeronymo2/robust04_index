			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A spokesman for the Popular Front for the Liberation  of Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC] has stated the following:    Since our heroes' operation in the al-Rayhan-al-'Ayshiyah  area in southern Lebanon last week, an operation which resulted  in the killing and injury of many agents, the Zionist enemy has  been trying to lift the morale of its troops and agents through  lies and fabrication. And it seems that what the enemy has  broadcast about the killing of two PFLP-GC elements and  capturing two others is part of the same series of lies and  deception. We, the PFLP-GC, are interested in exposing the  Zionist enemy's lies. We have not lost a single martyr in the  aforementioned operation and none of our strugglers has been  captured.    [Signed] The PFLP-GC</p>

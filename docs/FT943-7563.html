			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Jackal's lawyer starts to hound the Elysee If you were a lawyer defending 'Carlos the Jackal', the alleged international terrorist extradited from Sudan to face bombing charges in France, it would be hard to be more controversial than your client - but that is just what Mr Jacques Verges has just succeeded in doing. The 'Verges affair' threatens, briefly at least, to eclipse the 'Carlos affair', with Mr Verges accusing President Mitterrand of deciding to have him killed in the early 1980s, a charge ignored by the Elysee and denied yesterday by former counter-intelligence chiefs but implicitly supported on television on Sunday night by a former anti-terrorist policeman. Mr Verges has specialised in controversial cases, defending members of the Algerian anti-colonial FLN movement in the early 1960s, associates of Carlos in the early 1980s and more recently Klaus Barbie, the Nazi war criminal. He recently wrote a book called 'An Open Letter to My Algerian Friends', warning the Algerian authorities that, in suppressing the Islamic fundamentalists, they were using the same oppressive tactics they had accused their former French colonial masters of. The variety of Mr Verges' clients certainly confused at least one foreign intelligence agency. In recent days, the French press has cited files unearthed from the Stasi of the former East Germany, claiming that Mr Verges has been a go-between Carlos and France's Mauroy government in the early 1980s, a terrorist 'directly implicated' in a 1982 rocket attack on France's Creys-Malville nuclear reactor, and an agent for the US Central Intelligence Agency, apparently because of his defence of Barbie. Mr Verges flatly denies the second and third charges, and describes the first as a diversionary tactic to detract from his current defence of Carlos, whom he has formerly accused the French government of kidnapping from Sudan. Saying that he did discuss the fate of Carlos' associates in the early 1980s with senior officials of the Mauroy government, Mr Verges also claimed he was put on a list of supposedly dangerous people for 'rapid elimination', and that this task was given to Mr Paul Barril, whom he defended on a charge of falsifying evidence on suspected Irish terrorists in 1982. It was Mr Barril who said Mr Verges was 'a priority target' for the French authorities. Meanwhile, a senior Sudanese official told the French press over the weekend that the extradition of Carlos was a 'model of co-operation' between the two countries. Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, was yesterday more circumspect about relations with Sudan, which he said was conducting 'an extraordinarily bloody war' against its south and was 'sometimes' suspected of harbouring terrorists. However, the minister said there was no hidden 'counterpart' in the Carlos extradition, such as Iranian pressure on Khartoum in gratitude for France's return of two suspected Iranian terrorists to Tehran last year.</p>

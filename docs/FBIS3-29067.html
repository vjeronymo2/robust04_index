American threats worked in that dispute. Now  Northwest's need to trim costs has achieved what Australian  diplomacy (and litigation) could not. Yesterday the airline was  forced to announce the end of two of the three  Detroit-Osaka-Sydney services Washington was so determined to  protect.    But it would be unwise to declare a belated victory for  Australia. Rather, Northwest's departure may only make more  room for the larger American carrier, United Airlines. Of the  four US airlines active in Australia at the beginning of 1992,  two have now withdrawn altogether, and Northwest will be reduced  to one weekly service from April. United, by contrast, is  expanding its Australian flights. [passage omitted]    Northwest entered the market after signing agreements by  which at least half the seating capacity would be taken by  passengers originating in the US. The deal was supposed to  minimise Northwest's impact on Japanese and Australian airlines  servicing the Japan-Australia route. But Northwest flagrantly  ignored the "50 per cent" rule. Last year Australia, with  Japan's support, threatened to reduce Northwest's service unless  the agreement was honoured. However, Washington retaliated with  threats to cancel several direct-flight Qantas services to the  US, Canberra capitulated, and Northwest continued to pick up  most of its Australia-bound passengers in Japan.    Even so, Northwest was unable to turn a sufficient profit.  But American eyes are still fixed on the profit potential of  Asia, the world's fastest-growing aviation market. US interests  conflict with those of countries in the region, including  Australia, whose own carriers hope to dominate the market. So  far, however, Australia has not come up with an effective answer  to America's bullying but successful tactics.</p>

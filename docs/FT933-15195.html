			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Guatemalan tobacco growers fear US import curb A BILL in the US congress that would restrict domestic cigarette manufacturers to using a maximum of 25 per cent of imported tobacco, is threatening to cripple Guatemala's tobacco industry, according to producers here. The bill, which is still in committee stage, is part of President Bill Clinton's Dollars 500bn deficit reduction package, and is expected to be voted on in the next few weeks. Guatemala's influential private sector umbrella group, Cacif, has written to the US congress complaining that the proposal would violate the Generalised Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and goes against the spirit of the Caribbean Basin Initiative, a unilateral trade benefit granted by the US. The Central American republic exports mainly Burley tobacco, 70 per cent of which goes to the US without trade restrictions. Tobacco exports are expected to reach 15,200 tonnes this year, worth about Dollars 70m. This follows a sharp increase in planting over 1992, when the Bank of Guatemala recorded exports of Dollars 28.8m. For blending purposes US manufacturers require a 15 per cent mix of Turkish tobacco, which means countries that only produce Burley and Virginia tobacco will be forced to compete for the remaining 10 per cent of US manufacturing needs, say exporters here. The US currently imports more than 40 per cent of its tobacco requirements. In Guatemala tobacco supports 140,000 people, mostly on the hot, flat lands along the southern Pacific Coast, according to an industry official. 'If the bill goes through, it will put us out of business,' warned Mr Francis Carlow, manager of Tabacalera Nacional, a subsidiary of British American Tobacco, which has been operating in Guatemala since 1928. BAT is the Central American republic's largest tobacco exporter, accounting for 40 per cent of shipments to the US. Mr Carlow says that US manufacturers will probably turn to larger, cheaper, lower quality suppliers to rationalise reduced import requirements. The Guatemalan government has yet to respond officially to the proposed measure. But Mrs Irma Luz Toledo Penate, the acting economy minister, said Guatemala was working on a response together with Honduras, another Central American producer. She said the Guatemalan government would consider adopting retaliatory measures if a negotiated compromise were not found. Apples, chicken, and textiles have been mooted as possible areas were restrictions might be imposed. But a US embassy official in Guatemala City played down the significance of the Bill. He said the local industry was exaggerating its production figures and claimed tobacco exporters had told him six weeks ago that they were expecting a 25 per cent drop in exports during 1993.</p>

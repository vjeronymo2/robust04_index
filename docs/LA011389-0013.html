			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAELI SETTLERS ANGRY, FEARFUL IN TENSE WEST BANK  </P> <P> With the grim willfulness that is their trademark, dozens of Israeli settlers  tried Thursday to get to the place where the body of an Israeli taxi driver,  slain by gunfire, was found a week ago. They were intent on building a monument  to the victim, whom they see as a martyr and a symbol of their demands for  greater security.  </P> <P> The Israeli army, to avoid trouble, blocked their way with a truck.  </P> <P> The insistent settlers left their cars and began to walk the 2 miles to the  fork in the road where the body was found. But as they neared the place,  soldiers arrived with a bus, herded them into it and took them back to their  starting point.  </P> <P> "This is ridiculous -- someone gets murdered, and they pick on us," said Ron  Nachman, the mayor of Ariel, largest of the Jewish settlements on the West  Bank. "But don't worry. We will return."  </P> <P> The incident illustrated the increasingly uncertain condition of Israeli  settlers in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. After being encouraged by  successive Israeli governments to settle on the disputed land, they find their  future less and less certain amid increasing talk, in Israel and abroad, of  trading the land for peace with Israel's Arab neighbors.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, they complain that the government and the army are failing to  protect them from the hate and the stones of the Arabs, who regard them as  aliens. Their clamor for protection is heard in Israeli enclaves from the  hillside olive groves of the West Bank to the beaches of the Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> The settlers want their status clarified, although they seem to feel that in  the end they will be allowed to stay on land controlled by Israel, that the  Arabs will accept it or leave.  </P> <P> "We want some clear policy from the government," said Saralee Glasser, a  resident of Elkana who immigrated to Israel 18 years ago and moved to the West  Bank four years ago. "As far as we are concerned, we are living in Israel. We  want the same protection as someone would get in any Israeli town. We want  Israeli law applied here."  </P> <P> The demands of the settlers -- about 70,000 of them in about 130 settlements --  have kept Israeli politicians busy responding with rhetoric, if not substance.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir traveled to the bleak mountaintop  settlement of Brakh to speak at a memorial service for a security guard killed  last month by an Arab intruder -- another example, the settlers say, of their  vulnerable situation.  </P> <P> Shamir spoke passionately of Israel's right to the land while a small group of  enraged settlers, demanding a stronger hand applied to rebellious Arabs, tried  to shout him down.  </P> <P> "Neither murders nor stones nor Molotov cocktails will destroy the will of the  nation of Israel to redeem the Land of Israel and settle it with many Jews,"  Shamir said. "Land of Israel" refers to the biblical Israel that Shamir wants  to reclaim.  </P> <P> "The nations of the world talk peace," he said. ". . . We tell them the danger  to peace is not from Israel but from our enemies."  </P> <P> This failed to satisfy the settlers huddled on the wind-swept crest. They  screamed, "You're responsible!" and held up signs lettered, "The Blood of Our  Brothers Cries Out for Revenge," referring to, among others, the taxi driver  and the security guard.  </P> <P> The body of taxi driver Shlomo Edri, of Petah Tikva, was found a week ago on  the road near the settlement of Yakir with two bullet wounds in the chest. It  was in his memory that the settlers wanted to build a roadside monument.  </P> <P> The other victim, Yaacov Parag, was shot last month at Brakh, where Shamir  spoke, by a Palestinian shepherd who was apparently angered over a pay dispute.  </P> <P> Both have become symbols of the settlers' goals and fears.  </P> <P> "The people are angry," Mayor Nachman said. "They want action. Instead, the  army stops us from building a monument."  </P> <P> In recent weeks, the settlers have organized more and more protests designed to  wrest greater protection from the government. In Jerusalem, a group of settlers  is holding a hunger strike near the prime minister's office. In a tent, they  display the crude weapons of the 13-month-old Palestinian uprising -- stones,  nails, spikes, bits of scrap metal.  </P> <P> A few weeks ago, settlers blocked highways in the West Bank to protest the  stone throwing that makes a nightmare of their daily passage to and from work.  On Thursday, the settlers who were gathered at Brakh criticized comments  attributed to Gen. Dan Shomron, the army chief of staff, who suggested that the  Arab uprising could not be crushed, only resolved politically. Some shouted,  "Fire Shomron!"  </P> <P> On occasion, the settlers defend themselves, even take the offensive against  the Arabs. Many travel with pistols or submachine guns in their cars.  </P> <P> The government and the army think some settlers are trigger-happy. This image  was reinforced last fall when a settler shot and wounded two plainclothes  Israeli agents trying to lay a trap for Arab stone throwers.  </P> <P> Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, a frequent target of settler criticism, said  that dissatisfaction among settlers in the occupied lands should not turn into  a battle between Israelis -- that is, between the army and the civilian  settlers.  </P> <P> At an army roadblock near Yakir on Thursday, settlers chased a group of Arab  villagers who were taunting them. They fired two rounds from an Uzi submachine  gun carried by one of the settlers. Soldiers looking on from nearby did  nothing.  </P> <P> A dozen Israelis have been killed by Arabs since the start of the intifada, or  uprising, including a woman and her three children who perished in a bus that  was firebombed last fall near Jericho. Hundreds of buses have been damaged by  rocks and at least 40 gutted by fire, the government says.  </P> <P> About 13 Palestinians have been shot to death by settlers, and in all almost  340 Arabs have been killed in the intifada.  </P> <P> One settler, Israel Zeev, was found guilty in court recently of shooting to  death a 28-year-old Arab shepherd last year near the West Bank settlement of  Shiloh. Zeev said he fired in self-defense after the shepherd threw stones.  Witnesses said Zeev fired without provocation. They said the victim recognized  Zeev and shouted at him, "Israel, don't shoot!"  </P> <P> Charges against two others accused in shooting cases are pending.  </P> <P> The settlers are a varied lot, perhaps as varied as the population of Israel.  Some have come to the occupied territories in order to live cheaply, lured by  concessions on costs and mortgage rates and knowing little of the area's  biblical symbolism, which is so important to some Jews.  </P> <P> Some believe that the land is biblically ordained for Israelis. Under almost  every stone they see the footprint of a prophet. Others see the land as  territory won by Israel in what they consider a defensive war, the Arab-Israeli  conflict of 1967, and they think it is necessary to retain this land for  purposes of national defense.  </P> <P> "We are as Israeli as anyone else," said Glasser, the resident of Elkana who is  also a developmental psychologist. "We pay taxes and obey the law, and we  demand to be treated like other Israelis."  </P> <P> She has friends whose car windows have been smashed by rocks. One acquaintance  suffered severe eye injuries.  </P> <P> The settlements are different from one another. Some look like American-style  suburbs transplanted to the edge of the Arabian desert. Some are just a few  inhabited boxes atop bare hills. Others consist of trailers jumbled on the  sand. One, Ariel, has the flavor and boosterism of a small, growing,  high-technology town.  </P> <P> "We are here to stay," Mayor Nachman said. "We are not like other settlements,  a satellite of some town in Israel. We are the center of things here."  </P> <P> Nachman has ambitious dreams for Ariel. He has laid out an industrial science  park and hopes to attract new business. He would like to expand the boundaries  but is hemmed in by Arab farms.  </P> <P> "They planted these olive trees so we couldn't say the land was vacant," he  complained.  </P> <P> While the settlers fret and protest, the government has undertaken a campaign  to attract more Israelis to the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Television  commercials paint a rosy picture of life in the country. A recent campaign  meant to attract settlers to the Gaza Strip, which like the West Bank is caught  up in the intifada, urged listeners to "come enjoy the quality of life." Bumper  stickers extol the sun and sand of Gaza Strip beaches. "Live in a young,  effervescent community," a newspaper ad said.  </P> <P> The campaign was designed on behalf of Gush Qatif, a sandy beachside settlement  with about 3,000 Israeli inhabitants. Gush Qatif is in the middle of the Gaza  Strip, home to 700,000 Arabs.  </P> <P> "We think we have a lot to offer," said Datya Herskowitz, a spokesman for the  settlement. "Children are safe in our community, it's quiet and there's lots of  sun."  </P> <P> However, residents of the area note that automobile trips from Gaza into Israel  can be risky.  </P> <P> "It's a tense atmosphere outside," tomato farmer Ehud Neor said. Like others,  he referred to surrounding Arab land as "outside." Neor said he once had to  swerve his car sharply to avoid a gasoline bomb that had been hurled at him.  </P> <P> Still, the settlers persevere. Developers of the newly built and bankrupt Qatif  Beach Hotel hope for a return of visitors. The hotel was completed before the  intifada began, then was closed when both government funds and business dried  up.  </P> <P> The government has plans for new settlements despite the problems of populating  older ones. It is committed to starting as many as eight in the coming year,  although it is not clear how much money is available for new settlements.  </P> <P> The United States, Israel's principal ally and donor of aid, calls the  settlements an obstacle to peace but has done nothing concrete to discourage  them.  </P></p>

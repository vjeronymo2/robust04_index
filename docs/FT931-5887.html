			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Afghan rivals agree deal to share power AFGHANISTAN'S two main warring rivals have agreed on a peace formula that should allow the arch enemies to share power in Kabul, officials said, Reuter reports from Islamabad. Under the draft accord, reachedin Islamabad and yet to be agreed by the other main mujahideen parties, President Burhanuddin Rabbani remains in power for several months, while Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, chief of the hardline Hezb-i-Islami party, becomes prime minister. 'Engineer Hekmatyar is ready to take up the post of prime minister and if there are no objections by the other groups we see no difficulty,' Mr Rabbani's spokesman, said. A few small differences remained, he said. Mr Rabbani was insisting on recognition of the assembly of nationwide delegates that last December elected him as president for the next two years but conceded to Mr Hekmatyar's demand for general elections before his term expired. Mr Hekmatyar has accused Mr Rabbani of rigging his election and subjected Kabul to a fierce bombardment to back his demand the president step down. More than 1,000 people were killed and 6,000 injured in Hekmatyar's last assault on Kabul.</p>

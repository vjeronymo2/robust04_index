			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Yugoslav mediators to confront Milosevic THE OUTCOME of the Bosnian peace talks and possible outside military intervention in the conflict may hang on today's meeting in Belgrade between Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the international mediators on the former Yugoslavia, and Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. Mr Milosevic, whom many believe to be backing Bosnian Serb aggression in Bosnia-Hercegovina, will be told Bosnian Serbs must drop their demand for a 'state-within-a-state' that could later be linked with a Greater Serbia. Mr Vance and Lord Owen regard this demand as the principal obstacle to a Bosnian settlement, and have said that if the talks break down they will not hesitate to name the party responsible. This would make almost inevitable some kind of UN-sanctioned military action against the Bosnian Serbs and perhaps Serbia itself, initially through enforcement of the no-fly zone over Bosnia. Mr Fred Eckhard, spokesman for Mr Vance and Lord Owen, said yesterday that Mr Milosevic was 'a key player' and 'in a position to push this peace process home'. He added: 'Time is running out in terms of what the international community is willing to live with.' The first session of talks between the warring Serb, Croat and mainly Moslem government factions adjourned on Monday evening, after Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb chief, said he needed to consult Serbian leaders, including Mr Milosevic. The negotiations are due to resume on Sunday.</p>

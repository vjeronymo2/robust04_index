			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 16 (YONHAP) -- South Korea received the  U.S.-drafted sanctions resolution on North Korea Wednesday and  the president approved it, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said  Thursday.    A unification and national security policy coordination  meeting convened late Wednesday reviewed the draft received  earlier in the day and agreed it was ready for United Nations  consultations, he said.    "The draft, if adopted as it is, will be very effective,  exerting great pressure on North Korea," Han said at a press  conference. "It appropriately reflects the position of South  Korea."    He predicted that it will take two to three weeks before the  draft passes discussion within the Security Council and is  finally adopted.    Meanwhile, he left the door open for dialogue with  Pyongyang,  saying it all depends on North Korea's attitude in the coming  days.    "As we have said before, the purpose of the resolution is  not  sanctions themselves but to clear up the suspicion about North  Korea's past nuclear activities and to secure nuclear  transparency for the present," said Han.    "Before or even after the resolution is adopted, the door  remains open for dialogue if North Korea carries out its  obligations under the nuclear safeguards accord and cooperates  with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)," the foreign  minister said.    The draft gives the communist state a 30-day grace period to  unconditionally comply with the nuclear safeguards agreement and  to implement the inter-Korean accord on denuclearization.    The U.S.-drafted resolution contains six points including a  mandatory ban on weapons imports and exports, partial diplomatic  sanctions, a ban on all flights except regular passenger  services, and an embargo on any technological cooperation  related to nuclear science.    These are the first-phase sanctions, he said, with  second-phase action to include freezing funds remitted to North  Korea, Han said.    The second-phase sanctions, including a freeze on all North  Korean assets abroad, would be implemented immediately in the  event of any negative behavior by Pyongyang such as withdrawing  from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT), he said.    Asked about China's position on the draft, Han said it was  probably given to Beijing late Wednesday and no reaction was yet  forthcoming.    He suggested that the next phase of sanctions could well  include a ban on China's crude oil supplies to its neighbor and  traditional ally North Korea, saying "a number of stringent  actions can be included."    "The resolution outlines clearly the conditions under which  the sanctions will be abandoned before implementation and the  conditions under which the sanctions will be stopped after  implementation begins," Han explained.    "Whether these conditions have been met sufficiently for the  involved parties to engage in dialogue, the judgement of the  IAEA is crucial," he said, suggesting that North Korea will have  to negotiate with the U.N. nuclear agency to defuse the problem.    The North announced earlier this week that it was quitting  the IAEA in retaliation for the agency's own sanctions  resolution on Pyongyang.    The foreign minister did not go into detail about specific  means of South Korean participation in the sanctions, although  the first- phase U.N. measures include suspension of bilateral  and multilateral development assistance.    "If the sanctions go into effect, there will be much for us  to do both bilaterally and multilaterally," said Han.    He indicated negotiations have been held on what to do about  inter-Korean trade activities at this point, saying "The  government does have thoughts on this issue."    "But the focus now is on U.N. measures. It would be improper  to say what the thoughts are at this point," said Han.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The section that follows describes the NCDs announced in calendar years 1991 and 1992. During that period, HCFA announced the addition of six new services and the removal of one service. By combining Medicare payment data for physician services with facility costs data, we were able to estimate the relative costs associated with providing these services. The coverage of liver transplantation for adults was estimated to cost over $100,000 per procedure, which meets the threshold to be considered ``of significant cost'' under this proposed rule. Adult liver transplantation is covered for specific conditions when performed in a facility approved by HCFA as meeting certain institutional coverage criteria. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The remaining services were estimated to have average costs that are well below the $100,000 threshold. These services are described below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Extracorporeal Immunoadsorption (ECI) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This procedure, which uses Protein A columns, is covered only for the treatment of patients with Idiopathic Thrombocytopenia Purpura (ITP) failing other treatments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Implantation of Automatic Defibrillators <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Patient selection criteria were changed to remove requirements that patients had to have inducible tachyrhythmia before implantation or that this technology be used as a treatment of last resort. Although additional patients may be covered, we believe that the savings in diagnostic costs offset additional costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This procedure is used in the treatment of obstructive lesions of arteriovenous dialysis fistulas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This surgical procedure is covered for the removal of the gall bladder.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Apheresis (Therapeutic Pheresis) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This autologous medical procedure is covered for specific conditions. Medicare coverage criteria have been updated to include coverage for procedures performed in a hospital setting (inpatient or outpatient) or in a nonhospital setting if the patient is under the care of a physician and a physician is also present to direct and supervise the nonphysician services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Extracranial-intracranial (EC&hyph;IC) Arterial Bypass <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1991 this surgical procedure was removed from the list of Medicare covered procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The only ``significant cost'' NCD service among those listed above is the liver transplant for adults. That NCD was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> as a final notice on April 12, 1991, at 56 FR 15006. The decision to cover liver transplants for adults was based on our determination that liver transplants are medically reasonable and necessary services if furnished to adult patients with certain conditions and if furnished by participating facilities that meet specific criteria including patient selection criteria. Under certain circumstances, coverage of these liver transplants could be effective as early as March 8, 1990, which was the publication date of the proposed notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . However, Medicare payment for liver transplants for beneficiaries enrolled in risk HMOs and CMPs was not included in the per capita rates of payment until January 1991. Consequently, risk HMOs and CMPs were forced to absorb any liver transplant costs (approximately $100,000 per transplant) from March 8, 1990, through December 31, 1990. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Items and services necessary to diagnose a condition for which the recommended therapy is a noncovered service, and most services furnished as followup care to the noncovered service, are not considered part of that service and are not included in the payment for that service. Medicare already covers certain diagnostic services, which may lead to a recommendation that a beneficiary receive therapy that is not covered. In addition, Medicare covers certain medically necessary services that relate to follow-up care to a noncovered service. For example, for patients who received liver transplants before March 8, 1990, outpatient diagnostic services preceding the transplant procedure were covered, as was medically necessary follow-up care after discharge from the hospital for the noncovered transplant procedure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The hospitalization for the transplant procedure would not have been covered, nor would other services received directly related to the noncovered procedure, such as the surgeon's fee for the transplant surgery itself. We consider services that would not have been covered as part of the NCD occurrence. An occurrence includes the actual provision of a discrete item or service that is the subject of an NCD. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any item or service that is already covered, such as diagnostic services followed by a noncovered therapy, as discussed above, would not be considered as part of the NCD service and thus would not be eligible for payment outside the HMO's or CMP's monthly rate. An item or service that would not have been covered if furnished as part of a noncovered procedure, such as the surgeon's fee for a noncovered liver transplant, would qualify for payment outside the HMO's or CMP's monthly rate, even though it is not itself the subject of the NCD. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1861(s)(2)(J) of the Act provides for coverage of prescription drugs used in immunosuppressive therapy for 1 year following a transplant, only if the organ transplant procedure is a covered service. Therefore, if future NCDs provide for coverage of transplantation of organs other than the presently covered kidney, liver, and heart, and are announced after publication of AAPCC rates for the contract period, immunosuppressive therapy following those organ transplants would also qualify for payment outside the HMO's or CMP's monthly rates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Collection of Information Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule contains no information collection requirements subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Response to Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because of the large number of items of correspondence we normally receive on a proposed rule, we are not able to acknowledge or respond to them individually. However, we will consider all comments that we receive by the date and time specified in the `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Dates <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '' section of this preamble, and if we proceed with the final rule, we will respond to the comments in the preamble to the final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

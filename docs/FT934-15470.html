			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Switch reported in education spending LOCAL education authorities are spending a greater share of their budgets on nursery and primary education, but secondary schools still receive a larger amount of funding, Mr Stephen Byers, Labour MP for Wallsend, said yesterday. He quoted provisional education department figures which showed that in 1991-92 a total of Pounds 1,415 was spent on each nursery or primary school pupil, compared with Pounds 2,190 for each secondary school pupil. However, 76 local education authorities in England had increased the proportion of funds spent on nursery and primary pupils over the previous two years, and only 23 had cut back.</p>

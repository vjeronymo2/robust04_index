			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOYOLA OUTLASTS PORTLAND, 126-103  </P> <P> The University of Portland has won only 13 games in the last three seasons, but  for nearly 30 minutes Thursday, the Pilots appeared ready to upset 22nd-ranked  Loyola Marymount.  </P> <P> Portland built first-half leads of double figures and had a seven-point  advantage in the second half in front of 4,886 at the Chiles Center before  Loyola ran away with a 126-103 victory.  </P> <P> The Lions got the victory behind the scoring of Bo Kimble, who had 39 points,  Hank Gathers with 31 and Jeff Fryer with 24.  </P> <P> Portland tried to run with Loyola in the second half, and was outscored, 69-42.  The Lions scored 52 points in the last 15 minutes.  </P> <P> Loyola is 14-3 overall and 5-0 in the West Coast Conference. Portland fell to  5-13 and 2-3.  </P> <P> "Our guys had to play up in the second half, and they did," Loyola Coach Paul  Westhead said. "It was not an easy win. I sensed it was going to be a game we  would have to win; it wouldn't be handed to us. The first 10, 12 minutes we  gave them reason to think that."  </P> <P> The Pilots set the pace in the first half. Led by Will McDowell's eight points  and some long-range shooting by Josh Lowery later, Portland overcame an early  deficit and led, 43-32, with 6:11 left in the half.  </P> <P> Loyola answered with a 14-4 spurt in the next two minutes to pull to within a  point, then regained the lead at 50-49 on a free throw by Gathers.  </P> <P> But Portland finished the half with a 12-7 run, held a 61-57 lead at halftime  and moved ahead 64-57 early in the second half.  </P> <P> But six minutes into the half, Loyola turned its press up a notch. The Lions  outscored the Pilots, 18-5, to take the lead for good.  </P> <P> Down the stretch, Kimble, who had been scoring mostly inside, pulled up for  four three-pointers, and Fryer added three more as the Lions hit 12 of 21 shots  from three-point range in their seventh consecutive victory.  </P> <P> McDowell finished with 29 points and 14 rebounds, and Lowery added 24 points  for the Pilots. Gathers and Kimble each had 11 rebounds. Per Stumer added 11  points -- three three-pointers -- and eight rebounds. The Lions' press forced  24 turnovers.  </P></p>

			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Welsh practices THE MISDEMEANOURS at the Welsh Development Agency revealed by a Commons committee yesterday provide a curious illustration of how not to import the culture of the private sector into public service. In terms of its commercial objectives, the WDA has been remarkably successful. With a mere 5 per cent of the UK population, Wales has in recent years grabbed 20 per cent of the UK's inward investment. Last year, against the general trend, foreign investment in Wales was higher than the year before. This was at least partly due to energetic selling and marketing along private sector lines; and in the context of a public company, some at least of the goings-on indulged in by WDA officials would scarcely raise an eyebrow. But the taxpayer demands, and is plainly entitled to, different standards. Public officials are not supposed to travel by Concorde, award themselves free petrol or conduct interviews with model girls in hotel rooms. The danger now is that the pendulum will swing the other way. The last Welsh secretary, Mr David Hunt, attributed much of Wales's success in attracting investment to close co-operation between the WDA and the Welsh Office, and indeed to active joint selling by himself and the WDA's now retired chairman. It would be scarcely surprising if the entrepreneurial instincts of the new secretary, Mr John Redwood, were tempered by yesterday's revelations. In the context of a marketing effort, which last year attracted investment of Pounds 950m and is claimed to have created over 13,000 jobs, that would be rather a pity.</p>

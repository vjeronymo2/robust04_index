			<p>Language: <F P=105> Tigrinya </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [First installment of an interview with President Isayas </F> Afewerki by local reporters; date and place not given --  recorded]    [Excerpts] [Isayas] On 16 December at a place called (Adi  Hawke), which is about 20 to 30 kms from (Shenkit), 20 armed men  who came from Sudan fought with our units in the area and were  all killed. This is not a new incident because there have been  similar clashes at the border. What makes this latest incident  more important than previous ones is that the group included two  Moroccans. These people claim they are to liberate the whole  region and that they are connected with the Jihad movement of  Afghanistan and of other regions. For the past two to three  years we have been trying to solve this issue with the Sudanese  Government in a very constructive way.    There was no practical action taken to contain or control  these activities other than empty promises. Generally speaking,  we did not want to speak out. We believed we could solve the  problem patiently and constructively because it was not our  internal problem but a foreign problem. Since the source of the  problem is Sudan, we were trying to solve it in collaboration  with the Sudanese Government and other forces in Sudan. This is  what we believed. However, while we were trying to solve the  problem such incidents continued to occur. The issue remained  outstanding.    Finally, there was this incident on 16 December. The said  people were killed and one of our unit commanders was killed.  We do not want any Eritrean killed, particularly at this time  when there is no reason for any Eritrean to be killed. We  cannot keep a death on our side a secret. We do not regard this  incident as a victory. In the past our policy was extreme  tolerance, because we did not want the issue to get out of hand,  but now it has reached this stage. We do not care about those  who were killed in the previous fighting, but because there is  no reason for a combatant to be killed now, after independence,  because we do not want such incidents to happen again, and  because we do not want the matter to be kept secret, we are  informing the public about the war which has been declared on  Eritrea and its people. [passage omitted]    We see no reason for foreigners coming all the way from  Morocco, Tunisia, Afghanistan, and Pakistan to fight in this  country. Moreover, we cannot keep silent when such a war is  declared on us, nor can we keep silent before the world. This  is because we have managed to reach this stage after a long and  protracted war. We are therefore trying our best to solve this  problem not only in the interests of our country, but also in  the interests of the region. [passage omitted]    We know how to play with fire. There are different types of  fire. We have enough experience in how to play with fire in the  past, and we no longer want to play with fire. Enough is  enough. [passage omitted] We will persevere, but this does not  mean that our patience is inexhaustible and it does not mean  that we will continue with the same policy we have been  following. The people know where their duty lies. [passage  omitted]    [Unidentified reporter] Won't such an incident negatively  affect the historical good-neighborly relations with our  neighbors, particularly when the attempts are connected with  foreign intervention from abroad?    [Isayas] The Jihad movement in Eritrea was formed by the  Sudanese National Islamic Front. This is clear to all. The  front also knows and admits the fact. It is not a secret.  [passage omitted]</p>

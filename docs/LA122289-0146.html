			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RETAILERS COUNT ON BIG WEEKEND TO SAVE SEASON  </P> <P> If only Magic Johnson could sell refrigerators. With the holiday shopping  season winding down to its final weekend, many retailers need a clutch  performance to pull off a winning Christmas.  </P> <P> Analysts expect sales gains of 5% to 8% for the season. Profits, however, have  been squeezed by the sharp markdowns being offered to bring more customers into  the stores.  </P> <P> Still, a strong showing in the last few days could swing some companies' bottom  lines "from mediocre to good," said Irving J. Weintraub, the Los Angeles  director of retail services for the Deloitte &amp; Touche accounting firm.  </P> <P> "The last week is critical," added Craig Gordon, head of Grassroots Research in  San Francisco. "A larger and larger group of people are making last-minute  purchases because time has become more precious with more two-income families."  </P> <P> Last year, a final-weekend surge gave retailers a healthy profit gain and  lifted general merchandise sales increases to nearly 9% over those of the  previous year. Until then, it had seemed like a mediocre season.  </P> <P> This weekend's sales could have added importance for some of the nation's  weaker retail concerns, particularly Campeau Corp. The Toronto-based company,  which last week disclosed a widened loss of $186 million for its third quarter,  has said it might seek bankruptcy court protection for its Federated Department  Stores and Allied Stores divisions as soon as late January.  </P> <P> Traditionally, about 50% of the annual profits at Campeau's department stores  and other major retail chains come in the quarter that includes Christmas.  </P> <P> Among the other major department store operators hoping for a boost from the  holiday shopping season is R. H. Macy &amp; Co., parent of the Bullock's, I.  Magnin and Bullocks Wilshire chains in Southern California. This month it  reported a first-quarter loss of $33.1 million. In November, Carter Hawley Hale  Stores, the Los Angeles-based parent of the Broadway department stores, posted  a loss of $13.9 million for its first quarter.  </P> <P> Some analysts expect the markdowns that consumers have seen for the past two  months to get even steeper over the final weekend of Christmas shopping. "The  reality is that there is a lot of merchandise on the floors of the stores, and  if you want to get people to buy it now, you've got to lower prices," Weintraub  said.  </P> <P> Others said, however, that most retailers don't appear to have gotten desperate  to drum up business. Consequently, they said, consumers generally won't see  across-the-board price cuts in the 50% range until after Christmas, if at all.  </P> <P> Retailers' relatively ample inventories, analysts said, should mean that  customers will still have a fairly good selection of merchandise. "There will  be hot items that are missing, but people generally should be able to find what  they want," said Elizabeth A. Armstrong of Johnson Redbook Service.  </P> <P> Although the final word is yet to be written on retailers' profits, the hit  products already have emerged. According to a nationwide survey of 422 stores  by Grassroots Research, the hot sellers at department stores have been  turtlenecks and other types of sweaters, leather jackets and denim and fleece  clothing.  </P> <P> Other big sellers have been electronic games, VCRs and video cameras, or  camcorders. Large appliances, on the other hand, have moved slowly.  </P> <P> At the discounters, Grassroots found, such items as the Teenage Mutant Ninja  Turtle action figures, Nintendo video game products and such classic dolls as  Barbie and G.I. Joe have led the way. On the other hand, the Pee Wee Herman  line of clothing and the Donald Trump board game are going nowhere.  </P> <P> Grassroots reported that specialty stores have sold lots of leather bomber  jackets, Rock'n Flowers and sweaters, but that sweat suits and clothing in neon  colors have fared poorly.  </P> <P> Generally speaking, analysts said, consumers have been spending cautiously,  looking hard for bargains.  </P></p>

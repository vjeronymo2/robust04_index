			<p>BFN     [Text] Kigali, 7 Apr (AFP) -- Three Rwandan ministers  opposed to President Juvenal Habyarimana who died yesterday, and  three UN military observers posted to guard them, were today  "kidnapped" by elements of the Presidential Guard, a spokesman  of the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR] disclosed. The  kidnapping of the ministers and the UN observers is "a  reprehensible act that we view with utmost concern," the  spokesman added. The three ministers, who were kidnapped at  their homes with their families in some cases, were Information  Minister Faustin Rucogoza, Agriculture Minister Frederic  Nzamurambaho, and Labor Minister Landouald Ndasingwa, the UNAMIR  spokesman specified.    Mr. Rucogoza is a member of the Republican Democratic  Movement, the main Rwandan opposition party, and Mr.  Nzamurambaho belongs to the Social Democratic Party while Mr.  Ndasingwa leads the Tutsi branch of the Liberal Party. The  government formed in July by President Juvenal Habyarimana  included ministers from the opposition. The "broad-based"  interim government, which was expected to have been put in place  early this year, was also expected to include members of the  Rwandan Patriotic Front, a former armed rebel movement of the  minority Tutsi ethnic group.    Sporadic shooting continued to be heard in several districts  of Kigali this afternoon but no casualty list has been drawn up  on these clashes which, apparently, involve youths and the Army,  UNAMIR added. The UNAMIR spokesman also disclosed that the  Presidential Guard today, without explanation, denied his  organization access to the spot where the Rwandan president's  plane crashed yesterday evening. Consequently, the UN office in  Kigali is unable to confirm the Rwandan Defense Ministry's  statement according to which the presidential plane was shot  down by "unidentified armed elements."</p>

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Books: Mislead by economists - Kit McMahon questions some dubious economic forecasting LOST PROPHETS by Alfred L. Malabre Jr Harvard Business School Press When The Way the World Works by Jude Wanniski was published in 1978, Mr Barton Biggs, the Morgan Stanley guru, gave it as his considered opinion that it was the most important economic work since Karl Marx. (Biggs is currently in the news for telling Morgan Stanley's clients to get out of China/Hong Kong only six weeks after telling them to bundle in. Perhaps if his earlier judgment had been more widely known, his recent advice would have been received more dispassionately.) Jude Wanniski, together with Art Laffer and Paul Craig Roberts, led the Supply Side movement in the US in the late 1970s and early 1980s and captured bigger fish than Biggs. Their talisman was the so-called 'Laffer Curve', a simple device which could be, and was, drawn on a thousand paper napkins in restaurants all over the country. Their message was simple and seductive: the way to cut the public deficit was to reduce taxes. Martin Feldstein, sometime Chairman of the US Council of Economic Advisers, pointed out at the time, this was 'something a Congressman could digest in about 30 seconds and then talk about for months'. The Wall St Journal was very enthusiastic and played its part in convincing President Reagan - no very difficult task, to be sure. Of course it ended in tears as such movements do, with some saying they had been sceptical all along, some forgetting all about it and some saying it had never really been tried. But it provides the most dramatic and enjoyable of the case studies presented in Alfred L. Malabre's Lost Prophets, a book whose thesis is that since the war the economics profession has systematically misled the politicians and the general public by promoting a series of over-optimistic over-simplified economic nostrums. Before the supply siders (fortunately never as powerful on this side of the Atlantic as on the other) were the monetarists - who inflicted, if anything, more damage here than in the US. Roughly contemporary with both were the Rational Expectations men who believed that everybody expected what they expected (which is why they styled the expectations rational): as a result they claimed that all economic action by government would be doomed to failure. Before all these people there were the naive Keynesians, loudly preaching that the business cycle was dead or that it was in governments' power to kill it. Before that again, according to Malabre, was the delusive fantasy of the Bretton Woods system. But just a minute. The Bretton Woods system of fixed but adjustable exchange rates lasted for some 25 years and - to put it as neutrally as possible - coincided with the greatest period of non-inflationary high employment growth that the world has seen this century. Of course it reached its sell-by date. Malabre could legitimately have attacked those who, after the system had broken down in the early 1970s, tried to put Humpty Dumpty together again. But to mock a regime which was so successful at the time on the basis that nowadays there is no alternative for the dollar but to float is to miss a lot of points. The trouble with this book is that Malabre does not carry the critical guns with which to accomplish the demolition jobs he is attempting - except when the targets are as big as a barn door - which admittedly a lot of them are. We have certainly been beset by nostrums - and many of them, and especially the lurches from one to another, have done us a lot of harm. So, on the principle that my enemy's enemy is my friend, much in this book is to be welcomed. But much of it, sadly, is pretty mushy. A large cast of little known economists is cited in evidence against a lot of other scarcely better known ones, in conversations recalled from long-forgotten conferences held over the decades in outstanding American beauty spots. Malabre's own view emerges as one of extreme pragmatism: in particular, that the business cycle is rather like the weather - nothing can be done about it. This may be true, but the trouble is that he then cannot resist giving us his own methods of forecasting, on the basis of interviews with businessmen. He creates a whole theory of the business cycle from what he says he used to learn at the annual conferences of consumer goods salesmen. A glance at his CV, however, shows that he only attended three of them. A smallish sample.</p>

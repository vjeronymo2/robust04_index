			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (16): A conflict of interests  -The role of accountants in MBOs has come into question CONFLICT and economic uncertainty are vexing many of the accountancy firms involved in the buy-out market of the early 1990s. Most remain bullish about prospects for business. But they are having to adapt their cultures to match new demands on their services. Mr Richard Mead, national director of corporate finance at Ernst &amp; Young, says: 'It's been a funny market recently and very different from two years ago. But we have had a relatively good flow of business, particularly in our regional offices.' Mr Andy Pollock, senior partner of Rees Pollock, a small firm started just over two years ago by accountants from Ernst &amp; Young, is optimistic. 'There is money around,' he says. 'As interest rates fall, there will be a better rate of return.' What does continue is what he calls the 'lunchtime entrepreneurs' who say they are interested in MBOs. He says he can screen out those who will not make it when they start asking about the hours involved, their salary and whether they will be able to keep the company car. For others, the volume of business has slowed to some degree, in part because deals are taking longer to come to fruition. The difficulties have been particularly intense for the larger prospective MBOs. The main problem, according to Mr Mead, is the paucity of senior debt. Banks which need to syndicate loans for the larger MBOs have lacked the confidence to do so. 'We are much busier than we were three or four years ago,' says Mr Chris Beresford, head of the MBO unit at KPMG Peat Marwick. 'But there is a degree of nervousness around.' He says banks realise they are more vulnerable after some of the highly leveraged deals of the late 1980s failed. They also face the uncertainty of the UK economy. The accountants' role in MBOs needs to be kept in perspective. Mr Beresford pours scorn on those firms claiming to hold sway in deals. 'It's not realistic,' he says. 'You can only say you have lead a deal if you have structured, financed and negotiated its terms.' There is a possibility that accountancy firms could provide for finance for deals. But the prospects are negligible - even apart from the issue of expertise. 'We haven't got the money,' says Mr Mead. More importantly, accountants financing deals would raise further potential conflicts of interest, he says. 'As soon as we do that, we are out of the contest for on-going audit work and we like to develop a long-term relationship.' That is because existing professional ethical rules forbid an auditor from holding shares in a client company. Mr Mead says that, as far as Ernst &amp; Young is concerned, it would apply equally to other on-going services for a client. In fact, the accounting firms' activities in MBOs involve two principal areas: Personal and corporate tax, business structuring, business plan development and other advisory work to the management team. Investigating accountancy and due diligence work for the financiers considering backing the MBO. Mr Beresford estimates that his firm spends about three times as many hours on investigation work as on advisory work for management teams. On the one hand, management advisory work can be far more commercially attractive, he says. On the other, a good relationship needs to be maintained with the finance houses by bringing them deals, to ensure that they turn to the firm to pass on due diligence work. That means bringing the teams to finance institutions. One aspect of the work which can raise tensions with other, more conservative parts of the accountancy firms is the application of contingency fees, geared around payment only if the buy-out is successful. 'We prefer not to have contingency fees,' says Mr Beresford. 'We are still very old-fashioned. We think of working for an hour and getting paid for an hour. But we have got used to the idea, with a premium for success and a modest fee for failure.' A second area that is causing increasing tensions is the possibility of conflict of interest. Mr Pollock's firm tries to generate most work from finance houses such as 3i and AIB Capital Markets. 'Can you be truly independent if you introduce MBOs?' he says. 'It's a very grey area. On the other hand, you need to bring them in if you want the finance houses to bring deals to you. We don't want to be cut off.' He asks whether an accountant can be objective. In the extreme, they may strike a bargain with financiers to whom they have made the introduction but from whom they are looking for other business. They could be carrying out due diligence on numbers they have have audited and on projections they may have prepared. They may ultimately hope to gain the audit of the numbers once the deal is done. Mr Douglas Llambias, chief executive of the Business Exchange, a network of professionals for buying and selling businesses for up to about Pounds 20m, says he will not accept the accountants trying to introduce potential deals to levy contingency fees, or for the company's auditor to carry out advisory work. 'Contingency fees are not appropriate,' he says. 'When the potential fees are large, the pressure is enormous to get the deal done whether it is for the best or not.' With regard to the auditor, he sees it as 'improper' that a firm supposedly acting in the best interests of the shareholders should be able to support a buy-out. Mr Beresford admits that some finance houses not happy with the accountants bringing them the deal and also conducting the due diligence. But he says: 'You have to be grown up about it. I would far rather it was a friendly guy from my own firm who found an error rather than someone from a rival firm. If there is a problem it is in everyone's interests that it is unearthed.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LEADING ACCOUNTANTS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                           Number of deals  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- KPMG Peat Marwick                                     128 Coopers &amp; Lybrand                                      69 Price Waterhouse                                       54 Touche Ross                                            44 Ernst &amp; Young                                          41 Arthur Andersen                                        33 Others/none/not known/(duplication)                    10  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL                                                 379  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Qualification: acted in pounds 10 million plus deals  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: KPMG Corporate Finance  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

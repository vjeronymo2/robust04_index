			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Background and Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Regulatory History <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> On February 13, 1990, the Coast Guard published [55 FR 5120] a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) entitled Stability Design and Operational Regulations. During the 60-day comment period, the Coast Guard received 28 letters. Only 2 of the 28 included comments on the standards for damage stability of new domestic passenger vessels in the proposed rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On September 11, 1992, the Coast Guard published [57 FR 41812] a final rule, also entitled Stability Design and Operational Regulations. This adopted standards from the proposed rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On December 10, 1992, the final rule went into effect. Soon afterward, the Coast Guard received inquiries on the appropriateness of the standards, now in 46 CFR 171.808(e), for certain new domestic passenger vessels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 7, 1993, the Coast Guard published [58 FR 36374] a notice to announce a public meeting on August 5, 1993. This meeting was to discuss what problems were being encountered in complying with the standards and what measures might be appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On August 5, 1993, at the public meeting, discussions occurred on the application of the standards to certain new domestic passenger vessels, especially those operating in protected and partially-protected waters. Comments indicated that some designers were encountering unexpected difficulties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Coast Guard believes that compliance with the current standards is feasible, and achievable with minimal changes in design. But it also believes that it can relax those standards on certain waters without unreasonably degrading safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On August 27, 1993, therefore, in response to requests that it reconsider the standards to apply on certain waters, the Coast Guard published [58 FR 45264] a notice temporarily suspending &sect;171.080(e), for all vessels without SOLAS Passenger Ship Certificates, and reopening the comment period for 90 days. The delay would also allow further research by the Coast Guard into the application of the standard to new domestic passenger vessels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On February 25, 1994, in response to the comments received, the Coast Guard both published a notice of intent to issue this NPRM and indefinitely extended the temporary suspension of &sect;171.080(e), for all vessels without SOLAS Passenger Ship Certificates [59 FR 9099]. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Reasons for Reconsidering Standards for Damage Stability <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Even as recently as February 13, 1990, the sudden growth in the number of excursion vessels and gambling vessels on protected and partially-protected waters, especially western rivers, was unforeseen. By December 10, 1992, therefore, when the current standards came into effect, further research and investigation of the impact of the standards on these vessels had become necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Coast Guard extended its work with the Volpe Transportation Systems Center of the Department of Transportation to examine at least six more vessels as we had examined a number earlier in the regulatory process. The six vessels so far submitted for examination ply mainly protected and partially-protected waters; they include gambling vessels, a type not examined closely in the earlier study. A detailed analysis of the failures, design changes and economic impact will be available in the regulatory docket when the study concludes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Comments on Final Rule of December 10, 1992 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Comments on Final Rule in General <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Nine comments conceded that some degree of after-damage stability is needed. Three comments maintained that the current regulations aim at ensuring ``total survivability'' rather than a reasonable degree of safety. Three comments urged that the regulations should not be relaxed without more evidence that relaxing them is necessary, and even then not without following the correct legal procedure. Two comments stated that suspending a regulation already in effect 6 months was unlawful; they stated further that no balance was achieved in this suspension, that the suspension favored purely shipyards, owners and operators, and naval architects, and that no response had arrived from passengers, crews, or insurance underwriters. One comment, further, stated that 3 years had been necessary to accomplish the regulation, 11/2 months to emasculate it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment stated that, far from needing a relaxed standard, vessels on inland rivers might need a standard more stringent than that of SOLAS. Inland rivers face many dangers not considered in the development of international standards, including treacherous currents and heavy traffic. New standards for vessels on these rivers should actually increase residual buoyancy and reduce heel and trim to facilitate evacuation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two comments questioned the use of the standard from SOLAS for coastwise domestic routes as well as inland routes. Two more questioned its use for any domestic route, even for exposed waters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Response to Comments on Final Rule in General <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Coast Guard agrees that passenger safety is its primary concern and that the old standards for damage stability were grossly inadequate. The Coast Guard disagrees that the current standards aim at, let alone ensure, ``total survivability.'' However, the Coast Guard is bound to consider seriously the input received from the industry, and to determine whether these standards are having a greater impact than intended. The Coast Guard has invited and will continue to invite comment on these standards from all interested parties, observing that it cannot force those sectors of the industry not heard from to develop a position on these standards. However, in everyone's interest, the Coast Guard makes safety its primary concern in all standards for vessel design. The Coast Guard followed proper legal procedures in the suspension of these standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Coast Guard agrees that smaller vessels, with fewer passengers, should receive less burdensome treatment. However, where these vessels venture into exposed waters, the hazard to them is much greater than to large ones. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Responding to reasoned comments, the Coast Guard considers the best approach one that applies standards in tiers: full rigor for craft most vulnerable (for whatever reason, including exposure of waters), less rigor for those less vulnerable. This approach has determined the shape of this proposed rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

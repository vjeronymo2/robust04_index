			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 9 (CTK) -- The new chairman of the  Bohemian and Moravian Chamber of Trade Unions (CMKOS), Richard  Falbr said today the speech which Premier Vaclav Klaus delivered  at the CMKOS congress on Friday [8 April] indicated that  "nothing nice and nothing pleasant is awaiting us."    "I would like to create a team of people who would be good  opponents to our social partners (the government and employers)  who sometimes do not behave like partners," Falbr told the  delegates shortly after his election.    He promised to do everything to improve union activity. "I  will proceed from the achievements of the Bohemian and Moravian  Chamber of Trade Unions," he stressed.    The congress continues at 9:00 a.m. today. The names of the  four deputy chairmen to be elected by the CMKOS Assembly during  the night are to be announced on Saturday [9 April]. Falbr is  expected to deliver a speech after the delegates approve  congress documents.</p>

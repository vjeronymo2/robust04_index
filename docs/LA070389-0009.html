			<p><P> July 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INDIA TRADE  </P> <P> The U.S. government's response to the crisis in China has been, by all  accounts, measured and resonable, supportive of democratic aspirations. Yet its  response to the so-called "trade problem" with the vibrant democracy of India  has been only slightly short of hysterical.  </P> <P> Instead of supporting the attempts being made by India, which despite an  autarkic past has liberalized imports, opened up hitherto unreachable markets  and indulged market economics to an unprecedented extent, the Administration  has sought to isolate these trends by threatening trade retaliation for those  things that have not yet been done. How ridiculously shortsighted!  </P> <P> Why is it that we always seem to cut off our collective nose to spite our face?  </P> <P> ROHIT SHUKLA  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

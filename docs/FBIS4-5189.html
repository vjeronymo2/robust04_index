			<p>BFN     [Text] The second session of the first National Assembly  opened on the morning of 5 April and closed cheerlessly at noon.  According to those watching the situation, this was a work  failure. They have compared this session to the opening session  of the constituent assembly on 2 July 1993. This is because  nothing of importance happened at this session, except that  assembly members -- some standing and some sitting -- listened  to the message from His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk and a  report by the National Assembly Standing Committee.    Sar Sa-at, a member of the Commission for Interior, National  Defense, Investigation, and Suppression, admitted that this  session was useless because one of the major items was withdrawn  from the agenda. He believes, however, that there will be many  major items at the next session relating to the debate and  adoption of a number of bills the government is forwarding to  the National Assembly. Sar Sa-at further said that because of  differing views, this session seemed unimportant. It was  legally correct, however, which is something necessary for the  National Assembly.    What was termed a failure was the disagreement during  adoption of the agenda on examining the validity of new people's  representatives. The mistake of using improper words in the  third item created a problem that caused the last two items to  be withdrawn without hesitation by a number of assembly members.  On this occasion, 41 were in favor of the items being withdrawn  and 15 against; 44 abstained. There were 100 members present  with 20 absentees.    A National Assembly official from FUNCINPEC [National United  Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative  Cambodia] said: The withdrawal took place because there was no  compromise. If there was a compromise along with the legal  factor, a way out could have been found... [ellipsis as printed]  What this official said seemed reasonable, based on what the  National Assembly did earlier. It is still remembered that  during the election of the National Assembly's second vice  chairman, voting had to be done in four rounds. His Excellency  Son Soubert was a candidate three times after failing to get  support twice. Taking democracy into consideration, this is  unacceptable! Compromise, however, is an important factor in  undoing a hidden knot.    Be that as it may, the National Assembly was widely  criticized by outsiders and by its own members for the loss of  full democracy due to this compromise. The National Assembly  was perhaps trying to answer this criticism at this session by  not advocating compromise to solve the issue of the third item  on the agenda. The National Assembly tried to adhere seriously  to the law and democracy. It was noticed that the session was  conducted solely on legal grounds.    Some have criticized the National Assembly Standing  Committee  and the government for the adjournment and unimportance of the  session. The Standing Committee did not do its work properly and  clearly. The government was late in forwarding bills to the  National Assembly, which in turn caused problems for the  National Assembly Standing Committee in organizing the agenda.  One obvious fact, though, is this: The two major political  parties, which have about the same number of people's  representatives, did not have any intention of examining and  adopting the issue of the validity of the new people's  representatives during this session.    Some analysts hold that if the two parties were willing to  find a way out on the issue of new people's representatives, it  would not have been difficult. There could be some intrigues  between the two political parties behind the shelving of this  issue for a while, even for a short while.    A FUNCINPEC official said that the validity issue is a  complex one. He refused to elaborate to our correspondent on  what this complexity is. We know that the validity issue  concerns 18 people's representatives -- five from the Cambodian  People's Party [CPP] and 13 from FUNCINPEC -- who are to replace  18 people's representatives who are taking up public functions,  which is incompatible with the role of people's representative.    There are hints that FUNCINPEC does not like two CPP  people's  representatives -- namely, Prince Kromkhun Chakkrapong and Sin  Song -- because the two already renounced their people's  representative status when UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in  Cambodia] was still in Cambodia. Furthermore, the case of Nguon  Non, who is replacing Khin Yean, could also cause some problems.  The same FUNCINPEC official also said that FUNCINPEC will  support the inclusion of Nguon Non despite some difficulties.    Some analysts think that the inclusion of the new people's  representatives could be done if the two parties make mutual  concessions. Another noteworthy point is that FUNCINPEC may not  want its men who were elected in the first place to leave the  National Assembly.    Some clues have been uncovered that this is also connected  with monetary benefit. It is known how big the salary of a  people's representative is compared to that of ministers and  provincial and municipal governors and deputy governors...  [ellipsis as printed]    Whatever the reasons, we hold that the Constitution should  be  respected and the National Assembly Standing Committee ought to  be courageous in its decision on this issue based on the law.  Now that the two political parties think of themselves as  democratic, they ought to be genuinely so.</p>

			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEGISLATORS BACK TOUGH ETHICS BILL;  </P> <P> STATE GOVERNMENT: CONFLICT-OF-INTEREST PENALTIES ARE PART OF THE LANDMARK  PACKAGE. IT IS TIED TO VOTER APPROVAL OF PAY-RAISE LEGISLATION.  </P> <P> Seeking to boost the Legislature's sagging public image, top state lawmakers  agreed Thursday on a landmark package of new ethical standards, including the  first conflict-of-interest penalties for legislators.  </P> <P> Billed by supporters as one of the toughest ethics codes in the nation, the  legislation would also ban outside speaking fees for legislators, place a $250  limit on gifts, and restrict lobbying by ex-officials. These three provisions,  however, would take effect only if voters approve a June 5 ballot measure  paving the way for a legislative pay increase.  </P> <P> In a significant departure from existing laws, the bipartisan proposal also  would make it a crime for a member of the State Board of Equalization who  accepts $250 or more from a campaign donor to vote on any matter -- such as a  tax break -- affecting the contributor.  </P> <P> The legislation was spurred in large part by the recent conviction of  then-state Sen. Joseph B. Montoya and the indictment of former state Sen. Paul  Carpenter -- now a member of the Board of Equalization -- on a variety of  political corruption charges. A Los Angeles Times poll in January showed that  most voters believe it is a common practice for legislators to take bribes.  </P> <P> After more than a year of public debate and back-room negotiations, the ethics  package was approved unanimously by a two-house conference committee that  included the Legislature's highest leaders -- signaling that the measure is  almost certain to win approval from both the Senate and the Assembly.  </P> <P> "It's a major step forward as far as ethics reform in the state Legislature and  I think it's a model for all legislatures," said Senate President Pro Tem David  A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), who chaired the committee. "Basic remuneration has  to come from the people so there is no conflict of interest in who a legislator  is beholden to."  </P> <P> But some critics of the measure contended that it is flawed and does not go far  enough in curbing abuses. For example, they pointed out, the bill still would  allow legislators to receive thousands of dollars in free trips. Others argued  that the bill's conflict-of-interest provisions are too weak and that local  elected officials who vote to benefit their own financial interests face much  stricter penalties.  </P> <P> ntil now, it has been against the law for legislators to engage in votes that  constitute a conflict of interest, but the law has been irrelevant because  there is no penalty. Under the bill, legislators who vote to enrich themselves  would be subject to a fine of up to $2,000. Local officials, on the other hand,  already can be charged with a misdemeanor or fined three times the amount of  money they have gained as a result of their improper vote.  </P> <P> "I hope we don't make the mistake of pretending this bill is more than it is,"  said Assembly Republican Leader Ross Johnson of La Habra, who also served on  the committee. "This proposal has several loopholes and omissions that could  have, and should have, been corrected in this committee."  </P> <P> As part of an effort to secure a pay increase for legislators, some of the most  significant elements of the ethics plan are tied to Proposition 112 on the June  ballot.  </P> <P> If approved by the voters, Proposition 112 would create a commission with the  power to set new salaries for legislators, who complain that they now receive  only $40,816 a year plus a tax-free expense allowance and a state-subsidized  car. At the same time, the proposed constitutional amendment would require the  Legislature to impose stricter ethical standards on its members.  </P> <P> Roberti and the citizens' lobbying group Common Cause had urged legislators to  enact such legislation before June so that voters would know precisely what  ethics measures would take effect if they vote for Proposition 112.  </P> <P> The legislation approved Thursday by Roberti, Johnson, Assembly Speaker Willie  Brown (D-San Francisco) and other leaders from both parties includes a wide  range of measures.  </P> <P> The bill would prohibit legislators from accepting outside speaking fees or  other cash payments that are commonly known as honorariums. The practice of  accepting honorariums from special-interest groups has been widely criticized,  particularly since Montoya was videotaped accepting a $3,000 payment from an  undercover FBI agent.  </P> <P> The leaders also agreed to set a limit of $250 on gifts to legislators from a  single source each year. However, certain free trips sponsored by  special-interest groups would be allowed, such as travel within the United  States to give a speech.  </P> <P> rown had initially balked at voting for the legislation, complaining that it  would prohibit him from accepting free tickets to such events as the Academy  Awards and the Super Bowl. But ultimately he agreed to support the ethics  package, noting that he could pay for his own tickets if necessary.  </P> <P> In addition, the legislation would prohibit legislators and top government  officials from lobbying their former colleagues for 12 months after leaving  office.  </P> <P> All three of these provisions -- the ban on speaking fees, the limit on gifts  and the restrictions on lobbying -- would take effect only if voters approve  Proposition 112.  </P> <P> However, the conflict-of-interest provisions affecting legislators and the  Board of Equalization would become law regardless of the vote on the  proposition.  </P> <P> The provision affecting the Board of Equalization marks the first time the  Legislature will treat a campaign contribution as a payment that can result in  a conflict of interest.  </P> <P> Members of the board, who often decide tax appeals for individual corporate  taxpayers, could face criminal prosecution and ouster from office if they voted  on a matter benefiting a campaign contributor.  </P> <P> James Wheaton, executive director of Common Cause, praised the legislative  leadership for approving the ethics package and urged voters to pass  Proposition 112.  </P> <P> "This is landmark legislation," Wheaton said. "It is the first step to wean  legislators from the flow of special-interest dollars."  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEXT STEP  </P> <P> The ethics measure next goes to the Senate and Assembly. If it receives  approval as expected in both houses, it will be sent to Gov. George Deukmejian  for his signature. Major portions of the legislation would take effect only if  the voters approve Proposition 112 on the June ballot. The new ethics standards  would take effect Jan. 1, 1991.  </P></p>

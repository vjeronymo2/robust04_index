			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW;  </P> <P> FLEUR DE VIN: A LITTLE PROVENCE IN PASADENA  </P> <P> Fleur de Vin has a shrewdly chosen wine list and about a dozen wines available  by the glass. It has a big bar and comforting old paintings on the walls. This  is misleading.  </P> <P> What's really going on here at the wind-swept corner of Raymond and Green  streets in Pasadena is not some wine-drinker's hangout but a Provencal  restaurant. Or rather, a restaurant of Provencal and associated cuisines.  </P> <P> The cooking of Southern France is oddly under-represented in our part of the  world, in view of the fact that it was part of the original inspiration for  nouvelle cuisine. Like Italian food, it's based on fresh vegetables and hearty  earthy stuff like garlic and olives and mushrooms, rather than the rich  ingredients of haute cuisine.  </P> <P> Here and there, actual Italian dishes have invaded Provence. Bagna caoda is  one: a huge basket of raw vegetables, including whole fennel root with feathery  leaves, to be dipped in a a pot of thin anchovy-flavored sauce. (Fleur de Vin  also adds a pot of the typical Provencal garlicky mayonnaise aioli.) A salad  made of mesclun, defined on the menu as "a whimsical mixture of several  lettuces," is basically Provencal. Those would be baby lettuces, of course, in  a slightly mustardy dressing, earthily scattered with pine nuts and thick-cut  bacon.  </P> <P> On the other hand, the one dish identified as Provencal, veal flank with  Provencal vegetables, comes with the same vegetables as everything else:  zucchini in tomato sauce; cold, cooked sweet peppers and a little square of  gratinee potatoes. Here it looks as if we've finally wandered into nouvelle  cuisine territory, the veal having been sliced and arranged in a fan shape,  except that it isn't sliced paper-thin and the sauce is a good old-fashioned  one of reduced red wine and shallots.  </P> <P> Actually, a lot of quite successful dishes could pass equally well as nouvelle  or exoticized Provencal. Which would you call the chicken breast on its bed of  chanterelle mushrooms and leek greens? The breast of pheasant with its  mushrooms and tiny little bit of tart black currant sauce? The seafood  fricassee, with its clams, mussels and shrimp in a strong saffron cream sauce?  </P> <P> Something called ahi gazpacho, though, does seem to come from the nouvelle  side, and not the most beloved strain either. It's scarcely a soup at all,  rather a thick cold sauce of pureed sweet peppers and green onions with a  little square slice of raw tuna in the middle; a diverting appetizer, but you  wouldn't sit still for a large helping.  </P> <P> And the filet Roquefort, a tender bud of steak topped with melted Roquefort  cheese accompanied by a moderately sweet port wine sauce, is unexpectedly  Continental. Misconceived, to boot, since you'd have to scrape away most of the  cheese to taste the steak.  </P> <P> The desserts are uniformly satisfying, except maybe the severely simple poached  pear served in a little bit of wine-flavored syrup. Others include a nice sharp  lemon tart, a quite good creme brulee and a rich and eggy chocolate mousse.  </P> <P> Above all, there is spectacular caramel ice cream. People who idly take their  first mouthful without paying attention are likely to stop in mid-chew,  transfixed by its impossible creaminess and wonderful fresh caramel flavor.  </P> <P> We need more Provencal food around here. Here's a suggestion to help popularize  it: It's all but impossible to finish all the raw vegetables of the bagna  caoda, so the customer should be allowed to take home the leftovers. Not in a  doggy bag, of course, but a bunny bag.  </P> <P>  Fleur de Vin, 70 S. Raymond Ave., Pasadena. (818) 795-0085. Open for lunch  Tuesday through Friday, dinner Tuesday through Sunday. Full bar. One-hour  validated parking nearby. Major credit cards accepted. Dinner for two, food  only, $50-$67.  </P> <P> </P></p>

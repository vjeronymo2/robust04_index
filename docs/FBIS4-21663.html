			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Ivantsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 31 TASS -- Russia would like to take  part in the organisation which will succeed the Coordinating  Committee on Export Controls (Cocom), which ceases its existence  as of April first according to a decision taken by Cocom's  representatives during a meeting held in a suburb of the Hague.    Cocom's "death" symbolizes the disappearance of one more  relic from the "Cold War." Cocom was formed in 1949 by the NATO  countries with Australia and Japan to establish strict controls  over the export of strategically important technologies and raw  materials to the socialist bloc countries.    As far as Cocom's "successor" is concerned, it will not be a  structure similar to its predecessor, but basically a new  organization which should implement an international programme  to monitor the movement of arms and dual-use technologies,  ITAR-TASS learned from reliable sources.    The new organization should forestall the purchase of such  goods for military purposes, but will hopefully not be aimed  against one state of group of states.    Work on an agreement concerning the new organization is due  to begin in the near future. China, Poland, Hungary, the Czech  Republic and Slovakia have announced their interest in being  part of the Cocom-successor organization. So far, a decision  has been made to found three working groups which will outline  the main purposes of the future international institution.    Consultations on the approaches of various countries to the  problem of export control will be continued. Russia has already  taken part in such negotiations and is ready to continue to play  an active role in them on a partner-like basis.    The most important question remains that of working out an  effective international control mechanism which will replace the  old principles and help maintain the necessary high level of  knowledge about the spread of strategic technologies and  materials.</p>

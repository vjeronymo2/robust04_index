			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WEMBLEY INDOOR MATCH DROPPED  </P> <P> The men's indoor tennis tournament held here each autumn for the last 14 years  was dropped today when its chief sponsor pulled out, citing "changes in the  men's professional tour."  </P> <P> Promoters said they had considered all alternatives and "regrettably, there is  no other acceptable course available to us."  </P> <P> The tournament, first known as the Benson and Hedges Championships, was to have  been staged Nov. 5-11. But tournament director Len Owen said the sponsors were  concerned that, with that week designated as a "free week" by the Assn. of  Tennis Professionals, "we faced the threat of exhibition matches featuring top  players being staged against us."  </P></p>

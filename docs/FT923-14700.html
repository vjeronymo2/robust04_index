			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Airlines set to lose Dollars 2bn this year THE AIRLINE industry is set to lose about Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1bn) this year on international scheduled services because too many aircraft are flying in a sluggish airline market, latest estimates of the International Air Transport Association, the Geneva trade organisation grouping over 200 airlines, show. Traffic is showing signs of recovery, but not as quickly as the industry had hoped. European traffic appears to have been hit hardest and has failed to show a strong rebound. Officials said yesterday that without a sharp turnaround in economic activity in the second half of this year, the industry would show another big loss. Mr Gunter Eser, IATA director-general, said airlines had lost a record Dollars 4.7bn on international services in 1991 after losing Dollars 2.7bn in 1990. He urged airlines to cut capacity to match real demand and adopt a more entrepreneurial approach to their business. 'If airlines want to survive in the longer term, they must behave like any other industry and stop losing money by flying empty seats.' Airlines are continuing to maintain high-capacity levels to protect their market shares in the hope of recovery in traffic. But continuing losses are expected to squeeze even further the financially weaker carriers. IATA figures show airline operating revenues last year on international services totalled Dollars 91.7bn, with expenses at Dollars 92.3bn, resulting in a Dollars 600m operating loss. Airlines also faced net interest charges of Dollars 3.4bn last year, swelling the total loss to Dollars 4.7bn in 1991. 'This was the worst result in the history of aviation. The best thing that can be said about 1991 is that it is over,' said Mr Tom Murphy, IATA director of traffic and financial services. Airlines would have had to charge an average Dollars 15 more for each ticket sold, to break even last year, since they were not able to cut capacity to match demand. Capacity grew 0.3 per cent last year while traffic fell 3 per cent. It was the first fall since the jet aircraft was introduced, reflecting the recession and the fall in air travel caused by the Gulf crisis. This year, international passenger traffic has risen 8 per cent over 1990 (the year before the Gulf war slump) but airline capacity was still 12 per cent higher than in 1990. The industry lost nearly 50,000 jobs last year with employment falling by 3.4 per cent to 1.45m people in IATA member airlines. Another problem is the widening gap between low discounted fares and premium business and first-class fares.</p>

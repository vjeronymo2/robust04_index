			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Collor refuses to quit presidency during trial PRESIDENT Fernando Collor of Brazil will not resign, his spokesman said yesterday, despite his crushing defeat in a Congressional vote that opens the way to an impeachment trial in the Senate. This would leave Brazil with an acting president and a suspended president until the conclusion of Mr Collor's trial within the next six months. He is accused of benefiting from extensive corruption while in office. In Braslia yesterday, there was discussion over how to transfer power to Vice-President Itamar Franco after the vote in the House of Representatives on Tuesday night. He is likely to be declared acting president today. Mr Franco is preparing an emergency programme, to be announced when he is confirmed in office. His spokesman said his main concern was a return to economic growth after three years of recession. The programme would include tax reform and health and education changes. Mr Collor's cabinet, incuding economy minister Mr Marclio Marques Moreira, resigned yesterday, although ministers will stay as caretakers until their successors are named. The only appointment in view so far is that of Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso as foreign minister. The festivity and excitement which greeted the the impeachment vote has continued across the country. Street parties went on until dawn and statues were painted in the national colours of green and yellow to celebrate the 441:38 landslide vote forimpeachment. Demonstrator after demonstrator proclaimed: 'We're proud to be Brazilians'. The result of the vote and the formal request for Mr Collor's suspension from office was handed in the morning by Mr Ibsen Pinheiro, House chairman, to Mr Mauro Benevides, Senate chairman. The former said the request contained 'a profound lesson for the whole nation and a clear demonstration of the strength of our institutions .. We have given the world a lesson in democracy'. Mr Collor spent his last day in the presidential palace contemplating the apparent demise of a political career that seemed promising when he assumed office in March 1990 as the country's first directly elected president for 30 years, and its youngest. Aides yesterday described his mood as 'serene', but admitted that he had reacted furiously to the result of the vote, berating numerous Congressmen for having 'betrayed' him, and toying with the idea of making an angry address to the nation. Mr Etewaldo Dias, his spokesman, said yesterday Mr Collor would collaborate with the transfer of power, wanting this 'to be civilised and to cause the minimum possible social agitation'. Mr Dias repeated that there was no possibility of Mr Collor resigning, but said that he would agree to stand trial in the Senate.</p>

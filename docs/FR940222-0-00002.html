This action requires modifying the wing ribs at Wing Station (WS) 39, inspecting (one-time) WS 39 for cracks or corrosion, treating any corrosion found, and replacing any cracked wing front spar lower cap (spar cap). Several reports of cracked spar caps and cracked and deformed wing ribs at WS 39 on the affected airplanes prompted this action. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the wing structure caused by a cracked spar cap or cracked or deformed wing rib at WS 39. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Effective April 12, 1994.

The proposed AD would require (1) modifying the wing ribs at Wing Station (WS) 39; (2) inspecting (one-time) the main spar lower cap and lower wing stringer No. 7 at WS 39 for cracks or corrosion; and (3) replacing the spar cap if any cracks are found and treating any corrosion found. The proposed inspections would be accomplished in accordance with the ACCOMPLISHMENT INSTRUCTIONS section of Twin Commander SB No. 211, Revision 1, dated July 7, 1992. Replacing the spar cap, if required, would be accomplished in accordance with Twin Commander Custom Kit 144, Revision A, dated November 12, 1992; or AVIADESIGN, Inc. Supplemental Type Certificate SA5740NM, dated July 16, 1992, as applicable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the 10 comments received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Five commenters concur with the proposal as written. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter recommends excluding Model 685 airplanes that show no signs of corrosion based on the inspection required by AD 91&hyph;08&hyph;09. The commenter feels that the proposal is unreasonably burdensome to private aviation (i.e., 14 CFR part 91 operators) and should not be mandatory. The FAA does not concur. AD 91&hyph;08&hyph;09 requires inspecting for corrosion on the main wing spar lower cap, but the inspection procedure will not detect cracks in the wing front spar lower cap (spar cap). Even if the inspection required by AD 91&hyph;08&hyph;09 reveals corrosion, there is no assurance that cracks at WS 39 do not exist. The purpose of the proposal is to provide a way to detect and correct cracks at WS 39. The FAA has determined that these cracks or failures of the WS 39 wing rib can occur on airplanes in any type of operation, and that this action is the best course to achieve the safety objective of returning the airplane to its original certification level of safety. The proposed AD is unchanged as a result of this comment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter, the Civil Aviation Authority of Australia (CAA), recommends replacing the wing spar cap before the next 500 hours time-in-service (TIS) if corrosion is found, instead of treating any corrosion found. The CAA states that, if a corroded spar is not replaced, then the small fatigue crack formed as a result of the corrosion will grow to weaken the spar to a level below its design strength. The FAA is currently conducting a study to determine the fatigue crack growth rates from irregular corroded surfaces. Part of this study includes the consideration of a replacement time period for spar caps found corroded. When this study is complete, the FAA will consider taking further AD action to cover this issue. The proposed AD is unchanged as a result of this comment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A third commenter states that the inspection should be repetitive. This is one of the items the FAA is considering in the current study to determine the fatigue crack growth rates from irregular corroded surfaces. When this study is complete, the FAA will consider taking further AD action to cover this issue. The proposed AD is unchanged as a result of this comment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

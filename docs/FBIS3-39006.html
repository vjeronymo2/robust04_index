Mr Alastair Goodlad, Foreign Office Minister, said an  agreement signed in 1988 contained a formula for a set  percentage of the money spent on British military equipment to  be reimbursed in aid.    In a Commons written question, Mr Alan Williams, Labour MP  for Swansea West, asked whether the 1988 protocol "contained  figures relating amounts or percentages of civil aid to amounts  of arms purchases."    Mr Goodlad replied: "Yes." But he added that a letter was  later sent by Mr George Younger, then Defence Secretary, to say  aid could not be linked to defence sales.    "As a result, the issue was not taken up in the memorandum  of  understanding on defence procurement signed in September that  year," Mr Goodlad explained.    However, the answer will bring renewed questions over  ministerial assurances that no links existed between the aid  package and arms -- something that could be challenged in law.    Mr Major and Mr Hurd, Foreign Secretary, overruled official  advice to clear the 234 million pound aid, which has been  described by MPs as a waste of money. Around the same time, a  1.3 billion pound defence contract was negotiated with Malaysia.</p>

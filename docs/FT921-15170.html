			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / Kohl sets out new year's agenda CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl yesterday set out his agenda for 1992, declaring that Germany must review all its priorities in the light of recent developments, which are stretching financial and political resources. He would not, however, surrender the federal republic's growing role in international affairs. With 80m people and a powerful economy, everyone could see that Germany was a strong country, he said, just as everyone could see what the weather was like by looking out of the window. Speeding recovery in the former East Germany was the main task, he told his first press conference of the year. This, in turn, depended on securing Germany's position as a leading industrial power, and he stressed the need for wage restraint in this year's pay round to help secure growth, jobs and stability. The chancellor shrugged off concerns about the increased power and assertiveness of the united Germany. Taking a leading role in helping eastern Europe and unifying the west was the best way of dispelling the 'historic image of the ugly German', he said. "One must live with critics. If you only want to be liked then you end up without influence, and in the end you are more alone than ever.' Avoiding direct comments on the much-criticised recent increase in German interest rates, he said long-term rates had not increased and those were the ones that mattered. He was happy to see Japan and the US prepared to co-operate to stimulate economic relations, but, he said, 'this will not solve our problems.' Traditionally careful to steer clear of involvement in industrial dealings, Mr Kohl has become increasingly embroiled in this year's pay round as union claims for increases of 10 per cent and more have emerged as the main danger to the Bundesbank's price-control policy. Chancellor Kohl's intervention, and the importance he has attached to stability, reflect growing worries over the fragile economic recovery in the east, and its dependence on heavy cash transfers from the weakening economy in the west of the country. High interest rates have hit the capital-intensive construction industry which is the main source of growth in Germany's five new states. Although the chancellor said yesterday that 1992 would be a 'strong' year for eastern Germany, he warned of a sharp increase in unemployment in the next few months, to be followed by an improvement in the second half. Mr Kohl said the country also needed to review its industrial priorities. He wanted first to push through a corporate tax reform programme this year. Other factors which might have to be looked at included indirect labour costs, over-generous pay deals and the shortest working hours in Europe, which, he said, had made Germany into 'the holiday republic'. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, deputy president of the Bundesbank, warned that German industry's international competitiveness would be damaged if this year's wage settlements were as high as last year's level of around 7 per cent, writes Andrew Fisher in Frankfurt. He also said German interest rate levels would have to stay 'relatively high' in the foreseeable future. Reiterating the central bank's determination to keep monetary policy tight to avert further inflation - last month's annual rate was 4.2 per cent - he said moderate pay deals would not mean less purchasing power, since employees would also benefit from lower inflation. He said long-term interest rates were lower than a year ago, with the costs of mortgage finance also easing.</p>

			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: FDK to lay off 70 employees Paris stockbroker Francois Dufour Kervern (FDK) plans to lay off 70 of its 110 employees, board member Mr Jean-Loius Kervern said, Reuters reports. Mr Kervern said his firm would shortly complete a planned merger with Massonaud Fontenay, another broker which, like FDK, is ultimately owned by the Dutch bank ABN-Amro. The firm, which lost FFr5m (dollars 920,000) in 1990, is another casualty of sluggish trading on the bourse and the growing need for expensive investment in technology.</p>

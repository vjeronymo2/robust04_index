			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Cricket: Careful Hattersley plays a dead bat - Teresa McLean talks to a lover of Yorkshire sports WHICH British politician is this being asked about cricket? 'Do you like one-day cricket?' 'I hate it. I can see it's necessary for financial reasons, but it destroys proper cricket. No player can go from a Sunday afternoon slog to a three- or four-day game where he needs to work out tactics and play strokes. One-day cricket is ghastly.' 'Who is your favourite modern cricketer?' 'Graeme Hick. He has class. A fine, high-class batsman.' The answer is Roy Hattersley, who was a batsman himself before politics stole him. Having started as an opener and slip fielder, he went on to be captain, No 6 batsman and patroller of the third man boundary for Sheffield City Grammar School. He played some cricket at Sheffield University. I bet he played all his strokes with proper style. He is a conservative man, deeply loyal to his upbringing or, as he put it, 'a very tribal person.' He has always admired batsmen with perfect technique and was anguished to hear a cricket coach a while ago advising Hick to adopt a more open stance. 'Imagine, advice like that . . . to a batsman like that.' We shook our heads quietly for a moment, in regret. Hattersley's childhood heroes were the great Don Bradman and the idol of every Yorkshire boy in the 1940s, Len Hutton. Tradition for Hattersley does not just mean technically correct cricket; it means cricket and Yorkshire combined, with football a fundamental part of this life-giving mixture. I met Hattersley in his office in the House of Commons, with little cascades of papers, packets and files all over it, an air of hard work, a desk covered in letters awaiting replies and a Sheffield Wednesday rosette on the wall opposite the desk, where its owner can see it at the lift of his head. A Yorkshire emblem to keep spirits up. At times like this, after Labour's general election defeat, spirits are bound to be drooping and Hattersley looked vaguely tired and unbuttoned. Both he and his brisk Scottish assistant, who guided me through many corridors to his room, then through many more to the 'strangers' canteen' and the way out, looked a bit battle-weary. Nor did Yorkshire cricket seem the ideal topic to cheer a Yorkshireman just at the moment. On the other hand, it could not be avoided. 'Do you still watch Yorkshire cricket?' 'Sometimes, but it's very hard. I can go to see my mother on a Saturday, then watch Sheffield Wednesday play football for a couple of hours in the afternoon. But I can't do that with cricket; it needs hours of watching at a time.' 'Still, you'll go and watch the Headingley Test, won't you?' 'Oh, I expect so, for a while. But what I want is to watch Yorkshire play cricket.' There is a clear sense that Hattersley is only in the south because he can't help it. Anywhere except Sheffield is away from home and while Yorkshire is home country, it has some far-flung boundaries, away from the Sheffield heartland. He will try to go to the Oval Test for a few hours, but if he does it will be partly out of a sense of solidarity with the 20,000-30,000 people from Pakistan in his constituency (Sparkbrook, Birmingham), many of whom will be there to support their team. I asked him if he approved of Yorkshire's new policy of importing players, like all the other counties, instead of maintaining their long-standing policy of recruiting only Yorkshiremen. He talked his way from principle to common sense with good Yorkshire pragmatism, having overcome his doubts and reservations by talking to the county's players. 'Too often they reached the point of needing to get the last few opposing batsmen to win, but not being able to do it.' He discoursed at some length on the subject but the thrust of his argument was that Yorkshire signed the Australian Craig McDermott because they badly needed a fast bowler to partner Paul Jarvis. Once they had collected the required capital and lost McDermott, it would have been stupid not to spend the money on someone else. That has turned out be the brilliant young Indian, Sachin Tendulkar. 'Don't let me waffle on all the time,' Hattersley added, looking at his watch, 'I have to go in 10 minutes.' I got more personal. It is not easy with Hattersley, who is a polite and friendly man but, I felt, a slightly impersonal one. He welcomed me with a big, warm hand-shake, but had a pre-occupied air while we talked. Nevertheless, when I asked him if he still played cricket, he rewarded me with a response of real feeling. 'No. It's one of the very few regrets of my life, giving up cricket. But I wanted either to be very good or not to play at all. I didn't want to be a fat, old player who should have retired years ago.' He mentioned his weight and his age several times. He has always been on the heavy side and enjoyed telling me about playing in a recent charity match at which he had given advance warning that he would need a very large pair of trousers. He was delighted to find that the enormous pair of flannels they produced were far too big for him. Charity matches are the only ones in which he takes part nowadays, and he brushed aside any suggestion that he should start playing seriously again. There is a good House of Commons team, which he described with pride. He told me it boasts Peter Brooke as one of its distinguished players, but Peter Brooke, unlike him, never gave up playing. Hattersley's 58 years have included over 20 without bat in hand and the most he can do now for the Commons team is tell others of its merits. I asked him if he could also tell me, as a parting shot, what he reckoned was the political equivalent of a wet afternoon watching Yorkshire do badly at Bramall Lane? He could, wistfully. It summed him up. 'Looking back on it, it had a sort of romance, being huddled on the terraces in the damp, with a few others. The closest to that in politics would be an early spring dawn on the terrace of the House, after an all-night sitting. You don't want to be there, but you know you've been in on something.'</p>

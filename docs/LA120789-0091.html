			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMEND SPONSORS OF SEMINAR ON RACISM  </P> <P> Re: "Students Get Lesson in Bias at This Camp," (Times, Dec. 3). Project  Brotherhood/Sisterhood should be commended for sponsoring this three-day  seminar on combatting racism!  </P> <P> The problem of racism has dramatically risen with the influx of Asian and  Hispanic immigrants into the San Gabriel Valley in the last 10 years. Young  peoples' attitudes toward race are strongly influenced by their parents. Many  immigrants coming into our American "melting pot" have never had much  opportunity to interact with those of different ethnic backgrounds. Their  unfortunate ignorance breeds racism. As every young person knows, it's very  difficult to change your parents' attitudes about anything! Schools offer the  best hope of combatting racism.  </P> <P> When I graduated from Rosemead High School in 1970, our ethnic student  population was approximately 66% white, 30% Hispanic, 2% Asian and virtually no  blacks. Today, it is 13% white, 54% Hispanic, 28% Asian and 1% black.  </P> <P> My high school did such a fine job of getting us involved in student  activities, that I was "color blind" -- the ethnicity of my classmates never  entered my mind. We were first and foremost, Rosemead High School students!  Although times have changed, the basic principles have not: Students who attend  these seminars and are actively involved in school activities will benefit the  most; those who do not get involved will always be hampered in life by their  own prejudice.  </P> <P> HENRY SAKAIDA  </P> <P> Temple City  </P></p>

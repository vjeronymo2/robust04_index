			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> To Improve the Fundamental Intellectual Skills of Children Through the Vehicle of Television Programming.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The term ``fundamental intellectual skills'' may be defined in a number of ways. In general, NECET interprets the term broadly, to include those competencies and abilities that enable children to effectively understand and cope with problems posed by the contemporary world. Such skills might include proficiency in traditional academic disciplines, such as mathematics, science, history or reading, or they might consist of more abstract abilities, concerns or appreciations, such as problem-solving, ethics, multiculturalism or diversity. Regardless of approach, applicants are also encouraged to incorporate basic human development skills, such as self-esteem and pro-social behavior development, into their proposals. Finally, since most effective educational television programming for children has an entertainment element woven throughout it, NECET applicants are encouraged to incorporate this element into the design of their proposals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> To the Extent Feasible, To Support the Development of Programming for Children Aged 6 to 8.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although there is a need for high-quality educational television programming for children of all ages, NECET has concluded that the six-to-eight-year-old child is currently the most underserved by educational television programming and is therefore deserving of special consideration for the FY 1994 grant round. According to the 1990 U.S. Census, there are a total of 10,732,061 children in this age group. Consistent with this emphasis, projects that meet the needs of this particular age group are more likely to be competitive and to receive funding consideration than projects focused on other age groups. NECET, however, will not automatically reject projects designed for other age groups. In future grant rounds, NECET may emphasize projects designed for different age levels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> To Encompass a Broad Range of Subject Areas Within the Overall Context of the Grant Program.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NECET is imposing no limits on the scope of the proposals that may be submitted for funding consideration. In selecting the goals for their projects, applicants may choose to encompass a broad array of targeted skills. Alternatively applicants may choose to center on a single learning need. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Funding Availability <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Departments of Commerce, Justice and State, the Judiciary and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 1993, Public Law 103&hyph;121, 107 Stat. 1153 (1993), provides the Department of Commerce $1 million in assistance for the National Endowment for Children's Educational Television under 47 U.S.C. 394 (1991), to be used for the creation and production of television programming specifically directed toward the development of fundamental intellectual skills. Congress has appropriated a total of $1 million for NECET for Fiscal Year 1994. NTIA anticipates that in FY 1994 NECET will fund up to six grant awards, depending on the nature of the projects and the need of the recipients, and that NECET awards will range from $50,000 to $300,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Matching Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Children's Television Act of 1990 provides that the Department of Commerce may award funds up to 75 percent of a project's eligible costs. Due to the limitation of available funding, however, applicants are encouraged to provide as much outside funding as possible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Type of Funding Instrument <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The funding instrument for awards made under this program will be a grant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Eligibility Criteria <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any individual, partnership, association, joint stock company, trust, corporation (not-for-profit or for-profit), or state or local governmental entity is eligible to submit an application for NECET funding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Award Period <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Successful applicants will have up to twenty-four months to complete their project, although the grant award period will vary as a function of the complexity and scope of the project. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Indirect Costs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The total dollar amount of the indirect costs proposed in an application under this program must not exceed the indirect cost rate negotiated and approved by a cognizant Federal agency prior to the proposed effective date of the award or 100 percent of the total proposed direct costs dollar amount in the application, whichever is less. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Application Forms and Kit; Selection Procedures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Preliminary Applications <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A Preliminary Application (Pre-Application) is required for each proposal submitted by an applicant. The Pre-Application consists of two parts; (1) A Standard Form 424 (SF&hyph;424) (Rev. 4&hyph;92) Application for Federal Assistance; and (2) a narrative summary of the general nature of the proposed project, not to exceed five single-spaced pages. An original and two copies of each complete Pre-Application is required for each project submission. No organization or individual is permitted to submit Pre-Applications for more than three separate projects. Videotapes, audio cassettes and other related materials are not permitted with Pre-Applications. A copy of the SF&hyph;424 and an outline of points to be included in the Pre-Application narrative summary is contained in the National Endowment for Children's Educational Television  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Guidelines for Preparing Applications: 1994 Grant Cycle <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . This booklet may be secured by contacting the NTIA Office listed earlier. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Upon receipt, NECET Pre-Applications will be reviewed and evaluated by outside reviewers with expertise in the area of children's television programming and by NECET staff. Criteria to be used in the evaluation of each proposal are listed in the ``Evaluation Criteria'' section of this Notice. Written comments made by reviewers on each proposal will not be made available to the applicant, and Pre-Application submissions will not be returned. Recommendations regarding successful Pre-Applications will be submitted to the NTIA Administrator, who shall make a final determination regarding successful and unsuccessful Pre-Applications. Successful and unsuccessful Pre-Applicants will be notified by letter about their proposals in late May, 1994. Those determined to be unsuccessful Pre-Applicants will be dropped from further consideration for the FY 1994 NECET grant cycle. Those determined to be successful Pre-Applicants will be invited to submit Full Applications to NECET. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Full Applications <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Full Application is a comprehensive document that consists of required Federal forms, five sections of additional information, and three exhibits. Detailed instructions for completing the Full Application are contained in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Guidelines for Preparing Applications: 1994 Grant Cycle  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> cited earlier. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, those applicants requesting funds for production of a series, individual program(s), or special program(s) are also strongly recommended to submit a half-inch VHS videocassette that represents the quality of work of which the applicant is capable. This type may take the form of a pilot or other sample tape of the proposed project, or may be a tape of an unrelated nature that demonstrates the creative and technical capability of the applicant. Applicants requesting NECET funds for reproduction activities only (e.g., planning, research, development, scripting, etc.) and/or for production of a pilot program do not need to submit a videocassette with their Full Applications. Videocassettes will not be returned. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Project Funding Priorities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SLONIMSKY REGALES WITH TUNES, TALES;  </P> <P> MULTITALENTED MUSICOLOGIST, 94, EMPHASIZES HIS PLAYFUL SIDE AT UC IRVINE  APPEARANCE  </P> <P> Nicolas Slonimsky, a singular figure in 20th-Century music, regaled a UC Irvine  audience Thursday night with his piano playing, his singing and tales from his  remarkable career.  </P> <P> The 94-year-old musicologist, who was born in Czarist Russia to a family of  intellectuals and came to the United States in 1923, has distinguished himself  as a pianist, composer, author and conductor who in the '30s became an early  advocate of Charles Ives, Edgar Varese and Henry Cowell. Of that, he pronounced  himself "very proud."  </P> <P> In recent years he has worked primarily as a lexicographer, compiling such  music reference works as the seventh edition of Baker's Biographical Dictionary  of Musicians. He published his autobiography, "Perfect Pitch," in 1988.  Slonimsky wanted to call it "Failed Wunderkind: A Rueful Autopsy," but the  title was nixed by his publisher.  </P> <P> Dressed in a black suit, bright-red sweater, white shirt and pink,  salmon-shaped tie, Slonimsky emphasized his playful side in his musical  selections Thursday. He performed two of the first songs he composed in the  United States, "The Pepsodent Song" and "The Castoria Song" -- dramatic  Russian-flavored numbers with lyrics taken directly from '20s magazine ads.  "Mothers, relieve your constipated child" is a line from "The Castoria Song."  </P> <P> Slonimsky also used the piano to illustrate some of his work in devising new  musical scales, work that continues to be influential in jazz and other  circles. "I decided to reconstruct all scales, a sort of perestroika," he  explained. Also, he said, "I wanted to annoy people" -- especially his  teachers.  </P> <P> Progressive rocker Frank Zappa, familiar with Slonimsky's work with scales,  called him in 1981, and several days later, Slonimsky found himself performing  one of his own compositions at a Zappa concert at the Santa Monica Civic  Auditorium. It's a tale the iconoclastic Russian delighted in telling.  </P> <P> "It's an unnatural friendship, but it is a friendship," Slonimsky said. Zappa's  daughter Moon Unit, who with her dad scored a novelty hit called "Valley Girl"  several years ago, even taught Slonimsky the basics of Valley talk. "I spoke  five or six languages before I met her," Slonimsky said in his vestigial  Russian accent, proceeding to reel off several favorite Valley phrases,  including "totally awesome." He also announced that he had named one of his  beloved cats Grody to the Max.  </P> <P> Irreverent to the end, Slonimsky ended his performance by playing a snippet of  the overture to Wagner's "Tannhauser" on the piano -- with a hairbrush.  </P> <P> Some anxious moments followed the appearance: Paramedics had to be summoned  when Slonimsky suddenly became ill. Posing for photographs about 30 minutes  after his presentation in the university's Fine Arts Gallery, he slumped in his  chair, grew pale and appeared short of breath.  </P> <P> He was moved quickly to a bench, where he lay quietly until the paramedics  arrived. His vital signs were pronounced normal, and he had recovered enough to  get worried onlookers laughing with his one-liners. (Paramedic: "Have you had  the flu recently?" Slonimsky: "Yes, I did have a terrible flu -- in 1918.").  </P> <P> Slonimsky agreed to be taken to nearby Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian for  further examination but later changed his mind and was driven to his home in  Los Angeles. Reached at his home Friday, Slonimsky said he was feeling fine.  "It turned out to be a gas attack -- a poison gas attack," he quipped.  </P></p>

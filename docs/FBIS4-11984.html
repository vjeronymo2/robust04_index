			<p>BFN     [Text] The president of the Republic, Lieutenant General  'Umar Hasan Ahmad al-Bashir, yesterday evening at the republican  palace, met Mrs. Madeleine Albright, the United States permanent  ambassador to the United Nations, who arrived in the country  yesterday afternoon on a brief visit.    In a statement issued after the meeting, the U.S. envoy  stressed that her discussions with Lt. Gen. al-Bashir were  serious, open, and clear, and that the dialogue was very  important.    For his part, Foreign Minister Husayn Sulayman Abu-Salih,  who  attended the meeting, expressed Sudan's satisfaction with the  visit by the U.S. envoy, which is considered the real beginning  of a serious dialogue between Sudan and America. He pointed out  that dialogue was a course which had been followed, and had been  called for, by the revolution from the outset. He said: We  believe that we have entered preliminary negotiations, and that  the revolution is working for peace. We call upon all sides to  work for a just and lasting peace.</p>

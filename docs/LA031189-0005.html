			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GIRL WHO GOT FRIEND'S HEART LAID TO REST  </P> <P> Donna Ashlock was laid to rest Friday in a pink casket adorned with roses as  family and friends mourned the teen-ager whose heart, transplanted from a  youthful admirer, finally gave out.  </P> <P> Donna, 17, had told her parents she wanted a pink casket like one at the recent  funeral of a family friend, so they ordered a duplicate after she died on  Tuesday while awaiting a new heart, her father, Raymond, said.  </P> <P> An overflow crowd -- many of them high school friends -- spilled onto the  sidewalk for a full block in front of Hillview Funeral Chapel. Those outside,  under a partially overcast sky, were told they could view the open casket after  the service before interment at Patterson District Cemetery. Six policemen in  blue dress uniforms served as pallbearers.  </P> <P> The Rev. Paul Flyfleet, pastor of the Assembly of God Church in Hilmar, thanked  God "for the impact she has made on other people's lives, her courage and her  strength."  </P> <P> Following the hymn "I'm Sheltered in the Arms of God," Flyfleet described  Donna's life since her heart transplant three years ago.  </P> <P> "She was just a normal, active, loving teen-ager, but she was a teen-ager with  great courage," Flyfleet said. "Twelve times she was in the hospital in San  Francisco. When I talked to her, never did she complain about her situation."  </P></p>

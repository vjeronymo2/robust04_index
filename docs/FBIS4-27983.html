			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 3 KYODO -- Japan and the United  States ended yet another round of "framework" trade talks Friday  [3 June], this time with officials trying to sort out  differences on how to measure progress of imports to Japan in  automobile trade.    Japanese officials said the two days of talks focused on the  thorny issue of "objective criteria," the very roadblock that  scuttled the "framework" negotiations in February.    Japan and the U.S. agreed last week to resume the trade  talks  and expert-level government officials from the two countries  have been meeting over the past week, both in Tokyo and  Washington, to take stock.    While officials declined to comment on the substance of  their  discussions, there were indications that the two sides still had  trouble working out a mutually acceptable formula to quantify  market access to Japan.    One difference that has surfaced since the two countries  decided Monday last week to resume the framework talks concerns  the number of auto dealerships handling foreign cars.    U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor has cited the number  of foreign car dealers in Japan as a kind of "objective  criteria" to determine whether Japanese consumers have equitable  access to foreign cars.    "For us, that amounts to a numerical target, something we  agreed that should have no place in the framework," a Japanese  official said.    Japanese officials emphasized, however, that the negotiators  involved in the two days of auto trade talks in Washington were  not charged to make "political decisions."    That would be left to another round of meetings that has  been  tentatively scheduled next week in Tokyo between Sozaburo  Okamatsu, vice trade minister for international affairs, and  Undersecretary of Commerce Jeffrey Garten, the two principals in  charge of the "framework" negotiations for the automotive trade  sector.    Apart from auto trade, other industry sectors covered in  this  week's talks were the insurance industry and Japanese Government  procurement of medical and telecommunications equipment.</p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Jobs market statistics encourage Dow Wall Street US SHARE prices ended higher across the board in busy trading yesterday in the wake of a rise in bond prices and some welcome good news from the jobs market, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 23.78 at 3,176.03, near its high for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished up 3.49 at 407.74, while the Amex composite ended 0.13 higher at 367.01 and the Nasdaq composite 4.69 higher at 573.89. Turnover on the NYSE was heavy at 204m shares, and rises outpaced declines by 1047 to 648. The market posted early gains following unexpectedly good news from the jobs market. Government figures released yesterday showed that weekly state unemployment insurance claims fell by 24,000 in the week which ended on September 26. The decline went against expectations as analysts had been predicting another rise in weekly claims, and some investors seized on the data as an indication that conditions in the labour market may be improving. Although shares fell back later in the morning and flirted with negative territory around midday, a series of late afternoon computer buy programs, apparently triggered by the rebound in previously-weak bond prices, provided the market with a strong lift just before the close. Among individual stocks, Fannie Mae (Federal National Mortgage Association) jumped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 64 3/4 in heavy trading after the company reported net income of Dollars 412.9m in the third quarter, the 19th consecutive record quarter for the group. USAir climbed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 12 3/8 in turnover of more than 1m shares after announcing that it had reached a settlement with striking machinists. The carrier said that 60 per cent of its service was back to normal yesterday, and that a full service would be resumed by Monday. Compaq rose Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 36 1/4 in turnover of 2m shares after the computer company said its operating earnings in the third quarter would be better than in the second. Westinghouse Electric fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 14 3/4 after it predicted that third quarter earnings would come in below 35 cents a share. The company is also expected to take a charge of between Dollars 60m and Dollars 100m on its investment in the discount drugstore chain, Phar-Mor. Best Buy rose Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 26 1/4 on news that the retailer's sales in September rose by 105 per cent to Dollars 156m. Another retail group to report strong monthly sales was Wal-Mart Stores, up Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 58. Canada IN TORONTO, gains in financial services and mining led stocks higher. The TSE-300 composite index climbed 21.86 points or 0.68 per cent to 3,237.22, and advancing issues edged out declines 251 to 246. Volume was 26.3m shares worth CDollars 296.5m as against 33.3m shares worth CDollars 376.6m previously. The financial services sub-group gained 1.46 per cent on index, mining was up 1.67 per cent, and consumer products rose 1.45 per cent.

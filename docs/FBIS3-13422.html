Ross arrived in the  Tunisian capital yesterday. The Israeli team is made up of the  director general of the Foreign Ministry, Uri Savir; General  'Uzi Dayan of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]; and the prime  minister's political adviser, Jacques Neriya.    The decision to dispatch the delegation to Tunis came in the  wake of the intensive American efforts to bring about renewal of  negotiations between Israel and the PLO.    Qol Yisra'el's Washington correspondent says also that  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and the PLO's Abu-Mazin [Mahmud  'Abbas] are likely to meet at the end of the week to restart  talks on the autonomy for Gaza and Jericho. The Washington  meeting is apparently dependent on the outcome of the contacts  now under way in Tunis.</p>

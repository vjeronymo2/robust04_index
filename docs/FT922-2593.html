			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Collor confronts reality after summit triumph PRESIDENT Fernando Collor of Brazil flew back to Braslia and harsh reality yesterday after two weeks of presiding over the world's largest-ever gathering of heads of state. Widely praised for his government's handling of the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Mr Collor returned to the capital to face mounting economic and political problems. He did not have a good start. The stock market fell 8 per cent yesterday morning on a new wave of corruption allegations involving Mr Collor, although it regained some ground later in the day to close 6 per cent down. The charges came in an interview published on Sunday with Mr Luis Octavio da Motta Veiga, a former head of Petrobras, the state oil company. Mr Motta Veiga made detailed allegations of the power wielded in the government by the president's friends, and said he had been dismissed because he refused to allow them to influence appointments or the award of contracts. He said he thought the Collor government 'will not escape cleanly' from a parliamentary inquiry under way into alleged extortion by Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, Mr Collor's campaign treasurer and close friend. The inquiry, which began on the first day of the Earth Summit, was prompted by allegations against Mr Farias and Mr Collor by the president's younger brother Pedro, and has only been kept off the front pages for the last two weeks by the conference. This is not Mr Collor's only problem. Inflation is rising again, last month reaching 22.5 per cent, and an expected turnround in growth has not come. Businessmen are once more increasing prices rapidly, fearing another price freeze. One of the most pressing concerns is a possible collapse of the country's accord with the International Monetary Fund. Having failed to meet first-quarter targets in April, Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira, the economy minister, admits those of the second period may also be missed because of continuing high inflation and interest rates which are resulting in an explosion in domestic debt. The accord, signed in January, had been based on inflation falling to 2 per cent a month by December. However, after a meeting with Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, Mr Moreira said he was confident the accord would not collapse because 'the IMF is happy with the thrust of our economic policy.'</p>

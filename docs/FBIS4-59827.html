			<p>BFN     [Text] New York, May 17, INA--Several international  dignitaries now visiting the United Nations called for the  lifting of the embargo imposed on the Iraqi people.    Speaking at a press conference here today, the dignitaries  called for the immediate lifting of the embargo and ending the  sufferings of the Iraqi people. They submitted a written appeal  to the UN secretary general urging the Security Council to  implement Article 22 of its Resolution 687 which provide for the  lifting of the embargo after Iraq's compliance to its  obligations.    Among the dignitaries that had taken part in the press  conference were 'Abd-al-Latif 'Arabiyat member of the Jordanian  House of Notables, Mr. Baham Singh, chairman of the Non-Aligned  Youth Conference, the former ambassador of Mexico, Canadian  professor 'Abd-al-Haq Abu-Bakr, Prof. Marta Mandavalo of Athens  Univesity and the Iraqi Permanent Delegate to the United Nations  Mr. Nizar Hamdun.    Replying to questions put by journalists, Mr. Hamdun said  the  American Administration is the only party that rejects the  implementation of provisions of the Security Council resolutions  adding that Iraq has implemented all what concerns provisions of  the weapons section of Resolution 687. Iraq's demand to lift  the embargo falls within the provisions of that resolution  itself.    The Iraqi ambassador said Iraq rejects the limited selling  of  its oil and having supervisors over the distribution of food  materials.    The Arab and Iraqi community in New York assembled here on  Monday under the banner of Iraq and denounced the perpetuation  of the economic embargo.</p>

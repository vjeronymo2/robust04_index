Sangheli pointed out that we are brothers, but each of us  has  his own home and lives according to his own rules. Some  representatives of Romania, as we know from our own sources,  promote a two-faced policy concerning us, that is, openly they  say that they acknowledge Moldova's independence, but behind our  backs they claim that our republic is part of Romania, Sangheli  stated.    What strikes me most, he continued, is the stance adopted by  Romania's Foreign Affairs Ministry, the representative of which  a few days ago stated that in order to solve the fate of Moldova  all Romanians should be consulted. I think that the best answer  to such offensive assertions is the statement made by our  president, Mircea Snegur, during the [5 February] meeting  entitled "Our Home, the Republic of Moldova," in which he  condemned the forces that support unification with Romania,  after which he issued a presidential decree on organizing a  public opinion poll among the republic's population with respect  to the issue of Moldova's independence.    It is regrettable that our desire to find out the opinion of  our people has triggered such reactions on behalf of the  Romanian press, proving that they do not understand history, and  also triggered offensive assertions against Moldova's leaders.  This is really foreign interference in the affairs of a  sovereign state, the independence of which was first recognized  by Romania, stated Sangheli in the interview he granted to  ITAR-TASS.</p>

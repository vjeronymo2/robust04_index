			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): Wife can't be used as tax puppet I HAVE JUST bought Pounds 5,000 (nominal) of 14 per cent Treasury 1998-01 in my wife's name. My question is: can I defer bondwashing? I bought the gilts ex-dividend and propose to take the gross interest on November 22 1993 (when my wife will not be liable for tax) and then sell cum dividend after April 5 1994 (when she will be liable), thus avoiding payment of tax on the second lot of gross interest. We are perturbed to see your use of phrases such as 'I have bought . . . in my wife's name' and 'I propose to take the gross interest on November 22,' which imply that you are using your wife as a mere puppet for transactions aimed at avoiding tax and producing an indirect benefit for yourself. You must have overlooked our repeated warnings about the wide-ranging anti-avoidance legislation aimed at taxpayers who try to use their spouses' names to reduce the incidence of tax on funds which will result eventually (albeit indirectly) in a benefit to themselves. It is essential that the interest be credited to an account in your wife's sole name to which you have no access, and that the proceeds be credited similarly to that account. The investment decisions must be your wife's, although there is nothing to stop her asking for your advice. What must not happen is that you make a decision for her and simply tell her where to sign, and when. And she must be free to spend the whole of the interest and proceeds just as she pleases. Subject to all these caveats, the answer to both your questions is YES, on the bare facts given in your letter. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these colummns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOW GAINS 26.23 ON HINTS OF FED CUT IN INTEREST RATES  </P> <P> The stock market ran up a broad gain Wednesday, extending Tuesday's rally on  signs of a new move toward a more stimulative Federal Reserve credit policy.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, up 14.96 on Tuesday, climbed 26.23  points to 2,623.36.  </P> <P> Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 5 to 2 in nationwide trading  of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 1,091 up, 418 down and 463  unchanged.  </P> <P> Stocks turned upward Tuesday on evidence that the Federal Reserve was taking  steps in the money markets to encourage interest rates to decline. News  accounts this morning quoted unidentified government officials as saying that  inference was correct.  </P> <P> Analysts said that encouraged stock traders who had been growing increasingly  apprehensive about the possibility of a recession.  </P> <P> Wall Streeters still expect corporate profits, which came in below expectations  for the third quarter, to be disappointing for the next few months.  </P> <P> But the Fed could presumably cushion the impact of an economic slowdown in the  future by relaxing its credit policy now.  </P> <P> A relatively small St. Louis bank lowered its prime lending rate to 10% from  10.5%, helping to stir expectations that bigger money-center banks might soon  do the same.  </P> <P> Bank stocks were notably strong. J. P. Morgan gained 1 7/8 to 43 1/2;  BankAmerica rose 1 1/4 to 28 5/8; Manufacturers Hanover edged up 1 1/4 to 37,  and Chemical Banking rose 1 to 32 1/8.  </P> <P> Gainers among the blue chip industrials included Philip Morris, up 3/4 at 41  5/8; General Electric, up 1 at 54 1/2; Procter &amp; Gamble, up 2 5/8 at 129  1/8; Coca-Cola, up 2 1/4 at 74 1/2, and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up  3/4 at 44 1/4.  </P> <P> But International Business Machines dropped 5/8 to 96 3/4 and Digital Equipment  was down 1 1/2 at 87.  </P> <P> Woolworth dropped 1 1/8 to 58 1/4 amid some disappointment about the size of  the quarterly earnings gain posted by the company.  </P> <P> Wyse Technology led the active list, down 1/8 at 9 3/8. The stock traded as  high as 12 1/2 early in the session amid takeover rumors.  </P> <P> Then it fell back when the company said it was discussing a possible  acquisition at $10 a share with a party it didn't identify.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 170.15 million shares, against Tuesday's 163 million.  </P> <P> Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rebounded in moderate trading, ending a  three-session losing streak. The key Nikkei average of 225 shares jumped 325.13  points to close at 35,595.59.  </P> <P> In London, stocks closed sharply higher Wednesday largely on technical factors  and positive sentiment stemming from Wall Street's continued recovery from its  steep loss at the start of the week. The Financial Times 100-share index rose  25.6 points to close at 2,203.6.  </P> <P> Credit  </P> <P> Treasury bill prices rose as the bond market also reacted favorably to the  signs that the Fed had eased monetary policy. Prices of longer-term securities  were mixed.  </P> <P> The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond fell 1/16 point, or under $1 for  each $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which rises when prices fall, increased  to 7.87% from 7.86% late Tuesday.  </P> <P> Analysts said there was little activity in longer-term issues because of  hesitation in advance of Treasury auctions of 10-year and 30-year securities  scheduled for next week.  </P> <P> "Bills did well," said F. Ward McCarthy Jr., managing director of Stone &amp;  McCarthy Research Associates. "Primarily I think it's because it's generally  acknowledged that the Fed has eased monetary policy, so some of the short-term  rates responded favorably."  </P> <P> Easier monetary policy and lower interest rates increase the value of  securities that are already issued and pay higher rates.  </P> <P> Traders believe that evidence of credit policy easing came Tuesday, when the  Fed unexpectedly injected $2 billion of reserves into the market. The sign was  registered in a drop in the key federal funds rate, the interest on overnight  loans between banks.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate was quoted at 8.375%, down from 8.50% late Tuesday.  </P> <P> A quarter-point drop in the federal funds rate this week is the fifth small  decline that has occurred since late May, when the central bank began to  reverse a yearlong effort to drive interest rates higher as a way to fight  inflationary pressures.  </P> <P> Currency  </P> <P> The dollar rose modestly against most major currencies.  </P> <P> Gold prices also advanced. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid for  gold at 4 p.m. EST of $387.50 an ounce, up from $384.75 late Tuesday.  </P> <P> Currency traders said the dollar showed fundamental strength despite the  market's perception that the Fed is relaxing its credit policy, which likely  would encourage lower interest rates. Falling interest rates usually depress  the dollar's value.  </P> <P> "The dollar is basically absorbing the lower interest-rate scenario rather  well," said Robert Hatcher, a vice president of corporate trading at the New  York office of Barclays Bank PLC. "It's hanging in there."  </P> <P> He noted that traders are looking toward today's government report on wholesale  price inflation in October for further signs of an economic slowdown, which  could spur the Fed to ease credit further.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar  fell to a closing 142.97 Japanese yen from 143.63 yen at Tuesday's close.  Later, in London, it declined further to 142.73 yen. But in trading in New  York, the dollar recovered and finished at 143.18 yen, up from 142.95 yen late  Tuesday.  </P> <P> The British pound rose in London to $1.5860 from $1.5810 late Tuesday. Later,  in New York, the pound fetched $1.5885, up from $1.5865 the day before.  </P> <P> Commodities  </P> <P> Energy futures prices slid on the New York Mercantile Exchange as traders  shrugged off news that petroleum stocks in the United States declined.  </P> <P> On other markets, grain and soybeans and precious metals were mixed, copper  advanced and livestock and pork futures were mostly higher.  </P> <P> West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 3 to 15 cents lower, with the  contract for delivery in December at $19.87 a barrel; heating oil was 0.16 cent  to 1.13 cents lower, with December at 58.70 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline  was 0.49 to 0.54 cent lower, with December at 51.87 cents a gallon.  </P> <P> The selling was spurred by bearish inventory data from the American Petroleum  Institute, which showed a 3.98-million-barrel draw on crude stocks to 341  million barrels.  </P> <P> "Most of the stock drawdown occurred on the West Coast, while stocks actually  increased in the Midwest and Gulf regions," said Jerry Samuels, an analyst with  Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.  </P> <P> Copper futures prices were higher on New York's Commodity Exchange as  uncertainty continued about labor activity at Chile's Chuquicamata mine, the  world's largest open-pit mine.  </P> <P> Copper was 1.5 to 3.9 cents higher, with November at $1.1545 a pound.  </P></p>

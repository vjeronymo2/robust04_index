			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Survey of Business Air Travel (4): Demand holds up but prices are keen - UK internal flights DOMESTIC business air travel, often regarded as the Cinderella of the airline world, has survived - if not exactly prospered - during the recession better than might have been expected a year ago. While international air travel has been slower to recover from the impact of war and the world slowdown in economic growth, flights within the UK have held up well. Figures from the British Airports Authority (BAA), for example, show that flights out of Heathrow to Glasgow last year were only 5.5 per cent down on the previous year. To Edinburgh, the shortfall was even less at 4 per cent. Mr Colin Rainbow, commercial director of Wagon Lits Business Travel (formerly Pickfords), reports that demand from corporate business travel clients for UK internal flights remains surprisingly buoyant. 'It's a market where executives feel that it's more advantageous in some circumstances to fly than drive or go by rail,' he says. 'Of course, some pretty fierce price competition has helped as well.' Most of the keen prices on domestic air travel, however, are aimed at leisure travellers who have to book in advance and have little flexibility in changing their tickets. Business travellers on UK routes, as in the international market, pay significantly more for the privilege of being able to pick and choose when they actually want - or need to - fly. But the UK business air travel market is primarily about convenience. Executives not only want frequent services to main cities such as Glasgow, Edinburgh or Dublin, but also connections to smaller regional airports such as Bristol or Norwich. While the big airlines such as British Airways and British Midland, with their sights set on Europe (or in BA's case the world), have had an ambivalent attitude towards these regional routes, niche airlines have stepped in to meet the demands of a growing internal market for business air travel. Brymon Airways, for example, is expanding its operations at its Bristol hub and thismonth is basing a fourth Dash-8 aircraft at Bristol to boost its services on its Bristol-Scotland route by 40 per cent and also to enable the launch of services to Belfast City. Moreover, Jersey European has introduced a daily Manchester-Jersey service and a Saturday-only Manchester-Guernsey link. At the same time the two main players - BA and BM - have made it clear that Europe is their target. This was illustrated recently by BM's decision to axe its loss-making Heathrow to Liverpool route and expand its European services using the slots vacated at Heathrow. These slots - the take-off and landing allocations at Heathrow - are a major source of annoyance for domestic carriers. As the world's busiest international airport, Heathrow has to cater for the many international airlines that want to come into the airport. The move last year to allow more carriers into Heathrow under the government's policy of deregulating civil aviation has put considerably more pressure on domestic services. Ironically, however, it is these domestic services which act as a 'feeder' into the international routes out of Heathrow. Some business travellers are forced to drive or go by train/tube to Heathrow simply because of the non-availability of a connecting service from their local airport. Thus the decision by Air UK, Britain's third largest scheduled airline, to base its operations at Stansted Airport in Essex. Stansted last year saw a radical improvement in its facilities with a Pounds 400m development of a new terminal. But it has faced a difficult task over the past year, following the fall-off in international air travel after the Gulf War, to persuade business travellers to use its services. Air UK, however, believes it provides a different option for business travellers from that offered by BA or BM, especially for those based in north or east London, the Midlands and the eastern part of the country, where access to Stansted is more convenient than to Heathrow or Gatwick. The airline flies more than 1,100 flights a week to 15 destinations within the UK. Not all of these are out of Stansted: for example, it has just added an extra direct early morning flight from Norwich to Aberdeen, providing six flights every day during the week. While BA's Shuttle services to main UK cities continue to be a profitable and important operation for the airline, it has realised that it cannot afford to devote too many resources to compete as efficiently on small regional routes as well as major international links. The airline is currently in talks with its staff over streamlining its regional operations out of Birmingham, Manchester, and Glasgow although it stresses that it has no intention of pulling out of these cities. But the opportunities clearly exist for more niche airlines to meet the needs of business air travellers in the UK.</p>

			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Rio waits for Romario to bring home 'his' Cup  -The unpredictable brilliance of one of the world's great strikers Normally Brazil play the best football in the World Cup and get knocked out early. This year has been different for two reasons: their defenders can defend and they have a striker who can score. Romario (da Souza Faria) has five goals in six World Cup games so far - about the average rate for his career. This league season, he scored 30 for Barcelona. Carlos Alberto Parreira, the Brazilian coach, may never invite Romario to his birthday party, but he has decided to forget the great man's personality flaws at least until tomorrow night. Now that Maradona has retired yet again, Romario is probably the best player in the world, but in the last World Cup his irksome char-acter kept him from playing more than part of one match. This is a man who says his hobby is sleeping (14 hours a day); who informed the Dutch press that his PSV Eindhoven team-mates could not play soccer; who flies home to Rio when he feels like it, league fixtures or not; who likes nightlife so much that he is 'going to keep going out until I am 90 years old'; and who called Pele 'mentally retarded.' Romario lacks Maradona's self-destructive streak (when he goes out he neither drinks nor smokes, not even cigarettes), but he is also a good deal less sociable than the Argentine. He thought it most unreasonable that he had to sit next to his striking partner Bebeto on the plane to the US. Carlos Alberto Parreira, a European type of coach, only recently came round to the idea of letting this man into his team. If you are Romario you don't have to be nice to people. Bobby Robson managed him at PSV and was frequently tempted to fire him, but then the striker would appear suddenly on an overnight flight from Brazil and score a hat-trick against Ajax. The problem at PSV was that Romario disliked Holland. He failed to understand the weather, or the Dutch habit of turning up for appointments, or the way they treat soccer stars as normal people, and he failed to charm the natives by saying things like: 'In Holland I work; I live in Rio.' He was never at home in sleepy Eindhoven. Born in a Rio slum, he moved with his parents to a slightly nicer slum before becoming a star. He does not dare visit the neighbourhoods where he grew up, but he loves driving around Rio like a madman, and when, during a recent game of beach volley-ball, he noticed a new building going up, he bought 10 apartments on the spot. Rio came through for him again after his father was kidnapped in May. Within days, the police had found the old man. It seems that the tip-off came from a gangster who feared that Romario's form might suffer if his father were killed. 'The only way I can repay the Brazilian people,' Romario said, 'is by scoring goals and helping to win the World Cup.' This, he declared, was going to be 'Romario's Cup.' During it, he has been the closest we have to a Maradona Mark II. About the same height as the Argentine, with the same enormous chest and thighs and skinny calves, he has Maradona's sense of balance and can similarly beat multiple defenders within a few feet in the penalty area. Romario, too, has taken to running with the ball from mid-field. He is always surprising. 'If it had been a European player, he would have put it in the far corner,' observed Russian 'keeper Dmitri Kharin after Romario scored against him. 'But Romario is a Brazilian and he put it in the near corner.' Romario's goal against Holland (he considered shaving his head before the game) was even more special. A cross landed far too far in front of him, so he flicked himself three yards through the air and, while he was still dropping, virtually on top of the ball, hit a half-volley with the outside of his right boot into the inside side-netting of the Dutch goal. The Italian defence will probably not permit much of a goalfest tomorrow, and Romario was part of the Barcelona team that lost 4-0 to AC Milan in May's European Cup final. But when Romario says that this is Romario's Cup, and that he is the real thing, why should we argue?</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 1 TASS -- Russian land troops stationed  in the Kaliningrad region pose no threat to the neighbouring  countries, including Poland, Commander of the Russian Land  Troops Colonel-General Vladimir Semenov said.    In an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday,  Semenov said that the troops in the Kaliningrad region, Russia's  westernmost enclave, are not an "armoured fist threatening the  Baltic Sea countries", and fulfill the tasks aimed at ensuring  the national security of Russia.    He also stressed that Russia strictly observes its  international commitments. Semenov said there are as many tanks  and troops in the Kaliningrad regions as is necessary to ensure  Russia's security.</p>

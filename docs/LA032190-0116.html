			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANAHEIM TO DROP SUIT AGAINST COUNTY OVER CANYON JAIL SITE  </P> <P> The City Council Tuesday night decided to drop a lawsuit against the county and  the Board of Supervisors that contested the proposed $1-billion Gypsum Canyon  jail in the east Anaheim area.  </P> <P> The council's action followed a recent Sacramento Superior Court ruling that  determined the county's proposed method of financing the jail -- through the  use of sales tax funds -- was unconstitutional.  </P> <P> "The city of Anaheim has no interest in spending hundreds of thousands of  taxpayers' dollars to fight a jail that will in all probability never be  built," Mayor Fred Hunter said. "That money will be more wisely spent serving  the needs of the citizens of Anaheim."  </P> <P> A state bill was passed in October, 1989, that allowed the Orange County Board  of Supervisors to place a half-cent sales tax increase for jails and other  criminal justice facilities on this year's ballot. The measure would have  required only a simple majority to be approved.  </P> <P> But a Sacramento Superior Court judge ruled that the legislation violates  Proposition 13, which requires a two-thirds majority for approval of new taxes.  </P> <P> Councilman William D. Ehrle said the council decided to abandon the lawsuit  against the county because the Gypsum Canyon jail facility plan is "not going  to go anywhere."  </P> <P> "It's a moot case," Ehrle added.  </P> <P> The property for the proposed jail is owned by the Irvine Co.  </P></p>

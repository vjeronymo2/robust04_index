			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A GYM DANDY PLACE TO TRAIN;  </P> <P> VERDUGO CENTER HELPS YOUNGSTERS VAULT INTO COMPETITION WITH SOLID EDUCATION IN  GYMNASTICS  </P> <P> The nondescript concrete building sits hard by unused railroad tracks that  separate it from a cemetery.  </P> <P> It is in this highly unglamorous setting, at the end of a cul de sac and  flanked by industrial warehouses and garages at the Glendale-Los Angeles  border, that the Verdugo Gymnastics Center inconspicuously attends to the  business of producing and refining athletic skills.  </P> <P> The youngsters who roll into the 6,500-square-foot building for instruction  tumble out with a first-rate gymnastics education.  </P> <P> "I remember when I walked in here for the first time, I thought, 'This is real  gymnastics,' " said David Hesbon, 32, a coach at the center who is a nationally  rated judge and a former member of the U. S. National Junior Team.  </P> <P> "They're not just doing forward and backward rolls in here."  </P> <P> Indeed, more than 200 athletes test and extend their limits under the watchful  eyes of an experienced staff.  </P> <P> Flags and ropes hang from the ceiling and mats cover the floor. One wall is  mirrored and others are adorned with posters showing world-renowned gymnasts.  </P> <P> From an upstairs area overlooking the main floor, parents and other spectators  can watch the gymnasts practice their routines.  </P> <P> During peak hours, the center is a flurry of tumbling and twisting activity.  </P> <P> As many as 100 students will be practicing at a time, rotating from station to  station.  </P> <P> "There are no events (apparatus) empty," Hesbon said. "If something is  abandoned, it's only that way for about a minute until someone else snatches it  up."  </P> <P> Founded in 1973, the center has been designated by the United States Gymnastics  Federation as a national training center -- one of only three in Southern  California and the only one in Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> Classes are offered for aspiring gymnasts of all levels, from toddlers to  adults.  </P> <P> "We're trying to provide a safe environment for people to learn," said Brenda  Browning, 27, a coach and the center's managing director.  </P> <P> "Schools aren't doing as much physical fitness as they used to. This gives kids  a place to develop friendships and get physically fit."  </P> <P> Kindernastics are offered to help children ages 22 months to 4 1/2 years  develop body awareness, coordination, rhythm and perceptual motor skills.  </P> <P> Beginner and intermediate classes incorporate an introduction to the various  events of men's and women's competitions.  </P> <P> Introductory, intermediate and advanced teams compete in local, regional and  national competitions.  </P> <P> The center draws gymnasts from throughout the region because it is home to one  of the few women's Elite teams in Southern California. Athletes at the Elite  level practice the Olympic compulsory routines in hopes of qualifying for a  national team.  </P> <P> The center was home to former U. S. National Team member Cyndi Tom and former  U. S. Junior National Team member Eugenia Park.  </P> <P> Current Elite athletes at Verdugo include Laurie Bartelt, 14, of Alhambra;  Sirinda Sincharoen, 16, of La Canada; Londa Chun, 16, of Woodland Hills; Amy  Nishiyama, 13, of Los Feliz; and Rebecca Jones, 16, of Glendale.  </P> <P> "When you deal with kids in class, you have kids that are here just for an  experience, not to be Mary Lou Retton," Hesbon said. "They're here because  doctors say gymnastics would be really good for this child's coordination,  self-esteem, self-confidence and overcoming fears.  </P> <P> "When you get into your team aspect, you want to make your athletes as good as  they possibly can be.  </P> <P> "They're not here for Park and Recreation games. They're here to do well and to  learn."  </P> <P> For the past nine years, the Verdugo center has augmented the overall  gymnastics experience by hosting an international competition at Glendale High.  </P> <P> Next March, teams from Japan, Ireland, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and  the Soviet Union are expected to participate.  </P> <P> Ideally, such a competition would take place at the Verdugo center but the  facility is too small to host so many athletes. Browning said the nonprofit  group is hunting for a larger home in the Glendale area.  </P> <P> And, of course, a bigger center would be useful not only for once-a-year  international meets. More room would mean more space for students on a daily  basis, providing an opportunity to expose more children to gymnastics.  </P> <P> "It's pretty amazing to see what some of the kids who come here can do after  working so hard," Hesbon said. "But there's something for everyone in  gymnastics, whether it's being able to do a double-back or learning how to  improve your balance.  </P> <P> "It's a lot of fun and something everyone should try."  </P></p>

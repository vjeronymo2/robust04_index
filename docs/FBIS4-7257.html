			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 27 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  exhorted his economic ministers on Wednesday to expedite  legislation covering private-sector infrastructure investment to  help increase the nation's global competitiveness.    Presiding over the monthly economic meeting to review the  five- year "new economy" development plan at the Kwachon  government building complex, Kim said construction of airports,  roads and other public utilities should draw on private as well  as public funds, like in Japan and Europe, because of the  enormous costs.    He reiterated the need for industrial peace, stressing that  labor-management cooperation is a major factor in increasing a  country's competitive power on the world market.    Kim then instructed the ministers to act against inflation  and the increasing balance-of-payments deficit, relax rules  governing economic activity on a continual basis, and complete  economic reforms within the year.    "It's good to note the economy is recovering rapidly," he  said, "but I'm concerned about the increasing  balance-of-payments deficit and I want you to solve this problem  not by reducing imports but by increasing exports."    The chief executive also directed the ministers to take  special steps to create an environment in which civil servants  can work well, noting that some public servants wrongly think  that the harder they work, the greater their losses.    Vice Economic Planning Minister Han I-hon reported that the  government would complete a rural development plan by the end of  May to help farmers overcome difficulties stemming from the farm  market opening under the Uruguay Round accord.    In June, the government will formulate a supplementary  budget  of 300-400 billion won (about 500 million U.S. dollars), based  on the special rural tax to be levied in the second half of the  year, to finance the plan, he added.    Over 1.3 trillion won will be provided to small- and  medium-sized firms to boost technological innovation and sharpen  their products' competitive edge on the world market.    Because parliament will need time to pass the pending  legislation on private investment in infrastructure and to amend  related laws, the government will prepare guidelines on such  investment so that private firms can get involved in  infrastructure projects during the first half of next year, Han  reported.    Toward the end of the meeting, President Kim exhorted the  economic ministers to unite around Economic Planning Minister  Chong Chae-sok, indicating that the coming cabinet reshuffle  after parliamentary approval of Yi Yong-tok as the new prime  minister would not affect the economic team.</p>

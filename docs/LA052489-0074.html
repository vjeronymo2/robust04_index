			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY MOVES TO BAN UNTREATED ROOFING  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday took steps toward  requiring that fire-retardant roofs be installed on all new buildings in  unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> The supervisors ordered that an ordinance be drafted to require the  installation of such roofs. The measure, supported by both fire officials and  building industry representatives, would extend a ban on untreated wood-shingle  roofs from mountain areas to the flatlands.  </P> <P> The 5-0 vote was the result of recommendations from a committee created last  December in the wake of several fires in the San Fernando and San Gabriel  valleys. The wildfires were fueled by untreated roofs.  </P> <P> Wooden roofs would still be permitted, but would have to be treated with a fire  retardant.  </P></p>

Sechenov; UDC  612.81.814]    [Abstract] The conformational changes in a membrane that  are due to a change in temperature, pH, Me[.sup]2+[/], or  electrical field represent one possible mechanism of the  appearance of electrical signals in receptor membranes and  excitable membranes. Information in living organisms is  transferred via electrical impulses, which means that, at the  membrane level, there must be elements that transform every  possible type of external event into electrical signals. The  transformation mechanism is localized in the cell membrane,  which contains receptor structures and is capable of generating  an electrical response. Membrane potentials arise as a result of  the selective diffusion of ions through individual transmembrane  pores. The bilayer lipid membrane has trigger properties that  are important from the standpoint of sensory systems, i.e., in  physiological systems, it can be in two conformational states  (gel and liquid crystalline). Experiments on flat bilayer lipid  membranes have demonstrated that when a fixed voltage is present  on a membrane, the transition from liquid- crystalline state to  gel phase is accompanied by electrical signals that are ionic  and capacitive. Membranes consisting of charged lipids are of  particular interest to researchers, because they are sensitive  to the external environment and to exposure to protons, divalent  ions, pressure, and electrical field. The researchers here use  measurements of electrical parameters in phase transformations  induced by changes in Me[.sup]2+[/] concentration in bilayer  lipid membranes consisting of acidic lipids to demonstrate that  the phase transition is accompanied by capacitive currents  comparable in magnitude and direction to the so-called gate  currents of excitable membranes and by increased permeability  for cations.

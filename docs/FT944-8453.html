			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Gardening: Not everything in the botanic garden is rosy - Roy Barnes compares two approaches to providing public access to open spaces I left Britain a week after the Cambridge University Botanic Garden announced it would charge visitors on weekdays between March and October to help cover its Pounds 1,200 a day maintenance costs. The charges - entrance remains free on Wednesdays and for school parties - were introduced on January 1 this year. Shortly afterwards, I was walking through the high north-east section of New Zealand's Dunedin Botanic Garden, admiring the native plants and trees, and could not help thinking about the sad development in Cambridge. Where I was walking, there is no perimeter fence, the public road leads directly into the garden before dropping downhill beside the native bush. There is no attempt, and apparently no need, to keep the public out, day or night, and there are no charges to enter the grounds, the glasshouses, the aviary (containing endemic and Australian birds) or the car park. Everything, apart from the excellent cheap food, hot and cold meals and snacks, served in delightful surroundings in the restaurant, is free. Whereas in Britain most botanic gardens were established by private bodies or individuals with a primary purpose of botanical research and education and not as public parks, in New Zealand most botanic gardens are 'public domains', set up for the 'benefit and enjoyment of the community at large'. They have a combined botanical, amenity and educational function. The Dunedin Botanic Garden's budget of Dollars NZ1.1m (Pounds 450,000) is funded from local rates with some additional help from various commercial and voluntary bodies. Like all local authorities in the UK, Cambridge city council is required to put the care and maintenance of its open spaces out to competitive tender. The council's horticultural officer merely monitors the work of the contractors. And even if the local authority had the will, it clearly has neither the funds nor the expertise to supply a free botanical information service to the general public. The Dunedin Botanic Garden also contracts out some of its work - grass-mowing, litter control, path maintenance and plant propagation and supply - but day-to-day control of the contracted staff's work is firmly in the hands of the garden's own managers. In addition, the administrators are obliged to provide a unified service in which research, education and amenity go hand in hand, and this is an obligation that they willingly accept. One has a strong impression all over New Zealand that everybody wishes to work for the common good. The land and its flora are the common heritage of all the people and they wish to preserve it. This could be a result of their history and geography - only 3m people in a country the size of Great Britain - and a tradition so different from the UK's, where the use of public land for private ends has fostered a different view of things and where urbanisation has diluted familiarity with the countryside. The contrast between the two countries can be illustrated by the amount of local involvement in the affairs of the Cambridge and Dunedin Botanic Gardens. Both gardens have their 'Friends', who help with donations of cash, production of publications, and some gardening chores. But outside help goes much further in Dunedin than in Cambridge: the Dunedin Bog Garden was established by the Friends; the aviary is financed by donations from the Trust Bank Otago Community Trust, the Dunedin Rotary Club and New Zealand Television; the Alpine House was rebuilt in 1986 with money supplied by the Dunedin Amenities Society; and the new Herb Garden was paid for and installed by the Otago Herb Society. Every local specialist society helps with its speciality - the Dunedin Dahlia Circle with the herbaceous borders, the Dunedin Rhododendron Group with the marvellously extensive display of azaleas and rhododendrons. The new historical rose garden was laid out in 1988-89 under the guidance of the Dunedin Rose Society. The Dunedin Botanic Garden manager says that when administrative costs, salaries and payment for contracted works are deducted from the Dollars NZ1.1m grant, the contribution of the voluntary societies becomes 'significant and invaluable to the success of this Botanic Garden'. Cambridge University Botanic Garden does not contract out any work and, except for minor tasks such as seed gathering by Friends, everything is carried out by professionally qualified full-time staff or by sandwich-course trainees from horticultural colleges under professional supervision. The superintendent has said that he does not see how amateur labour and expertise, of the kind and to the extent that it is used in Dunedin, could be incorporated into the work at Cambridge. But sadly, even in Dunedin there are ominous creakings: the Dunedin Botanic Garden Management Plan contains the sentence: 'The garden does not sit easily with its classification as a recreation reserve.' One senses that things may be changing not entirely for the better. Throughout the country there are signs of change: motorways are beginning to sneak out of the bigger towns; there is smog in Christchurch; and downtown supermarkets and hamburger bars are appearing everywhere. The government is urging 'modernisation', doubling the tourist trade very five years or so; in some areas the local population is outnumbered by visiting Japanese tourists and businessmen investing money and buying up hotels (in one case a whole university). One worries for them and hopes that they will be able to maintain the old communal values that, for me, are wonderfully symbolised in the Dunedin Botanic Garden.</p>

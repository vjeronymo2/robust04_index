			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / International Company News: Further shake-up at Olivetti aims to cut costs OLIVETTI, the loss-making Italian computer group, yesterday announced another corporate restructuring aimed at cutting costs and streamlining production, AP-DJ reports from Milan. Olivetti, controlled by financier Mr Carlo De Benedetti, said it had created three new central divisions and eight new commercial areas in what it claimed was the second phase of a previous restructuring announced one year ago. 'Our group today is the algebraic sum of areas where it earns and grows well and areas where it continues to lose . . . The objective is to develop to the maximum the first and intervene drastically in the second in a very brief time,' Mr De Benedetti said in a statement. Yesterday's statement reversed a previous restructuring announced last November, which, in turn, had rolled back another reorganisation in 1989. The three new divisions are products, systems and professional services. These will replace Olivetti's present three divisions, called diversified activities, planning and development; public administration; and operations. Olivetti's commercial areas will grow to eight from five and will be geographically rearranged 'with the scope of allowing the company to concentrate in an articulated way its commercial efforts in function of different geographic opportunities,' the statement said. Mr De Benedetti said the restructuring will start to pay off in 1994. '1993 will be a transition year, but in 1992 we will reap the fruit of all this work in an industry that, although experiencing worldwide the worst years of its history, is due for extraordinary growth over the next 10 years.' The chairman made no predictions for Olivetti's full-year results this year. The group's first-half consolidated net loss widened to L93.4bn (Dollars 68.92m) from  73.7bn in 1991.</p>

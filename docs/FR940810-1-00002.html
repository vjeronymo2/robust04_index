This action is being taken to ensure that consumers have pertinent information about airline code-sharing arrangements and long-term wet leases on domestic and international flights. The Department is proposing: (1) to require ticket agents (including travel agents) doing business in the United States and foreign air carriers, as well as U.S. air carriers, to give consumers reasonable and timely notice that the travel they are considering purchasing will be provided by an airline different from the airline holding out the transportation, and to disclose the identity of the airline that will actually operate the aircraft; and (2) for tickets issued in the United States, to require U.S. and foreign air carriers and ticket agents (including travel agents) to provide written notice of the transporting carrier's identity at the time of sale of transportation involving a code-sharing or long-term wet-lease arrangement. The Department also wants to consider seriously a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement to print the transporting carrier's identity on the flight coupon for services involving a code-sharing or long-term wet-lease arrangement. The Department is making this proposal on its own initiative. In addition, the Department is denying a petition filed in Docket 48710 by Donald Pevsner that requested a complete ban on code-sharing arrangements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department requests comments by October 11, 1994.

Code-sharing is the term given  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to a common airline industry marketing practice where, by mutual agreement between cooperating carriers, at least one of the airline designator codes used on a flight is different from that of the airline operating the aircraft. In one version, two or more airlines each use their own designator codes on the same aircraft operation. Although only one airline operates the flight, each airline in a code-sharing arrangement may hold out, market and sell the flight as its own in published schedules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The term ``code-sharing'' also refers to other arrangements where the code on a passenger's ticket is not that of the operator of the flight, but where the operator does not also hold out the service in its own name. Such code-sharing arrangements are common between commuter air carriers and their larger  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affiliates. Arrangements falling into this category are similar to leases of aircraft and crew (wet leases).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department regulates all international code-sharing arrangements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as wet leases under 14 CFR Parts 207, 208, 212 and 218.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although code-sharing and wet-lease arrangements can offer significant consumer benefits, they can also be misleading unless consumers know that the transportation they are buying will not be provided by the airline whose designator code is shown on the ticket and unless they know the identity of the airline on which they will be flying. The recent growth in use of code-sharing, wet-leasing and similar marketing tools, particularly in international air transportation, has given the Department concern about whether the current disclosure rules (described below) protect the public interest adequately. This notice proposes to strengthen the rules and requests public comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Benefits of Code-Sharing Services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its examination of domestic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airline interline practices, the Department noted that only 10% of passengers on certificated air carriers used interline services, indicating the strong preference of passengers on connecting flights for on-line service. Interline Practices in the Airline Industry at 24 (January 1986). There may be even fewer today. Data for the quarter ended September 30, 1993, show that interline passengers account for approximately 2.3% of total passengers based on the Department's Passenger Origin and Destination Survey. Code-sharing arrangements, which enable airlines to hold out multi-carrier connections as on-line service, are, in part, a market response to this demand for on-line  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service. Often, code-sharing partners offer services similar to those available for on-line connections with the goal of offering ``seamless''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service (i.e., service where the transfers from flight to flight or airline to airline are facilitated). They may, for example, locate gates near each other to make connections more convenient, or coordinate baggage handling to give greater assurance that baggage will be properly handled.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 20. Preliminary Drafts of the Proposed SMMP <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commentor stated that the Proposed Rule does not reflect comments received by the agency on various preliminary drafts of the SMMP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Response <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As indicated above, on April 20, 1994, EPA issued a Public Notice soliciting comment on its proposed SMMP which set forth proposed monitoring and management measures for the SF&hyph;DODS. In addition, the Public Notice accompanying the Proposed Rule designating the SF&hyph;DODS broadly outlined EPA's proposed site monitoring and management measures for the SF&hyph;DODS. The provisions in the Final Rule setting forth site monitoring and management requirements for the SF&hyph;DODS now being promulgated by EPA reflect the public comments received in response to these two Public Notices, as well as all other comments EPA previously received concerning preliminary drafts of the SMMP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 21. Enforceability of the Proposed SMMP <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commentor stated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both permit conditions and the site management and monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions themselves must be enforceable not only by EPA, but by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> members of the public with standing to represent the marine resources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Response <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As indicated above, the Final Rule has been revised to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include specific provisions governing site monitoring and site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management. These provisions establish the legal basis for requiring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> site monitoring and site management and establish the basic criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for adequate site monitoring and management measures. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions will be enforceable by EPA as well as by citizens who meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the requirements for filing suit under MPRSA section 105(g), 33 U.S.C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1415(g).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 22. Performance of Site Monitoring Field Work <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commentors were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerned that reliable information may not be collected if site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring field work could be conducted by the permittee or, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> federal projects, by the Corps of Engineers. These commentors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended that all site monitoring work be conducted by EPA and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by independent third parties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Response <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Final Rule has been revised to clarify that monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information required to be submitted by permittees must be collected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and/or certified as being accurate by independent Quality Control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contractors, who are not employees of the permittee. However, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corps of Engineers shares site management and enforcement authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with EPA and, for disposal operations conducted by or for the Corps of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Engineers, the Corps of Engineers may directly collect and submit the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required information. EPA and the Corps of Engineers retain the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority to independently monitor, and conduct surveillance and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement operations on, all permitted disposal operations at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> site. In addition, EPA may independently monitor Corps of Engineers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposal operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 23. Relevance of Navy Monitoring Data <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commentor recommended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the U.S. Navy mid-point monitoring data should not be used or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cited because a final report has not yet been received on this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Response <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> References to the Navy mid-point monitoring have been retained, since this work entails the only monitoring of actual dredged material disposal to date in the vicinity of the SF&hyph;DODS. Given concerns expressed in public comments about the actual (versus modeled) behavior of disposed dredged material at what will be the deepest ocean disposal site so far designated in the U.S., EPA believes that the information is very relevant. Although the Navy's final monitoring report has not yet been received, the results contained in the preliminary reports reviewed by EPA are adequate to reach basic conclusions about site performance regarding plume behavior and deposition of dredged material on the bottom.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 24. Corps of Engineers Site Designation Authority <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commentor requested that the Final Rule include more specific and accurate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> language regarding the responsibilities of the Army Corps of Engineers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in issuing permits for dredging projects and managing the disposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> site, and questioned whether the prohibition on site use (if the site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management and monitoring provisions are not implemented) affects the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Army Corps of Engineers' independent authority to designate temporary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (project-specific) disposal sites under Section 103 of the MPRSA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Response <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Nothing in the Rule affects the independent authorities of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other agencies. The Corps' authority to issue permits for ocean  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposal is fully described in 40 CFR part 225. Also, under Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 103 of the MPRSA, the Army Corps of Engineers may designate temporary,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project-specific ocean disposal sites if an EPA-designated (Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 102) ocean disposal site is unavailable. If, due to a lack of funding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to implement the site management and monitoring provisions required in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Final Rule, EPA's SF&hyph;DODS site were technically ``unavailable'' for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use, the Army Corps of Engineers could propose to designate a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temporary site. However, under these circumstances, it is likely that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the SF&hyph;DODS site itself is the only location that could be justified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or designated for temporary use, since EPA's Final EIS identified it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as the best overall location for disposal. Proposed use of any other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> location would likely require the collection of substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplemental data, and could result in greater cumulative impacts than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continued use of SF&hyph;DODS. It is EPA's position that responsibility to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement all monitoring requirements for use of a temporary Corps-designated site would rest with the Corps, and that temporary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designation of the SF&hyph;DODS site by the Corps would require them to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fully implement the site's existing monitoring requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 25. Detailed Comments on the Proposed SMMP <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several comments were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received regarding specific details of the proposed SMMP as summarized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the site designation Proposed Rule. These included comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding methods for monitoring impacts to particular marine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resources, and specific methods (including specific instrumentation)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for tracking the dispersal and migration of sediments suspended in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water column.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Response <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The SMMP included in the Final Rule incorporates overall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for site monitoring and management. However, all the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operational details for achieving the SMMP requirements are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in the Rule itself. This is because there are in many cases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more than one methodology or technology that could be used to achieve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the SMMP goals. It would be unreasonable to require more specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methodologies in the Rule itself, since the ability to select  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternate approaches that may be more effective or efficient would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restricted by the requirement to first go through formal rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that the degree of specificity in the SMMP is appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the Final Rule. In addition, particular technologies and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methodologies to be used at any time will be specified in the separate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SMMP Implementation Manual, which will be subject to ongoing public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review (also see response to comment number 14, above).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

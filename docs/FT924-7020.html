			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Continuing gloom on Germany The dollar again broke through the DM1.60 level against the D-Mark yesterday as the market continued to be swayed by Monday's report from five independent economic forecasters suggesting that there will be zero growth in the German economy in 1993, writes James Blitz. If money market prices are anything to go by, there will be no easing in official German rates before the New Year. But the report from the 'five wise men' who advise the German government has again raised the prospect that the Bundesbank will ease policy significantly next month to help boost the economy. The dollar continued to rally, peaking at DM1.6070 in European trading and closing at DM1.5980, up nearly a pfennig on the day. In later American trading, it was trading at 1.5982. The dollar's rise was partly capped by the Bundesbank's decision to keep its repurchase tender rate steady at 8.75 per cent, despite a net drain of funds in the German money market. One London-based dealer also said that the Bundesbank and the Bank of England had subtly intervened in the market to cap the US currency's rise, but this could not be confirmed. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, believes there is every possibility that the dollar can correct lower, but views this as a technical rather than fundamental process. He believes that there are still signs of weakness in the US economy and that today's September trade balance is likely to show a deficit of Dollars 8.7bn, because of a poor export performance. 'However,' he says, 'the Bundesbank will cut rates aggressively next year,and I do not rule out a 50 basis point cut in the Lombard rate in 1992, despite uncertainty surrounding the 1993 budget proposals.' Mr Brendan Brown, an economist at Mitsubishi Finance International, has a more cautious view of Bundesbank policy. His central case is that the western German economy will not go into severe recession and that the decline in German money market rates will be gradual. He sees the D-Mark gaining further ground within Europe in coming months as monetary easing in the UK and Italy outstrips that in the core countries. Mitsubishi Finance's forecast for the dollar/D-Mark rate in the first half of 1993 is DM1.52; by contrast, Citibank sees dollar/D-Mark at DM1.75 in May of next year. The D-Mark's intrinsic weakness was a boost for sterling which rose 1 1/2 pfennigs to close at DM2.4300. However, the pound was a good deal weaker against the strong dollar, falling  3/4 of a cent to a low of Dollars 1.5125,. but later closing at Dollars 1.52. Mr Mackinnon of Citibank believes that there is a strong correlation between the narrowing of US and UK short term rates and the decline in sterling/D-Mark rate.</p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / UK real interest rates since 1925: A growing sense of deja vu BRITAIN IS finally paying the price for the inflation of the 1970s. The economy, struggling to get out of a two-year recession, is burdened by heavy debts and the highest level of real interest rates at this stage of an economic cycle since the 1930s. Real interest rates have been at exceptionally high levels throughout the past decade, as the chart shows. The build-up of consumer and corporate debt in the second half of the 1980s occurred even though the real cost of servicing that debt was higher than at any time in Britain's post-war history. The chart tracks the short-term nominal interest rate - 'bank rate', then 'minimum lending rate' and finally 'base rate' - and consumer price inflation since the UK rejoined the gold standard in 1925. The difference between the two lines represents the real interest rate. The red shade represents periods when the real interest rate was positive and the yellow shade when real interest rates were negative - that is when the interest paid on outstanding debt was less than the reduction in the real value of that debt caused by inflation. The blue bars show the annual rate of economic growth over the same period - calculated quarterly from the mid-1950s. The return to positive real interest rates in the 1980s was the direct result of the turbulence of the previous decade. There were repeated periods of high inflation during and soon after the Second World War, but negative interest rates were virtually unknown between then and the 1970s. After the 1973 oil shock, depositors saw the real value of their savings destroyed as inflation soared. Companies and individuals that had accumulated debts before the 1974 property crash saw the real value of their debts diminish as interest rates failed to keep pace with inflation. Saving appeared to be foolish and borrowing the path to prosperity, a belief that lingered throughout the 1980s. Companies and individuals increased their borrowing, encouraged by rapid increases in nominal asset prices and the easier credit allowed by financial deregulation. Nominal interest rates were quite high in the face of rapid credit growth, but the government had bailed debtors out in the past. The assumption presumably was that it would do so again. Yet the government has not kept its side of this implicit bargain. Rather than allow inflation to accelerate in 1988, the government raised interest rates, albeit too late to prevent inflation from rising to double figures again. By joining the European exchange rate mechanism in 1990 it has also prevented itself from cutting rates further, just as it did in the late 1920s. The real interest rate in June this year was 6.1 per cent - below its 1980s peak of 9 per cent in January 1985, but higher than in any year since March 1932 prior to the 1980s. As inflation falls, real interest rates will tend to rise further, but in January 1981 - when the last recovery was beginning  -the real interest rate was only 1 per cent. Real rates did not rise above 6 per cent until January 1983, the ninth quarter of recovery. In the previous recession, in the mid-1970s, real interest rates were negative, falling to a trough of minus 16.1 per cent in June 1975. But that was when all the trouble began.

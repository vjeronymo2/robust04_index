			<p>BFN     [Text] The tug of war between the DPRK and the United  States seems to be reaching break point. Both sides have made  threats and neither wants to give in. Today, DPRK Ambassador to  Angola Kang Sun-yong called the press to comment on the problem.  Reporter Antonio Alves compiled this report:    The Patriot missiles which the United States recently set up  in the Korean Peninsula and the pressure that it has been  applying on the DPRK through the United Nations to have that  country's nuclear installations inspected, have irritated the  DPRK even more.    [Begin Kang Sun-yong recording in Korean, with  passage-by-passage translation to Portuguese] Our country is a  sovereign country. Though it is a small nation, if the United  States should use its might to exert pressure on us, we will  confront the Americans and counter their machinations. [end  recording]    The DPRK has long been on alert and its people are only  waiting for one blade of grass of their territory to be touched.    [Begin Kang Sun-yong recording] If they start shelling the  Korean peninsula, they will disappear forever. [end recording]</p>

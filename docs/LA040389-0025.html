			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OPENING STRIKES A NOTE OF HOPE;  </P> <P> VAN NUYS AIDS HOSPICE DEDICATED  </P> <P> Dick Brett, a church deacon, befriended five residents who died at Pioneer  Home, the San Fernando Valley's first hospice for people with AIDS. But on  Sunday, at a dedication of the 5-month-old home in Van Nuys, he and others  spoke of hope.  </P> <P> "I was hungry, and you gave me something to eat. . . . I was sick, and you  looked after me," he said, quoting from the Bible to about 70 supporters  gathered at the home at Haskell Avenue and Valerio Street.  </P> <P> Rabbi Denise Eger of Temple Beth Chayim Chadashim in Los Angeles said he hoped  for the day "when we'll never have to dedicate hospice homes, when there'll be  a cure. . . ."  </P> <P> Brett, who leads AIDS support groups at Metropolitan Community Church in the  Valley, said he has been touched by watching friendships develop between the  residents, such as two named Michelle and Ben. "When he wasn't able to get out  of bed, she would come visit, and when she couldn't get out of bed, she would  yell over to him." Ben died last month, Brett said. Michelle is living with  relatives.  </P> <P> The five-bed home, operated by Hospice Los Angeles/Long Beach, opened in  November after seven months of planning and renovations, using $65,000 in  private donations from the hospice organization and the Valley Business  Alliance, an association of gay business people.  </P> <P> Pioneer Home operates on a monthly budget of about $15,000 and has a staff of  six. Its funding comes from Los Angeles County, private donations and medical  insurance, Maceri said.  </P> <P> Since the hospice opened, 12 residents have died, said Manager Robert Marsh.  Residents, who have come from all over the county, are expected to live less  than six months.  </P> <P> Because AIDS victims often face rejection even by their families, more places  like Pioneer Home are needed, said Larry Wine of Van Nuys, who volunteers for  AIDS service groups.  </P> <P> Bruce Swicker, co-chairman of the Friends of Pioneer Home, said the hospice was  a "a symbol of the coming of age of the San Fernando Valley" because the Valley  has lacked the kind of AIDS service organizations that Los Angeles and West  Hollywood have.  </P> <P> "We shouldn't have to go over the hill for everything, including hospice care,"  he said. A hospice is to provide care in a home-like setting and allow  residents to be as close as possible to loved ones, he said. "If you have to go  to Hollywood, you've defeated half the purpose of a hospice."  </P> <P> Hospice Los Angeles/Long Beach also has hospices in Hollywood and in Long  Beach.  </P></p>

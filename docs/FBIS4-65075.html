			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn/Shaqlawa (DPA) -- The German liaison bureau in  Kurdish northern Iraq was stormed and looted in the wake of the  bloody power struggle between rival Kurdish parties. This is  what Bureau Chief Eberhard Walde told DPA in a telephone  conversation on 11 May. He said his local staff had been  detained.    Earlier, Walde and other Europeans had withdrawn from the  embattled region and gone to the Turkish border. According to  estimates, the fights that broke out early in May have claimed  approximately 2,000 lives. Walde is trying to find eight German  development aid volunteers that are in the region without any  contact with the outside world. His bureau, which was opened in  Shaqlawa in March, was to coordinate the activities of German  relief organizations on behalf of the Federal Government and the  Worker Samaritan Organization.</p>

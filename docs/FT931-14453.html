			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / European petrochemicals reform 'could save Dollars 2bn' EUROPE'S petrochemical industry could save as much as Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) a year if it restructures, according to a confidential survey of 34 plants representing 75 per cent of European capacity. The survey*, by consultants Chem Systems in London, demonstrates the current plight of the petrochemicals and plastics sector. It estimates that even the most efficient producers are generating a minus 5 per cent return on capital. The worst producers are performing far worse than that. The industry has been hit by a combination of slower than expected demand growth and chronic overcapacity. The quickest and cheapest way to improve the industry's cost structure is to concentrate the industry, eliminating the smallest and least efficient plants. This would leave between eight and 12 producers but still ensure healthy competition, claims Mr Roger Longley, a Chem Systems director. Merely by reducing the number of polypropylene producers from 17 to 11 the industry would save Dollars 250m a year, he argues. The survey also demonstrates most petrochemical and plastics plants are highly inefficient. If the most efficient European plant adopted the best practice of other plants in terms of staffing, maintenance, overheads, utilities, credit and logistics, it could make fixed-cost savings of Dollars 79 per tonne. The worst practices in existing plants add up to more than Dollars 230 per tonne higher than best practice. The difference between the worst and best plant is Dollars 153 per tonne. This excludes differences in raw materials - the few plants using liquid petroleum gas have a significant cost advantage over those using naphtha. The report adds that a properly integrated plant can create revenues worth more than Dollars 100 per tonne of ethylene. It says few refiners integrate their plants effectively. 'The bottom line message is clear and brutal,' says Mr Longley. 'Management in almost every company has failed to address inefficiencies.' The industry's ability to sort out its problems has been lessened since the early 1980s, because about 20 of the least efficient plants were shut down at that time, warns Mr Longley. The position of EC manufacturers is likely to deteriorate as they face increasing competition from imports. The consultants also warn that imports could take 40 per cent of the Ethylene Glycol market by the year 2000. European petrochemical manufacturers face an additional problem with the build up of environmental costs. It says the cost of complying with a carbon tax would add up to Dollars 22 to the cost of ethylene produced and Dollars 34 to the cost of high density polyethylene. Chem Systems reckons European polyethylene could faced environmental costs of up to Dollars 80 a tonne compared with importers. *European petrochemical strategy in the 1990s, Chem Systems, 28 St James's Square, London, SW1Y 4JH, ++ 44 71 839 46 52, Pounds 25,000.  ----------------------------------------------------          PETROCHEMICAL PROCESSING EFFICIENCY               (Dollars/tonne ethylene)  ----------------------------------------------------                             Best -       Leader -                            Leader*       Worst**  ---------------------------------------------------- Manpower                      2            15 Maintenance                  16            28 Overheads                    25            39 Utilities                    16            40 Logistics                    15            15 Credit                        5            16 Total                        79           153  ---------------------------------------------------- *Difference between best in each sector and overall cost-base leader.  ---------------------------------------------------- **Difference between worst in each sector and overall cost-base leader.  ----------------------------------------------------</p>

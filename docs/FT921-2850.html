			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / GPA moves to reassure investors GUINNESS Peat Aviation, the world's biggest aircraft leasing company, yesterday announced measures designed to show investors that its management was 'locked in' to the company for the foreseeable future after its proposed flotation in June. The flotation, which could value the group at more than Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.7bn), will be one of the most ambitious attempts to market shares in New York, London, and Tokyo. The group made a preliminary filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington on Friday. The Shannon-based group is to split the roles of chairman and chief executive which have been held by its founder, Dr Tony Ryan, since 1985. Mr Maurice Foley, president, who had planned to retire from his executive duties in October, is to become chief executive where he will remain for at least two years. Dr Ryan, whose contract expires in March 1994, has agreed to stay on as chairman until mid-1996. In light of the UK's sensitivity to corporate governance Sir John Harvey-Jones, joint deputy chairman, said: 'It is particularly appropriate with a public listing in view to split the roles of chief executive and chairman.' The rest of the senior management has agreed to stay on for at least two years after the float. Advisers to the group have not yet agreed with the company how many shares, if any, the directors should be allowed to sell during the flotation. The advisers are keen that the management should be seen to have full confidence in the group. Dr Ryan owns around 8 per cent of the stock which could be worth around Dollars 200m. The rest of the management owns around 5 per cent of the shares. There is unlikely to be any selling by the management for a period of six to 12 months after the sale to help create a stable aftermarket. Advisers to the group are keen to simplify the complex share structure of the group. Dr Ryan's shareholding is held in A ordinary shares, which pay out his remuneration in dividends linked to the group's profits. This is likely to be converted into ordinary shares. However, the advisers cannot unilaterally end the arrangement, which has tax advantages, and are negotiating a lump sum with Dr Ryan as compensation for converting his stock into ordinary shares.

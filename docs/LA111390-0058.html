			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RADIO SALUTE TO VETERANS RUNS GAMUT FROM WWI TO OPERATION DESERT SHIELD  </P> <P> Winston Roche's old, blue eyes get misty when he thinks about the glory days,  such as they were.  </P> <P> He was 17, fresh out of Los Angeles High School and, as he put it, "I really  wanted to fight the Kaiser."  </P> <P> Now 92, Roche would spend 22 months "over there," through the battles of  Chateau Thierry, Aisne-Marne and St. Mihiel; surviving mustard gas, machine-gun  fire and misery in its more mundane forms.  </P> <P> He and other soldiers would dine on French rolls plucked from the mud, washing  them down with cold coffee from their canteens. In the Argonne, they went 42  days without bathing. Sometimes they would rub coffee into their stubble before  attacking it with safety razors.  </P> <P> Roche likes Veterans Day. It gives the North Hollywood resident a chance to put  on his tattered World War I victory medal -- "my favorite" -- as well as his  French Croix de Guerre and his Purple Heart.  </P> <P> With another generation of Americans facing the prospect of war -- including  his grandson Robert, a Navy petty officer second class aboard the aircraft  carrier Saratoga -- Veterans Day takes on added urgency.  </P> <P> The old doughboy, as U.S. infantrymen were known in World War I, was among  scores of veterans and families of servicemen who gathered Monday at Patriotic  Hall in Los Angeles for a special Veterans Day broadcast on KABC radio by  talk-show host Michael Jackson.  </P> <P> Inside the auditorium, the crowd listened as Jackson interviewed CBS news  correspondent Charles Kuralt and other guests, ranging from Roche to a  4-year-old boy whose Marine father is in Saudi Arabia as part of Operation  Desert Shield.  </P> <P> Wives with husbands abroad tried to control their children. Members of American  Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars posts wore their caps and ribbons. Street  people drifted in to partake of the free lunch; some, they said, were Vietnam  veterans.  </P> <P> "We started out feeding families as our guests. But what it's really turned  into, we're feeding the homeless vets who occupy this area," said Nelkane  Benton , KABC's director of community relations. "This is even better than we  thought it would be."  </P> <P> On Veterans Day, "you feel proud to be American, regardless of your present  situation," said James Williams, a Vietnam veteran, who said he has been  homeless for two years.  </P> <P> In addition to its commercial sponsors, the radio show promoted the station's  "Operation EGBOK" -- an effort to gather 1-million Christmas cards for American  troops in the Persian Gulf. EGBOK is an acronym for "Everything Is Going to Be  OK." Someone placed a giant poster for the cause beneath a portrait of the  ill-fated crew of the space shuttle Challenger.  </P> <P> Regardless of politics or strategic considerations, many veterans said it was  important to support servicemen and servicewomen overseas.  </P> <P> "The biggest thing that hurt us in Vietnam wasn't the bullets or the shrapnel,  it was the lack of support from the American people," said Simba Roberts, who  wore camouflage clothing for the occasion. "We have to support our soldiers --  not the war, not the government -- but the individual soldiers."  </P> <P> Among those who gathered at Patriotic Hall, a recurring theme was the hope that  diplomatic efforts would succeed in averting war. But there was little  optimism.  </P> <P> "He was supposed to be home in January," Angela Register, watching over three  young sons, said of her husband in Saudi Arabia. The rotation of forces has  recently been canceled. "I just hope nothing happens. . . . God knows I need  him home; the boys need him. Whatever happens is is God's hands, and He has to  bring him home safely. That's what we pray."  </P> <P> Another recurring theme was an expression that, if there is combat, American  military action should be swift and decisive.  </P> <P> "It looks like we're headed that way, because of the buildup" of forces, said  Sharon Deehan, a Woodland Hills hospital administrator who served as a nurse in  Vietnam. "I think we need to get in, do what we have to do, and get the hell  out."  </P> <P> Roche also expressed hope for either a peaceful resolution or a short war.  </P> <P> "You know the Vietnam vets and this post-traumatic stress syndrome? We had  shellshock," Roche said.  </P> <P> The old veteran smiled when he displayed his scarred shins and throat burned by  mustard gas, and a finger, its tip torn off by a German bullet.  </P> <P> Eighty-year-old Elsye Roche, wooed 57 years ago with tales of the Great War,  expressed hope that her grandson will not have such stories or souvenirs.  </P> <P> Does she think war is coming?  </P> <P> "I just really don't know -- I'm not into all the intricacies," she said. "I  just wish we can make up our minds, one way or the other."  </P></p>

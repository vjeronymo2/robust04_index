			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Sturdy pillars of reform Mr Yao Zhenyan, director of the new State Development Bank, feels that he is carrying a 'heavy burden' in the bank's first months of operation. The SDB, he says, in fulfilling its target of lending Yn80bn (Dollars 9.3bn) this year for infrastructure projects, will be responsible for a significant proportion of China's total credit plan. The bank, together with the Import and Export Credit Bank and the Agriculture Development Bank, are pillars of China's banking reforms. Their establishment is regarded by World Bank and IMF officials as a crucial step in reorganising the banking sector. Lending for infrastructure had long been a millstone around the necks of China's specialised banks. The country's demand for capital to fund its infrastructure requirements virtually dictated the new institutions' formation. Mr Yao said that the SDB, which is modelled on the Development Bank of Japan, would concentrate lending in power generation, transport and telecommunications - sectors where funding requirements are heaviest. The Agriculture Development Bank, which is expected to begin operations later this year, will shoulder a greater burden of lending for construction, including of roads and railways, as well as support agriculture-related projects such as water conservancy. The SDB president said his bank would be run according to commercial principles. He was adamant that it would not assume responsibility for the non-performing 'policy loans' of the specialised banks. 'We say that old problems should be solved through old channels. New problems should be dealt with using new methods. If we took over the problem loans, our bank would go bankrupt in three years.' The establishment on July 1 of the Export and Import Bank of China is another example of changes in the financial system. China, which is striving for a niche among the world's top 10 trading nations, is signalling determination to compete more aggressively. Mr Tong Zhiguang, chairman and a former vice-minister of foreign trade, said that the bank's activities would be 'critical to ensure that China's exports sustain momentum'. He indicated that the bank's priorities would include increasing exports of machinery and electronics, which presently account for a quarter of China's average annual exports. 'In the long run,' Mr Tong said, 'our bank will facilitate China's industrial restructuring that gives rise to more export-oriented industries.' China's banks could hardly be accused of lacking direction.</p>

			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> IRAN'S RADICALS FLEX MUSCLES, ELECT ANTI-WESTERN CLERIC AS SPEAKER  </P> <P> Iran's Parliament today elected as its Speaker a fiercely anti-Western cleric,  Mehdi Karrubi, underlining radicals' strength and the uphill task facing  incoming President Hashemi Rafsanjani in pursuing more pragmatic policies.  </P> <P> The Iranian news agency IRNA said Karrubi, 52, was chosen ahead of his moderate  challenger, Ali Akbar Nateq Noori, by 147 votes to 92.  </P> <P> Karrubi's election is unlikely to affect Iran's stance on key questions, such  as the fate of Western hostages believed held by pro-Iranian militants in  Lebanon, which will be decided by a handful of top leaders.  </P> <P> But hard-liners in Parliament can force policies on the Cabinet, as they did  with a resolution ordering a break in ties with Britain over the Salman Rushdie  affair in March.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The information form also inquires into the effect of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement on ports within its geographic range; it should be noted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that it is unnecessary to segregate data on port calls by sub-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trades. In addition, the information form imposes special  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements on any ``Class A'' agreement that authorizes ``capacity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management'' or ``capacity regulation.'' Because such programs are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed to address problems of excess capacity, the information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> form inquires into each agreement member line's recent capacity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utilization experience within the geographic service area to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered by the proposed program and its initial capacity level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the program. These data are to be provided within a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``geographic service area'' because a capacity management or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation program that is part of a larger agreement can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed to cover less than the entire geographic scope of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement. This section of the form also requires the submission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of any reports or studies dealing with capacity utilization and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related topics, but only to the extent that such documents were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both recently prepared and shared among the agreement lines, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thus may have influenced the formation of the capacity management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the new agreement were permitted to go into effect, then  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the reporting requirements for ``Class A'' agreements would become  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable. Changes in membership in other agreements would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reported, and the parties' market shares would continue to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tracked by entire agreement geographic scope and by sub-trade.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Otherwise, the reporting requirements would mirror the information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> form in order to provide ``before and after'' depictions of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trade, with some additional provisions that can apply only to an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective agreement. For example, the special provisions of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information form applicable to a capacity management program would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be expanded to carefully monitor the actual operation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. In addition, a new section entitled ``Independent Rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Actions'' would apply to ``Class A'' conference agreements and would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For each sub-trade within the scope of the agreement, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for each of the leading commodities *&blank;*&blank;*, and for each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> party, state the number of independent rate actions taken  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the calendar quarter that were applicable to that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commodity moving in that sub-trade, and the total number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of TEUs of that commodity covered by the independent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions. Also, state the name of each shipper for whom  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an independent rate was taken on that commodity during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the calendar quarter, and state whether the shipper was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a beneficial cargo owner, a non-vessel-operating common  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carrier, or a shippers' association. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> This provision would allow the Commission to monitor the level of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> independent rate activity (or the lack of such activity) on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific commodities, and to take appropriate action immediately if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it appears that certain commodities or types of shipper are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receiving more rigid rate treatment than others.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. ``Class B'' agreements under the proposed rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As already stated, the proposed rule prescribes the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information form for ``Class B'' agreements as for ``Class A''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreements. This establishes the same pre-agreement baseline as is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> done for ``Class A'' agreements. However, assuming the ``Class B''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement were allowed to go into effect, the reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements are limited to quarterly updates on market share,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement-wide cargo and revenue results, membership in other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreements, and changes in port service. The agreement would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitored by the Commission, particularly the sub-trades where the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement holds more than 50 percent of the market, and if there  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were indications of possible rate or service problems in a sub-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trade, further information would be obtained_by either informal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negotiation or a section 15 order_and compared against the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> original baseline data to determine whether further action was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5. ``Class C'' Agreements Under the Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An agreement that authorizes service rationalization, such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> space charters, coordination of service frequency and port  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rotations, and coordination of the size and capacity of vessels to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be deployed by the parties, but does not authorize ``capacity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management'' or ``capacity regulation'' (or any of the other five  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Class A/B'' activities), is a ``Class C'' agreement. Although such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreements have rarely presented serious regulatory concerns, some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oversight is necessitated by section 6(g)'s admonition against  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreements that cause unreasonable reductions in service. For a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Class C'' agreement, the proposed rule provides for information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> form and reporting requirements limited to membership in other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreements and the level of service at the ports within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement's overall scope. Those provisions should provide the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission with adequate warnings in case service rationalization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reaches the point where a port, and the shippers which use that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> port, begin to suffer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

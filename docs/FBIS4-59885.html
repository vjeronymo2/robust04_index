			<p>BFN     [Text] Political sources in Jerusalem have said that in  evaluating the proposals relayed by Syria to Israel through U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher, one can deduce that  Damascus is ready to discuss the time factor for a settlement on  the Golan provided Israel announces its agreement to withdraw  completely from the Golan. Our political affairs correspondent  Shlomo Ganor has learned that Syria proposed that the withdrawal  be carried out within a period not to exceed four years on  condition that it includes security arrangements on both sides  of the border.</p>

			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / US Mid-Term Elections: Win and lose for Bush sons The younger generation of Bushes, sons of the former president, had a win and a loss. In Texas, George W Bush, the eldest son, felled Governor Ann Richards, who once ridiculed President Bush for having been 'born with a silver foot in his mouth'. Although a popular incumbent, Ms Richards proved susceptible to a Republican tidal wave powered by promises to reduce taxes and crime. Mr Bush, owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team, won on his first try for office. The attractive, prolific Bush children and grandchildren, played important roles in their father's campaigns. Another Bush son, Jeb, lost in a very close race against Florida Governor Lawton Chiles. In a long political career, Chiles - a former senator - has never lost a race.</p>

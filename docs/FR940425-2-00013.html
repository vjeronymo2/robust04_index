The contract's existing terms also specify that delivery of FCOJ may be made either by the transfer of a warehouse receipt representing FCOJ stored in 55-gallon steel drums in an CANYCE-licensed warehouse, or by the transfer of a shipping certificate representing FCOJ stored in an CANYCE-licensed tank storage facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Brix is a measure of the sugar content of oranges expressed as a percentage of the weight of orange solids.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The futures contract's existing terms provide that delivery may be made at par at any CANYCE-approved delivery facility located in specified counties of the state of Florida. In addition, the contract currently provides that delivery may be made at CANYCE-approved delivery facilities located in Wilmington, Delaware; Port Elizabeth, New Jersey; and Newark, New Jersey at a discount of three cents per pound of orange solids, and in specified counties in the state of California at a discount of thirteen cents per pound of orange solids. <FOOTCITE></FOOTCITE>  <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The futures contract currently specifies that delivery may be made at CANYCE-licensed delivery facilities located in the following California counties: Fresno, Kern, Los Angeles, Monterey, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz, Tulare and Ventura.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed amendments will modify the locational price differentials for delivery at the above-noted nonpar delivery locations. Under the proposed amendments, the existing discount of three cents per pound for delivery at Wilmington, Delaware; Port Elizabeth, New Jersey; and Newark, New Jersey will be eliminated, with FCOJ at these locations henceforth being deliverable at par. The proposed amendments also will reduce to 10 cents from 13 cents per pound the discount for delivery in the specified counties of the state of California.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CANYCE intends to apply the proposed amendments to all currently listed futures contract months beginning with the May 1995 contract month and to all newly listed contract months following its receipt of notice of Commission approval. In this respect, the CANYCE, prior to listing the May 1995 and July 1995 contract months on April 18, 1994, issued a notice to all members and member firms of the CANYCE advising these entities that the proposed amendments will be applicable to the May and July 1995 contract months and to all subsequently listed contract months, subject to Commission approval of the proposed amendments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In support of the proposed amendments, the CANYCE stated that ``[t]he reasons for making the changes in the locational [price differentials] are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The normal differential of basis trades for the northeast ranges from ^5 to +10 putting a differential of zero within the normal range; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The cash market differential between California and Florida ranges from ^33 to +16.5 putting a differential of ^10 within the normal range.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is requesting comments specifically with respect to the extent to which the proposed locational price differentials fall within the range of commonly observed commercial price differences between the contract's delivery points for FCOJ for manufacturing of the same quality.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Copies of the proposed amendments will be available for inspection at the Office of the Secretariat, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, at the above address.

			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HELEN HAYES ISN'T READY TO RUST;  </P> <P> THE ACTRESS, NEARING 90, HOLDS TO HER 'STAY BUSY' CREDO: SHE'S NOW PROMOTING  HER RECENTLY COMPLETED BOOK -- HER THIRD MEMOIR  </P> <P> "Ah, that's our mockingbird," Helen Hayes says. She is sitting on the porch of  the white Victorian house she and Charles MacArthur bought nearly 60 years ago.  There is indeed a lovely liquid trilling to be heard in the trees. "He likes to  join the conversation," she says.  </P> <P> It is a warm spring morning but the sun has not yet burned the haze off the  Hudson below, giving the river a soft and timeless look that you can imagine  Ichabod Crane and boatloads of patroons gazed upon in their time.  </P> <P> In the '60s, having lost both her husband and her daughter Mary and with her  actor son James MacArthur newly married and living elsewhere, Hayes put the  house, with its 18 rooms and its tall and spacious windows providing stunning  views of the river, up for sale.  </P> <P> Local rowdies were sneaking into the swimming pool on the slope below the house  at midnight and having raucous beer and sex parties. But her neighbors were so  appalled at the idea of her leaving that they picketed the house. The  developers who had planned to buy and convert it were scared off; the town got  its rowdies under control and Helen Hayes continues to have the joy of her  memento-filled home.  </P> <P> "My paintings are the Hudson River School," she says. "I sold all my snob  paintings years ago -- long before their prices went crazy, as is my wont."  </P> <P> Helen Hayes is one of the glories of American acting, a link in her lifetime  and theirs between the theater of Lew Fields and Victor Herbert and of Eugene  O'Neill and Tennessee Williams (the two greatest, she believes). In a country  and a profession that loves superlatives, she was being called "the first lady  of the American theater" in the mid-'30s, after her triumph as Queen Victoria  in "Victoria Regina." It made her uncomfortable, she says, because there were a  few other first ladies around, among them Laurette Taylor, Katherine Cornell  and Ina Claire.  </P> <P> Hayes will be 90 in October and she says with considerable firmness that she is  retired. Late-blooming asthma cut short her stage career. "I've been deprived  of that," she says sadly. And while there are still polite inquiries from films  and television, she says, "I wouldn't take a part. I've never been happy with  anything I've ever done that I could see later. Acting for that little red  light -- oooooh! I watch things on the little screen and I say, 'Oh, why didn't  they let me do that again?' "  </P> <P> Early in her career she was under contract to MGM but she never really felt at  home in Hollywood. When the contract was up, she left with relief. "I don't  think I'm much good in pictures," she said at the time, "and I have this  beautiful dream that I'm elegant on stage." Yet she won an Academy Award as  best actress for her first screen role in "The Sin of Madelon Claudet" in 1931  and another as best supporting actress for her role as the stowaway in  "Airport" in 1970 -- a span which is at least one measure of one of the longest  and most honored careers in American acting.  </P> <P> Hayes has just now published an autobiography -- "Helen Hayes: My Life in Three  Acts" (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich: $19.95) -- written in collaboration with  Katherine Hatch, a friend who lives in Cuernavaca, where Hayes also has a house  and spends part of the year.  </P> <P> She had written earlier memoirs, including "A Gift of Joy" and "On Reflection"  in the '60s, and the new one was intended to be "Helen Hayes' Mexico," or some  such, stories and impressions of a country she loves. She didn't think it came  off but sent it to Anita Loos' agent, a mutual friend, as a courtesy to her  co-author. The agent found the publisher, but the changes that were requested  amounted to a new book.  </P> <P> "I talked it," she says, and sent the tapes to Hatch, who polished the words  into shape, carefully preserving Hayes' own tone, which is energetic and  cheerful but remarkably candid about herself and her associates.  </P> <P> The blessings of seniority are not without number, but one of them is a  refreshing freedom to let candor reign. She speaks of Lee Strasberg and the  Actors Studio, "which I blame for many of the things wrong with the American  theater then and now." There is a devastating portrait of Joan Crawford,  reaffirming many of the things Christina wrote in "Mommy Dearest." (Hayes tried  to send a gift to Christina, who had been forced to spend the summer at her  boarding school, the only child in residence. Crawford's secretary said the  mother did not want her daughter to have any gifts. Hayes sent one anyway, but  doesn't know if Christina ever got it.)  </P> <P> There is an acid-etched portrait of Richard Burton, with whom she worked on  Broadway in "Time Remembered." Hayes became what she calls an "unwilling  auditeur" to Burton's noisy lovemaking with Susan Strasberg in the next  dressing room. (Strasberg has written about the destructive relationship in her  own memoir, "Bittersweet.")  </P> <P> "How would you feel if you had a pockmarked face like mine?" Hayes says Burton  asked her as they walked around Boston during the pre-Broadway run. "Conquering  every woman who came within reach seemed to be his way of compensating for that  liability," she writes in the book. "But all those conquests cost him what had  been easily within his grasp -- unstinting recognition as a great actor."  </P> <P> Hayes had entertained Burton and his wife, Sybil, for a weekend in Nyack years  earlier, when Burton was on Broadway with John Gielgud, playing in "The Lady's  Not for Burning." MacArthur was already deep in the depression that darkened  his last years and Hayes thought that Burton, his fame as a raconteur already  established, would be bright company. "And he was," she says, "with his stories  of his mining village and that hard-drinking family of his."  </P> <P> By contrast to the portrait of the later Burton, there is a favoring glimpse of  John Barrymore, with whom Hayes played in a 1933 film called "Night Flight" by  the French author-pilot Antoine de St. Exupery. Barrymore was already known for  undermining his own talent and having to read his lines from cue cards. But he  was letter-perfect and totally professional. Hayes says that Barrymore told the  director, Clarence Brown, "I was working with a real actress; I didn't want to  make a goddamn fool of myself."  </P> <P> Marian Davies was one of Hayes' close friends and at one point the subject of  </P> <P> gossip as having had a child by the love of her life, William Randolph Hearst.  Once she was escorted to a party by Truman Capote. As they swept in, she said  in her characteristic stammer, "I want you to m-m-meet my illegitimate son by  C-C-Calvin C-C-Coolidge."  </P> <P> On the recent spring morning in Nyack, the news was of the Hubble space  telescope being unlimbered in deep space. It reminded Helen Hayes of an  expedition she and husband Charles MacArthur, Aldous Huxley and Anita Loos made  to spend a day with Prof. Edwin Hubble, for whom the space telescope is named.  Hubble was at Mt. Wilson, where he was awaiting delivery of that observatory's  vast lens, then being ground in Upstate New York.  </P> <P> "When it was done, he'd be able to reach through the Milky Way and pick out an  individual star. And Aldous said, 'Yes, and when it's all done and you've  adjusted it perfectly, what you'll see is your own backside.' And Charlie, my  Charlie, who was always supposed to be the flippant one, said, 'No, he won't.  What he'll see when it's all adjusted is God . . . waggling his finger and  saying, "Not a step further." ' "  </P> <P> The most affecting portraits in the book are of Hayes' actress daughter, Mary  MacArthur, who died of polio in the epidemic of 1949, and of her husband,  Charlie. Theirs had been one of the great romances, and although his last years  were marked by illness and heavy drinking, the memories of the good times  prevail.  </P> <P> They had met at a party at the artist Neysa McMein's studio, when he famously  poured some peanuts into her hand and said, "I wish they were diamonds." His  charm was understandably irresistible, and there was an endearing prankiness to  match.  </P> <P> She recalls an early escapade, when MacArthur arranged a telephone conversation  between a Metropolitan Opera star, Lucrezia Bori, and Al Capone. Bori was crazy  to meet Capone and while MacArthur couldn't manage that, he got a dubious  Capone to take a phone call. Capone was an opera lover. "Have her sing 'Sempre  libera' from 'La Traviata,' " Capone said. "If I'm convinced it's her, I'll  talk to her." She did and he was and they talked.  </P> <P> Hayes quotes his partner Ben Hecht's line about MacArthur: "He walked backward  through life looking at the day he was 21." Together he and Hecht had written  "The Front Page," "Twentieth Century" and many another play and film together.  "Ben was right," Hayes says. "It was part of Charlie's charm. But after Mary's  death, the youthfulness faded." He died in 1956 at 61.  </P> <P> Unlike many actors, who confess that the urge to impersonate caught them at a  very early age -- the first time they toddled on stage as kindergartners, say,  or the moment they put on angel wings in the Christmas pageant -- Helen Hayes,  characteristically candid, says, "I never chose to be an actress." In the new  book, she explains that the choice was made for her by her actress mother,  Catherine Hayes Brown, whom everyone called Brownie. (Helen dropped the Brown  for marquee purposes.) At her mother's prompting, she appeared in an amateur  production at age 5. She worked alongside her mother in a Washington repertory  company at 8 and made her Broadway debut in "Old Dutch " a Victor Herbert  operetta, in 1909, when she was 9.  </P> <P> Brownie, steering Helen through the career she had sought for herself but been  unable to achieve, was a chaperon who became increasingly dependent on both her  daughter and alcohol. Hayes, who is as candid about herself as about anyone in  the book, quotes a doctor-cousin who said that the children of alcoholics carry  feelings of inferiority with them into adulthood. "Not that they're ashamed,"  she says, "but they feel they are put on this Earth to serve, not to take.  Maybe that explains my attitude."  </P> <P> She felt very keenly the tug of war between career and parenthood. "Sometimes,"  she writes, "I became so melancholic that I felt all actresses should be spayed  so they couldn't have children. . . . At times I thought of giving up work to  concentrate on raising my children, but I couldn't bring myself to do it."  </P> <P> Son James MacArthur, now 51 and still hailed as the longtime co-star of "Hawaii  Five-0," has remarried and divides his time between Hawaii and a lodge in  Colorado. Like many a series star, he finds the strong identification a mixed  blessing, making it hard to be considered for other roles. His mother, who  admires his talent, finds it unfair and distressing. Neither she nor MacArthur  urged acting careers on the children but were supportive when they made their  own choices.  </P> <P> These days Hayes, who makes a number of public appearances, likes to quote her  favorite dictum, which is, "If you rest, you rust." She rests very little. She  presently is doing signings of her book -- 300 copies on a recent afternoon at  the Doubleday shop in Manhattan. "The good news of this morning," she says, "is  that they're printing another 5,000 copies. That'll be 35,000."  </P> <P> She is involved in charitable work, appearing at the "Night of 100 Stars,"  which benefits the Actors Fund, of which she is an officer. She is also a  principal supporter of an orphanage in Mexico and of Mother Teresa.  </P> <P> She lives in a house full of memories, and leads her morning's guests down a  circular stone staircase to a ground-level playroom and office crammed with the  mementos of her life with Charlie -- posters, paintings, signed photographs of  dozens of the famous, like the young Maurice Evans, desperately handsome, and a  warmly inscribed portrait of her friend and idol, Laurette Taylor.  </P> <P> But the mementos, it seemed clear, are not much visited. She elects to live in  the present. With all else, she travels a good deal: to Ireland not long ago.  She entertains old friends from the theater. Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy were  up for a visit a few days after Tandy's triumph in the Academy Awards. The  couple strolled down to the village, blissful at going unrecognized by  passers-by.  </P> <P> Not least and not surprisingly, Helen Hayes is a constant theatergoer. She and  her old pal Mildred Natwick were off to see Maggie Smith and Margaret Tyzack in  "Lettice and Lovage" the following week. And not long before, she had been to  see Glynis Johns, Rex Harrison and Stewart Granger in Somerset Maugham's "The  Circle."  </P> <P> "I toured in that years ago," Hayes said, "doing the part that Glynis Johns  does. And I saw her and I said, ''Oh, of course; THAT's the way it should be  played."  </P></p>

			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Business Travel: Just lounging around Airlines have discovered a new area of competition - their executive lounges. Set apart from the general confusion of the airport terminals, and dedicated to business-class passengers, these lounges try to be both an office away from the office, and a home away from home. They provide somewhere quiet to work, with plenty of telephones, fax and photocopying facilities, free drinks, newspapers and magazines, and enough comfy seats to allow travellers to put their feet up. And it's all complimentary. Within this framework, however, there are many variations, as exemplified at London's Heathrow airport (see table). The Servisair executive lounge, for instance, provides facilities for passengers flying with Alitalia, Iberia, TAP, Olympic, Finnair and Austrian Airlines, all in one not very large room tucked away along a corridor in Terminal Two. It comprises an adequate but rather plastic bar and coffee area, seating for about 40, three telephones, a fax and (when I looked in) a large, shoeless businessman, unconscious in front of a television. The windows have no views, the ceiling has a chilly chrome finish and you have to use the public loo in the corridor outside. Compare this with American Airlines' Admirals Club in Terminal Three: the lounge is vast, with 225 seats, two copiously stocked bars, many telephones, vibro-chairs, two shower rooms and an immense marble entrance. Being American, it believes that work is as important as a good Bloody Mary, so it provides 14 individual, comfortable workstations, each with a phone. The Admirals Club combines the indulgent (leather armchairs, dark-stained wood, thick carpeting) and the utilitarian (large, bleak windows overlooking the apron outside, bare walls, the showers kept locked). It feels like a luxury garage, devoid of personality. This highlights a fundamental problem: it is hard to find an executive lounge that inspires a sense of well-being in its passengers for the brief time they are using it - a place combining business efficiency with the virtues of a good hotel. Qantas comes close to this ideal, with a warm, tasteful, classy facility, up the stairs in Terminal Three. Japan Airlines' Sakura class, on the other hand, may have 150 seats, free beer and a place to play cards, but the furnishings are austere. There is another option: Virgin Atlantic, with its famous Clubhouse facility, has a non-self-service bar, staffed by women in red uniforms. It has a music room with a Pounds 13,000 hi-fi, a massage and aromatherapy suite, and a large library. And it has a train set. The train set is symptomatic of all that is best and worst at Virgin. It looks terrific, but it doesn't work. Where the track makes a detour behind the bar, it fills up with spilled salt and sticky liqueurs, resulting in weeks of closure. But, as a Virgin employee explains, one frequent passenger is so keen on model trains that he changes out of his suit, mixes himself a drink and disappears underneath the train set to fix it. Virgin, it seems, has subverted the whole idea of business travel, and tried to make it fun.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Executive lounge                                      British at Heathrow                  Servisair                Midland  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Seats                           40+                      40+  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Telephones                       3                        5  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Faxes/copiers                  1 fax               1 fax, 1 copier  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Loos                       Outside, public          Outside, public  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Showers                        None                     None  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Periodicals                 Healthy, multi-         Standard British,                            lingual selection        plus 25 Newsweeks  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Work places                      2                        4  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Drinks/snacks              Adequate drinks;

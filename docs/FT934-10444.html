			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Technology: Safety in the works - Gunpowder, a traditional fuel for fireworks, may soon be replaced by resins 'I THINK I've got the best job in the world,' enthuses Ron Rapley, research director at Standard Fireworks, Europe's biggest firework manufacturer. At the Hudddersfield site, perched high on a hill, Rapley and his team of chemists are responsible for devising ever more sumptuous cascades of red, green and white stars to the accompaniment of an ever more varied cacophony of whistles, crackles and bangs. But as a recent recruit to the world of firework manufacture - until two years ago he was an accident investigator at the UK's Health and Safety executive - Rapley is acutely aware of the potential danger of making fireworks. In the UK today 75m or so fireworks will be lit to commemorate the failed plot to blow up Parliament in 1605 by Guy Fawkes. Rockets, bangers, sparklers, catherine wheels and roman candles will all rely on gunpowder, a dangerous mixture of charcoal, sulphur and potassium nitrate. From next year, a new material could begin to replace the traditional explosive. Rapley's team is working with researchers at the Cranfield Institute of Technology to investigate ways of using resins - viscous compounds which harden in air - to replace gunpowder in some of its fireworks. The result should be a safer manufacturing process. The investigations are arduous, not least because gunpowder is a versatile firework component. Tiny grains of gunpowder are used as the blowing charge in bangers, while larger grains - the size of a peppercorn or even a pea - burn more slowly and produce more long-lasting effects. Gunpowder can also be compressed into pellets to form rocket motors. Lit at one end the pellet takes several seconds to burn - long enough to lift the rocket high into the sky. Because resins are organic they act as a fuel and only need the addition of an oxidising agent - such as potassium nitrate - to produce a material to rival gunpowder. The resin, which is viscous, also acts as a binder for all the other ingredients. The first step for Standard has been to investigate ways of using the new resin in the coloured stars which shoot out of roman candles and rockets. In many industries the development of the resin would be the bulk of the work, but the stringent safety requirements of firework manufacturing has meant that Standard has had to carry out strict trial procedures. The tiny stars will be extruded, with a continuous flow of the viscous material being chopped into the appropriate size, like minced meat out of a mincing machine. Standard has already conducted successful test runs using a conventional extruding machine, but still needs to develop an appropriate conveyor belt system. 'We can't just put ordinary machines in,' Rapley points out. 'Every nook and cranny has to be considered. If there's a corner that explosives can get in to, they will.' Rapley is confident the resins will be safer than gunpowder. Not only is there less dust - less to be inhaled by employees as well as less to cause a spark - but the softer dough of the resin absorbs blows which the hard powder cannot. Moreover resins open the way for machines which can be operated remotely. Today's fireworks are often constructed and filled by hand and at best the machines used need operators to stand close by. In the unlikely event of an accident, says Rapley, machines operated remotely would help minimise the casualties. With a throughput of 70m fireworks a year, involving some 100m operations between them, the safety requirements for Standard are awesome. It would take just one operation in those 100m to go wrong for the result to be potentially fatal. The safety precautions at Standard's Huddersfield site - there are two further locations near Wakefield - are necessarily stringent. Storage buildings are well away from the numerous small production sheds, which are grouped in twos with thick brick walls between so that if one shed blows up no other section is damaged. The electrical wiring is on the outside of the buildings to prevent sparks. The gunpowder is stored separately under strict regulations. As none is manufactured in the UK - it has to be imported from Germany or former Yugoslavia - an expensive and difficult transportation procedure is involved. If the new resins could replace gunpowder, Standard would need less secure storage facilities and could reduce its costs in both sourcing and transportation. 'So few people make gunpowder to the quality we need - we're virtually single sourcing,' explains Rapley. In addition the number of suppliers is continuing to decrease. 'As each plant blows up they stop production. That's how it works.' Once the production of stars has been introduced successfully gunpowder looks set to be replaced in other fireworks. Next on the list could be fountains, for which Rapley is investigating the use of pourable resins so that the cardboard shell of the fountain could be filled with the pyrotechnic brew in the same way as toothpaste tubes are filled with toothpaste. The problem would be to ensure no gas bubbles remain in the mixture, as they would produce a bigger surface area for burning and result in chunks of the mix spurting out. The next step could be to develop the pellet motors for rockets. 'We would have a tremendous advantage if we could get into things like rocket motors,' Rapley continues. Other manufacturers could follow suit since the process is not proprietary. But it would take large volume production, says Rapley, to make it economical. For Standard, under pressure in its traditional UK market from cheaper, imported Chinese fireworks, cost reduction will be a welcome further advantage of the resin technology. And for the consumer the result could be more stable and prettier fireworks. 'I would hope we could produce some colours that we can't produce now,' predicts Rapley. While greens, yellow, reds and whites are relatively easy to produce by adding fragments of barium, sodium, strontium and magnesium respectively, blues and purples are notoriously difficult to produce safely. 'If the process is inherently safer,' says Rapley, 'we could perhaps add some ingredients that we can't use now.' Nonetheless, Rapley believes the versatility of gunpowder means it will be a long time - if ever - before it is replaced entirely. Which means the festive rhyme 'gunpowder, treason and plot' has still some life left in it yet.</p>

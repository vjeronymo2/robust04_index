			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Khody] </F>   [Text] Irkutsk May 19 TASS -- The far-regional inspection  for the protection of the freedom of the press and the mass  media has suspended the newspaper RUSSKIY VOSTOK instituted by  the local national patriotic movement Vernost.    The newspaper managers were notified that the newspaper was  suspended for going beyond its goals and tasks outlined in its  programme, which the newspaper did several times. The  inspection declared that a recent publication containing insults  against lawmakers of the Irkutsk regional legislative assembly,  which was entitled "Thieves Have Won or New Regional Committee  in Action", was aimed at flaring up social tension and  intolerance, which violates Article 4 of the Russian Law on the  Mass Media.    The newspaper, which is sold beyond the Far-Eastern region  and practically has a nationwide status, will have to be  re-registered in Moscow.</p>

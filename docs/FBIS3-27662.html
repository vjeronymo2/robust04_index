			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, February 24 (XINHUA) -- The Clinton  administration sent to Congress here today a legislation to  reform the country's export administration act of 1979, which  imposed "inefficient and obsolete" control of Cold War era on  exports.    The renewed Export Administration Act, according to Commerce  Secretary Ron Brown, represented a "very, very important effort"  and was "the first comprehensive effort to reform export control  licensing in 15 years."    "The legislation strikes the critical balance that is much  needed between (nuclear) nonproliferation concerns and economic  interests in our export control regime," Brown told a press  conference.    Among the regulatory changes, officials disclosed, are to  decontrol computers to most Western countries up to 1,000  million theoretical operations per second (mtops), which include  most of the desktop office machines.    For the countries which U.S. said it has nuclear  proliferation concerns, the decontrol was moved up to 500 mtops,  and for the few countries facing U.S. trade embargo, the  decontrol of computers will be allowed to 260 mtops.    Last September, as part of the national export strategy, the  Multi-agency Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC)  agreed to a substantial increase from the computers at the level  of 12.5 mtops, which is an old Apple Macintosh computer.    The new regulation for supercomputers was also raised from  195 mtops, to 1,500 mtops. "This is part of the effort to get  rid of obsolete Cold War controls that had no effect on  proliferation," said Barry Carter, undersecretary of commerce  for export administration.    The computer decontrol announced last September is expected  to generate 30 billion U.S. dollars of exports a year for the  U.S. Trade in computer and telecommunications sources said.    The administration officials, meanwhile, stressed that  "we're  halfway to home now," saying that they are going to consult with  congress and the business community for "even more constructive  changes."    In the new legislation, the administration stressed to use  multilateral efforts in export control, improve the U.S. ability  to prevent nuclear proliferation, and streamline export control  system.    The proposed act, which is a combined effort of the commerce  department, the defense department and the state department,  also stressed to harmonize U.S. sanction laws against the  countries with missiles and missile parts, chemical and  biological weapons.</p>

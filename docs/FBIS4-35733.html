			<p>BFN     [Text] Here is a report from the news desk:    Press reports a short while ago said that PLO Chairman Yasir  'Arafat is suffering from a serious deterioration in his health  condition that might require moving him from Tunis. He is  expected to be taken to the royal hospital [King Husayn's  medical center in Amman] this evening or tomorrow.    Reports circulating among Palestinian leaders this morning  indicated that 'Arafat's health has entered a serious stage.  Denying this, Mrs. 'Arafat said that 'Arafat was suffering from  bronchitis that forced him to stay in bed.</p>

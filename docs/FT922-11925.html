			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Arts: A film odyssey fit to bore the Bard - Cinema UNTIL THE END OF THE WORLD (15) Lumiere NAKED LUNCH (18) Cannon Shaftesbury Ave, Screen on the Green REBECCA'S DAUGHTERS (12) Odeon Haymarket THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE (15) Odeon West End BROADWAY BOUND (PG) Screen on the Hill It is Shakespeare's 428th birthday today. Something reminded me of the Bard  -perhaps it was the sense of passing centuries - in Wim Wenders' long, ambitious, awesomely picaresque Until The End Of The World. No, but there was something else too. In the film's last half, desert-dwelling scientist Max Von Sydow tries to help his blind wife Jeanne Moreau see with quasi-magical video footage shot around the world (in the film's first half) by their son William Hurt. Though set in 1999, this section is in mood and essence a replay of the 1956 sci-fi film Forbidden Planet, itself a replay of Shakespeare's The Tempest. The marooned and brooding wizard; the hubris of Man imitating God by tinkering with human potential; the sense of a scholarly 'court' lost far beyond time and place. Two and a half hours' long, with a five hour director's version waiting dauntingly in the wings, Until The End Of The World goes as far towards the edge of the world and of movie possibility as a modern film could. But in getting there it is terminally strained by the rigours of travel. The first half, not to circumlocute, is a fiasco. Here are Hurt and his girlfriend Solveig Dommartin (also Wenders's girlfriend, muse and co-writer) tearing around six countries whirring their camera and becoming entangled with a surfeit of subplots. A German detective, an Australian bounty hunter, two French bank robbers, Solveig's ex-boyfriend Sam Neill. . . Siberia, San Francisco, Beijing, Tokyo. . . no, stop the movie, I want to get off. In a sense we do get off. The film suddenly stops dead, tipping us into the red-earthed Australian desert. Here a movie Wenders has been nursing for 15 years begins at last to break free of abstraction. We sense the glimmer of excitement in a fable about 'seeing' set in a landscape whose native people aboriginally combine the hunter's outer eye with the dreamer's inner eye. And we thrill to the plane's-eye views of a land whose time-worn splendour dwarfs even the cityscapes we have gazed down on before, celestially glimpsed mazes of microchip buildings and winking fibre-optic lights. But even this promise does not last. Soon we are flung back upon the white man's plot, ruled by the phrasebook dialogue and warring accents of an 'international' cast. In Wenders' best films - Alice In The Cities, Kings Of The Road, Paris, Texas - human beings begin as blank enigmas and are coloured in by experience and social-cultural exposure. In Until The End Of The World, the characters begin as interchangeable co-production ciphers and stay that way. Even the film's climactic apocalypse of new technology - the swirling images of the film-within-film shot on high-definition video - fails to blast into life a film that is less like the intended fable about an image-sated world re-learning to see, more like an overlong storytelling soiree at the United Nations. * * * The Naked Lunch also strives towards new horizons and fails to reach them. Canadian shriek specialist David Cronenberg (The Fly, Dead Ringers), adapting William Burroughs' cult novel, presents a fabulist futureworld no more convincing, though more darkly playful, than Wenders'. Pest exterminator Bill Lee, played by Peter 'Robocop' Weller with a deadpan croak patterned on Burroughs himself, is haunted by giant bugs, talking typewriters and hideous Mugwumps resembling skinned lambs. This sounds like an average day in the life of a late 20th-century artist. But Weller thinks he needs a trip and takes one to 'Interzone' - equals Morocco - where he meets creepy Ian Holm, sultry Judy Davis (doubling as Mrs Weller and Mrs Holm) and more talking typewriters. When Cronenberg's shrinking budget prevented him from filming in Africa, he built the movie on a soundstage. It looks like it: I felt I was in a TV adaptation of Casablanca with special effects by the Muppets. The lighting is drab, the creatures are silly and the plot momentum - well, there isn't any. Burroughs's book had a point. It was a bad dream from the drug culture. It mixed the rhythmic anarchy of Beat writing with a quivery persecution mania out of Kafka via sci-fi. The book's shapelessness was its shape: it followed the cresta runs of its narrator-hero's damaged mind. Cronenberg's film is like a ski-run that never leaves the starting post. The problem may be the wrong kind of snow, or then again the wrong kind of director. Cronenberg's forte is for physical, as distinct from spiritual, dissection. His best films are under-the-knife nightmares about the invasion of the human body. But here visceral immediacy is supplanted by the tame frissons of second-hand symbolism. The only modern director who might do justice to Burroughs is David Lynch (or Burroughs himself). Cronenberg's talent seems both overstretched and underused. He cannot do justice to the free-associative delirium tremens of the book, even when pixillating the text with details from Burroughs' own life. At the same time he seems reduced by the need to make potentially ravening monsters quaintly metaphorical. * * * Peter O'Toole is a source of delight in Rebecca's Daughters. Wearing false upper teeth, a rakish wig and a live cat around his neck, he plays a dissolute landowner in 1843 Wales. Based on a Dylan Thomas original screenplay, tidied up by Guy Jenkin and directed by Karl Francis (Giro City), this agitprop romp allows O'Toole to behave like an absolute bounder whenever he is allowed to upstage - allowed? who could stop him? - the nominal hero and heroine played by Paul Rhys and Joely Richardson. She is O'Toole's daughter, he the gallivanting social crusader who sweeps her up in his struggle against the English tollgate laws. 'Rebecca's daughters' is the Bible-culled name of his male army, who dress up in drag to defend the peasant poor against the vicious tax wheezes of the rich. But the rich, as represented by O'Toole, are so much more fun. The film is footling whenever he is not on screen: like The Wicked Lady adapted by Bertolt Brecht. When he is on screen it is still footling but somehow inspirational. The drawling voice, the lolling gestures, the tipsy-staring eyes, the fond regard for his daughter ('What she needs is a good man on top of her]'): it is not so much that the Devil has the best tunes in this film as that none but he can sing in tune. Lastly, two from Tinseltown. In The Hand That Rocked The Cradle a vengeful nanny (Rebecca De Mornay) frightens a married couple (Annabella Sciorra, Matt McCoy) plus their tot. As Jean Renoir said, everyone has his reasons, and Miss Mornay has hers. This is a nice girl with a good background who simply likes to rig greenhouses so they slaughter people in a shower of glass, to sabotage Miss Sciorra's asthma spray so she is left writhing on the verandah, or to wield an axe as if trained at the Joan Crawford School for Advanced Child Care. Good Gothic fun, scripted by Amanda Silver and directed by Curtis Hanson. If one could order one by catalogue, I would have called in an axe murderer to liven up Broadway Bound. Here the cinema rounds off its stodgy adaptation of Neil Simon's autobiographical stage trilogy. Like Brighton Beach Memoirs this is set in a house in Brooklyn where the walls and furniture are all in mouldering brown. The time is the 1940s. The young Simon brothers yatter formative wisecracks; Grandad Hume Cronyn grouches; Ma Anne Bancroft reminisces and knits (brown wool - is she knitting the set?); and husband Jerry Orbach walks out. Lucky man. You, if foolish enough to have paid admission, should follow.</p>

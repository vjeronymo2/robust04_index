			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / International Company News: Daido Steel forecasts sharp first-half reverse DAIDO Steel, a leading Japanese supplier of steel to the car industry, expects to report a 56 per cent fall to Y2.5bn (Dollars 20.83m) in pre-tax profit for the first half, following the rapid decline in domestic passenger car sales. The company, strong in specialty steels, forecast sales of Y130bn for the six months to the end of September, down from Y150.7bn in the same period last year, due partly to pressure from leading customers for discounts. The Japanese steel industry has just applied to the government for assistance in 'employment adjustment', the transfer and retraining of idle workers. Steelmakers generally blame the weak demand on falling orders from important customers such as the construction and car industries. Daido is particularly vulnerable because about 60 per cent of its orders are from carmakers. For the full year, Daido expects a pre-tax profit of Y5bn, down from Y10.2bn last year, on sales of Y260bn, compared to Y299bn. The company had previously forecast a pre-tax profit of Y7bn and sales of Y280bn.</p>

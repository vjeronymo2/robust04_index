			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FANG LIZHI, THE 'CONTAMINANT';  </P> <P> DISSIDENT'S IDEAS LIVE IN THE PEOPLE -- AND INSIDE THE EMBASSY  </P> <P> In our first meeting with Chinese physicist Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li  Shuxian, we came to understand why they have so enraged Chinese authorities.  They refuse to accept not only the dictates of the Chinese Communist Party but  its very legitimacy. Like the prophets of the Bible, as well as fellow  physicist Andrei Sakharov and his wife, Elena Bonner, Fang and Li hold to a  different -- and to many, a higher set of values: human rights, decency and  democracy. Neither the Fangs nor the Sakharovs have any patience with the  excuse that arbitrary state controls are essential because the masses in China  and the Soviet Union are not yet ready for self-rule or democracy. The Fangs  and the Sakharovs are iconoclasts in societies where secular icons, arbitrarily  decreed by the ruling Communist officials, are not to be challenged.  </P> <P> Why was it, we asked the Fangs, that it was the hard scientists and a small  number of literary intellectuals, such as Liu Binyan, who like the Fangs and  the Sakharovs were among the first to challenge Communist Party orthodoxy? Why  not the social scientists who, after all, presumably specialize in such  matters? To Fang, the answer was simple. As a physicist, he had access to  scientific literature from the outside world. He recognized that the official  Chinese depiction of science differed from what fellow scientists in the  outside world accepted. It was scientific criteria rather than political  accommodation that affected his thinking and values.  </P> <P> In the same way he came to question official Chinese descriptions of political,  social and economic conditions both in and outside China. That meant that Fang  and Li were among the first to question not only Mao but the entire Chinese  Communist Party system. To Chinese officials, this meant that Fang was a  troublemaker and a contaminant to be eliminated.  </P> <P> There is no doubt that Fang's ideas and his actions have had an impact on the  democracy movement in China. In many ways, he served as the inspiration for the  student demonstrations that occurred in December, 1986. But the irony is that  in the recent demonstrations, Fang consciously kept a low profile.  </P> <P> The Chinese authorities, however, must find someone or something to blame, and  Fang is a convenient scapegoat. It is so much simpler for the leadership to say  that Fang and a few student leaders caused the whole problem. Otherwise, the  implication would be that poor political leadership and corruption among  officials had provoked the student demonstrations.  </P> <P> By blaming someone prominent like Fang, they also can explain away the chaos  and disorders that occurred and the fact that workers and ordinary people as  well as students joined in the demonstrations. Since the creation of the  Solidarity movement in Poland, there is nothing as frightening for Communist  Party authorities as the nightmare that workers may take to the streets to  protest not only economic upheaval but political deprivation as well.  </P> <P> Against this background, it may be easier to understand why the Chinese  leadership has called for the arrest of Fang and Li, even though of necessity  this has created an inevitable fight with the United States. President Bush was  embarrassed because he and his staff did not make more of a fuss when the  Chinese police kept Fang from attending Bush's dinner in China a few months  ago. Providing temporary refuge for Fang and his wife helps to compensate for  that earlier show of timidity.  </P> <P> Yet from the Chinese point of view, the safety provided by the U.S. Embassy in  Beijing is infuriating. It brings back memories of the 19th Century and  extraterritoriality, when foreign governments set up special enclaves and  declared themselves exempt from Chinese sovereignty. Under the circumstances,  we cannot assume that the Chinese will respect international law and customs  that are supposed to protect the operation of foreign diplomats and embassies.  Whether we see a repeat of the sacking of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, we should  remember that during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, the Chinese put embassies  under siege for two months. During the Cultural Revolution, Red Guards torched  the British Embassy.  </P> <P> Recent Chinese history has been scarred by periodic shifts between rationality  and chaos. Admittedly, during the last few years, the Chinese seemed to be  moving closer and closer to what appeared to the outside world to be normalcy.  Yet we should not lose sight of the fact that rapid change and rapid economic  growth can be disruptive, be it in China, Iran or the Soviet Union. The danger  is that the conservatives overreact, as they seem to be doing now.  </P> <P> It is tragic that recent events should be reduced to an assertion by the  Chinese government that what happened never happened, and to an attack on the  U.S. government for sheltering Fang. But in many ways this shows how difficult  change can be for totalitarian regimes and how heroic, prophetic individuals  symbolize both bravery and hope.  </P></p>

			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Warburg closes its discount house side SG WARBURG, the merchant banking group, is to close down the last vestiges of its discount house operation at the end of this month, further reducing the dwindling band of specialist intermediaries who play a pivotal role in the London money markets. Discount houses are the only institutions able to deal directly with the Bank of England, making them an important link in the Bank's activities to influence money market interest rates. Warburg merged its discount house into its gilt-edged market making business earlier this year, effectively cutting back its activities in the area, and is now to close the business entirely. The move was prompted by the decision to merge the money market activities of Warburg Securities and SG Warburg, which has led to a review of the business. Warburg said the business employed only one front-line trader and was not significant in the context of its main gilt-edged market making and money market activities. Other discount houses report that they have had a busy fortnight due to the upheaval in financial markets. Sterling's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism could prolong the life of London's discount market if it slows down or prevents sterling's participation in European monetary union.</p>

			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Left wing refuses to go quietly DISILLUSIONMENT with Labour's drift to the political centre is expressed in composite motions to be taken at conference this week, signalling that the party's increasingly marginalised leftwing is intent on remaining vocal. Although these motions are certain to be defeated, they presage a less than comfortable ride for the leadership in some debates. The leadership's push to become 'pale imitations of the Tories or Liberals' and to substitute 'show business for socialism' has 'now proved on two occasions to be futile', asserts one of the most out-spoken composites. It urges the party to 're-adopt and re-assert those policies which give hope to those who fear for their homes, their health, their jobs, their children's and their own futures'. Where the party leadership does again look set for defeat, however, is on defence, where a motion urges the party to reaffirm the commitment of past conferences to cut defence expenditure to the average level of other west European countries. On employment policy, one motion calls on a future Labour government to 'repeal all anti-union laws', noting that the re-election of a Conservative government in April meant 'the seventh round' of such legislation since 1980.</p>

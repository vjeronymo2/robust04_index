			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Ian Craig, architect of FT Statistics structure: Obituary Ian Craig, who died in a car accident on Saturday aged 53, was the architect of some of the most delicate and far-reaching technical changes carried out at the Financial Times. As systems manager of FT Statistics, he designed a modern structure for collecting and processing the vast array of market data printed daily in the FT and distributed to clients. He did not see every part of this complex operation transferred to the new suite of databases. But his disciplined mind, rigorous attention to detail and sheer professionalism not only took the FT's statistical operations from hot metal printing to the first generation of computerisation but set out an elegant design that will last well into the next century. Born in East Lothian, Ian Craig graduated as an engineer and served in the Queen's Flight of the RAF. He worked in the printing machinery industry before joining the FT in the mid-1970s when it was first exploring computerised production. He combined deep knowledge of the intricacies of typesetting with a creative mastery of computer technology. The kindest and most considerate of colleagues, he was always as willing to explain difficult technical issues patiently to lay people as he was open to new ideas. Sailing was Ian's spare-time passion, shared with the family he was devoted to. He leaves a widow, Carol, and their three children, Alastair, Nick and Sheena.</p>

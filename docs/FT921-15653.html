			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Leading Article: HK governor IT WILL be a difficult and probably thankless task to oversee the hand-over of Hong Kong from Britain to China in 1997. Most former colonies have emerged independent, but Hong Kong will uniquely be delivered, even if as a Special Administrative Region protected by its own law, to well-established, and decidedly threatening, communist masters. The governor succeeding Sir David Wilson later this year must be carefully chosen. Though Sir David's retirement - announced with his elevation to a peerage last week - was not a surprise, the hiatus until a successor is announced after Britain's general elections is unfortunate. These are uncertain, nervous times for Hong Kong. It can do without a period of speculation in which a series of unlikely names are bandied about. The government should try to obtain cross-party agreement to appoint a new governor before the elections. This could be difficult since some potential candidates might hope for other offices in London if their party were to win. But the future of Hong Kong is important enough to try. No clues are being given as to whether the new governor will be a diplomat, politician or from any other calling - with the one qualification that Hong Kong Chinese people appear to have been ruled out. Though China, which views the Hong Kong administration simply as an extension of the British government, would doubtless object strongly to a local governor, that is not a reason for rejecting the option outright. The idea has merit. But it has to be recognised that any governor must also be able to deal with Beijing. The governor will need to be not only an effective representative of departing Britain, but also alert to the needs of Hong Kong people. He, or she, must be prepared to stand up for them openly in negotiations with both London and Beijing, which between them take the most important decisions. Above all, the governor should not be seen as conditioned by Britain's former imperial role. He, or she, should be a politically adept, sensitive, robust and open chief executive, not a symbol of the Raj.</p>

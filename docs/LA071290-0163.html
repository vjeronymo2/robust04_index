			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S BACK TO THE WATER COOLER AT MCDONNELL  </P> <P> Computers used by an estimated 22,000 McDonnell Douglas workers in Long Beach  to communicate with each other are being turned off today.  </P> <P> The extraordinary move -- some employees say a drastic and even a desperate one  -- is just the latest effort by the company to meet a goal mandated by  McDonnell Douglas Chairman John McDonnell to save $700 million annually.  </P> <P> "These are times that call for drastic measures," said Douglas Aircraft  spokesman Don Hanson, acknowledging reports of the decision from sources inside  the plant. "We are talking about saving $700 million across the corporation.  That is a very big number."  </P> <P> Ironically, employees were notified of the decision by a message sent on the  very computer system that is to be decommissioned. "The McDonnell Douglas  executive council has decided to eliminate all electronic mail throughout the  corporation," the announcement said.  </P> <P> The computer system, made by International Business Machines, is known as PROFS  or "professional office system." It is used by employees to send and receive  messages electronically, keep daily schedules, compose letters or memos and  many other functions.  </P> <P> Employees are either outraged or frightened by the the decision. "People are  saying why don't you get rid of the telephones," said one professional  employee.  </P> <P> When word first began to circulate on June 27 about a possible decision to shut  down the system, 908 responses were sent to the management information center.  Of those, 905 were opposed to the move, a source said.  </P> <P> Without PROFs, employees will either have to place telephone calls or use  interoffice mail. But one employee noted that the company mail room is weeks  behind in distributing mail.  </P> <P> Hanson acknowledged that the mail room was running behind schedule as a result  of cost-cutting layoffs in the mail room staff.  </P> <P> But mail deliveries are improving. The company recently was forced, however, to  cut deliveries and pickups from a frequency of twice each day to only once each  day, another indication of the severity of the financial condition of the  company.  </P> <P> "It really does bring it home to you," Hanson said about the difficulties of  the cost-cutting effort.  </P> <P> In addition, a range of other plant services are being cut, such as the bus  service that shuttles employees around the plant. More seriously, the staff  that keeps plant machinery operating is also being trimmed, according to one  management source.  </P> <P> "They say we are just keeping the direct production people," the source said.  "They don't seem to understand that if their machines are not operating, it is  going to be difficult to keep production going."  </P> <P> Another internal source at Douglas said the company has 30,000 terminals in  Long Beach alone that are tied into the PROFs system. Other terminals link Long  Beach to such far-flung Douglas facilities as Cypress, Monrovia and Torrance.  </P> <P> Indeed, a key concern of many employees is that Douglas is so spread out that  without an electronic message system, communications will suffer. For example,  production of the Air Force C-17 cargo jet is on the west side of the Long  Beach airport, but the program's engineering staff is about two miles away on  the east side of the airport. The executive staff is about a mile north of that  building.  </P> <P> It is unclear just how much money the elimination of PROFs is supposed to save.  It is operated by four mainframe computers. A source said the company  ultimately might remove some PROFs terminals and eliminate some of the  mainframes.  </P></p>

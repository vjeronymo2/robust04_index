			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Baseball season brought to an end Last night Americans, or at least those who care about what really matters, were glumly facing the fact that next month will be like no peacetime October in 90 years. The rest of the baseball season, including the climactic World Series championship, was cancelled. After 34 days of a strike by the players, the inevitably curtain was finally rung down by Mr Bud Selig, who is both acting commissioner of baseball and owner of the Milwaukee Brewers team. 'This is a sad day,' he said. Mr Mario Cuomo, the governor of New York and once a promising young professional himself, probably expressed national emotions more accurately, if neutrally. 'It was a wicked thing to do; a really wicked thing,' he lamented over the loss of what had promised to be a record-breaking season for several players (and possibly a championship one for the New York Yankees). Mr Selig naturally blamed the players, who walked out on August 12 after complex, protracted negotiations over a new contract broke down. The strike, he said, 'leaves us with no choice'. Actually, the owners of two clubs, the Baltimore Orioles and the Cincinnati Reds, voted against turning off the lights, but there was no sign they would barnstorm the nation and play each other exclusively for the next month. This was baseball's eighth industrial dispute in the last 22 years. The technical sticking point was the players' refusal to accept the owners' proposal of a cap on team salaries, designed to distribute revenues more evenly among the rich and poor clubs. But it would be wrong to ascribe the breakdown to the greed of the players (minimum salary Dollars 109,000 - Pounds 70,000 - a year, maximum individual contract Dollars 31,500 a game). The owners themselves have failed to address revenue-sharing for years and have consistently refused to open their books to the public or the players' union. Since the walk-out, it has been the players who have made all the negotiating proposals and who contended last night that the owners' action was premature. It is far from clear that there will be a next season. Spring training normally resumes late in February. Both sides have some hard thinking to do over the winter.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- Japanese import prices on  items used in daily life fell 5.8 percent in March from a year  before, influenced by the high yen, the Finance Ministry said  Thursday [28 April].    Of the 30 items surveyed, 25 fell in price from a year  earlier, with 13 falling by double-digit percentages, a ministry  official told reporters in releasing the monthly report.    The dollar's value against the yen fell 10.9 percent in  March  from a year before to an average 105.04 yen, he said.    Among the reasons that the average price decline was less  than the increase in the yen's buying power, he said, was a  number of imports contracted for in the Japanese currency and  shifts in product preferences among certain categories.    Among the large decliners was frozen octopus, with falling  production prices pushing the import price down 24.6 percent.    A switch to cheaper brands pushed European electric shaver  prices down 39.5 percent and U.S. golf club prices down 19.9  percent, the official said.    By contrast, import prices for British whiskey jumped 16.4  percent. The official cited a statistical reaction to a large  fall a year earlier as well as a shift to more expensive malted  whiskies.    Strong U.S. demand for frozen shrimp and prawns pushed the  Japanese import price up 1.0 percent and a switch to more  expensive navel oranges pushed orange prices up 2.2 percent.    Lemon and lime prices, however, fell 13.4 percent and  grapefruit 6.1 percent due mainly to the yen's rise, the  official said.    Fresh and frozen beef prices fell 4.0 percent, with the  effect of the high-yen dampened by rising production prices, he  said.</p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: Baker warns of rightwing extremism MR Kenneth Baker, the home secretary, last night sought to raise the spectre of rising immigration and an upsurge in rightwing extremism if the Conservatives lose the general election, Philip Stephens writes. His comments brought immediate charges from opposition leaders that he was deliberately 'scare-mongering'. His remarks were condemned by Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, and Mr Roy Hattersley, the shadow home secretary. Mr Baker, in a speech which linked the alleged opposition of the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties to tight controls on political asylum with the possibility of electoral reform, said that Britain could see the emergence of fascist movements comparable with those in Germany and France. He said that recent German regional elections, in which the extreme rightwing Republicans gained seats with nearly 11 per cent of the vote, were a warning as to what could happen. The rise of the right in continental Europe had been linked inextricably to a flood of migrants and asylum-seekers. Only the Conservatives would offer tough laws to prevent that occurring in Britain. Mr Baker said that the situation in Germany could not happen under Britain's electoral system. Proportional representation made it easier for extremist minorities to gain power. He concluded: 'Proportional representation has helped the fascists to march again in Europe. It is a terrible warning to us about what could happen if we threw away our system of first-past-the-post election.'</p>

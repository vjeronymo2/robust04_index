			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Construction Contracts: Avionics facility at Llantrisant LAING SOUTH WEST has been awarded a contract by British Airways to build a high-technology centre for the specialist repair and servicing of aircraft electronic components at Llantrisant, mid Glamorgan. The Pounds 30m development is being undertaken by British Airways in association with the Welsh Development Agency. The avionics facility will comprise three two-storey buildings, car parking, access roads and service yards plus minor buildings. Providing a total gross floor area of about 12,780 sq metres, the main buildings will house 12 production units for repairing and servicing avionics equipment plus two support units to service the testing equipment. A highly serviced environment is required to support the extensive computer and sensitive equipment needed in each unit. An important feature is the automated storage and distribution system. Completion of the whole project is scheduled for April 1994.</p>

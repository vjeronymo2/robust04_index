The first is led by Menduh Taci and the  second is connected with the legal committee for the preparation  of the congress of the party. The dilemma arises as to which  leadership will be legal and present the body of the congress.  It is interesting to note that the assembly under the  leadership of Taci was attended by the representative of the  Democratic Party of Albania, Saban Memia. Otherwise,  representatives of both factions of the PDP stayed in Tirana,  last week, on a "reconciliation" visit. However, the outcome in  Tetovo, this weekend, shows that the "axe was not buried."</p>

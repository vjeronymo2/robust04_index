			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Hotelier's new home: Single occupancy, three meals, no balcony. Only $26 a day.  That would be the average cost to taxpayers for each day Leona Helmsley could  spend in Danbury Prison Camp in Connecticut. Helmsley is free on bail pending  an appeal of her August conviction. Danbury is reportedly like a college  campus, with no fences and unlocked rooms.  </P> <P> Long Story: Even when Louisiana's colorful Gov. Earl Long was cavorting with  stripper Blaze Starr, he came home at night, his widow says. Blanche Long, 87,  discussed Long's romps (re-created by Paul Newman and Lolita Davidovich in the  movie "Blaze") with the press. "He was down there on Bourbon Street a lot, (but  he) would be right at home that night. You know how men do that sort of thing,  don't you?" Historians agree Starr was not the love of Long's life, because he  also saw other women at the time. "What with the drugs he was taking, the  liquor and the cigarettes, he was almost impotent, and that's why he was  grabbing these young women," said historian Morgan Peoples.  </P> <P> Jackpot: Col. Jack Waters of the Salvation Army announced that because his  charity had been banned from many shoping malls, the group would lose about  $100,000 this season. But then Barbara Bush dropped $10 in a kettle in  Washington. Now, Lillian Soloman and her brother Izzy Cohen, chairman of Giant  Foods, have read about the First Lady's donation and decided to give Waters a  $100,000 check.  </P> <P> MOTH Award: The 1989 Most Outrageous Tabloid Headline Awards were announced by  United States Playing Card Co. of Cincinnati. From the Sun: "It's Every  Infant's Nightmare . . . Boy George to Adopt a Baby," which won the music and  entertainment category. From the Globe: "Man Explodes on Operating Table" won  health and fitness. And "Bride's Kiss Makes 80 Guests Sick" copped the society  prize for the Weekly World News. BETTIJANE LEVINE  </P></p>

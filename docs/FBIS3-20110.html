			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Gianluca Luzi report: "Martinazzoli: `They Both Lost'"] </F>   [Text] Rome -- They fought tooth and nail for over an hour  and a half, but it was not enough. Even at a distance, Forza  Italia's leader and the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left]  secretary are still exchanging very heavy blows, and between the  two combatants the center is condemning them both and  proclaiming itself the winner: "Occhetto and Berlusconi only  know how to fight, and have nothing to say. We do not like  either of them, and the voters will vote for us."    "No, we cannot accept it: Berlusconi is turning the clocks  back. He can only conceive of politics as `anti' something, not  as a blueprint applicable to the whole of the national  community." The duel is over, but Achille Occhetto has not  changed his mind about his adversary, Silvio Berlusconi.  Indeed, he is reaffirming and reinforcing it: "Berlusconi does  not meet the need for the establishment in this country at last  of a new Left and a new Right, both capable of aiming at  government. He is unable to acknowledge that we have entered  the new phase, of alternative programs."    Occhetto absolutely cannot accept Berlusconi's observation  that "if the Left wins there will be no return match." Occhetto  pointed out that Berlusconi "has not withdrawn it, and this is  the most disturbing aspect of this new Right that has rallied  around Berlusconi."    These were tough and uncompromising assessments. They are  not surprising, however, inasmuch as the Forza Italia leader is  the number one enemy of the progressive forces. But the  comments from the center were no less fierce, though addressed  to both rivals, and not just to Berlusconi. The main criticism  was for the length of the debate, which lasted much longer than  expected and which supposedly jeopardized the center by focusing  attention only on the Right and the Left. Mario Segni, the Pact  leader, wrote to media watchdog Giuseppe Santaniello to protest  and to demand an opportunity to recover his disadvantage. "The  `Trial of Strength' television program has always lasted 45  minutes," Segni pointed out. "On the occasion of the debate  between Occhetto and Berlusconi, it lasted at least an hour and  40 minutes. Since this creates an objective disadvantage with  respect to the time made available to the Pact for Italy, I  request that appropriate measures be taken with the necessary  promptness to calculate the necessary adjustment in terms of  time and benefits due to the Pact for Italy."    As for matters of political substance: "If what emerged on  television is Italy's Right and Left, then we are in trouble.  It was a drawn match, which I believe persuaded people not to  vote for either of the two. I believe that the center will  benefit from it."    Mino Martinazzoli did not watch the duel on television:  "Nevertheless, I formed an idea of it from reading the  newspapers," the Popular Party secretary commented drily, "and  it confirmed to me that people can only watch such things out of  pure masochism." Martinazzoli too believes that the voters will  have concluded from the duel that neither the Right nor the Left  is trustworthy. "They have tried to convince people with the  idea that only they will be in the running. They use  spectacular methods, and commit many instances of immoderation,  both public and private. Ultimately, however, that suits me  fine, because the more they talk, the more our own arguments are  strengthened."    In other words, according to the representatives of the  center, the Occhetto-Berlusconi duel backfired. [Italian  Republican Party, PRI, Secretary] La Malfa confirmed this: "The  debate was the most obvious proof to all voters of the poverty  of the arguments of both alignments, both Left and Right. The  two contestants oscillated between very petty personal polemics  and an absolute lack of incisiveness in presenting their  respective stances." La Malfa's conclusion was that "the  election campaign has been very useful: It has deflated two  sham alignments and brought to light their complete absence of  policies and programs."    The debate was also examined during the political discussion  on RAI channel two. According to Giuseppe Ayala [Democratic  Alliance], "Occhetto made the best impression," against a  Berlusconi who was "on the defensive," while the National  Alliance's Francesco Storace saw in Occhetto "the promise of a  defeat. I saw him succumb for the second time, after his  encounter with [Italian Social Movement and National Alliance  leader] Fini." According to the League's Franco Rocchetta, the  PDS leader has "great skills as a performer," whereas Berlusconi  "is a more normal person, which is why he has gathered more  support." [Radical leader] Marco Pannella said Berlusconi was  the winner: "Keeping in mind that it was Berlusconi's first  time, whereas Occhetto is an expert in debates, Berlusconi  should score an extra point for doing well."</p>

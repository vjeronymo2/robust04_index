			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S., CANADA, MEXICO PLAN TRADE TALKS  </P> <P> In a prelude to a possible three-nation free-trade agreement, the United  States, Mexico and Canada will begin talks on transportation issues in  Washington next week, U.S. officials announced here Tuesday.  </P> <P> The talks are part of efforts to establish a three-nation free-trade zone, said  John Negroponte, U.S. ambassador to Mexico.  </P> <P> The countries' representatives to the final session of the international trade  talks in Belgium this week also will be discussing a three-way agreement, he  told reporters in a press conference.  </P> <P> Negroponte said that if three-way talks fail, the United States still will try  to negotiate a bilateral agreement with Mexico. The United States and Canada  signed a free-trade agreement two years ago.  </P> <P> Truck, bus and rail transport regulations will be discussed in an effort to set  a timetable for liberalization by the time formal talks on a free-trade  agreement begin in mid-1991, said U.S. Secretary of Transportation Samuel K.  Skinner.  </P> <P> "We want to be sure that implementation of a (free-trade agreement) would not  be hindered by transportation issues outside the agreement," he said.  </P> <P> Skinner is in Mexico this week to meet with transportation officials and to  sign an agreement on rules for U.S. charter and tour bus operations in Mexico.  Previously, U.S. bus companies could not operate here.  </P> <P> Since taking office two years ago, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari  has begun deregulating the transportation industry. However, impediments for  foreign companies still exist, such as requirements that freight trailers be  switched to Mexican-registered cabs and drivers on trips further than 16 miles  beyond the border.  </P> <P> Canadian officials agreed with Skinner that improving transportation is  essential.  </P></p>

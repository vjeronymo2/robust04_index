			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / German Bunds: Balance tips in favour of rate cut SO WILL the Bundesbank policy-making council cut interest rates when it meets in Leipzig on Thursday? If so, what impact will it have on the bund market? After the markets were disappointed last week with a most minuscule snipping of the rate, the balance may have been tipped in favour of a cut in the German central bank's official rates on Thursday. While the cut in the repo rate from 7.6 to 7.59 per cent was the first cut at all since May 12, it could hardly have been more begrudging. However, comments made by Mr Hans Tietmeyer on local radio yesterday were more encouraging. The vice-president of the central bank made clear that he had no wish to see rates kept at unnecessarily high levels. In a restatement of the central bank's long-term policy, he said that the Bundesbank intended to bring rates down, but only in such a way that long-term rates did not rise in response to easing at the short-end of the yield curve. As other members of the council have indicated recently, and as Mr Tietmeyer reiterated, this can only happen if other parties to the policy-mix equation pull the necessarily weight; if the political establishment is successful in pushing though the much-vaunted public spending cuts, which are currently in the final throes of negotiations; and if unions and employers agree to show the necessary wage restraint. Significantly, Mr Tietmeyer appeared to rule out the current weakness of the D-Mark against other currencies within the European exchange rate mechanism, the US dollar and the yen as an obstacle to further easing. The weakness of the D-Mark ought to be interpreted as a 'normalisation', he said, after a period in which foreign funds were pulled into the German currency. These funds were now flowing back to their home currencies, a natural development and not cause for concern. Even before this statement, economists had become confident that the Bundesbank would resume its process of gradual interest rate cuts before too long. 'I think we will see another 25 basis points off the discount rate before the end of July,' said Mr Thomas Mayer, an economist at Goldman Sachs, in Frankfurt last Friday. Such a move would cut the discount from 7.25 to 7 per cent. Mr Mayer described the tiny cut in the repo rate last week as a 'loosening up exercise' ahead of further easing. However, any easing in repo and therefore money market rates cannot take place without a reduction in the discount rate, which acts as a floor to the Bundesbank's money market operations. 'The Bundesbank has a lot of balls in the air,' said Mr Robert Barrie, economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London, 'and some of those balls will have to be dropped - for example, the currency, which is overvalued.' Mr Barrie believes that in the light of the problems in the German economy, the Bundesbank has 'dragged its feet too long ' in making cuts. The headline inflation figure - still more than 4 per cent - underestimates the forces working against future inflation in Germany. Money supply growth is also on the way down, Mr Barrie said, both factors militating in favour of early rate cuts. Opinions differ on the impact on the bund market. Mr Mayer at Goldman Sachs believes the pattern of future easing has been anticipated to a large extent and that long bond yields - while they may receive a fillip from a cut in rates this week - are set to move up over the rest of the year. He is predicting that long bund yields will be at 7.25 per cent in the early part of next year, up from 6.7 per cent at present. Mr Barrie is more sanguine. He forecasts that yields on the long bund will be down to 6.35 per cent by the end of the year. The best performance is likely to come at the short and medium end of the yield curve where the impact of cuts in short-term official rates will be most keenly felt.</p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Letter: Disquiet over competitive tendering Sir, Your recent article, 'Council contractors reduce tendering prices' (July 9), claiming savings in second round compulsory competitive tendering (CCT) contracts for refuse collection of upwards of 18 per cent has caused more than a little disquiet. The plain fact is that the research on which the report is based appears to leave a good deal to be desired and the conclusions drawn are somewhat suspect. Many of the authorities listed were displeased at being cited as examples at this stage without consultation. The Local Authority Associations have asked the Local Government Management Board's CCT information service to carry out a detailed analysis of the authorities quoted as examples from the recent CCT report by CDC Research. Not one single reference has so far been found to be wholly accurate. For instance, one authority mentioned that it is not actually due to re-tender its contract until November 1995 and another has suspended its CCT programme prior to the outcome of local government reorganisation and extended its existing contract. We have not named the authorities here because the LGMB database has a duty of confidentiality to its members. Even if the figures were accurate, one should not assume that the compulsory tendering process in itself necessarily generates any savings. Any apparent savings may be attributable to a range of factors including financial pressures and changes to service specifications. It is naive to assume that changes occurring over the period during which CCT has operated have necessarily been brought about by CCT.

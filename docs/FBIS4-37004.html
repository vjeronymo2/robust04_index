			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  Presidential Council chairman, today received the ambassadors of  the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] member states to our country.  The president asked the ambassadors to convey messages to his  brothers the leaders of these states on developments in our  country and issues concerning relations between our country and  each of their states.    In his messages, the brother president stressed that what is  going on in Yemen is an internal affair in which no party should  interfere in order to ensure that the conflict will not be  prolonged and to spare further Yemeni blood. The brother  president urged his brothers the leaders of the GCC member  states to do whatever is needed to preserve the Yemeni unity and  stability in Yemen which will be in the interest of the Yemeni  people and strengthen security and stability in the region. He  stressed that the Yemeni unity is an important and basic element  for stability in Yemen and the region and embodies the Arab  nation's national objectives and supreme interests. He also  stressed that preserving this unity is a pan- Arab  responsibility as much as a Yemeni responsibility.    The brother leader noted the Republic of Yemen's eagerness  to  improve its strong brotherly ties with its sisterly GCC member  states on the basis of mutual respect, good neighborliness,  noninterference in internal affairs, and the positive  cooperation that embodies the common aspirations of the Yemeni  people and their brothers in the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf.</p>

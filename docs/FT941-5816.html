			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / German industry faces engineering workers' strike Almost 40,000 engineering workers in the German state of Lower Saxony have voted in favour of a strike, union leaders announced yesterday, clearing the way for the first major conflict in the industry for a decade. The engineering employers' federation, Gesamtmetall, called for an urgent meeting with IG Metall, the engineering workers' union, in a bid to prevent strikes from starting on Monday. The national executive of the union will decide today in Frankfurt whether to accept the invitation or insist on a formal offer from the employers before returning to the negotiating table. The overwhelming vote in Lower Saxony, where more than 92 per cent of the 41,000 eligible union members voted for strike action, gives the embattled IG Metall leadership useful ammunition in its efforts to wring an improved package on job security and wages out of the employers. It was clear yesterday in Hanover, the state capital of Lower Saxony, that the union sees itself being dragged reluctantly into a full-scale conflict. Mr Jurgen Peters, the chief union organiser in the state, said only some 10,000 of the union's members would be called out on Monday, and the companies chosen would if possible not include suppliers to the recession-struck motor industry. The union wishes to minimise the knock-on effects of the stoppage. He said that if the employers were simply proposing new talks, without any proper offer, 'it will not be worth our time . . . . The employers must give clear signals that these will be negotiations, not just talks.' Mr Hans-Joachim Gottschol, president of Gesamtmetall, proposed the direct talks with Mr Klaus Zwickel, the IG Metall leader, without any indication that new ideas were on offer. He said both sides agreed that securing existing jobs was the highest priority for the industry, which has seen 30,000 redundancies a month during the past year. But he warned that it would not be good enough if peace was bought at the price of higher wage costs, which would simply lead to further job losses. Mr Dieter Hundt, one of the employers' chief negotiators, said the plan was simply to take up the negotiations where they broke off three weeks ago. However, a Gesamtmetall official said there were plenty of ideas on areas of possible compromise. If the attempt to get both sides back together fails, IG Metall has already set out a strategy of gradual escalation of the strike. The last full-scale engineering workers' strike, in 1984, lasted a month, and knocked 0.5 per cent off the annual growth rate of the German economy.</p>

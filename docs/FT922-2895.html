Over the 12 days of the conference Brazil has gained more in bilateral and multilateral aid commitments than at any time in the past decade and more than the rest of money pledged for new world aid.

Germany has pledged Dollars 300m to Brazil in concessional aid. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) has agreed to release Dollars 1bn and the World Bank is to increase its lending from Dollars 700m last year to Dollars 1.08bn. The heads of the World Bank, IDB, and International Monetary Fund each promised between Dollars 350m and Dollars 400m as initial collateral in Brazil's current negotiations on its commercial debt. The total in new aid for this year could reach Dollars 4bn - compared with what appears to be only Dollars 2.5bn (the numbers are vague) pledged for environmental projects worldwide by leaders of industrialised nations at the summit. The direct cost of the summit to Brazil was about Dollars 37m. 'The returns have been very good,' said Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira, Brazil's economy minister.

'First of all everyone was here and it gave us chance to speak to heads of state and of multilateral institutions directly; secondly everyone wanted to sign things here.'</p>

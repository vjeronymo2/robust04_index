			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Gerd Brueggemann: "Greenspan in a Fix"] </F>   [Text] The U.S. dollar has had problems for weeks. The  exchange rate of the U.S. currency is on a constant downward  slide, which has brought it to so far unknown low levels  compared with the Japanese yen and has made it fall to less than  1.6 German marks on occasion.    However, this weakening was no coincidence but was certainly  intended. The White House -- annoyed by Tokyo's unwillingness  to make efforts to reduce its gigantic trade surplus -- tried to  put pressure on the Japanese by strengthening the yen.    However, this policy, whose usefulness one might dispute  anyway, had unexpected side effects. It undermined the trust of  the international money managers in the United States and made  them get rid of their dollar investments on a wide scale. This  made long-term interest rates in the United States rise.    Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, had  hoped to be able to avoid this development by raising interest  rates on short notice. However, this calculation did not work.  The investors are obviously missing a clear commitment by the  U.S. Administration to its own currency. So far, it has not  been made.    This puts Chairman Greenspan in a dilemma. If he continues  to raise short-term interests, as the markets demand, there is  the danger that he will strangle the incipient recovery. If he  leaves them unchanged, investors will continue to unload their  dollars.</p>

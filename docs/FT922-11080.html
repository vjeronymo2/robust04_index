			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / International Company News: Qantas considers stake in carrier QANTAS Airways, Australia's government-owned international carrier, yesterday said it was considering bidding for a significant stake in Australian Airlines, the domestic carrier which is to be privatised next year. Mr John Ward, chief executive, said Qantas would file an expression of interest with the government's airline sales task force on Thursday, the deadline for indicative offers. However, Mr Ward said Qantas had not finally decided to bid for Australian, and indicated the airline also planned to discuss a possible operating agreement with Ansett Australia, the domestic carrier jointly owned by TNT and News Corporation. He said Qantas's preference was for a significant holding in Australian, but it would be unable to judge whether to bid for a controlling stake until the next stage of the sale, when the government would discuss detailed options with bidders. Qantas has been barred from discussions with Australian, Ansett and other airlines since an information memorandum on Australian was circulated by the government shortly before Christmas. However, the government announced in February that a ban on cross-shareholdings between Qantas and the domestic airlines would be lifted as part of a proposed second stage of deregulation in the Australian aviation market. Mr Ward said the acquisition of a significant stake in Australian was not beyond the financial capacity of Qantas, although short-term bridging finance might be required until the international airline's own partial privatisation was finalised. 'I wouldn't see a stake in a domestic airline as being insurmountable,' he said. 'We have been trading profitably for several months (and) . . . we don't see anything in our financial position incompatible with a bid for Australian.' Mr Ward said the government's revised aviation policies, which would allow domestic carriers to fly on international routes and create a single aviation market in Australia and New Zealand, had confused the prospects for its own partial privatisation. However, he said the airline hoped the sale of 49 per cent of its capital would go ahead later this year, either by way of a trade sale or a flotation on the Australian Stock Exchange. Initial enthusiasm for the airline sales has cooled in the face of international recession and changes in government policy. But British Airways and Air New Zealand are believed to be interested in acquiring stakes in Australian Airlines. Singapore Airlines is believed to be interested in taking a stake in Qantas.</p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Benetton ahead 12% over year Benetton, the Italian clothing group, again defied the worldwide recession, increasing net consolidated profits last year by a further 12.6 per cent to L208bn (Dollars 86m), compared with L185bn in 1992. The company backed up an optimistic statement by proposing a 10 per cent increase in the dividend, to L385 a share from L350. Benetton said it had experienced strong growth in sales in the US and Caribbean, where revenue increased by 19 per cent, in the east Asia (83 per cent growth) and the Middle East (up 51 per cent). Overall consolidated sales in the 120 countries where Benetton is now established rose to L2,751bn, against L2,512bn in 1992. Operating profits increased 14 per cent to L408bn, while an additional 75m pieces of clothing were manufactured worldwide. Benetton said there had been a further cut in operating costs, due to continuing rationalisation of production, including the integration of Benetton's Italian manufacturers into the group. The group drew attention to the performance of its shares in 1993, during which the market capitalisation of Benetton nearly doubled to L4,345bn from L2,278bn, while the principal Milan stock market index increased by 35.6 per cent. Over the last year, Benetton has been keen to widen the international spread of its shareholder register. At the beginning of this month, the group announced plans for a bond issue and a placing of 19m new shares overseas.</p>

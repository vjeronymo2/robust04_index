			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> A WRAP FOR WILLIAMS, BRIDGES  </P> <P> Principal photography on "The Fisher King," starring Robin Williams and Jeff  Bridges, has been completed in Los Angeles after a production schedule of three  months.  </P> <P> "The Fisher King" is billed as a dramatic comedy about one man's attempt to  redeem himself from a life of fatal cynicism through his allegiance with a  visionary street person.  </P> <P> Williams will be seen as a professor of medieval history who has retreated into  a world of his own creation to isolate himself from his past. Bridges plays a  radio shock jockey who falls from grace.  </P></p>

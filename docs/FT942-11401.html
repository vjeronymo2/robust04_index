			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (19): Settlement delays a source of pain - While recession has played its part in slowing payments, for many companies it is a matter of policy, aimed at strengthening their own cash flows and saving on borrowing costs / Payment problems Europe's small business community is never short of worries. Bureaucracy, taxes, training, recession, inflation, interest rates - the list of concerns is a familiar one, although their relative importance may vary from month to month or country to country. But one an issue arouses particular bitterness, perhaps because it is seen as an unnecessary problem: late payment by customers, especially large companies. Many buyers, as a matter of policy, systematically delay settlement of invoices in order to strengthen their own cash flow positions and save on borrowing costs. 'It is commonplace for large companies who have got a decent accounting and finance set-up to introduce a system to slow outflow of cash,' says Martin Williams, commercial director of the credit information company, Graydon (UK). 'Recession does have an impact on the large companies. Cash management becomes very important to large organisations. And, as a consequence, you get financial directors telling their account managers to actually slow down on payment. Obviously it is small companies which always suffer'. When interest rates are high there is a greater incentive to hang on to cash as long as possible. Small firms are more likely to be kept waiting because they are usually in a weak position to confront big customers. Statistics present a mixed picture but spokesmen for small business feel that over the past few years payment standards have generally declined. 'Ethics have deteriorated in the UK and in others as well,' says Brian Prime, president of Europmi, the European Committee for Small and Medium Independent Companies. 'Once upon a time you had a code of honour in business, and you honoured your bills and paid on time.' Europmi administrative director, Bruno Wattenbergh, believes that the fear of payment delay is deterring many firms from taking advantage of the EU single market and developing their export sales. Many already have difficulty collecting money on time from buyers in their own countries and realise that barriers of language and distance could make for even worse problems if they start trading abroad. The brake that payment worries exert on the potential growth of intra-European trade is also a concern for the European Commission, which last July organised a conference in Brussels to discuss the issues, bringing together representatives of small and large firms, banks, factoring houses and government. Nevertheless, analysis by the credit reporting group Dun &amp; Bradstreet suggests that the overall incidence of payment delay in the business world has not changed much over the past five years. Between 1989 and 1994, the average number of days delay actually fell in France from 28 to 24 and in the UK from 51 days to 49. In Ireland it remained the same, at 34 days. There was also no change in Sweden or Norway (both 18 days). But delays did worsen in Germany from 18 days to 19 and in Italy from 34 days to 37. Other survey results suggest that recession has increased payment pressures, particularly for small businesses. Bruno Wattenbergh cites figures that show declining respect for contractual payment terms in Germany during 1991 and 1992. During 1993, he says, enquiries in Denmark found 35 per cent of companies reporting payment problems, while in France 48 per cent of companies had difficulties. In the UK problems were reported by as many as 67 per cent of businesses. According to some analysts, there are sectors - such as pharmaceuticals and high technology - where late payment is less common. This may reflect long standing differences in attitude and a smaller choice of suppliers, which makes big firms more aware of the need to keep those they buy from in business. On the other hand, there are sectors where payment performance appears to be worse than average, such as construction, retailing and, in Germany, steel. Governments have begun to pay more attention to the issue and much discussion has taken place over whether granting suppliers the legal right to charge interest would pressure buyers into paying early. UK credit insurers Trade Indemnity have reluctantly concluded that other methods having failed, legislation granting an automatic right to interest may be the only option for governments. But Colin Foxall, chief executive of NCM Credit Insurance is sceptical. He fears that such a move might easily give formal status to late payment - big firms might just pay the interest willingly, as a cheaper form of credit than bank overdraft. The small business representatives also take this view. Suppliers already enjoy a right to interest in Scandinavia. But, as one analyst points out, the Nordic economies are relatively small. Companies often develop close interdependent relationships and big firms may have a fairly restricted choice of suppliers. They cannot easily switch procurement to another firm that is less pushy in demanding to be paid on time.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Analysis" by Semih D. Idiz: "Turkey and U.S. Tread a </F> Delicate Path on Iraq"]    [Text] Ankara--The firm U.S. stance on the U.N.-imposed  embargo on Iraq, and Turkey's continuing insistence that the  question of its losses resulting from that embargo be addressed,  remain potential sources of friction between Ankara and  Washington. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit  last week to the Gulf, his article published in THE NEW YORK  TIMES over the weekend, entitled "Rigid Iraq Merits No UN  Mercy," as well as a statement by a U.S. State Department  spokesman on Monday [2 May] on the subject, are all being  interpreted in Ankara as open signals of disapproval of the  policy Turkey is trying to develop over Iraq.    Prime Minister Ciller on Tuesday denied recent press reports  that Washington had given Turkey a "strongly worded" diplomatic  note on the matter, and said that Ankara's efforts towards the  lifting of the embargo on Iraq would continue. Ciller also  said that Turkey had no intention of departing from the U.N.  system on this issue.    Hoping to avoid a serious fall-out with Washington over this  matter, but still trying to ensure that Turkey's vital interests  regarding the ongoing problem in Iraq are not overlooked,  officials in Ankara have acknowledged that Turkey is currently  treading a delicate course in terms of its relations with the  United States.    A sign of this was given by Foreign Ministry Undersecretary  Ozdem Sanberk, when he told reporters on Monday that contacts  with the United States on this subject were continuing. "The  United States acknowledges the need to work together on this  issue," Sanberk said, indicating that technical level talks were  underway in Washington.    "Turkey has overtaken everyone by taking the Iraq initiative  in hand," he added, underlining that it would not let go of this  initiative in the debate which will apparently continue.  Sanberk's visit to Baghdad last month, the highest level visit  from Turkey since the Gulf Crisis, had raised some eyebrows in  Washington. Diplomatic sources say the visit increased the  discomfort felt ever since Prime Minister Ciller started arguing  last year that the embargo on Iraq should be eased. Upon his  return to Amman from Baghdad, Sanberk remarked that the two  countries had agreed to flush the pipeline running between them,  within the context of a "limited rescue operation," in order to  prevent the pipeline from being damaged. This statement was  also met with displeasure.    "We propose a limited rescue operation, whereby the pipeline  will be flushed once or twice, repaired and closed, and then we  will wait for the lifting of the embargo" Sanberk had said.  Sanberk told reporters on Monday that Turkey's flushing of the  pipeline did not require an application to the U.N. Sanctions  Committee because Turkey would not export the oil and no funds  would be transferred to Iraq as a result of this operation. But  there have been suggestions emanating from officials in Ankara  that of the 12 million barrels of oil in the pipeline, 3.8  billion belonged to Turkey, because Ankara was owed $2 billion  by Iraq. Officials also suggested that a portion of the oil  belonging to Iraq could be sold to meet the humanitarian needs  of that country, without breaking the U.N. sanctions.    However an article in THE WASHINGTON POST on Saturday quoted  anonymous U.S. officials in Washington as saying that such an  arrangement "may have some elements that could violate the  sanctions." Turkey argues that the Security Council should  review the trade sanctions against Iraq because these have not  only proved ineffective but have also damaged Turkish interests.  Official estimates in Ankara indicate that ever since the  United Nations imposed the sanctions on Baghdad, following the  invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, Turkey has lost at least $3  billion a year in trade, services and revenues from the oil  pipeline which it shares with Iraq.    Shortly after coming to power last year, Prime Minister  Tansu  Ciller made getting Turkey's allies to rethink the embargo one  of Ankara's main priorities.    Addressing the parliamentary group of her True Path Party on  Tuesday, Ciller repeated that Turkey was incurring great losses  from the embargo on Iraq, and estimated that the total loss to  date was $20 billion. The 1.6 million-barrel-per-day pipeline  links the Karkuk oil fields in Iraq with Yumurtalik, a terminal  on the Turkish Mediterranean coast.    Ciller also stressed that the pipeline ran the risk of  severe damage due to disuse, and said that the recent agreement  with Iraq aimed at ensuring that the damage was assessed and  repaired.    Ciller also suggested that a portion of the oil from the  pipeline could be used for humanitarian aid to Iraq. "Our  efforts without allies to get the embargo lifted are continuing.  It is not true that the U.S. has given us a note because of  these efforts of ours. There is an effort to make it seem as  though we were departing from the U.N. system on this issue.  This is not true," Ciller said.    The United Nations has offered to allow Iraq to export oil  worth $1.6 billion through Turkey to pay for imports of food,  medicine, relief work and war reparations, but Baghdad has  rejected the offer, claiming that the conditions were a  violation of its sovereignty.    In talking about giving humanitarian aid in return for oil,  Ankara is said to be making use of the advantage provided by the  U.N. decision. Turkish officials say that Ankara's current  diplomatic activities vis-a-vis Iraq can be characterized as  "intense lobbying."    They say that while they do not intend to "let Iraq get away  with a violation of international law," the world also has to  acknowledge the full ramifications, for a country like Turkey,  of the ongoing situation in Baghdad.    They also argue that the sanctions against Iraq have  contributed to the destabilization in Turkey's troubled  Southeast, because of their adverse economic effects in the  already depressed region.    "This is too high a price for any country to pay, especially  as it is not clear for how long the regime in Baghdad, which the  U.S. is so opposed to, will remain in power," one official told  the TURKISH DAILY NEWS. "If the proof is in the facts, then it  must be admitted that the embargo has not achieved its  objective. It has hardly brought about any change in  administration in Baghdad," he remarked.    He went on to say: ``At present, we are putting forward  proposals that have to be taken into account, given that Turkey  is a regional country and following developments in Iraq closely.    ``One proposal we have put forward, based on our own  personal  observations, is that the sanctions against Baghdad have not  worked in the way that the U.S. and some of our other allies  wanted.'' In other words, Saddam has grown immune to the  negative effects of these sanctions, and has turned the  resistance of them into a social virtue for those that support  him. "This means that there is no light at the end of the  tunnel as of yet. Unless the U.N. and key allies such as the  U.S. come up with a new formula to overcome the impasse with  Iraq, it is senseless that a country like Turkey should be left  to foot a massive bill that it cannot afford." [quotation marks  as published]    Christine Shelley, a deputy spokesman for the U.S. State  Department, told reporters on Monday, "We understand that it is  important for Turkey's economic future that they should be able  to preserve what for them is certainly a very vital economic  asset."    But she added immediately, "We have made it clear that we  would be opposed to any steps that violated the U.N. sanctions  against Iraq," thus underscoring the determined stance adopted  by her country on this issue.    Officials in Turkey also say that what Ankara is asking for,  in terms of the Iraqi pipeline, is not totally without precedent.    They point to the "oil-for-debt arrangement," which the  United Nations extended to Jordan, enabling the country to  import Iraqi crude for domestic use, without any cash changing  hands. Officials say that this is one option that Turkey might  accept. They also point to an arrangement with Saudi Arabia  after the Gulf War. Under this agreement, the Saudi government  flushed the Iraqi crude oil in the pipeline that runs through  its territory, sold it and gave the money to the Saudi Aramco  Oil Co. to cover the costs of maintaining the pipeline and  storage tanks.</p>

			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Failed group's accounts were queried SFV HOLIDAYS, the travel company which collapsed last month, had its most recent accounts qualified and had not kept accurate records since, creditors heard yesterday. The company collapsed shortly after being told by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, that it did not require bonding. Mr Jeremy Berman of joint liquidators Berley and Co told a creditors' meeting in London that the auditors of SFV Holidays, which collapsed last month, had qualified its 1991 accounts because of questions arising from a property sale after the year end. Accounts for 1992 had not been completed when the Oxford-based company went into liquidation, but Mr Berman said the financial records held by SFV's management were inadequate. 'The management information I've seen is very poor. The accounts I've seen on their computers are inaccurate.' SFV was not bonded and had not made alternative arrangements to protect customers' money. The company wrote earlier this year to Mr John Patten, education secretary and an Oxford MP, saying it was unable to comply with an European Community directive which requires package holiday operators to ensure that clients' money can be returned if the company fails. SFV had been refused membership of the Association of Independent Tour Operators and could not persuade any insurance company to provide it with a policy to protect its customers. The company said it believed it was obliged to comply with the directive. Mr Patten wrote to Mr Heseltine about the company's concerns last January and April. Mr Heseltine replied to Mr Patten saying he had examined SFV's brochures and concluded that the company did not have to comply with the directive as it was not a package tour operator. This was because - while the company sold self-catering accommodation in France - it allowed customers to specify what ferry service they wished to use. Mr John Cullom, SFV's managing director, told the meeting he agreed with one creditor who said the company should have fallen within the ambit of the directive because it was selling inclusive accommodation and ferry holidays. Mr Berman said the company owed customers just over Pounds 1m. Of this, Pounds 750,000 had been paid by credit card and customers would be able to get refunds. The remaining customers are ordinary creditors. SFV's total deficit is Pounds 1.2m. SFV's client list was earlier this week sold to Kingsland Holidays of Plymouth which said it would attempt to ensure that trips were able to go ahead. It said, however, that about 600 of the 3,000 holidaymakers who had booked with SFV had not paid by credit card and would not get refunds. The 600 would be able to re-book their holidays but would have to pay again.</p>

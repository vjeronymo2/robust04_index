			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / PIA applicants reach 4,000 The Personal Investment Authority, the watchdog to protect the private investor, will today publish figures likely to show that applications from companies and individuals regulated by Lautro and Fimbra have reached 4,000 out of a potential membership of about 5,500. There is less than five weeks to the deadline by which any financial adviser must apply to the PIA for authorisation to remain in retail financial services. The regulator became operational last month. The PIA is likely to move to London's Docklands by the end of the year. Although some of the 300 employees are already in Docklands, other staff are based in central London.</p>

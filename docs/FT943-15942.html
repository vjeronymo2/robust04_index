			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Criticised referees take no further part The Mexican and Syrian referees who came under heavy criticism for their handling of Tuesday's second-round matches were yesterday left off the list of officials who will handle the rest of the tournament. Fifa left out Mexican Arturo Pablo Brizio, who sent off Italy's Gianfranco Zola for an innocuous tackle in the match with Nigeria, and Jamal al-Sharif of Syria, who showed red cards to a Bulgarian and a Mexican in the day's other game. Zola was given an automatic two-match suspension and fined 5,000 Swiss francs. Fifa dismissed a protest from Bulgaria against the expulsion of defender Emil Kremenliev and banned him for the quarter-final against Germany on Sunday.</p>

			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> PROTEST VOICED ON SPACE CLUTTER  </P> <P> Argentina complained at the 40-nation disarmament conference today that the  developed nations have generally ignored a 1975 treaty calling for notification  of objects launched into space.  </P> <P> It called for stricter wording and monitoring of implementation of the  agreement.  </P> <P> "The flow of information as a result of the convention has proved to be scanty,  incomplete and tardy," Argentina representative Roberto Garcia Moritan said.  </P> <P> A shortcoming of the 1975 agreement, he said, is that information by launching  nations was to be provided only "as soon as practicable."  </P> <P> "Thus the absurd situation was reached that for many years not a single  military-type mission was reported although . . . the majority of activities in  outer space are directly or indirectly associated with operations of a military  nature," he said.  </P></p>

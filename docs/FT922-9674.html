			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Williams Holdings refuses to comment over Dowty Williams Holdings, the conglomerate, again refused to comment on market rumour that it was about to play the white knight to Dowty. Williams said it never commented on rumours. Its shares fell 15p to 329p following a report in the weekend press that it had held meetings with Dowty concerning a friendly merger. However, sources close to Dowty and Williams said no meetings or contact had taken place between the two companies and that a friendly bid was unlikely. Williams last week sold its holding of 9.9 per cent in Racal Electronics for a net Pounds 81m. Mr Brian McGowan, chief executive, said last week that Williams would probably concentrate on buying large businesses from big companies that were refocusing on core businesses rather than undertake hostile bids in the short term.</p>

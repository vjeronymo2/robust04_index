			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Brent Walker chief resigns MR KEN SCOBIE, chief executive of Brent Walker, the heavily indebted property and leisure group, and its banks, appear to have fallen out. Mr Scobie resigned yesterday. He is understood to have agreed a compensation package. Brent Walker is now expected to appoint a new chief executive to replace Mr Scobie. Sir Keith Bright has been brought in to chair the group, which last March completed a Pounds 1.6bn refinancing. Lord Kindersley, the previous chairman, left after last year's annual meeting and the group has been looking for a new head since. Mr Scobie has been acting as chairman. Mr Alan Clements, a non-executive director, has also resigned from the group. He indicated last summer that he wanted to leave. As well as their loans to Brent Walker, the banks own 54 per cent of the group's shares following the refinancing. One banker said, 'the banks call all the shots'. Another said there was a fairly widespread opinion among the banks that Mr Scobie was not the right man for the job, once the restructuring was in place. Mr Scobie originally joined the group as a non-executive director in May 1991, but became chief executive soon after. He is thought to have been keen to take on the chairmanship, while the banks wanted that role to be kept separate from the chief executiveship. Mr George Walker, the former head of Brent Walker, had combined the two until the banks brought in Lord Kindersley. Under the refinancing agreement, Brent Walker was to have made disposals to cut debt. However, there appears to have been concern among the banks at the rate of progress the group was making. Brent Walker said yesterday 'the restructuring of Brent Walker has reached a stage where Mr Scobie feels that his particular expertise is no longer required.' Brent Walker shares, which had been in the doldrums, have risen in recent days and yesterday closed up 3p at 16p. Sir Keith, 61, is also chairman of Electrocomponents.</p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Cosalt dives but holds dividend PROFITS OF Cosalt, the Grimsby-based diversified industrial group, fell 24 per cent to Pounds 1.88m pre-tax for the year to August 30. However, the total dividend is maintained at 10.75p, via a final of 6.5p. Earnings per share worked through at 11.1p (15.05p). The shares rose 7p to 143p. Mr Bill Wood, finance director, said the group was now in a healthy position 'having cut out the loss-making and risky parts of our business'. Nonetheless, a markedly improved performance this year was dependent on economic recovery in the UK. The recession, particularly in the fishing industry, dented profits at the group's fibres and safety equipment divisions. Mr Wood said the group had continued to reduce its exposure to the fishing industry, which now accounted for some 10 per cent of its business compared with more than half five years ago. Loss-making Cosalt Caravans was sold in September, and the group made an extraordinary Pounds 2.06m provision for the disposal of the business. The overall results were bolstered by better performances from the work clothing division and Cosalt Holiday Homes, although operating profit slid 35 per cent to Pounds 2.37m. Mr Wood said phase one of Cosalt's Pounds 4m North Shields property development was not going as well as expected, although lower costs and good prices offset sluggish sales.</p>

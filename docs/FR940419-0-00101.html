			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to implementing the April 29 proposed rule, this interim rule addresses two additional areas of necessary amendments to the HOME regulation. First, a number of clarifying revisions are made to the HOME regulation to provide additional guidance for program participants, as explained below in the discussion of changes made to individual sections. Second, Departmental staff reviewed the HOME rule in relationship to the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program, and developed a number of recommendations for greater compatibility between the HOME and CDBG regulations which are included in this interim rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following discussion, arranged according to the sequence of the HOME rule sections being considered, summarizes and responds to the comments received, and describes the changes made to the HOME Program regulation in this interim rule. Unless otherwise indicated in this preamble, the portions of this rule that were a part of the proposed rule remain the same.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;92.2, the definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> commitment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is revised. The Department believes greater flexibility in the definition of commitment is required to give participating jurisdictions additional time to use their HOME allocations. In addition to commitments to specific projects which are recognized as legally binding agreements between PJs and project owners, the Department is expanding the definition of commitment. The expanded definition would count as commitments legally binding agreements with State recipients, subrecipients, contractors or reservation of funds by Community Housing Development Organizations (CHDOs).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Initially, the Department believed that additional flexibility was warranted for FY1992 funds because of the slow start-up of the program based on initial statutory complexity. With both significant statutory amendments of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 and regulatory simplification by the Department, the ability of States and local governments to operate the HOME Program has now been increased. Nonetheless, the Department recognizes that to build upon the momentum of these changes, an expansion of the definition will provide regulatory relief to allow funds to be committed to both state recipients, subrecipients and CHDOs in a more orderly and equitable fashion. States can work with small cities and recently formed nonprofits to build capacity without fear of losing funds in the short term. Local participating jurisdictions may also take on more difficult rental projects with nonprofits which serve very-low income families or special populations, which often require greater development time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department will provide additional guidance on how these commitments will be documented for purposes of meeting the commitment deadlines. While the Department is providing greater flexibility on commitments, it will continue to collect information on commitments to specific projects and will maintain its emphasis on this aspect of the program both in reporting and monitoring of participating jurisdictions. All cash and management procedures will remain in effect with regard to reporting and disbursement of HOME funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> commit to a specific local project,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> included within the definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> commitment,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> is revised by changing the start construction period for publicly owned projects from six months to twelve months. This change will make the start construction period for publicly owned projects consistent with the start construction period for privately owned projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> community housing development organization  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> in &sect;92.2 is revised to specify that this term means a private nonprofit organization that has a tax-exempt ruling from the Internal Revenue Service under section 501(c) (3) or (4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The definition did not previously include the reference to paragraph (3) or (4) of section 501.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> housing  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> in &sect;92.2 is revised to include elder cottage housing opportunity (ECHO) units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment recommended that the ``footprint'' foundation requirements present in the definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> reconstruction <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  should be eased to give participating jurisdictions (PJs) the decision-making ability to waive the requirement if the situation warrants. The Department agrees that additional flexibility may be needed, for example, to permit PJs to meet current zoning requirements that would affect the reconstruction site. The definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> reconstruction <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at &sect;92.2 is modified to permit a unit to be reconstructed anywhere on the existing lot. However, all other Federal requirements of subpart H would still be applicable to the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> CITY VOTES TO SURVEY ADULT BUSINESSES  </P> <P> The city, seeking to bolster its legal standing in efforts to regulate adult  businesses such as bookstores and "peep shows," will hire a consultant to study  the impact of such businesses.  </P> <P> This week, the council approved an agreement with UC Irvine researchers Richard  McCleary and James Meeker to assess the effect that the businesses have on  property values, crime and nuisances such as noise.  </P> <P> The council voted 4 to 1 in favor of the proposal, with Councilman J. Tilman  Williams dissenting.  </P> <P> Additionally, the consultants are to study adult businesses not located in the  city.  </P> <P> The completed reports are expected by Feb. 15, and the consultants will be paid  $20,350.  </P> <P> Williams objected to the cost, arguing that better enforcement of zoning laws  would be cheaper and more effective. "If we already know the solution, why are  we going to spend $20,000 to $25,000 of taxpayers' money on this?" he asked.  </P> <P> City Manager George L. Tindall said that zoning enforcement wasn't a complete  solution, and that the survey was needed to support the city's contention that  adult businesses should be treated differently from other commercial concerns.  </P> <P> "In order for us to have an ordinance that provides a separation, we have to  justify that separation," Tindall said. "They'll take the data to study the  impact of adult uses on adjacent areas that hopefully meet the standards of the  Supreme Court."  </P> <P> Garden Grove's "spacing" ordinance, which attempts to keep such businesses a  certain distance from each other and away from residential areas, has been  struck down by courts, Tindall said.  </P> <P> The other choice is to designate a certain area of the city for adult  businesses. The city has seven adult bookstores and peep shows on Garden Grove  Boulevard, most of them between Magnolia Street and Beach Boulevard. JIM  TORTOLANO  </P></p>

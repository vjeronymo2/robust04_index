S&amp;N, the brewing and leisure group, acquired Chef &amp; Brewer last November and was obliged to sell down 748 pubs in order to comply with the Government's 1989 Beer order. These pubs were switched into holding companies controlled by Morgan Grenfell, and there are 270 pubs remaining. These must be sold within two and a half years from now.</p>

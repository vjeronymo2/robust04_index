			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Hyundai chief moves into politics THE FOUNDER of Hyundai, the leading South Korean industrial group, has announced that he is to retire from business and form a new political party to oppose the government. The decision by Mr Chung Ju Yung, one of the country's leading industrialists, will widen a developing rift in the traditionally close relationship between government and the big conglomerates at the heart of the Korean economy. The move follows Mr Chung's announcement on Friday that he was retiring from business after a career in which he transformed Hyundai from a small construction company into a conglomerate with annual sales of Dollars 40bn. His political ambitions will add to the problems facing the ruling Democratic Liberal party as it prepares for a series of important elections this year, culminating in a presidential poll. An official at Hyundai, Korea's largest car manufacturer and biggest shipbuilder, said Mr Chung was aiming to field candidates in parliamentary elections due by early May. Mr Chung would also offer his support to a candidate for presidential elections due by the end of the year, the official said. His plans are the latest development in the increasingly tense relationship between the government and the industrial conglomerates which dominate the economy. Hyundai, which Mr Chung founded in 1947, is now involved in electronics, petrochemicals and financial services as well as cars and shipbuilding. A party formed by Mr Chung would face the difficult task of overcoming growing public resentment towards big business. Its initial objective would be to win a minimum of 20 of the 299 seats in the national assembly. But a party headed by the charismatic business leader would be a thorn in the side of the DLP. The ruling party, which holds two-thirds of the seats in the national assembly, has seen its popularity eroded by a host of economic problems, ranging from double digit inflation to a rapidly expanding trade deficit. It is also threatened by increased friction between the three factions in the party. Mr Chung, a vocal critic of government economic policies, has clashed with the administration of President Roh Tae Woo on several occasions. In September, Mr Chung, members of his family, and subsidiaries of the Hyundai group were levied penalty taxes of won 136.1bn (USDollars 181.5m) for evasion of inheritance taxes and irregular share transactions. Details of Mr Chung's political ambitions and policies are expected to be announced later this month.</p>

			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWSBITES: DRESS LIKE NAPOLEON, EAT LIKE A KING AT BIRTHDAY BASH  </P> <P> Happy birthday, dear Napoleon? Yup, Saturday, Aug. 18, is the birthday of  Bonaparte, and for the fifth consecutive year, Le Meridien Hotel, Newport  Beach, will celebrate with an evening of dining and dancing in Cafe Fleuri. The  cafe staff will dress for the occasion and guests are invited to do likewise. A  four-course dinner focuses on consomme of crab and veal medallions with a fresh  tomato concasse. Music will be by the Christian Dimaggio Trio. The evening  begins at 7:30 and the tab is $30. The hotel is located at 4500 MacArthur  Blvd., Newport Beach. Reservations: (714) 476-2001, Ext. 2194.  </P> <P> The Robert Mondavi Wine &amp; Food Center will celebrate summer on Saturday,  Aug. 18, with a Midsummer Night's Dinner Dance. Bamboo-broiled shiitake  mushrooms and chicken skewers with oyster sauce will be served with a Mondavi  sparkling wine in the Rose Garden; then a different Mondavi Reserve wine will  accompany each of the four dinner courses, which include grilled tiger shrimp  tostada with Caribbean salsa, and terrine of rabbit and pheasant with chilled  basil-stewed tomatoes and homemade pretzels.  </P> <P> The Bobby Dorman Big Band with Cassie Miller as featured vocalist will perform  for dancing in the Pavilion Room.  </P> <P> The evening begins at 7. Cost is $125 per person. The center is at 150 Scenic  Ave., Costa Mesa; (714) 979-4510.  </P> <P> The Natalie Cole concert scheduled for Aug. 25 at the Robert Mondavi Wine &amp;  Food Center has been canceled.  </P> <P> The Cafe at the Westin South Coast Plaza brings a new twist to the  old-as-Bacchus idea of wine makers' dinners Thursday, Aug. 16, and Friday, Aug.  17. Instead of a staged presentation with formal seating and a set menu, diners  will select their dining time (between 6 and 9 p.m.), as well as what and how  much they want to eat.  </P> <P> This week's featured wine maker, Bruce Newlan of Newlan Vineyards in Napa  Valley, will be on hand both evenings to chat informally with diners. Some of  the menu choices: tarragon-marinated shrimp appetizer, broiled and served with  tomatillo salsa on a bed of angel hair pasta (Newlan's Chardonnay suggested to  complement); pan-fried veal medallion stuffed with mushroom duxelle, with  garlic rosemary sauce and wild rice (Newlan's Pinot Noir estate, 1987,  suggested).  </P> <P> Entrees will be priced from $12 to $17 and wines by the glass start at $4.  </P> <P> The Newlan menu and wines will also be featured nightly in The Cafe during the  last two weeks in August and first two weeks of September.  </P> <P> A different winery will be spotlighted in a similar manner each month. The  Westin is at 666 Anton Blvd., Costa Mesa; (714) 540-2500.  </P> <P> Chef Gino Mattei from Tuscany recently joined Salvatore D'Abbusco at the  4-month-old Salvatore Cucina Italiana in Mission Viejo. Since Mattei is from  northern Italy and D'Abbusco is from Naples (he owned Cafe Napoli in Van Nuys  before moving to Orange County), they suggest that they have the Italian  repertoire well covered.  </P> <P> To celebrate their grand opening, all during August, Salvatore's offering a  $9.95 dinner: bruschetta appetizer, homemade soup or Caesar salad, choice of 12  pastas (including fettucini with porcini mushrooms; cappelini with olive oil,  fresh tomatoes, capers, black olives; linguine and clams, ravioli Gorgonzola),  plus coffee and choice of three desserts.  </P> <P> The restaurant is in the Garden Plaza shopping center, northwest corner of La  Paz Road and Marguerite Parkway. (714) 859-4572.  </P> <P> Add Antonelo in South Coast Plaza Village to your list of restaurants touting  low-cholesterol, low-fat, low-salt meals. A few examples from the new light  menu: a salad of calamari, shrimp and fish tossed with red and yellow peppers,  romaine, frisee, arugula and herb dressing; angel hair pasta with fresh  tomatoes, basil and chicken; linguine with spinach, olive oil and ricotta;  penne with fresh tuna, green peas and tomato sauce.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kanazawa, March 25 KYODO -- Former Finance Minister  Ryutaro Hashimoto predicted Friday [25 March] that a row over  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's alleged role in a money  scandal will lead to dissolution of the House of Representatives  and a general election. Hashimoto, chairman of the Policy  Affairs Research Council of the opposition Liberal Democratic  Party (LDP), said the row over the alleged scandal is  threatening the passage of the fiscal 1994 budget program.    Diet business has been stalled, leaving the 73.08 trillion  bugdet in limbo, by the LDP's demands that Hosokawa release more  data about a loan he says he received from Sagawa Kyubin Co. in  1982. The LDP says it will continue to refuse to open budget  deliberations until Hosokawa meets its request.</p>

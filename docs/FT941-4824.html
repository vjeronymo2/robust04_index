			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Australia seeks to simplify buy-backs Mr Michael Lavarch, the Australian Attorney-General, yesterday released a proposed simplification of rules for corporate share buy-back schemes. The changes could encourage more Australian companies to consider the option. Although share buy-backs are permitted in Australia, they are subject to complex conditions. Critics of the current regulations claim compliance costs are heavy, and the safeguards against abuse are unnecessarily detailed. As a result - and in contrast to the US, where buy-backs are commonplace - few Australian companies have attempted to introduce such schemes. Under the new proposals, companies would be able to buy back shares, other than redeemable preference shares. However, directors would have to sign a written declaration stating that, in their opinion, the company would be solvent immediately after the buy-back. They would be personally liable if the buy-back led to insolvency. A company would also be allowed to buy back more than 10 per cent of its ordinary shares in a 12-month period, provided shareholders approved. Restrictions on the source of funds for buy-backs would be eased, as would accompanying constraints on the timing of new issues - for example, under dividend reinvestment plans. At present, any company operating a dividend reinvestment plan is effectively barred from a buy-back scheme.</p>

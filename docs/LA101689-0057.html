			<p><P> October 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CNN TAKES ON NETWORKS WITH 'WORLD TODAY';  </P> <P> TELEVISION: CABLE CHANNEL GOES HEAD-TO-HEAD AGAINST THE MAJORS TONIGHT WITH AN  EVENING NEWSCAST AND BEATS THEM TO THE HOURLONG FORMAT.  </P> <P> Call it the CNN paradox: At the hour of day when most TV viewers watch a  network news broadcast, the one network devoted solely to news has had no  newscast.  </P> <P> Now, as it approaches its 10th anniversary, CNN finally has a "flagship"  broadcast of its own. Starting tonight, CNN will broadcast "The World Today"  from 6 to 7 p.m. EDT weeknights and for the first time compete directly with  the nightly news seen on ABC, CBS and NBC (except on the West Coast, where "The  World Today" will be seen from 3 to 4 p.m.).  </P> <P> Until now, CNN's strategy has been to counter network news programming by  offering viewers something different -- most recently a show-business report  and financial news -- to compete in the East and Midwest against ABC's "World  News Tonight" with Peter Jennings, "The CBS Evening News With Dan Rather" and  "NBC Nightly News" with Tom Brokaw. But with 70% of network news viewers  catching the 6:30 p.m. Eastern broadcasts, it occurred to CNN executives that  their channel was missing an opportunity to attract people who were accustomed  to hard news at that hour.  </P> <P> "This is when people go shopping for their news," said Paul Amos, executive  vice president of news programming for CNN, "and we need to be on the shelf."  </P> <P> With its entry into the nightly news war, where star power is deemed a key  factor, CNN has teamed its most visible newscaster, veteran Bernard Shaw, who  will anchor from Washington, with newcomer Catherine Crier, who is as fresh a  face as there is in broadcast journalism -- she's never worked in TV news  before. Before landing at the anchor desk in CNN's Atlanta headquarters, based  on her audition for a proposed CNN talk show, Crier was an assistant district  attorney and then a state district court judge in Dallas.  </P> <P> For years, the three broadcast networks have talked about expanding their  half-hour evening newscasts, in part to ease time limitations on reporting as  well as to add a new dimension to a format that has remained virtually  unchanged for more than 20 years. But they've been blocked by their affiliated  stations, which don't want to relinquish even 15 minutes of what is their most  lucrative local programming time.  </P> <P> Now CNN has beaten them to it, creating considerable interest in "The World  Today" among TV journalists.  </P> <P> "It's another competitor," says William Wheatley, executive producer of "NBC  Nightly News." "And we are all curious about how they are going to do it,  because this would really be the first evening 'news hour.' All of us have  thoughts on how we would do an hour."  </P> <P> (He and other TV newsmen don't regard PBS' "The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour" the  same way because, although it too is an hourlong nightly news show, it is  noncommercial and uses a different format from the traditional network  newscasts.)  </P> <P> "The World Today," as planned, will be divided into two half hours, the first  consisting of interviews and in-depth treatment of news and issues; some  reports might last up to 20 minutes, heretofore virtually unheard of in a  nightly newscast. The hour's second half will come closer to the traditional  nightly news format by presenting an overview of the day's important events.  </P> <P> Bill Kaczaraba, executive producer of "The World Today," described the program  as "a little more sophisticated" than CNN's usual broadcasts, which tend toward  straightforward, unadorned delivery of the news with stories repeated and  updated frequently. "The World Today" will have its own set and present a  package of freshly produced reports, which will be updated on subsequent  broadcasts, most notably "PrimeNews" (5 p.m. PDT) and "CNN Evening News" (7  p.m. PST).  </P> <P> CNN's decision to go head-to-head with the network newscasts is, by all  accounts, necessary for the network's growth as an influential news  organization.  </P> <P> "To truly come into their own, they do need a kind of signature broadcast,"  said Everette Dennis, director of the Gannett Center for Media Study at  Columbia University. The new broadcast, he said, is "a sign of maturation" for  CNN, which went on the air in June, 1980, as Ted Turner's upstart in the TV  news business. Today, CNN, which reaches 51 million cable subscribers, is  regarded as an equal alongside the three network news divisions.  </P> <P> "The World Today" isn't expected to have an immediate effect on the network  newscasts, each of which, despite a slight decline in audience during the last  few years, still attract an average of 8.5 million households nightly. In  contrast, about 500,000 households have been tuning in for CNN's early  "Newswatch" broadcast and the half-hour "Showbiz Today," which will move to  2:30 p.m. PDT starting today. "Moneyline" will continue to air at 4 p.m. PDT,  following "The World Today."  </P> <P> Even CNN executives say wooing viewers from the long-established network  newscasts will be a gradual process, because viewing habits are hard to break.  "We do not expect a tidal wave coming out of the blocks," says CNN's Amos. "One  thing we are cognizant of is that news programming takes a long time to build  an audience."  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PANEL BURIES BILL TO ALLOW VOTE ON SALES TAX HIKE FOR JAIL  </P> <P> An Assembly subcommittee on Wednesday blocked a bill that would allow Orange  County residents to vote on a proposed half-cent sales tax increase for a new  jail and court facilities, prompting an outcry from local officials who had  counted on the measure's passage by next week's deadline.  </P> <P> The troubled bill, sponsored by state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach),  already has dodged a number of deadly legislative bullets and was thought to be  headed for final approval before lawmakers adjourn for the year on Sept. 15.  </P> <P> But on Wednesday, members of an Assembly Ways and Means subcommittee  unexpectedly ambushed the bill and decided to keep it bottled up indefinitely,  contending that the measure was flawed. Committee chairman Mike Roos (D-Los  Angeles) and others said Wednesday that the measure appeared to be an effort to  circumvent Proposition 13, which specifically requires a two-thirds vote to  impose any new taxes. The Bergeson measure, that had been expected to go before  voters in June, 1990, would require only a majority vote to impose the added  half-cent tax.  </P> <P> There appeared to be some effort late Wednesday to revive the measure by  amending it to a similar bill in the state Senate. But the committee's action,  nonetheless, caught Bergeson and Orange County officials by surprise and raised  doubts about their ability to find the $121 million in seed money needed to  build a $700-million jail in Gypsum Canyon, east of Anaheim Hills.  </P> <P> "I would like to give you some flip answer like 'It's back to the drawing  board,' but I'm too shocked," said Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F.  Riley in Orange County, moments after he learned of the action in Sacramento.  </P> <P> "We have to find a new jail somewhere and finance it someway, and we all  accepted the fact that this was practically a done deal," Riley said. "We're  trying to react now to what has happened. I know we're going to have to come up  with some funding mechanism if this doesn't work.  </P> <P> "We're all hoping that a miracle can happen up there and something would come  forward," Riley said, adding that being forced to find another way to pay for  the jail would "open up pretty emotional issues" on the board.  </P> <P> Sheriff-Coroner Brad Gates has said that the measure is desperately needed  because cramped jail space forces him to turn away or prematurely release more  than 50,000 criminals a year. The proposed tax hike, he argues, would cost the  average Orange County family $50 to $75 a year, and much of the money would  come from tourists flocking to Disneyland and other local points of interest.  </P> <P> Gates said Wednesday that he was "frustrated" by the subcommittee's action and  stressed that the sales tax money was needed not only for jail space but for a  new juvenile hall and added courtrooms.  </P> <P> "It's frustrating and hard for me to understand why they would not want to let  it out and let our voters have a chance to say yes or no," Gates said in a  telephone interview. "I don't really see a risk to anybody else if that bill  comes out. It goes to our voters . . . and we really don't impact anybody  else."  </P> <P> Asked after the hearing what the subcommittee's action means, Bergeson replied:  "It means that there's no jail."  </P> <P> Yet despite the apparent finality of the committee's actions on Wednesday, word  began circulating by late afternoon that Bergeson was working on a deal to take  her jail tax bill out of the Assembly for now and have it amended to a similar  measure winding its way through the Senate.  </P> <P> Orange County lobbyist Dennis E. Carpenter, a former state senator from Newport  Beach, said late Wednesday that there is still hope for the jail-tax bill.  </P> <P> "Dead? Heck no," Carpenter said when asked if the measure was lost.  </P> <P> Yet any effort to revive the measure in the Senate would still have to be  approved by the Assembly. And chances are, legislative aides indicated, that  any reconstituted Orange County measure would be sent directly back to the  hostile Ways and Means subcommittee for more of the same treatment.  </P> <P> Roos predicted after Wednesday's hearing that the Bergeson measure would  languish for the remainder of the session, which ends in two weeks.  </P> <P> That, in turn, would foil plans by Bergeson and Orange County officials to have  Gov. George Deukmejian sign the measure into law in time to put the sales-tax  increase on the June, 1990, ballot.  </P> <P> "I would say that . . . there is a high probability that you won't see any  action until January," Roos said.  </P></p>

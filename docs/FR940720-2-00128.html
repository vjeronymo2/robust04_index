The Participants, however, have not yet come to an agreement concerning revenue sharing for transactions effected pursuant to the Plan. Proposed Amendment No. 1 to the Plan extends this negotiation period for an additional six months. In conjunction with the Plan, on a temporary basis also scheduled to expire on July 12, 1994, the Commission granted an exemption from Rule 11Ac1&hyph;2 under the Act regarding the calculated best bid and offer (``BBO''), and granted the BSE an exemption from the provision of Rule 11Aa3&hyph;1 under the Act that requires transaction reporting plans to include market identifiers for transaction reports and last sale data. At the request of the Participants, this order extends these exemptions through July 12, 1995, provided that the Plan continues in effect through that date pursuant to a Commission order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Securities Acts Amendments of 1975 (``1975 Amendments'') directed the Commission to facilitate the development of a national market system for securities, consistent with certain objectives, including ``fair competition *&blank;*&blank;* between exchange markets and markets other than exchange markets.'' The legislative history of the 1975 Amendments makes clear that many active OTC stocks were expected to be part of the national market system. The 1975 Amendments also authorized the Commission to grant OTC/UTP to exchanges if certain conditions were met. The Commission generally deferred granting exchanges OTC/UTP pending progress on the development of the national market system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1985, however, the Commission noted that since the enactment of the 1975 Amendments, important developments had occurred in the OTC market; these developments led the Commission to reconsider its position on OTC/UTP. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  The Commission announced in its 1985 OTC/UTP Release its willingness to grant UTP to national securities exchanges in NMS Securities, <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  conditioned in part on the approval of a plan submitted by interested exchanges and the NASD to consolidate and disseminate exchange and OTC quotation data and transaction data in OTC securities upon which UTP is granted. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  The exchanges and the NASD have been negotiating the terms of a plan, under the oversight of the Commission staff, since that time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Securities Exchange Act Release No. 22412 (September 16, 1985), 50 FR 38640 (``1985 OTC/UTP Release''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Congress envisioned that National Market System Securities (``NMS Securities'') would include those equity securities whose characteristics of size, earnings history, breadth of ownership, and investor interest made them suitable for auction-market trading.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Senate Comm. on Banking, Housing &amp; Urb. Affs., Report to Accompany S. 249: Securities Acts Amendments of 1975, S. Rep. No. 75, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 16 (1975). NMS Securities are designated pursuant to Rule 11Aa2&hyph;1, 17 CFR 240.11Ac1&hyph;2, adopted in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 16590 (February 19, 1980), 45 FR 12391. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  1985 OTC/UTP Release,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 6. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its 1985 OTC/UTP Release, the Commission also determined that although it was premature to require any specific type of market linkage prior to the initiation of trading, the exchanges must provide OTC market makers direct telephone access to the exchange specialist in UTP securities to facilitate intermarket trading in those securities. The Commission determined to grant OTC/UTP to an exchange only if the exchange provided Nasdaq market makers access to the exchange market in the subject securities to the same extent that Nasdaq market makers provide specialists access to the Nasdaq market maker trading facilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1985, the Commission also stated that it expected Nasdaq market makers to provide exchange members with fair and efficient access to the OTC market, and that if the Commission became aware of any limitation on such access, it would take prompt remedial action. The Commission further noted that it did not believe that a more sophisticated intermarket linkage need be in place during the initial stages of trading OTC/UTP securities, but encouraged the NASD and the exchanges to forge their own initiatives in facilitating computerized intermarket trading linkages and adopting trade-through rules for these securities. The 1985 OTC/UTP Release also conditioned the grant of OTC/UTP on the exchanges not applying their off-board trading restrictions to those securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

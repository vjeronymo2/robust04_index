			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPETENCE RULES AT MORE VISIONARY FIRMS  </P> <P> The world economy is becoming more integrated daily. Japan's ethnocentricity is  keeping Japan from becoming a truly great power . . . and now comes Nissan and  other Japanese companies with an apparent policy of fragmenting management and  decision making along nationality lines.  </P> <P> ("Some Japanese Firms Moving to Segregate Staff," May 23).  </P> <P> If the reports are true, more forward-looking companies -- Honda, Kawai and  others -- should gear up to capture an even greater share of the world market.  </P> <P> My 15-year experience with Kawai, a wholly owned Japanese subsidiary, has been  just the opposite. Kawai has actively integrated managers, be they foreign or  American, into their decision-making process. This Kawai policy is based upon  competence, not nationality.  </P> <P> JOHN RAJCIC  </P> <P> Vice President/General Manager  </P> <P> Kawai  </P> <P> Compton  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gilberto Nascimento: "Stories of a Left-Wing </F> Ph.D."]    [Text] Sao Paulo -- Fernando Henrique Cardoso was supported  by the metalworkers in the ABC [Santo Andre, Sao Bernardo do  Campo, and Sao Caetano do Sul) region in his bid for the Senate  in the late 1970's, and he also became known as a respectable  left-wing sociologist. Today he is regarded as a kind of  "spiritual father" to the Brazilian Analysis and Planning Center  (Cebrap), an organization that he helped establish along with a  group of "progressive" scientists and intellectuals in 1969.    Fernando Henrique headed Cebrap until 1982, when he resigned  to fill a vacancy in the Senate (he was Franco Montoro's  alternate, and Montoro was elected state governor in that year).  His wife, anthropologist and retired USP [University of Sao  Paulo] professor Ruth Cardoso, is still one of Cebrap's  coordinators. As Cebrap's president, Fernando Henrique was  threatened with imprisonment and torture. He was helped during  that period by Cardinal Paulo Evaristo Arns, Archbishop of Sao  Paulo, and the two of them are still close friends today. "They  even threw bombs into the organization's offices," the cardinal  recalls. "I went to defend him and was very happy to put my life  in danger to save the members of that research association --  the most important in the country -- from torture."    Divided support: Ruth Cardoso feels that Cebrap will respond  to FHC's [Fernando Henrique Cardoso's] candidacy in the same way  that it has always responded when any of its members has sought  elective office. According to her, Cebrap will discuss his  proposals "in a critical manner" and, as an institution, will  not take a stand "either for or against." The minister does not  enjoy unanimous support today among Cebrap's coordinators. He is  supported by his wife and coordinators Elza Berquo, a  demographer, and Jose Arthur Gianotti, a philosopher. The  institution's current president, economist Francisco de  Oliveira, and historian Luiz Felipe de Alencastro are voting for  Lula.    In the union movement, Fernando Henrique obtained support in  his campaign for the Senate in 1978 from Luiz Inacio Lula da  Silva (PT [Workers Party]), the man who took him to the factory  gates back then to win the workers' support and who is now his  opponent. "The minister needed votes badly," recalls Djalma Bom,  a former director of the Sao Bernardo Metalworkers Union and  former PT deputy who was one of the top comrades leading the  historic strikes in Sao Paulo's ABC region. "He was out of his  element. He was always quiet, watching and observing. The  ordinary workers thought he was strange and would ask: `What in  the hell kind of candidate is that who comes here and doesn't  say anything?' But we got a lot of votes. If he had been bolder,  he would not have lost the election," says Djalma Bom. Fernando  Henrique received 1.2 million votes and became Franco Montoro's  alternate.    Atheist: His second electoral experience was a disaster. In  1985, when he was running for mayor of Sao Paulo on the PMDB  [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] ticket, he lost the  election to Janio Quadros after being branded an "atheist"  because he refused during a televised debate to give a straight  answer when asked whether he believed in God. While the votes  were still being counted -- he was ahead at the time -- he even  sat down in the mayor's seat to be photographed and then had to  face a humiliating defeat.    After the military coup in 1964, Fernando Henrique, along  with such intellectuals as Florestan Fernandes and Mario  Schenberg, was indicted in a Military Police Investigation. He  was teaching at the University of Sao Paul (USP) at the time. He  was retired from his post as university professor and  immediately went into exile in Argentina, Chile, and France. He  returned to Brazil in 1967 and went back to the USP. His  political rights were taken away again in 1969 for political  reasons on the basis of AI [Institutional Act] No. 5. After  being considered for the post of minister of foreign affairs in  the Collor administration, he was named to that office during  Itamar Franco's administration in October 1992. He has been at  the Ministry of Finance since May of last year.</p>

Migranyan from Galina Sidorova, policy </F> adviser to the minister of foreign affairs of Russia: "What  Should Russia Be Doing in the Near Abroad?"]    [Text] Esteemed Andranik Movsesovich, henceforward I, like  other readers of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA of 12 January, know who  saved Russia, its foreign minister, the Presidential Council,  and the president himself from the great delusion, to which, as  follows from your publication, all had succumbed simultaneously  under the leadership of the Foreign Ministry.    The delusion or, as you go on to specify, the policy of  Yeltsin and Kozyrev, was "expressed in relief" and "formed the  basis of the report of Foreign Minister Kozyrev and Supreme  Soviet Chairman Khasbulatov at a conference organized by the  Foreign Ministry in February 1992 at the Moscow State  International Relations Institute."    It, I quote from your article, "was that Russia should turn  inward within the borders of the Russian Federation, leave all  the former republics of the USSR, and not get pulled into  interethnic and regional conflicts of the former Union...,  thereby publicly having renounced all special rights and  interests in the post-Soviet space." It is nice to know that  there are people who are not afraid to assume responsibility and  to open the eyes of the public. "I formulated for the first  time," you boldly acknowledge, "the central idea which  subsequently came to be determining in an understanding of  Russia's role and place in the post-Soviet space among all  leading politicians of Russia, from the president through  Foreign Minister Kozyrev. It amounts to the fact that the entire  geopolitical space of the former Soviet Union is a sphere of  Russia's vital interests."    While not in the least disputing your contribution to the  elaboration of policy in this most important field, I would like  merely to call your attention to certain nuances which you  either failed to hear or failed to read through to the end.    First, A.V. Kozyrev and R.I. Khasbulatov delivered, for all  that, at the said conference not one common but each his own  report. And whereas the chairman of the Supreme Soviet really  did let slip that "Russia should not permit itself to be pulled  into interethnic conflicts; even acting the part of arbiter on  these issues on the territory of other countries of the CIS is  dangerous for it for these issues are not resolved in a short  historical period," the foreign minister in his speech (see the  journal MEZHDUNARODNAYA ZHIZN, issue for March-April 1992) said  literally the following: "The formation of the CIS occupies a  special place in Russia's foreign policy. Here lies our  paramount vital interest, if you will. Fundamental questions of  Russia's reconstitution in the civilized world.... In this area  also Russia will defend its interests firmly, `strictly,' where  necessary, making use of all the opportunities available to us.  Exclusively on a legal basis, of course.... Our special  attention to human rights and to the rights of Russians, in the  countries of the CIS included and in particular." And, further:  "Understandably, the fate of the CIS will largely be decided not  only in the European direction but in the south of the  Commonwealth also. It is not a matter of indifference to Russia  what kind of path the development of the former Union republics,  now independent states, located there takes, who will influence  this development and how...."    Second, I would also like to remind you, Andranik  Movsesovich, of certain statements of the president pertaining  to this time and also of some things that were said by A.V.  Kozyrev both before and in development of the speech to which  you refer. "Russia recognizes the full extent of its  responsibility for the Commonwealth of Independent States  becoming a ponderable factor of stability in the world" (from  B.N. Yeltsin's speech at the top-level UN Security Council  session on 31 January 1992). "The 25 million of our compatriots  in these states must not and will not be forgotten by Russia....  An agreement on the creation of a peacekeeping force in the  Commonwealth has already been signed within the framework of the  CIS....    "But the legal mechanisms of the formation and use of this  force have yet to be worked out and legalized (the Supreme  Soviet was in no hurry here--G.S.)" (from B.N. Yeltsin's speech  at the Sixth Congress of People's Deputies of the Russian  Federation of 7 April 1992).    "The Commonwealth is in the formation phase, which is  proceeding in extremely painful and contradictory fashion. The  position of our compatriots in the CIS countries.... will  largely depend on how stable the Commonwealth is. It has to be  frankly acknowledged that we are doing an inadequate job of  protecting our compatriots as yet. At the same time, on the  other hand, attempting to resolve such problems with the aid of  force and ultimatums, via armed confrontation with the republics  even more, as some people are proposing, is nothing other than  political recklessness. Agreeing to this would mean knowingly  putting our fellow citizens in the position of enemies and  inciting an avalanche of violence against them" (which,  unfortunately, we observed as a result of the activity of former  Vice President Rutskoy in the Dniester region and in a number of  other regions--G.S.) (from B.N. Yeltsin's speech at the Sixth  Congress of People's Deputies of 21 April 1992). "The main  priority of Russian diplomacy is the formation of the  Commonwealth of Independent States.... We cannot deny ... the  entire complex set of problems connected with the processes of  the acquisition of independence by all of us. It is for this  reason that a transitional period, which would make it possible  to avoid a repetition of rash Bolshevik decisions and afford  opportunities for the smooth transition of the totalitarian  empire to a commonwealth of democratic independent states, is  needed.    "Equality does not absolve Russia of its special  responsibility entrusted to it by history" (from A.V. Kozyrev's  article in IZVESTIYA of 2 January 1992).    "Essentially the CIS is the sole possible form of renewal of  the Union, which you advocated in the historic Declaration of  State Sovereignty.... The real choice, which we can and must  make, is between the arduous and multistage process of formation  of the CIS and continued uncontrolled collapse and the  exacerbation of relations with neighbors, a choice between the  addition brick by brick of a belt of good-neighborliness around  Russia and the `Yugoslav option' of the hopeless and devastating  use of force.    "...If we ourselves wish to live in a democratic state at  the  highest standard, we must build in exactly the same way also the  relations with our neighbor CIS states without any allowances  and without attempts to return to the idea that we have not yet  matured to democratic standards. This does not, however, mean  that we should not apply quite strict methods, power methods  included, of the defense of Russian interests and human rights,  on the contrary, it implies a mastery of such levers, but  strictly in accordance with contemporary rules of international  law and ideas. ... The fact that Russia is becoming firmly  established in its integral statehood in the Commonwealth is  also a factor of political reality" (from A.V. Kozyrev's speech  at the Sixth Congress of People's Deputies of the Russian  Federation of 18 April 1992).    "Two extremes--the reckless withdrawal of troops from the  former Union republics, particularly Asia and the Transcaucasus,  especially with provision not having been made for their new  living arrangements, and, on the other hand, continuation of the  present situation--cannot be allowed. The Foreign Ministry sees  as the solution a base strategy on treaty principles. The main  thing is that we simply cannot walk away from this historical  geopolitical and humanitarian sphere of our vital interests and  responsibility" (from A.V. Kozyrev's speech at the Council for  Foreign Policy on 27 November 1992).    "It would be desirable for us to speed up and approve the  submittal to the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation of a  bill prepared by the Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of  Defense and already approved by the Supreme Soviet Presidium on  the principles and mechanisms of Russia's participation in  peacemaking operations along CIS, CSCE, and UN lines" (which was  not done--G.S.) (from A.V. Kozyrev's speech at an enlarged  session of the International Affairs Committee of the Supreme  Soviet of the Russian Federation on 26 January 1993).    Please excuse the lengthy quotation. But I would like to  hope  for a more attentive attitude toward what is actually being said  and done by the Foreign Ministry on the part of experts and also  the new parliament. For under the old one Smolenskaya Square  missed a professional discussion about foreign policy not  burdened by political games.</p>

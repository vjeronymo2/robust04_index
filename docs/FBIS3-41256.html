			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Doron Me'iri] </F>   [Excerpts] Last Thursday, 7 o'clock in the evening.  Dozens of youngsters wearing kaffiyehs and armed with batons  and knives flock to the headquarters of Fatah's "strike police"  in the village of Abu-Dis in East Jerusalem for their daily  briefing. All of them are intifadah graduates who decided to  renounce terror and join the fight against mounting crime in  their community. [passage omitted]    Fatah's "strike police" units began operating about three  months ago. Their intentions may be good, but their methods are  shocking. Their activities are primarily aimed at drug dealers.  Lists of suspected drug dealers and places where deals are  conducted can be found in its headquarters. The information is  collected from informers and snitches.    "Strike police" troops raid drug-dealing areas every night.  People caught dealing drugs face a bitter fate: They are taken  for interrogation in the organization's dungeons where they  undergo excruciating torture in order to extract from them  information. A man I encountered at the "strike police"  headquarters smilingly told me: "Believe me, I have been  arrested many times in my life--by Israel Police and by the Shin  Bet--but what our interrogators do to their subjects is  absolutely terrifying."    Twenty-six-year-old Shakir, the commander of the "strike  police" adds: "We interrogate them, and with our methods they  talk, and talk fast. When the interrogation is over, we break  one of their arms or legs, their nose, or even slightly fracture  their skull. Then we explain to them that they are harming  themselves and the public, and warn them that if caught again  they will be eliminated."    The "strike police" opens "criminal records" for suspects,  as  if it were a real police force, and plays the role of  legislator, judge, and executioner. Shakir argues that his men  do not restrict their operations to East Jerusalem, and chase  Arab drug dealers into the boundaries of the Green Line. At  least on one occasion, Shakir recounts, a drug dealer from the  territories was spotted in Elat, where he had fled to protect  himself from the "strike police." This dealer "was arrested and  dealt with appropriately," Shakir notes.    He showed us the weapons used by his men. These include  batons, ice picks, knives, screwdrivers, ropes, and handcuffs.  "We do not yet have firearms," he says. "Until three months  ago our goal had been to fight you, the Israelis. However, from  the moment 'Arafat and Rabin shook hands, our goal became to  fight for a better and healthier society, both ours and yours."    Shakir argues that his methods have proved themselves,  seeing  that the activities of drug dealers in the area has decreased  considerably. According to him, many of them relocated their  business to the boundaries of the Green Line for fear of the  "strike police." "It is important that your police deal with  them and not let them off the hook," he says.    Shakir continues: "The heads of the Palestinian leadership  apprised Abu-'Ammar (Yasir 'Arafat) of our activities, and we  were told that he gave them his blessing and that he is pleased  with them. I hope he will heed our request and give us  financial aid. In future I definitely envision myself as an  officer in the Palestinian police force, and I will be happy to  cooperate with Israel Police to fight crime."    The "strike police" has also undertaken the task of dealing  with drug addicts. Any addict caught in the act is asked to  enter a rehabilitation center voluntarily. If he fails to do  that, such treatment is forced on him for four months. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Text]On 21 September IBM and Hewlett-Packard planned to  report,  independently of each other, on the production of new  high-performance personal computers to increase their share of  the sales market.    IBM Corporation, the largest manufacturer of computers in  the  world, will demonstrate a number of its PS/2 series PC's with a  three-year service guarantee in New York which it plans to  promote as computers for commercial users. And in the beginning  of September, IBM reported on the production of a new cheap PS/1  series system that is designed for use in small offices and  under everyday conditions.    Five new table-top systems, three servers, three monitors,  and four personal computers with audio and video capabilities  are in the PS/2 series. The firm's OS/2 version 2.0 operating  system will be loaded in all of the systems beforehand and all  of them will be based on IBM's "microchannel" architecture. An  IBM spokesman refused to provide any detailed description of the  product whatsoever. Personal Computer Company, a new IBM  subsidiary enterprise with headquarters in Somers (New York),  will be involved in marketing the expanded PS/2 series.    According to information from IBM spokesmen, the firm's  income from production of PC's totaled $7 billion in 1991,  however, IBM's "Personal Business" Division head J. Canavino  refused to provide a prediction for next year.    Hewlett-Packard plans to offer four high-class personal  computers, manufactured based on the 80486 microprocessor, with  a starting price of $1,149. Hewlett-Packard, whose income  totaled $14.5 billion in 1991, is known primarily as a  manufacturer of printers, automated work stations, and  measurement equipment. According to expert assessments, printers  account for 25% of the company's profits and personal  computers  only account for 5%.    In August, Hewlett-Packard reduced prices on its personal  computers by more than 25% while attempting to remain  competitive in the market. According to the company's official  statement, the new series of computers, which have received the  name Vectra 486N PC, are $400 cheaper than comparable items from  Compaq Computer Company.    New York (Reuters), 3 September 1992; 24 September  1992.  <H5>  Cray Receives Contract from NASA </H5>   Cray Research has received a NASA contract worth $74 million  for the delivery of a high-speed computer, beating out such  competitors as Japan's NEC Corp. and its American marketing  partner Control Data Systems.    The computer is needed by NASA experts from Ames Scientific  Research Center (Mountain View, California) to assist in the  design and conduct of tests of new design aircraft and  spacecraft. This center became the first to utilize numerical  modeling on a computer to replace certain expensive and  time-consuming tests of models of aircraft in a wind tunnel.    Hundreds of scientists from government, industrial, and  scientific organizations utilize the computer installed at Ames  Scientific Research Center in their work.    Cray received a seven year contract. The order for the  computer that was issued by Ames Scientific Research Center  became the first joint marketing effort between Control Data  Systems and NEC after they signed a cooperation agreement in  January 1992.    Control Data Systems (Arden Hills) became the successor of  Control Data (currently Seridien) for conducting calculations on  a computer.    NASA awarded the contract to the American firm in response  to  NEC's efforts to introduce high-speed computers in the American  government market, in which Cray is the leader. Having received  at one time a Canadian Meteorological Service contract, beating  out Cray in the process, NEC filed suit against NASA in Federal  Court, accusing the agency of a pro-American policy, and won the  right to compete in the competition along with Cray.    According to NASA spokesmen, Cray won the contract thanks to  the superiority of the specifications of its new C-90 computer  and the firm's reputation as a long-standing, reliable, and  profitable partner. The C-90 computer will replace the Cray-2  computer, which has been utilized at the Ames Scientific  Research Center since 1985.    Cray made a profit in the amount of $113 million with income  of $862.5 million in 1991.    AP, 3 September 1992.</p>

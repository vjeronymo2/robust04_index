			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Germany goes for win and place in second round If they beat Spain today at Soldier Field, Chicago, defending champions Germany could become the first of the 24 World Cup teams to clinch a place in the second round. 'We don't have a team that knows how to play for a draw,' said coach Berti Vogts. 'We are an offensive team and that's how we'll play.' Vogts gave no clue whether that meant a recall for veteran striker Rudi Voller. Germany beat Bolivia 1-0 in the Group C opener last Friday, while Spain wasted a 2-0 lead against South Korea, drawing 2-2. Worse for Spain was the red-card expulsion of captain Miguel Angel Nadal for an untimely tackle. Nadal was later given a two-match suspension. Spanish coach Javier Clemente has criticized Fifa, soccer's governing body, for penalising Nadal more harshly than the usual one-match suspension. 'I think it's totally unfair and out of proportion,' he said. 'I don't understand it.' Vogts said it would be dangerous trying to go for a draw. 'In 1984 we tried that against Spain and we were brutally punished,' he said, referring to the European championship. 'Spain has more at stake and I expect them to be cautious, to play defensively, to wait for our mistakes and then hope to get three points against Bolivia,' he said. German defender Thomas Strunz, who missed the Germans' first game because of a hamstring injury, is expected to play against Spain.</p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Arts: Safe pleasures by the lake - Lucerne Festival WHATEVER else the Lucerne Festival may stand for, it does not stand for controversy. Lucerne, like Switzerland, is comfortable and consensus-minded: it could not be controversial if it tried. By avoiding staged opera, it remains above the political conflicts that regularly beset other European music festivals. By relying on a core of wealthy Swiss patrons, it has steered clear of economic uncertainty. It is a safe, low-risk formula which promises continuity, smooth organisation and emotional reserve. Within these limits, Lucerne has something to offer. First, there is the setting: where else can you attend an Alfred Brendel performance in the morning, have lunch on a paddle steamer with views of William Tell-country drifting by, explore an Alpine peak by train and return to hear the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra? Even without the lakeside scenery, Lucerne offers a chance to catch most of the big-name orchestras, conductors and soloists in the space of three weeks. Anyone wary of musical indigestion can always stay at home and select some of the live concert relays on Swiss radio. But you still end up wishing you were there - as I did when I listened to the broadcast of Mikhail Pletnev's fabulous Russian National Orchestra in Tchaikovsky's Suite No. 3, and a Pathetique of blazing integrity from Abbado and the Berlin Philharmonic. Programmes have become spicier since Matthias Bamert took over as artistic director - slipping a new work by Heinz Holliger alongside Radu Lupu's performance of the Schumann concerto, or pairing Igor Oistrakh's Vivaldi with an Edison Denisov premiere. This year's theme was Russia. Lucerne must be the only large festival to have accepted the obvious pairing of Tchaikovsky and Rakhmaninov (respectively the 100th and 50th anniversary of their deaths); but the chance to explore the lesser-known chamber-recital repertoire was passed up in favour of another run through familiar blockbusters. Where the theme did pay dividends was the exposure it gave to Alfred Schnittke, Lucerne's first-ever composer-in-residence. No new work was on offer, apparently because of ill health and the symphonies were conspicuous by their absence. But 14 Schnittke works were performed, more than any other composer. The Lucerne programmes demonstrated just how variable Schnittke's prolific output can be. Worst of all was the Second Piano Sonata (1990), a catalogue of meandering ideas, thumping clusters and splashy pianistic cliches, which suggested a composer ill-at-ease with the keyboard. Schnittke's wife Irina certainly did nothing to soften the work's embarrassing tawdriness. By contrast, the Second String Quartet (1980), played by Sweden's excellent Tale Quartet in the same programme, came across as one of Schnittke's most elegiac and substantial works. Composed in response to the sudden death of a close friend, it owes some of its tonal language to old Russian religious motifs - but the influence is fully absorbed, the musical argument seamlessly unfolded through hiatus and repose, the tragic mood captured by quiet, meditative dissonances. This is Schnittke at his most serious and personal, expressing intense emotions through music of astonishing harmonic freedom. But where he acknowledges his influences more obviously, I find myself less easily persuaded. At first, his stylistic many-sidedness is hard to resist because of its sheer zest and playful imagination; with greater familiarity, it starts to sound trivial and banal. In the Concerto Grosso No. 3 for two violins and chamber orchestra (1985), vividly brought to life by Daniel Hope and Erik Houston with the Lithuanian Chamber Orchestra, Schnittke makes a convincing case simply through the technical dexterity with which he refracts the sound and style of a baroque concerto. There is a genuine synthesis of contrasting styles, filtered through Schnittke's own personality. The score also thrives on the brilliant conversational working of two virtuoso solo parts. But in less substantial works such as the melancholy Concerto No. 3 for violin and chamber orchestra (played by Bettina Boller and the Basle Radio Symphony Orchestra) or the over-extended Piano Concerto (Petras Geniusas), both dating from the late 1970s, the stylistic picking-around is at best predictable, at worst crude. Like most of the festival's small-scale events, the Schnittke concerts took place in one or other of Lucerne's churches and suburban halls, which offer atmosphere but poor acoustics (and the occasional overlay of bell-chiming). Lucerne needs not just a replacement for its cramped concert hall, but a decent recital hall. So the prospect of a SFr194m (Pounds 88m) lakeside complex, to be opened in time for the festival's 60th anniversary in 1998, is doubly welcome.</p>

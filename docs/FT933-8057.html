			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Thames to launch satellite channel THAMES Television yesterday announced the launch of a new satellite and cable television channel, called UK Living, which will start broadcasting on September 1, Gary Mead writes. The move extends Thames' broadcasting alliance with two of the dominant forces in cable communications, the US companies Cox Enterprises and Tele-Communications (TCI). UK Living is aimed primarily at women in the 25-45 age range in the middle and lower socio-economic groups; there are about 3.8m women who fit that profile in the UK. It will broadcast a mix of soap operas, chat shows, dramas and films. The bulk of the material will come from taking previously broadcast programmes from BBC TV and Thames TV's extensive library. A unique feature will be the broadcasting of BBC TV programmes within a week of their first being transmitted on the BBC network. The shareholders of the new channel plan to develop it alongside their existing cable and satellite channel, UK Gold, which specialises in broadcasting library material from Thames TV and the BBC. UK Living has Pounds 25m in funding and a Pounds 2m launch marketing budget, contributed by Thames, TCI and Cox. Ms Lis Howell, formerly head of programming at the breakfast commercial television company GMTV, is in charge of creating UK Living's schedule. Observer, Page 17</p>

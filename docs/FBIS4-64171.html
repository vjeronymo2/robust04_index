			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, May 30, BNS -- The commander in chief of  Estonia's Armed Forces is seeking clarity over allegations that  Prime Minister Mart Laar has bypassed him in steps toward a  defense cooperation plan with Israel, the POSTIMEES daily  newspaper reported today.    Major General Aleksander Einseln earlier this month had  asked  Laar's explanation for information provided to a Central Staff  official in a confidential letter by an aide to Leonid  Apananski, considered a key figure in the country's major arms  purchase deal with Israel, POSTIMEES reports.    Apananski's aide in the letter from May 16 had informed  Central Staff Colonel Arvo Sirel about a May 10-12 visit to  Tallinn of an Israeli delegation over, as the letter puts it, a  cooperation project started by Mart Laar and Israeli General Dan  Shamron.    "The work group participated together with their Estonian  colleagues from the Interior Ministry, police and the Defense  Ministry in a joint seminar for resolving the issues related to  the country's interior and outside security," the letter reads.  The discussions had also been about the defense concept and  doctrine, the Apananski aide said.    Einseln in his letter to the prime minister on the dame day  [as received], May 16, asked why Laar was dealing with security  issues without coordinating his activity with the head of the  Armed Forces.    The commander in chief asked a written explanation from the  prime minister on the allegedly existing cooperation project  started by Laar and General Shamron and what were the  authorities granted to Apananski, a private businessman, for  dealing with issues of state defense.    Laar in his answer on the following day stated that the  government had signed no cooperation projects with General  Shamron. He also denied any powers granted to Apananski over  state defense, and added Einseln should ask for information from  Defense Minister Indrek Kannik, by now resigned, or Interior  Minister Heiki Arike.    Einseln in his interview with POSTIMEES said he was not  satisfied with the prime minister's answer who, he said, was not  completely denying that something was going on, but had referred  the answer to other ministers.    He added that he hadn't still received the answers to his  May  23 letters to the defense and interior ministers.    The commander in chief said he was going to continue seeking  clarity over the issue, as he still didn't know whether plans  for the defense cooperation really existed. He said that if  something was going on, "such things must not be done without my  approval, agreement."    Einseln also said that if the government has decided to act  without informing him, it must also start looking for a new army  chief.</p>

			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEATH OF A SURVIVALIST: ONLY LAPSE PROVED TO BE HIS LAST  </P> <P> Kenneth Obney was a survivalist, a trainer of attack dogs and a man so  concerned with security that he carried a bullet-proof vest with him whenever  he traveled from his isolated desert home.  </P> <P> The one time he let his guard down, someone dressed in a Santa Claus suit  pointed a gift-wrapped box at him in front of a coffee shop and pumped five  shots from a semiautomatic rifle into his chest.  </P> <P> On Sunday, friends of Obney, who was 36 when he was slain Dec. 21 in  Bakersfield, will hold a benefit for his family at a San Gabriel Valley  restaurant and bar, not far from where he grew up in San Dimas.  </P> <P> The gathering, from 2 to 8 p.m. at Mr. Mike's in Covina, will feature  entertainment from several musicians who shared mutual friends with Obney,  including David Hidalgo, guitarist and singer for Los Lobos. The $5 admission  will go to Obney's widow, Mona, and their two teen-age children.  </P> <P> "Hopefully, it will be somewhat of a happy occasion," said Patrick Savant, a  longtime friend who helped organize the event. "I don't want it to be  depressing. I just wanted to do something to help the family."  </P> <P> Police investigating the Christmastime attack do not believe it was a random  shooting. But they have no suspects and little to go on, apart from witnesses  saying the assailant was tall, wearing a Santa suit and tennis shoes.  </P> <P> "You should have heard how many reports of people with Santa suits we got that  day," said Bakersfield Police Sgt. Brad Singleton, head of the homicide  division. "Something like 14 million. Santa was seen all over the place."  </P> <P> When Obney left the San Gabriel Valley in 1975, it was to escape the lunacy of  city life. A former auto repossession man for a collection agency, he found  peace on 15 acres of desert land in Joshua Tree, where he wore his hair  shoulder-length, his beard bushy and built up a cache of weapons and canned  food to be used in the event of a natural disaster or emergency.  </P> <P> He also purchased his first German shepherd, one of hundreds that he would  eventually breed and train at his own kennel, Obney Shepherds Inc. Most of the  dogs were sold for protection to businesses and celebrities throughout the  country. But some of his clients, friends said, were unsavory characters.  </P> <P> "In selling these dogs, he realized how much bad stuff and how many bad people  were out there," said his sister, Barbara Flotow. "That made him angry. The  main thing in his life was helping people protect themselves from that bad  element."  </P> <P> Four days before Christmas, Obney and a partner drove to Bakersfield with two  German shepherd pups that they had arranged to sell to someone at a Denny's  Restaurant. Obney left the dogs, his bullet-proof vest and .38-caliber revolver  on the floor of his Chevy Blazer. Then they went into the restaurant and  waited.  </P> <P> Sometime after 4 p.m., a man telephoned Denny's and told Obney to keep waiting.  About 45 minutes later, he called again and said he was having car problems. He  gave Obney directions where to find him.  </P> <P> "Things just didn't seem right," said Obney's partner, who was wounded in the  arm during the attack and asked that his name not be used. "I can't tell you  what it was. It was just like a gut feeling."  </P> <P> As they walked out of the restaurant at about 5:15 p.m., a man in a Santa  outfit and false beard approached them, carrying a gold gift-wrapped box, tied  with a red ribbon, under his arm.  </P> <P> The weapon never left the box. The shots ripped out of the cardboard about 12  feet from Obney. The gunman disappeared into the thick fog that enveloped the  San Joaquin Valley community that night. Obney died shortly after arriving at  Mercy Hospital in Bakersfield.  </P> <P> At his funeral, the casket was open and someone placed a tiny cloth German  shepherd on his chest.  </P> <P> "He believed everyone needed complete and total security," said Dave Messer,  who met Obney in seventh grade. "Sometimes I think he went a little overboard.  But it wasn't paranoia. It was awareness. He knew you could get blown away for  no reason at all."  </P></p>

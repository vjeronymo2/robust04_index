			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Airways active British Airways was the most actively traded Footsie constituent, turning over 13m shares and falling steeply in the wake of a placing of a large line of stock and persistent bearish comment on the outlook for 25 per cent-owned USAir. BA shares tumbled 10 1/2 to 353 1/2 p for a two-day decline of some 5 per cent. The interim statement is due on November 8 and worries about a possible write-off of part of the group's Pounds 275m investment in loss-ridden USAir are likely to continue to the run up to the results announcement. The big problem for BA yesterday though was block trades of 4.4m and 2.7m shares at 346 1/4 p and 349p respectively which crossed the screens in mid-afternoon. Talk in the market was that SG Warburg had handled the deals and been left holding a large line of stock. Position-taking in BA was also reflected in substantial traded option business.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Anatoliy Yershov under the "Events and Comments" </F> rubric: "Nizhniy Novgorod Mayor Falsifies Election Results"]    [Text] Nizhniy Novgorod -- A. Nekrasov, chairman of the  Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast Electoral Commission, has made a  sensational statement: In District No. 3, where, among other  candidates, Nizhniy Novgorod Mayor D. Bednyakov was running for  the Oblast Legislative Assembly, facts concerning the  falsification of the election results have been uncovered.  Furthermore, this was done with the participation of D.  Bednyakov and other officials.    Staffers of the Avtozavodskiy Rayon Prosecutor's Office are  now investigating this unusual case. District No. 3 for the  elections to the Oblast Legislative Assembly has 30 electoral  precincts; 65,000 voters live here. On the day of the  elections, 27 March, 17,611 ballot papers were given out; the  voter turnout was over 27 percent. But, as we know, the  definitive results of the ballot are determined by the number of  ballot papers which are deemed to be valid.    Unfortunately, there was a "shortfall" here, and this  district clearly did not reach the necessary 25 percent.    "In all, for various reasons, 1,655 ballot papers were  deemed  invalid, that is, almost one-tenth of the number issued," A.  Nekrasov said. "Incidentally, we had obtained all this  information by computer communication from the district  electoral commission the day before, and that is why the  elections here were deemed invalid."    There followed actions which can not be called anything  except the most gross violation of legality, A. Nekrasov went  on. Under pressure from D. Bednyakov and with the active  participation of G. Sokolnikov, head of the Avtozavodskiy Rayon  Administration, his deputy, Zh. Bolshakova, and Ye.  Boyarintseva, head of the organizational section at the rayon  administration, all the ballot papers were unpacked. Of course,  the officials, trying to please their chief at any cost, were  primarily interested in the ballot papers which were deemed  invalid the day before. They were all laid out in piles again,  and essentially a recount took place. At the same time the  previous protocols of the precinct electoral commissions were  destroyed, and this documentation was essentially filled out  anew. The number of valid ballot papers was raised first to  25.1 percent as a result of the aforementioned manipulations,  and later even higher -- to 25.2 percent. It must be noted  that the original count of the electorate's votes was conducted  in the presence of persons empowered to act for the candidates  and numerous observers, and there were no complaints or censure  on their part. In short, this is a matter of the most flagrant  arbitrariness by officials and an attempt by D. Bednyakov,  leader of the city authorities, to achieve the desired results  during the elections.</p>

			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Labour hangs onto narrow lead in opinion poll: Major rejects Kinnock call for TV debate Tory manifesto agreed by cabinet THE FIRST opinion poll since the start of this week's campaign for an April 9 election last night gave the Labour party a narrow 3-point lead. It came as pre-election nerves in London's financial markets brought further falls in share prices and in the value of sterling. The Mori survey for The Times, taken after the Budget, put Labour support at 41 per cent, the Conservatives at 38 per cent and the Liberal Democrats at 16 per cent. That compared with ratings of 40 per cent, 39 per cent and 18 per cent respectively in a similar poll two weeks ago. Senior ministers emphasised that the result was within the traditional 3-point margin of error on such surveys, suggesting that the two main parties were still level. But as Mr John Major promised to combine a 'visionary' manifesto with a continuous onslaught on Labour's tax policies, Tory MPs voiced disappointment that the Budget had apparently failed to lift their support. On the first full day of campaigning, Mr Neil Kinnock emphasised his party's determination to grab the initiative from the outset by challenging the prime minister to take part in televised debates. In a last angry clash in the Commons, the Labour leader accused Mr Major of being 'frit' after the prime minister rejected the demand. Mr Major faced a similar call from Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, but said such set-piece events were for 'losers'. Earlier Mr Kinnock, surrounded by celebrities at a London press conference, foreshadowed the themes of his campaign by promising 'new people, new ideas and new achievement for our country'. He repeated his claim that Labour would win an overall majority of 20 seats on April 9. The exchange between the two main party leaders at Westminster was the sharpest and most personal so far of their encounters over the past few months, emphasising the presidential-style of the election contest. Labour voted last night against the overall Budget package and prepared to oppose again today the detailed legislation to implement the introduction of a 20p income tax band. Mr Major charged that Mr Kinnock had once pledged 'to tax the rich to help the poor'. Now he proposed 'to tax the rich and tax the poor'. The Liberal Democrats pledged themselves to raise the basic rate of income tax to 26p, to fund an extra Pounds 2bn spending on education, and to abolish the new 20p rate. MPs will vote today on a truncated Finance Bill of just 11 clauses. It will also include the measures to push through the increases in excise duties, halve car tax and change the arrangements for VAT payments by small businesses. Senior ministers acknowledged that hopes of an early cut in interest rates had all but evaporated. But they insisted that Mr Major was confident that the jitters in financial markets would subside once his campaign was in full swing. The last cabinet meeting before the election yesterday morning endorsed the manifesto with which the party will launch its official campaign next week. Mr Chris Patten, the party chairman, said the manifesto was designed to help 'people to have a stake in Britain for themselves and their families'. He said: 'Above all it is a manifesto for enriching people's lives by using the government to help increase choice and opportunity for everyone.' Senior ministers said a much-trailed emphasis in the manifesto on promoting ownership and opportunity would be achieved through tax incentives for savings and schemes to extend home-ownership and by accelerating health and education reforms. These would be accompanied by a number of 'eye-catching' ideas. Mr Major's consensual style is to be emphasised by a positive approach to more open government although there will be no commitment to freedom of information legislation. The manifesto will also promise to give more help to the BBC World Service and to the British Council to underline the Conservatives' commitment to maintaining Britain's cultural as well as political influence on the world stage. The manifesto will include a pledge on the privatisation of British Rail and will propose sweeping changes to public sector housing. A programme drawn up by Mr Michael Heseltine to regenerate inner cities would break the local authorities' grip on rented housing. Housing management would be subject to compulsory competitive tendering, councils would be encouraged to transfer properties to housing associations and the rent-into-mortgages scheme would be extended nationwide. Among other proposals in the 60-page document will be plans to reduce inheritance tax, to further constrain the powers of trade unions and to privatise British Coal. Mr Heseltine also won approval for his ambitious scheme to develop the Thames corridor east of London's Docklands.

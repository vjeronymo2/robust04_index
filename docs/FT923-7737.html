			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Motoring: Grand Prix way to road safety UNBROKEN concentration and good judgment win grand prix motor races. If everyone showed the same qualities in day-to-day driving, most road accidents could be avoided. That is the gospel according to Dr Jonathan Palmer, who drove in 85 Formula I races, mainly with the Tyrrell team. He was also a highly successful driver in Formula 2 and 3, as well as touring car and world sports car championship events for Porsche and Mercedes-Benz. He still acts as a test driver for the McLaren Honda FI team. But Palmer's main activity at the moment is running the 1992 Cellnet Driver Challenge. For three years, Cellnet, the mobile telephone provider, ran a contest to find the best business driver. It must have felt the need to counter the popular image of a car 'phone-user as a man in red braces and a Porsche, making calls while driving one-handed on the M25 at 90 mph and almost touching the bumper of the car in front. As the car 'phone market approaches saturation, Cellnet has plans for another kind of service that 'non-company' people might hope to afford. So, in preparation, this year's driver challenge was opened to every kind of motorist: mum in her Metro, cab and delivery van drivers and under-25s as well as high-mileage businessmen and women. Entry is free. I joined competitors in the Reading heat this week. There were manoeuvring and smooth driving tests in a Toyota Carina E provided by Cellnet; a vision test; a brake reaction time test; a simple written examination on road safety; and some horribly fascinating road crash case histories on video. No, I will not be going on to the semi-final but I rated it an enjoyable and instructive morning. Anything to sharpen a motorist's awareness that concentration and good judgment are the secrets of safe driving has to be worthwhile. THE FIRST nip in the morning air is a reminder that summer is drawing to a close and the two big motor shows of autumn are not far off. The Paris salon de l'automobile comes first October 8-18 at Porte de Versailles) while Britain's international motor show opens at the National Exhibition Centre, Birmingham, on October 24 for a a nine-day run. The British show will be unlike any held before, either at the NEC or its previous venues, Earl's Court and Olympia in London. It will be combined with the Midlands autumn ideal home show; the same ticket (Pounds 7 for adults; children and senior citizens half price) admits to both events, which are on the same site. There will be no heavy commercial vehicles, which are to have a separate show of their own at the NEC next year. The organisers say the razzmatazz confined previously to press day will extend throughout the show. They do not mean scantily-clad women draped over car bonnets and tidal waves of champagne but live music and entertainment for the whole family. Can it really be that people once went to motor shows just to look at cars?</p>

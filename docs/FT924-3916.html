			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / International Company News: Navistar cuts loss to Dollars 30m as sales rise NAVISTAR International, the US trucks and bus maker, yesterday announced a reduced loss for the year to October 1992. For the fourth quarter the group lost Dollars 30m, or 15 cents a share, while losses for the full year totalled Dollars 147m, or 70 cents. That compares with a fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 67m, or 29 cents, in 1991, and a 1991 full-year loss of Dollars 165m, or 77 cents. The 1992 results are preliminary as the company is engaged in negotiations to reduce health care and retirement costs. Navistar said developments related to the negotiations may have an impact on the 1991-92 audited accounts. Navistar officials and representatives of the United Auto Workers of America have said they expect to settle the benefits issue this month. In the fourth quarter, Navistar had sales of Dollars 1.14bn, compared with Dollars 817m in the same quarter a year ago. During the quarter the company had an Dollars 18m charge for recalling a potentially defective steering gear shaft in some trucks and school buses. For the year, Navistar recorded sales of Dollars 3.87bn, up 12 per cent from the Dollars 3.46bn for 1991. The company is projecting a 3 per cent increase in North American demand for medium-sized trucks to 122,000 units in fiscal 1993, and a 16 per cent jump in demand for heavy trucks to 145,000 units. Based on these projections, Navistar does not expect to cut production, other than scheduled holiday breaks, during the first quarter of the current year.</p>

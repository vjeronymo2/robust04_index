			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FINES FOR LITTERING  </P> <P> A recent letter recited the fact that many persons who act in anguish when  there is an oil spill that affects our environment are the same ones who throw  litter from their autos and leave garbage on our beaches.  </P> <P> The sea has a way of tossing the litter back, thus penalizing mankind with, at  times, expensive cleanups.  </P> <P> Our public authorities should move in the same direction: assessing heavy fines  for even the most moderate acts of littering -- whether the acts occur on land  or sea. The penalties should be widely publicized and the cost of the program  derived from fines assessed the violators.  </P> <P> BARNARR CANNON  </P> <P> Laguna Hills  </P></p>

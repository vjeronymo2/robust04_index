			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DAY HIKE: BORREGO PALM CANYON IS CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF STATE'S DESERT SCENERY  </P> <P> More than half a million acres of Colorado Desert are preserved in Anza-Borrego  Desert State Park. The state park, California's largest, includes virtually  every feature associated with a desert -- washes, badlands, mesas and palm  oases.  </P> <P> The park stretches almost the length of San Diego County's eastern border  between Riverside County and Mexico. Anza-Borrego Desert State Park's size  means it is vehicle-oriented. Most of the popular scenic attractions can be  reached via some semblance of roads.  </P> <P> But to visit a tranquil place like Borrego Palm Canyon, you must hit the trail  -- a pleasant chore indeed. Borrego Palm Canyon is the third-largest palm oasis  in California, and was the first site sought for a desert state park back in  the 1920s. It's a beautiful oasis, tucked away in a rocky V-shaped gorge.  </P> <P> The trail visits the first palm grove and a waterfall. (A longer option takes  you farther up-canyon.) In springtime, the trail to the falls is one of the  most popular in the park. During the warmer months, you'll have the oasis all  to yourself. Watch for bighorn sheep, which frequently visit the canyon.  </P> <P> Directions to trailhead: The trail begins at Borrego Palm Canyon Campground,  located one mile north of Anza-Borrego State Park Headquarters. Day-use fee is  $3 per vehicle. Trailhead parking is available at the west end of the  campground near the campfire circle.  </P> <P> You may park for free at the Visitor Center (one of the best in the whole park  system and well worth your time) and walk a mile to the trailhead.  </P> <P> The Hike: Beginning at the pupfish pond, walk up-canyon past many desert plants  once used by the Indians for food and shelter. Willow was sought for  home-building and bow-making; brittle bush and creosote were used for their  healing qualities; honey, along with mesquite and beavertail cactus, was a food  staple. Shallow Indian grinding holes can be seen in the granite.  </P> <P> The broad alluvial fan at the mouth of the canyon narrows and the sheer rock  walls of the canyon soon enclose you as the trail continues along the  drought-reduced seasonal stream.  </P> <P> If you're already surprised at how an apparently lifeless canyon could provide  survival ingredients for the Indians, you'll be surprised once more when  Borrego Palm Oasis comes into view. Just beyond the first group of palms is a  damp grotto, where a seasonal waterfall (reduced to a mere trickle at last  report) cascades over huge boulders. The grotto is a popular picnic area.  </P> <P> From the falls, try an alternate trail back to the campground. This trail  follows the south side of the creek, past magnificent ocotillos, and gives a  different perspective on this desert environment.  </P> <P> You can also continue hiking up the canyon. The path is more difficult  up-canyon after the falls, with lots of dense undergrowth and boulders.  </P> <P> To continue to South Fork (where palms, not the Ewings, reside), hike past the  "tourist turnaround" up the canyon. The canyon is wet, so watch for slippery,  fallen palm fronds.  </P> <P> The canyon narrows even further and the trail dwindles to nothing. Parallel the  stream bed and boulder-hop back and forth across the water. The canyon zig-zags  quite a bit, so you can never see more than a few hundred yards ahead. The hike  is well-worth the effort, because most of the clusters of palms in the canyon  are found in the upper reaches.  </P> <P> The canyon splits 1 3/4 miles from the falls. Straight ahead, to the southwest,  is South Fork. The rocky gorge of South Fork is smothered with bamboo and  difficult to negotiate. South Fork ascends to the upper slopes of San Ysidro  Mountain (6,417 feet).  </P> <P> The Middle Fork (the way you came) of Borrego Palm Canyon is dry and more  passable. It's possible to hike quite a distance first up Middle Fork, then  North Fork of Borrego Palm Canyon, but check with park rangers first. It's  extremely rugged terrain.  </P> <P> BORREGO PALM CANYON TRAIL  </P> <P> Borrego Campground to Falls; 3 miles round trip, 600-foot elevation gain.  </P> <P> Borrego Campground to South Fork; 6 1/2 miles round trip, 1,400-foot elevation  gain.  </P></p>

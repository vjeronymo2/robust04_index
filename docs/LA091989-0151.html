			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> FAA ORDERS DC-10 ENGINE CHECKS  </P> <P> The Federal Aviation Administration today ordered a detailed inspection in the  fan disks of all DC-10 engines similar to the one investigators believe failed  before this summer's Iowa crash landing that killed 112 people.  </P> <P> FAA Administrator James B. Busey announced the formal inspections before a  congressional panel, where he and National Transportation Safety Board Chairman  James Kolstad both declared the DC-10 jumbo jet safe.  </P> <P> Busey said that although investigators had not determined what caused the  explosive engine failure in the July 19 accident, they believe one possible  scenario is the development of a crack in the fan disk "as the result of an  internal flaw in the disk material itself."  </P></p>

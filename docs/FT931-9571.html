			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / The Property Market: London bears brunt SHOP RENTS have increased by an average 44.6 per cent since November 1987, according to Hillier Parker, chartered surveyors. Rents reached a peak in May 1990, since when the Investors Chronicle-Hillier Parker All-Shops Index has fallen by 7.6 per cent. A study of the nine locations charging the highest rents in the UK showed sharp variations in rental movements between different areas. The sharpest falls since the peak in 1988 have been in London, which has been affected by the recession and high increases in business rates. Oxford Street, which commanded the highest rents in the UK in 1990, has seen its rents fall from a peak of Pounds 350 per sq ft in 1988 to Pounds 260 per sq ft today. The smallest fall was in Newcastle, in north-east England, where top rents declined from a peak of Pounds 200 per sq ft to Pounds 190 per sq ft. These figures measure the movement in open market rents on new leases, and so tend to react more sharply to changes in market conditions than portfolio measures, which include existing leases. However, they may underestimate the extent of the downturn by excluding the impact of incentives such as rent-free periods and capital contributions. Hillier Parker reports that the retail sector is performing better than offices and industrials, in spite of oversupply and falling retail sector profits. At the peak of the development cycle in 1989, 14.4m sq ft of retail space came onto the market. Last year the figure fell to 6m sq ft.</p>

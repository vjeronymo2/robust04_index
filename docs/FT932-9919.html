			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / EC pushes 'safe areas' option: The US-European row over Bosnia RELATIONS between the European Community and the US may have reached a turning point as both sides struggle to bridge divisions over how to end the civil war in Bosnia. These differences have largely been papered over, mainly because EC governments themselves have been torn over whether to support the use of force to halt the fighting. Their call on Monday to the US - and Russia - to send troops to bolster the United Nations peace-keeping force in Bosnia represents a stiffening of opposition to US plans to arm the Bosnian Moslems. It challenges Pentagon military doctrine - that US ground forces must be under US control and have a clearly defined mission, preferably backed by overwhelming force. Above all, it contradicts the US belief that the Vance-Owen plan is dead. To be sure, the allies are still hiding behind diplomatic code that 'all options, including military, remain open'. But this may obscure a more subtle shift in transatlantic relations. During the Cold War, the US took the anti-communist lead and a grateful Europe usually followed; now, a newly formed Anglo-French alliance has taken a lead of sorts and called on the Americans to fall into line, ironically with ground forces belonging to the old enemy, Russia. France and the UK are the chief contributors to the UN peace-keeping force in Yugoslavia, with about 6,000 troops in place. Their great fear is that the US preference for arming the Bosnian Moslems and bombing Bosnian Serb targets would put their own forces in the line of fire, ending all pretence of UN neutrality and most likely leading to a humiliating withdrawal. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, who toured Europe last week, was left in no doubt that to pursue plans to lift the embargo would lead to a split in the alliance. According to a senior UK official, the British goal was to kill at all costs the plans to arm the Bosnian Moslems. EC officials say the US secretary of state seemed more eager to hear about the European game-plan for ending the Bosnian conflict than pressing the US military version. The view that Yugoslavia is a problem for the Europeans rather than the Americans - as was held by the Bush administration - also emerged during last week's talks between President Bill Clinton and an EC delegation headed by Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, Danish prime minister, and Mr Jacques Delors, EC Commission president. 'Some of the US (military) proposals seem to be window-dressing,' said one Brussels official. So what is the European strategy? First, EC leaders have placed their bets on President Slobodan Milosevic and his transformation from war criminal to champion of the Vance-Owen plan. They believe sanctions are responsible for the conversion, and aim to capitalise on the split between Mr Milosevic and the Bosnian Serbs. The next step is to test the Serbian president's pledge to seal the border, possibly using the former Yugoslav army policed by civilian EC observers. Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, calls this the policy of 'asphyxiation'. The second goal is to expand UN-led efforts to create 'safe areas' for the Bosnian Moslems, consolidating the fragile ceasefire in six Moslem towns. The model is Srebrenica, where 150 Canadian troops negotiated passage into the town and persuaded Serbian artillery to hold fire. The UK's threat to bomb the Serbs if they attacked may have been a further incentive. French officials argue that securing 'safe areas' would provide the building blocks for implementation of the Vance-Owen plan. The Europeans' appeal for US and Russian forces stems in part from a realisation that the current UN force is inadequate and it is stretching its mandate continuously to keep the peace. This leaves the Clinton administration in a dilemma: having insisted that the Europeans take the lead, will it now dance to the European tune, knowing that sending US ground forces into Bosnia would effectively sidetrack their preferred military options - notably bombing.

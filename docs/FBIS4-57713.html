			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Cecilia Cayone from the "Union Radio News"] </F>   [Text] Democratic Action [AD] Deputy Hector Alonso Lopez  today requested that Luis Alfaro Ucero be dismissed from the  secretary generalship. Here is Cecilia Cayone with a report:    [Begin recording] [Cayone] AD leader Alonso Lopez made the  announcement during a news conference he called to explain the  reasons for his request.    [Alonso Lopez, in progress]...so internal party elections  are  convened to elect Claudio Fermin as new AD secretary general. I  see the Carlos Andres Perez case as the lethal weapon Alfaro  Ucero is wielding to dash Fermin's hopes of becoming the new AD  leader [words indistinct]. The real problem here is that Alfaro  Ucero wants to perpetuate himself as leader and does not want to  give Claudio Fermin an opportunity. Alfaro Ucero is spreading  rumors that Claudio Fermin is the candidate of Carlos Andres  Perez, thus seeking to divide AD between Perez supporters and  opponents, between corrupt and honest people. This is  unacceptable.    [Cayone] Deputy Alonso Lopez also underscored that,  according  to reports available to him, there is a plan brewing in AD to  expel him, Claudio Fermin, Luis Emilio Rondon, and Antonio  Ledezma. Asked about the possibility that Alfaro Ucero may  refuse to resign, Alonso Lopez replied:    [Alonso Lopez] Some day it will be written that Luis Alfaro  Ucero founded AD and ended up burying it.    [Cayone] Alonso Lopez added that he will make a formal  request to dismiss Luis Alfaro Ucero from the secretary  generalship during the National Directors Committee. [end  recording]</p>

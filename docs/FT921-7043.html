			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / International Company News: Omron fights to retain competitive edge - A Japanese company which is sharply cutting capital spending Mr Yoshio Tateishi, the president of Omron, the world's largest maker of switches and relays, sees the current downturn in the Japanese economy as a harbinger of a decade of slow growth in the country's manufacturing industry. But Mr Tateishi is not unduly worried about the prospect. He believes that even though Omron and other Japanese engineering companies face a more difficult time in the 1990s, they will retain their competitive edge in world markets. Growth will come from the further development of the Japanese economy and from export demand in east Asia. Omron is anything but immune to the effects of the downturn, which has had a particularly severe effect on the company's life blood - orders for factory plant and equipment. Omron warned last week of a likely 54 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y20bn (Dollars 156.3m) in the year to the end of March. It has cut capital spending from a planned Y70bn to Y50bn this year and plans further reductions in the year from April. In its concern for falling profit margins, Omron is reducing its product range by cutting customers' detailed options. To make matters worse, independent forecasts for the outlook for capital spending are universally gloomy - Nippon Credit Bank among others predicts a decline in investment in the year from April - the first in 15 years. Nevertheless, Mr Tateishi sees no reason to panic. He believes Omron has deep-seated commercial and technological advantages which will not be eroded in even a severe cyclical downturn. He does not share the gloom of some other Japanese industrialists who have compared the current slowdown with the recession Japan suffered after the 1974 oil shock. 'The financial bubble of the 1980s has collapsed and capital investment is falling. A cycle of business expansion has come to an end,' said Mr Tateishi in a recent interview. 'Up to 1990 sales in our industry grew at an annual rate of 10 to 15 per cent. I expect annual growth will be 5 to 10 per cent a year for the rest of the century.' Japanese companies are scrapping or postponing plans for investment in increasing capacity. But, says Mr Tateishi, they will continue to invest in labour-saving equipment, in pollution control, in plant to improve working conditions and in technological innovation. Moreover, sales to south-east Asia will grow at more than 10 per cent a year, as the economies in the region continue expanding faster than the industrialised world. Omron's fortunes are founded on its leadership in a narrowly-defined but widely-used technology. Founded in 1948 by Mr Tateishi's father, Mr Kazuma Tateishi, the company started by supply switches and relays to manufacturing industry and diversified into sensors, timers and programmable controllers - all pieces of equipment which link machines in a factory. Its share of the Japanese market in sensors is 52 per cent, in relays 68 per cent and in switches 70 per cent. In recent years it has applied the technology to office automation (modems and image scanners), medical equipment and banks' automatic teller machines. But industrial equipment accounts for two-thirds of its turnover which will total an estimated Y480bn in the year to March. Mr Tateishi says the company has stayed ahead of rivals through technological innovation. Employees are encouraged to be innovative and to foster their 'venture spirit', that is to try new ideas. The commitment to innovation thrives at Omron's biggest factory at Kusatsu, near Kyoto, in western Japan, which contains some of the company's most advanced production made to such accurate specifications that dust would harm their operation so they are assembled in dust-free 'clean rooms', like microchips. Mr Yoshiharu Ukai, a manager, says that 10 years ago the limit for errors in measurements was 20 to 30 microns. Today it is just 2 microns. In the past, switches were adjusted after they were made to ensure that they operated at exactly the right speed. This was now impossible since they were too small. The products have to be right first time, says Mr Ukai. The managers at Kusatsu acknowledge that there is no single part of the manufacturing process which is unique to Omron. The group's edge over its rivals lies in securing small advantages and making constant improvements. 'There are so many things we can do,' says Mr Ukai, who dreams of the day Omron will successfully put a relay and a microprocessor in the same silicon chip. Mr Tateishi says that this commitment to constant improvements distinguishes Japanese companies from foreign rivals. 'There is a high level of consciousness in Japan of the need for technological innovation in manufacturing.' Even though Kusatsu is a show-case plant, it has not been spared the effects of the current slowdown. One out of four lines making relays was shut down during a recent visit, because, said Mr Ukai, of a 'slight slowing in orders'. Mr Tateishi says industry is adjusting to the end of the financial bubble economy of the late 1980s, in which capital investment was fuelled by a flow of ultra-cheap credit. Companies, including Omron, face some short-term difficulties. But in the long-term, Japanese industry will keep investing, says Mr Tateishi. 'This is a huge market, so I don't think we will run out of work. Rather, labour shortages are our main problem.' In the view of industry analysts, Mr Tateishi may be under-estimating the severity of the present downturn in the Japanese machinery industry. But they acknowledge that the company's dominant position in its chosen markets, leaves it well-placed to survive.</p>

			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DRUG-AFFECTED BABIES EXPECTED TO DOUBLE;  </P> <P> HEALTH: THE ORANGE COUNTY SOCIAL SERVICES OFFICE INTERVENED IN 1988 FOR 171  INFANTS WITH SIGNS OF EXPOSURE. THE FIGURE REACHED 175 BY JULY, 1989.  </P> <P> About 300 drug-affected babies will probably be born in Orange County this  year, a number nearly double the officially reported figure for 1988, according  to figures provided Monday by county drug treatment officials.  </P> <P> The dramatic increase is attributable both to more widespread drug use and to  better reporting, especially of crack cocaine, among pregnant women, said Shoni  Welsh-Davis, director of the Orange County Perinatal Treatment Program, based  in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Welsh-Davis made the remark in an interview after her testimony before the  health and environment subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and  Commerce.  </P> <P> The subcommittee, whose chairman is Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), is  considering legislation that would authorize $700 million in new federal  spending for alcohol and drug abuse treatment by the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and  Mental Health Administration. Monday's hearing focused on the problems of  pregnant women.  </P> <P> In the interview, Welsh-Davis said that in 1988 the county Department of Social  Services formally intervened in cases involving 171 infants who were born with  signs of drug exposure. The figure for 1989 had reached 175 by the end of July,  she said, "which means we're going to double those numbers this year."  </P> <P> A department spokeswoman said Monday that the 1988 figure had been recently  adjusted to 179 after a review of records and that the total for 1989 had  reached 222 as of Sept. 30. If the current trend continues, the actual number  of county babies born in 1989 who had been exposed to drugs in the womb will  probably reach about 300.  </P> <P> Nearly 38,670 babies were born in the county in 1987, the latest year for which  figures were immediately available.  </P> <P> The incidence of babies born to drug-addicted mothers "certainly isn't low" in  the county, Welsh-Davis said: "I think we have a huge problem across the  nation, in small towns and big towns."  </P> <P> Operated by the county government, Welsh-Davis' clinic each year offers  outpatient treatment for about 400 drug-addicted mothers or mothers-to-be.  About 150 women are enrolled in the 36-week program at any given time, she told  the subcommittee. It is the only non-residential drug treatment program in  California tailored to meet the needs of pregnant women and the mothers of  small children, she testified.  </P> <P> The hearing provided another forum that showcased the continuing disagreement  over public health policy between Waxman and Rep. William E. Dannemeyer  (R-Fullerton), who also sits on the subcommittee.  </P> <P> In an opening statement, Waxman said: "In some cities, anger has led to a  disturbing trend where mothers are sent to jail rather than treatment. Jail is  not the answer. . . . Jail is not going to teach an addict how to be a good  mother."  </P> <P> But Dannemeyer suggested that law enforcement agencies should not allow  drug-addicted mothers to escape prosecution: "We have a law that says we're not  to use drugs. If we don't prosecute people . . . we're a short way removed from  the legalization of drugs, aren't we?"  </P> <P> Welsh-Davis disagreed: "You have to be able to replace their (drug-addicted  mothers') coping mechanism with something more effective. Sending them to jail  and sending them back to (the environment) . . . they're used to all their  lives is only reinforcing their behavior."  </P> <P> On another front, Dannemeyer asked whether religion can play a role in recovery  from drug addiction.  </P> <P> "The issue is of interest," he said, "because some people have observed and  written that the reason that people resort to drugs is because they're seeking  . . . to reconnect that breach between their creator, God in heaven . . . and  the lives they're leading."  </P> <P> However, Welsh-Davis said she does not believe that turning to religion helps  in overcoming drug addiction in the long run, although it may have positive  short-term effects.  </P> <P> "If I may speak frankly from my own experience," she said, "I find that to be  substituting one addiction for another because what these women need to do is  stand on their own, independently, without needing something to rely on."  </P> <P> Later, however, Welsh-Davis said religious beliefs that support involvement  with a formal self-help program, such as Alcoholics Anonymous, can help  recovering addicts.  </P> <P> Technically, Congress has already appropriated the $700 million to pay for the  new Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration programs. However, the  Waxman panel is still working on a formal authorization bill because some  members want to change the way the money will be spent, a source close to the  subcommittee said.  </P> <P> The spending bill already approved provides for $415 million in block grants,  over which state and local governments would have wide discretion.  </P> <P> Waxman, the source said, wants to reduce the size of the discretionary funds  and instead require that states spend a significant amount of the money to  programs that would directly benefit drug-addicted women, particularly those  who are pregnant.  </P></p>

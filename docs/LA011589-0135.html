			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WATCHFUL POLICE TO YIELD ARAB'S GIFTS  </P> <P> Forty-eight policemen will have to settle for a job well done instead of the  expensive watches they received from the president of the United Arab Emirates  in gratitude for guarding him.  </P> <P> "It was not deemed correct that officials receive extra compensation for  fulfillment of their normal duties," said an Aachen police spokesman.  </P> <P> The president, Sheik Zayed ibn Sultan al Nuhayan, gave the Swiss watches to the  policemen who guarded him during an August, 1987, visit, said the spokesman on  condition of anonymity.  </P> <P> "The watches are worth several thousand marks (more than $1,000) each, and  officials are questioning the propriety of accepting the gifts," he said.  </P> <P> The new police chief, Heinrich Boenninghausen, has decided the watches should  be auctioned off with the money to go to charity, the spokesman said.  </P></p>

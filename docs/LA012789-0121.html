			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GAUCHOS SQUEEZE PAST 49ERS, 53-52  </P> <P> UC Santa Barbara won another game Thursday night, and the Gauchos did it the  way Coach Jerry Pimm knew they would have to.  </P> <P> "At the end, I thought if we were going to win, we'd have to do it at the other  (defensive) end," Pimm said after the Gauchos (15-1 overall, 6-1 in the Big  West Conference) edged Cal State Long Beach, 53-52, before a sellout crowd of  2,237 in the 49ers' gym.  </P> <P> Long Beach had two opportunities to win the game in the last minute but failed  each time. Trailing by the eventual final score, the 49ers got the ball with  1:10 left on a steal by guard Tyrone Mitchell. They couldn't get off a shot,  and with the shot clock showing 8 seconds, Mitchell had the ball knocked away  by Carlton Davenport.  </P> <P> Mike Elliott of the Gauchos was fouled and, following two timeouts, missed the  front end of a one-and-one, giving the 49ers a last chance with 24 seconds to  play.  </P> <P> The only shot they could get wasn't a good one -- a running one-hander by  Darrell Faulkner that was well off the mark just before time ran out.  </P> <P> "We executed well all night, but on the last play we didn't execute worth a  darn," Long Beach Coach Joe Harrington said. "It was disarray. What can I say?"  </P> <P> The game was such an aggressive defensive battle that 4 points were the most  that ever separated the teams.  </P> <P> Long Beach (7-10, 4-4) led, 30-29, at halftime but never regained the lead  after Mike Doyle put the Gauchos ahead, 31-30, at the start of the second half.  </P> <P> And it was Doyle who hurt the 49ers the most late in the game, breaking ties of  47-47 and 51-51 with baskets.  </P> <P> "They get the ball to the right person at the right time," Harrington said,  speaking of Doyle, who led the Gauchos with 11 points, 8 in the second half.  </P> <P> Foul-shooting trouble was another reason why the 49ers' upset bid fell short.  Mitchell missed the front end of a one-and-one with 2:07 to go and Santa  Barbara ahead, 53-51.  </P> <P> Then with 1:41 left and the score the same, Jeff Eastin went to the foul line  with a chance to pull the 49ers even.  </P> <P> Eastin, who had missed only one free throw all season, made the first shot but  missed the second.  </P> <P> Center John Hatten led the 49ers with 21 points. He had tied the game at 49-49,  but his last attempt was blocked by Eric McArthur.  </P> <P> That was one of five chances the 49ers had to either tie or go ahead in the  last 3 minutes.  </P> <P> "It was one of our better efforts of the year," Harrington said. "It was a  great college basketball game, and it was an indication what our players can do  out there. We just weren't quite good enough."  </P></p>

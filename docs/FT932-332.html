			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / International Company News: Guinness Nigeria to raise Dollars 27m GUINNESS, the brewing group, has underwritten an investment of N750m (Dollars 27m) in Guinness Nigeria, writes Paul Adams in Lagos. The investment is the largest made in Guinness Nigeria. Nigeria is the third-largest market for Guinness, after Ireland and the UK. In 1992, the company increased pre-tax profits by 40 per cent to N238m. Guinness Nigeria will issue irredeemable convertible loan stock structured by First City Merchant Bank in Lagos. It will not be eligible for repayment and the interest rate will be linked to the yield on Guinness Nigeria's shares. The loan stock will be raised in foreign currency but denominated in naira, which allows the company a fixed rate of exchange at the date of issue. Most of Guinness's costs are for imported capital goods and spare parts. Last year, Guinness Nigeria raised N150m on the local stock market just before it lost 80 per cent of its foreign exchange value in the March 1992 devaluation. The proposed new investment has important implications for the future ownership of the company. Foreign equity ownership is limited to 40 per cent. Guinness holds 25 per cent and Unilever 15 per cent.</p>

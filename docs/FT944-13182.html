			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Shiloh Shiloh, the textile spining, healthcare, protective clothing and packaging group, lifted pre-tax profits by 27 per cent in the half year to October 1. The advance, from Pounds 490,081 to Pounds 622,355, was despite a Pounds 205,000 loss on the packaging side. Mr Edmund Gartside, chairman, said the group was urgently addressing the loss on packaging and was planning to withdraw from the least profitable markets, for which some provision might have to be made at the year-end. In addition, an exceptional provision of up to Pounds 392,000 might have to be made in regarding the deferred consideration on the land sale made in October 1990. Turnover improved by 9 per cent to Pounds 14.6m (Pounds 13.4m). Earnings per share emerged at 7.14p (5.75p) and the interim dividend is held at 1p.</p>

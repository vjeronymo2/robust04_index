			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Packwood appeal rebuffed: Senate votes to obtain diaries SENATOR Robert Packwood's attempts to limit Senate investigation into his private affairs was firmly rebuffed by his colleagues on Tuesday night after two days of painful, and sometimes emotional, floor debate. The full Senate voted 94-6 to back the request of its own ethics committee for an unlimited subpoena to obtain Mr Packwood's private diaries. Earlier it rejected by 77-23 an amendment by Senator Alan Simpson, the Republican from Wyoming, that would have made only 'relevant' materials available to the committee, leaving the balance in the custody of an independent judge. Mr Packwood's lawyer intimated yesterday that legal challenges to the Senate action might still be taken. Never before has the chamber taken such sweeping action against one its own members. Mr Packwood was already under investigation for charges of sexually harassing more than 25 women over a 20-year period. The committee has also said it may have evidence of additional offences by the Republican senator from Oregon. In the debate one leading senator went so far as to advise Mr Packwood to resign. Mr Robert Byrd, the Democrat from West Virginia and a staunch defender of the integrity of the Senate, put into words what many of his colleagues are known to be thinking. 'None of us is pure or without flaw,' Senator Byrd declared, 'but when those flaws damage the institution of the Senate it is time to have the grace to go.' The Simpson compromise amendment, which Mr Packwood said earlier he could accept, was supported by Senator Robert Dole, though the Republican leader also voted in favour of upholding the ethics committee's request. On that vote, one Democrat joined five Republicans, including Senator Packwood, in opposing the blanket subpoena. He was Senator Dennis Deconcini from Arizona, himself censured by the ethics committee for his involvement with Charles Keating, the savings and loan executive. All seven women in the Senate voted for the subpoena, though Mrs Nancy Kassebaum, the Kansas Republican, disagreed with Senator Patty Murray, the Washington Democrat, that sexual misconduct was the most important issue at stake.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sandra S. Aguinaldo] </F>   [Text] A communist leader yesterday warned Jose Maria  Sison his faction is ready to retaliate if the Netherlands-based  central committee will attempt to kill oppositionists.    Arturo Tabara, allegedly one of the insurrectionists or  anti-reaffirmist faction, a group strongly opposed to Mr.  Sison's revolutionary strategies, confirmed his group already  has a liquidation order from the communist hierarchy.    He said the anti-reaffirmist faction will be the  leadership's  first target because it has a strong following and has been a  consistent critic of Mr. Sison's "defective ideological  foundation."    Based on intelligence reports, the faction has the largest  number of members coming from the central committee and the  entire Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP). Its largest  group is the Manila-Rizal Regional Committee (MRRC) which was  said to have 40 percent of the entire party membership.    Recently, the New People's Army (NPA) Melito Glor Command,  the group who owned responsibility for the killing of former NPA  leader Leopoldo Mabilangan, said their next targets are Mr.  Tabara, alleged former head of the CPP's Visayas Commission;  Romulo Kintanar, alleged former NPA chief; Felimon Lagman,  alleged leader of the breakaway Manila-Rizal Regional Party  Committee (MRRC); and, Ricardo Reyes, alleged former CPP  secretary general.    Gregorio Rosal, spokesperson of the command reportedly  chaired by Mr. Sison himself, said the "renegades" of the  communist movement are involved in counter-revolutionary  activities.    But Mr. Tabara said his group's activities in the past were  under the party's "official revolutionary policy."    He admitted CPP members' involvement in kidnapping and other  activities considered illegal under the Philippine law, but said  they were done under the communist party's expropriation policy.    The expropriation policy, he said, is the act of  confiscating  movable and immovable properties from landlords, bank,  multinational corporations in order to contribute to the party's  cause.    He said Mr. Sison cannot condemn former partymates of these  activities because expropriation had been an "open practice"  before it was "centralized to the politburo."    "Bakit kami lang? Dapat responsibility yon nang buong party.  Dapat suriin ang policy para magkaroon ng pagbabago [Why only  us? It should be the responsibility of the whole party. The  policy should be reviewed to have a reform]," Mr. Tabara said.    He echoed Mr. Reyes' statement the other day that the  central  committee leaders should explain the activities of the people's  court. "Hindi na iyan yung people's court dati [It is not the  old people's court]. We are not expecting fair trial anymore.  As good as sentenced na kami [We are good as sentenced  already]."    "We strongly warn Sison and his Stalinist faction to stop  all  the pretense of judicial process to mete out orders of summary  executions of opposition leaders."    He also laughed off Mr. Sison's accusation that the  oppositionists are out to liquidate him. "Walang assassination  plot laban kay Sison. Gawa-gawa lang nya yon [There is no  assassination plot against Sison. He just made it up]," he said.</p>

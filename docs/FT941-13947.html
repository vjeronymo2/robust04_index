			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Switching cycles Kingfisher's report on current trading disappointed those who had been expecting a merry Christmas. But given the equity market's sunny disposition, poor economic news is seen only as an opportunity for another interest rate cut. While little will stop a market in such a gung-ho mood, this focus on consumer confidence as a guide to interest rate movements may be misleading. The Treasury, keen to maintain a broadly based recovery, and mindful of the balance of payments, may well be paying more attention to corporate investment intentions when deciding monetary policy. That may mean that the consumer, who has led the recovery so far, will not figure as prominently this year - particularly so when tax increases begin to bite. The outperformance of the FT-SE Mid 250 index also shows how investor interest is focused on medium-sized capital goods companies and away from the financial, utility and consumer dominated FT-SE 100 index. High expectations for smaller companies are shown vividly by the rating of 35 times earnings on which the FT-SE SmallCap index is trading. Still, that may not be wildly excessive given the much improved financial position of companies. The earnings recovery required to sustain the market may also be on the way. All of that is timely since interest rate cuts may be slow in coming and gilts may have seen the best of the bull run. When yields start to move up, attention may eventually shift to the long end of the gilt market. The more fundamental support there is for equities, the better underpinned they will be when the interest rate cycle turns.</p>

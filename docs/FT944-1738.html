			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / This Week: FT Guide To EU Inter-governmental Conference What will the European Union's 1996 inter-governmental conference be about, and why the sudden interest? In 1996, the 15 members of the EU are due to review the operation of the Maastricht treaty, and possibly amend it. French and British Euro-sceptics are worried that the conference (IGC) could mark a second great leap forward in European political and economic integration. Dissident British Tories are warning about 'Son of Maastricht'. They are demanding a referendum, before or after the conference. Why the referendum fever? After all, Britain held one on EU membership in 1975. UK prime minister John Major hints that he might hold a referendum, but only if the IGC produces far-reaching constitutional changes. At this stage, the chances of a 'big bang' IGC look remote. Jacques Delors' decision against running for the French presidency makes a Franco-German push in 1996 for deeper, faster integration less likely. OK, but what about the single European currency? Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist presidential candidate in France, says he favours a referendum on European monetary union. True. But contrary to popular belief, the IGC will not discuss policy issues such as the single-currency project. It will only examine possible treaty changes. Anyway, Emu is already in train. There could be a move to Emu in 1997, but 1999 is far more likely. Why? Maastricht says that Emu can only be triggered in 1997 if a majority of the 15 member states meet tough targets on budget deficits, government debt levels, exchange rate stability and interest rates. In 1999, you do not require a majority - just those countries which meet these so-called convergence criteria. If a privileged group does go ahead, it could be very divisive. Either way, Britain would face a tricky decision on staying in or out. If Emu is off, what is on the 1996 agenda? One of the big topics is European defence policy. Britain led opposition to moving too fast towards a separate European defence 'identity' in 1991, because it was worried about undermining the Nato alliance and upsetting the Americans. But that was before the Bosnian war, and before the US made clear it wanted the Europeans to take more responsibilty for defence matters, albeit under Nato's umbrella. So what might come out of the conference? Reports of a future common European army are wildly exaggerated. But the British, French and Germans are interested in strengthening the Western European Union, the EU's fledgling defence arm. Pay attention, too, to the Anglo-French axis. Paris and London have been 'bonding' in Bosnia as the biggest contributors to the UN peace-keeping operation, and they are planning a joint air command. Also, Britain thinks that playing the defence card is the best way to bolster its Euro-credentials with Paris. Any other business in 1996? Everyone, even the British, appears to agree that some institutional changes in the Union will have to take place to prepare for the next round of enlargement - that is, the entry of the former communist countries of central and eastern Europe, as well as Cyprus and Malta, around the turn of the century. Most people think the Union may have as many as 27 countries by 2005-2010. What are the options for institutional change? Mind-numbingly numerous. The British want a minimalist agenda. They would like to cut down the number of commissioners (presently 20), but that means breaking the tradition that every country has its own commissioner. The big countries want to tinker with the voting system in the EU decision-making body, the Council of Ministers. The present system is weighted disproportionately in favour of the smaller member states. So what is John Major's problem? Germany and the federalist-minded smaller states would also like to introduce more majority decision-making and reduce the power of the national veto. Another sensitive area is justice and home affairs. Chancellor Kohl would like to introduce supranational decision-making to tackle organised crime and drug trafficking. His dream is to turn Europol, the fledgling police network, into a European FBI. That is anathema to the sovereignty-conscious British and French, but still bet on some movement here. What about the European Parliament? Kohl believes that strengthening the Strasbourg assembly is the best chance of filling the 'democratic deficit' in Europe. He would like to increase its power of co-decision in EU legislation. But he could run into opposition in 1996 from countries such as Britain and Denmark which see their own national parliaments as the big players, and are reluctant to cede more powers to Strasbourg. What is the next step in preparing for 1996? The European Commission, the European Parliament and a group of selected representatives of the 15 member states will shortly submit papers identifying the institutional problems created by future enlargement and a possible agenda for 1996. The smart money is on a long IGC, probably lasting beyond the next UK election. Perhaps John Major will not even be around to conclude the negotiations. In which case, step forward Tony Blair, the UK Labour party leader.</p>

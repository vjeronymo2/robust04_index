			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Spices The pepper market has been rather inactive of late in the absence of buying interest from grinder, reports Man Producten. Consequently white pepper prices have come under increased selling pressure. In comparison with a fortnight ago prices have declined by about 4 to 5 per cent and are now about USDollars 2,700 a tonne, cif, for April/May shipmment and Dollars 2,600, cif, for July/August (ex-new crop). Black pepper prices, in contrast, remained steady, though here too demand remained below normal. However, most origins showed little or no interest in reducing prices . Black pepper grade 1 was offered this week at Dollars 1,600-Dollars 1,650 a tonne, cif.</p>

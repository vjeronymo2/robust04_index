			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Arts: Zender's 'Don Quijote' - Opera in Stuttgart and New York 'Happy New Ears'. The greeting comes from the 56-year old German conductor-composer Hans Zender, an increasingly vociferous member of his country's musical avant-garde. As the title of a book of recent essays, it represents not just his disillusionment with traditional forms of opera, but his desire to set music theatre on a radical new course. Zender's first opera - heavily influenced by his mentor Bernd Alois Zimmermann - was Stephen Climax (1986), in which two separate plots unfold simultaneously. Now comes Don Quijote de la Mancha, in which Zender isolates five components of opera - speech, song, instrumental music, action and scenery - and subjects them to the maximum number of permutations. The result is '31 theatrical adventures', premiered at the Wurttemberg State Theatre in Stuttgart and already scheduled for a second staging at the 1995 Salzburg Festival. This is deconstruction writ large. The 31 scenes unfold like revue sketches, each lasting three to six minutes - except the 16-minute finale to the first half, the only scene in which all five components come together. You have speech without song or action; sound without scenery; action without sound; scenery alone - and so on. Zender gives precise instructions on decor, gesture, timing and rhythm, but says the order and number of scenes can be changed. The only leitmotif is Cervantes' eccentric, flamboyant knight, who emerges as little more than a comic cartoon-strip character. As just one of five equal components, the music is marginalised. It is most effective at its most conventional, as in the flurry of staccato trumpet and horn calls accompanying the windmill scene. Elsewhere, Zender's serialism is unremittingly arid and cool. Voices - including three 'readers' - often swamp each other. To sustain interest, the piece relies on visual variety, requiring spans of concentration no longer than a pop video programme. But in contrast to today's pop videos, Don Quijote de la Mancha is all intellect and no feeling. Content is secondary to technique; unity and harmony are replaced by bloodless dissection; art is reduced to a mathematical formula. We have been up the same cul-de-sac before - with Cage's Europeras among others. Such experiments, aimed at shaping the future of opera on a super-rational basis rather than organically, serve only to trivialise the human and technical resources of a traditional opera house. Don Quijote might have more to say in a production showing less respect for theatrical norms. The Stuttgart producer and designer Axel Manthey made no attempt to break the barrier between stage and auditorium, relying instead on a few electronic sound-effects and a sequence of eye-catching stage pictures inspired by Pop Art. Some of the action had a Pythonesque touch, as when Don Quixote and Sancho Panza tried obsessively to duel with their shadows. David Pittman-Jennings and Dieter Bundschuh made a heroic leading pair, backed by 16 other singers and a small orchestra under Bernhard Kontarsky. None of their efforts could mask the work's blatant tedium.</p>

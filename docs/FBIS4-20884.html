The project is considered to be a state secret (code: "A  232"). A scientist who informed the west about it was arrested  for betraying state secrets.    The nerve poison (called "Novikhok") reportedly works even  faster and more strongly than all chemical combat agents known  so far. Bonn is alarmed. Dieter Kastrup, state secretary in the  Foreign Ministry, says: "The Federal Government is worried  about these reports."</p>

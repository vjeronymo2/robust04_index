			<p>Language: <F P=105> Azeri </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference held by President Geydar Aliyev with </F> Turkish reporters in Baku on 3 February; reporters' questions  are in Turkish, Aliyev's replies in Azeri -- recorded]    [Text] [Aliyev, in progress] ...there are friendly and  fraternal relations between Turkey and Azerbaijan. The  friendship and fraternity between our peoples have a long and  rich history and these ties between Turkey and Azerbaijan have  been considerably broadened and developed. However, this does  not mean that the level of relations completely satisfies Turkey  and Azerbaijan. There is a great potential to deepen and  further develop our relations. I believe that these potentials  have thus far not been used to the desired extent. Therefore,  many tasks await us now and in the future. I repeat that our  relations are ones of friendship and fraternity. Our peoples  are friends and bothers. However, such ties are given concrete  shape by economic, trade, cultural, social, and other  cooperation. We have great potential for extensive cooperation  in all these fields. I am sure that during my visit to Turkey  we will conclude relevant agreements to activate this potential  and to better use it in the future, and that such agreements  will be reflected in relevant documents and treaties to be  signed.    I will visit Turkey at the invitation of my very close  friend  esteemed Suleyman Demirel, whom we highly respect here.  Undoubtedly, I will meet with all the Turkish leaders there. I  am also ready to meet with the Turkish people, businessmen,  scientists, and those who have an influence on Turkish life.  The program of my visit has still to be finalized, but I am  ready to accede to other requests outside the program.    I also want to note that I am personally giving great  importance to this visit and getting ready for my visit to  Turkey with great expectations. I hope that this visit will  produce very positive results, and will open a new phase in the  development of ties between Azerbaijan and Turkey.    [Reporter Murat] I want to ask a few questions on the  situation at the front. You have recently scored some  victories. The people mostly ascribe these successes to you.  They say that after taking office Geydar Aliyev put things  aright. What do you think is behind these successes? And my  second question: The Turkic summit has been postponed; will it  be held sometime in the future or has it been abandoned  completely?    [Aliyev] The victories achieved in recent months in the  struggle being waged by the Azerbaijani Army against Armenia's  aggression are first of all the victories of the Azerbaijani  people and the Azerbaijani Army, which is an inseparable part of  the Azerbaijani people. The Azerbaijani people have always been  brave and powerful. They have a history of great heroism. The  Azerbaijani people fought for their freedom, independence, and  the defense of their lands for centuries and have emerged  victorious. There have been moments of defeats too. But,  history saw the Azerbaijani people survive and has now has seen  them emerge as an independent state. All these things were  achieved due to the strength, effort, courage, and heroism found  in the Azerbaijani people.    It could be asked why high spirits exist now and was absent  in the past. It is simply that people should have been  persuaded to trust their own strength.    [Unidentified reporter] Could we say that they now trust  their leaders?    [Aliyev] You know peoples' history. Turkey's history too  confirms that a people must have faith in something. Just like  faith in God and religion, there should be faith in the people.  Now this faith has been forged in our Azerbaijani people. They  now believe in their own strength. And, undoubtedly, there is  also trust in the leadership of Azerbaijan. You yourselves can  see this. My task has been to make people aware of their own  strength and believe in it. We have achieved this aim, and I  believe that we will continue to do so.    The successes are the result of the heroism of the  Azerbaijani people and the heroic struggle being waged by the  Azerbaijani sons fighting in the army ranks. My task as the  president and commander in chief has been to guide and shape  these efforts, to mobilize the people, to rise the people up, to  make them trust their own strength. You are aware that I have  been active in this direction in recent months. And, the  results are obvious.    As for the summit, it has not been abandoned; it has only  been postponed to a later date. The summit will take place.    [Second unidentified reporter] It is being said that in  view of the Azerbaijani successes at the fronts and the  continued Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict, a summit in Baku would  have been construed as support for Azerbaijan, and that is why  it was postponed.    [Aliyev] Hmmm. I do not know. There might be something to  it, but I am not aware of it.    [Third unidentified reporter] Why has the military  cooperation agreement between Turkey and Azerbaijan not been  signed yet? Will you take initiatives during your visit to  Turkey to sign the military cooperation agreement?    [Aliyev] I do not know why it was not signed. However, we  have no such plan.    [First unidentified reporter] The Turkish press reports that  PKK [Kurdish Workers Party] terrorists are going from Syria to  Armenia by various routes and then are fighting against  Azerbaijan. Do you have information to this effect? That is, do  you have information proving that PKK terrorists are fighting  against you in the Armenian ranks?    [Aliyev] As you know, many join the Armenian ranks in the  war  against us. There are people from many countries. It could be  that they [PKK] too are taking part. But, I have no definite  information on this. However, I know that there are soldiers  from Russia, European countries, and other countries fighting  against us on the Armenian side. We have documents proving  this, the prisoners confirm this. As for the PKK members'  participation in the fighting, that too might be possible; after  all, the PKK has close ties with Armenia. It could well be.    [Fourth unidentified reporter] There are reports that this  terror organization is trying to establish bases in Sharur,  Dashan,and Devekoy in Nakhichevan. Mustafayev, the former  police chief of Devekoy, has declared himself president of a  self-styled [Kurdish] region in Shushinskiy and Lachinskiy  rayons.    [Aliyev] In whose name has he done that?    [Fourth unidentified reporter] In the name of PKK.    [Aliyev] I see.    [Fourth unidentified reporter] There are reports to this  effect. What measures are you thinking of taking against the  PKK in Azerbaijan and Nakhichevan?    [Aliyev] As you know, we have not made any decisions against  the PKK. When I was in power in Nakhichevan there was no overt  [PKK] activity, though they might have carried out secret work  in the villages you mentioned. Therefore, I cannot say anything  on this subject at this time. However I do know that there is a  power line from Turkey to Nakhichevan and they have sabotaged  that line two or three times and they have again sabotaged it.  Turkey informed us that the lines were damaged by PKK members  or by people who had come from Armenia. They cross the border  with PKK assistance and carry out sabotage on the lines. At  present the power line from Turkey to Nakhichevan is not  working. It has been damaged. Of this I am aware.    [Fifth unidentified reporter] You recently met Boris  Yeltsin's representative on Karabakh. You had already met with  Vladimir Kazimirov twice in Baku. The Turkish press reported  that the Russian plan envisages the deployment of [Russian]  peace troops on Azerbaijan's borders with Iran and Turkey and in  Karabakh. Did you receive such a proposal from Kazmirov?    [Aliyev] I met Kazimirov here. We held lengthy  consultations. They put forward proposals for ending the war  between Azerbaijan and Armenia. We too want this war to end.  However, we did not agree with the conditions put forward. I  told Kazimirov that, as we have often reiterated, we favor the  ending of the war and implementation of a cease-fire, with the  sole condition that the Armenian armed forces immediately  withdraw from Azerbaijani territory. Their proposals and our  proposals on conditions for the withdrawal of the Armenians do  not coincide; therefore, we could not reach an agreement.  However, our contacts are continuing and will continue. And if  conditions suitable to us are put forward we might accept them.    After all, we do not want war. Blood is being shed and  people are getting killed every day. Recently, the Armenian  side suffered enormous losses. Armenia was trying to convince  the world that the war was not between Armenia and Azerbaijan  but between Karabakh and Azerbaijan, but now we have lots of  proof that it is Armenia that is fighting and many of its troops  were killed while trying to enter Kelbadzharskiy Rayon and some  were captured. The same thing happened in Fizulinskiy and  Agdamskiy Rayons. Armenian citizens are engaged in war there.  We told all this to Kazimirov and we said that we favor peace  and the ending of war provided that our condition is accepted.    [Fifth unidentified reporter] What was your condition: Was  it the Armenian withdrawal from the occupied Azerbaijani lands...    [Aliyev, interrupting] Yes, their withdrawal.    [Fifth unidentified reporter]... and that there cannot be a  question of a cease-fire as long as they do not withdraw?    [Aliyev] Hmm. There might be a question of it, but what we  want is that for them to withdraw. There are also conditions  for the withdrawal. They cannot anyway withdraw within a day.  There are details as to when, on which day, under which  conditions they could withdraw.    [Fifth unidentified reporter] Was there a discussion of the  deployment of a Russian peace force?    [Aliyev] There are such ideas. However, we did not accept  this condition.    [First unidentified reporter] [Words indistinct] could  Turkey  take part in a international (?peace force)?    [Aliyev] We think that Turkey could take part in it; and  Turkey should take part. Turkey must definitely take part,  especially when the CSCE observers are deployed here. However,  Armenia opposes Turkey's participation, it objects to it.    [Fifth unidentified reporter] Could Russia send a peace  force  here by itself alone?    [Aliyev] Russia wants this and is trying do it.    [Fifth unidentified reporter] Could Azerbaijani alone [words  indistinct]    [Aliyev] As I told you, these are big issues, talks are  needed.    [Sixth unidentified reporter] Yesterday the Turkish  parliament speaker, the esteemed Husamettin Cindoruk, speaking  on Turkish television in connection with your visit, underlined  that only democracy befits the Turkish people and Azerbaijan.  People from Nakhichevan are being invited to Turkey to hold  news conferences on human rights violations. It is being said  that you are oppressing the opposition and some political  figures are being held in prison, and that there is not much  information about their fate. These claims are being published  in the Turkish press and the Turkish Government is also talking  about the need for democracy in Azerbaijan. What is your  approach to democracy and opposition?    Second, Abulfaz Elchibey is living in a mountain village. In  Turkey, too, such internal troubles occurred in the past but  none of our politicians or elected officials have been forced to  return to their villages. That is, one cannot engage in  politics in a village; after all, Baku is the political capital.  Is there room for some flexibility. It is being claimed that  if Elchibey returns here there will be internal turmoil. But,  this does not sound realistic. Do you agree that all the  opposition parties should freely work in the parliament on a  democratic platform? And to what extent are these rumors  correct?    [Aliyev] As you know, democracy is not the monopoly of one  single person or a group of individuals. Democracy is a global  value -- Do you understand me, I am speaking in Azeri?    [Reporters] Yes, yes...    [Aliyev] So, you do. I am speaking in Azeri. Democracy is  a global value. It does not belong to one or two persons.  Therefore, you should not be carried away by wrong information.  Yet, unfortunately, here and in Turkey they divide people into  groups. Allegedly, a certain group is prodemocracy and the  other is not. This is not correct. Democracy has already made  its own niche in Azerbaijan. That is, it has established  itself. As for my position, I have always been in favor of  democracy. Regrettably, even some people in Turkey disseminate  negative reports about my person. They say that in the past  Geydar Aliyev was a great communist leader and headed the Soviet  Union, the Azerbaijani Communist Party, and that he was a  general, and therefore he cannot be a democrat. Starting with  Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, almost all the presidents of the Turkish  Republic were generals. However, no one says that these are not  democrats, or that they failed to follow the path of democracy.  Therefore, all such claims are concoctions. This is the first  point.    Second, you yourselves know that I came to Azerbaijan at the  invitation of Abulfaz Elchibey. His sitting in a village is his  own problem. No one sent him there. I too sat in Nakhichevan  close to three years, and I never said that anyone had forced me  to settle there. I simply had no place other than Nakhichevan  to go. That is why I went and settled down there. I had no  place in Baku, that is why I went to Nakhichevan. They also  gave me no means to make a living in Baku. This is each  person's problem. I, as a former leader of Azerbaijan and the  Soviet Union, never said why I stayed in Nakhichevan for three  years. I accuse no one for this.    It was Abulfaz Elchibey who invited me here. I did not want  to come here, I came only because he invited me. I was elected  chairman of the parliament on 15 June, the day I came here.  Since then I have always said: Azerbaijan is an independent  state, and I will never allow the loss of this independence.  Azerbaijan must walk along the path of democracy. Azerbaijan  must establish a democratic and law-based state and society by  making use of the internationally accepted democratic principles  in accordance with the Azerbaijani national traditions and  characteristics. This is the path followed by Azerbaijan. I am  also walking along this path. I am also trying to take the  Azerbaijani Government along this road. Therefore, claims of  violation of democracy in Azerbaijan are lies. Those writing  such things in Turkish and Azerbaijani press are writing lies.    The relations with the opposition here is normal. No one  is preventing the opposition from speaking. Since my election as  president I have repeatedly said that I am the guarantor of  democracy, human rights, and of equal legal treatment of the  Azerbaijani citizens regardless of their linguistic, religious  and political affiliations. I am the guarantor of speech and  conscience, and I favor political pluralism. I am in favor of a  multi-party system. Here there are far more parties and papers  than in Turkey. If Turkey has 10 major newspapers, here there  are that many whose names I do not even know. Whoever wants can  publish a newspaper.    Therefore, the talk about the strangulation of democracy is  totally false. These claims arise from the assumption that  allegedly there was democracy when the People's Front of  Azerbaijan [PFA] and Abulfaz Elchibey were here. This is wrong.  When Elchibey was in power, the interior minister used to beat  up the reporters. I remember, once I was watching television in  Nakhichevan. The then Prime Minister Panakh Guseynov and the  representatives of the National Independence Party were engaged  in a debate. Suddenly, the then Interior Minister Iskender  Gamidov, he is the leader of the Bozkurt [Gray Wolves]  organization -- maybe there are also Bozkurts from Turkey too in  this organization, I don't know -- charged in and smashed the  television studio. Could there be worst violation of democracy  then this? Yet, Abulfaz Elchibey said nothing about it. If  Abulfaz Elchibey or Isa Kamberov [the former chairman of the  parliament] were guarantors of democracy they should have  punished him that very day, because this was the worst sort of  violation of democracy. It was violated in the most gross  manner. They beat up hundreds of people in the past and sent  them to hospitals during rallies in [Baku's] Azadlyg Square on  orders from Iskender Gamidov and Azerbaijani leaders. Why was  it was not said then that these were violations of democracy?  But now there is not a single person or deputy jailed for his  views.    Each person says and writes whatever it likes. There is  democracy here. The PFA is not the embodiment of democracy, and  democracy does not equal the PFA. Democracy is a larger  concept. Turkish democracy draws its principles from  international democracy evolved over centuries. I, as a  political personality, have always been a democrat. You should  not believe that there were no democratic people in the  Communist Party. There were such people and they are now active  in politics in Russia and everywhere else.    Thank you. I believe that you will work to publish in your  papers and other information organs objective and correct  information on the present situation in Azerbaijan. Because  some Turkish news media and papers publish wrong information.  This is not helpful. Everything should be correct. [video  shows Geydar Aliyev and reporters sitting around oval table]</p>

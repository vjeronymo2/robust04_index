			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOUISE SEEKS TO BETTER HER LIFTS AT FESTIVAL  </P> <P> Heat and weights hang heavy in the air each time Carole Louise plows through  her weight-lifting regimen in a prop room beneath the auditorium at Van Nuys  High.  </P> <P> The makeshift gym, home to the Van Nuys Weightlifting Club, boasts three small  plywood platforms squeezed between the planks, tables, paint buckets and  assorted production materials strewn about the floor.  </P> <P> Louise, however, does not seem to mind.  </P> <P> The 31-year old La Crescenta resident believes the spartan facility lends  itself to success because it is devoid of health club props such as glistening  chrome machines, stationary bicycles and bottled water imported from the French  Alps.  </P> <P> "To do this sport, you accept some of the strange things and the hardships,"  Louise says. "That's part of the mystique.  </P> <P> "The thing it gives you more than anything else is self-confidence. If I can  lift almost 200 pounds over my head, then I figure I can pretty much do  anything."  </P> <P> On Friday, Louise will attempt to lift more weight than she ever has before  when she begins competition in the U. S. Olympic Sports Festival in Oklahoma  City.  </P> <P> Louise, 5-foot-9, 180 pounds, is competing in the women's 82.5-kilogram (182  pounds) weight division, which is one class below the super-heavyweights.  </P> <P> Last April in Houston, Louise finished third in her class at the women's  nationals. Her goal at the Olympic Festival is to surpass personal bests of 139  pounds in the snatch -- in which the bar is lifted overhead in one unbroken  movement -- and 188 pounds in the clean and jerk -- in which the bar is brought  to the shoulders and then pushed overhead.  </P> <P> "I'm not thinking too much about winning because I'm still gaining experience,"  Louise said during a workout last week. "I'll consider it a successful trip if  I can improve my PRs (personal records) and technique."  </P> <P> Outfitted in blue Lycra shorts, an old red polo-style shirt and red and white  weight lifters' shoes with built up heels and rounded toes, Louise repeatedly  grasps, lifts then drops the weighted bar to the floor.  </P> <P> Louise was a multi-sport athlete at Crescenta Valley High and threw the javelin  for Valley College, but she never attempted serious weight training until she  got out of school.  </P> <P> Eight years ago, she was exercising on machines in a health spa when, Louise  recalled, "This guy saw me and he said, 'You wanna lift some real weights?' "  </P> <P> She joined the Van Nuys Weightlifting Club, a group of about 10 lifters  supervised by Bob Takano, a biology teacher at Van Nuys High.  </P> <P> Louise, however, quit after only three months when she suffered a back injury.  </P> <P> She did not return until February of 1988.  </P> <P> "I was almost 30," Louise recalled. "I looked in the mirror and said, 'We gotta  do something quick.' "  </P> <P> Louise returned to the Van Nuys club where she works out four to five times a  week with other members such as Diana Fuhrman, who is first in the nation and  fourth in the world in the 67.5-kilogram (148.5 pounds) weight division.  </P> <P> "Carole had a lot of strength to begin with, but at first it was something she  was doing to get in shape," said Fuhrman, who is also participating in the  Olympic Festival. "I still would like to see her dedicate more time than she  does now."  </P> <P> Louise, however, is already strapped for time.  </P> <P> Her "day" begins at 2:30 a.m. when she reports to work as a mail handler for  the Postal Service. After eight hours of "swinging 40-pound sacks on and off  trucks," she sleeps for a few hours before driving to Van Nuys for her  workouts.  </P> <P> Motivation is not always easy to come by.  </P> <P> "Sometimes, I have to force myself to come here," Louise said. "But once you  get here and work up a little sweat and see some progress, it makes it OK."  </P> <P> It's also OK for women to lift weights, build muscle and be proud of it, she  said. Conveying that message to men and other women is one of Louise's primary  goals.  </P> <P> "Millions of women in this country are screwed up because corporate America has  this vision of what a woman is supposed to look like," Louise said. "I just  want women to know they can be big and strong.  </P> <P> "I'm in my 30s and feel like I'm in my prime. And I think I'm going to be in  better shape when I'm 40."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by official spokesman; date not given] </F>   [TEXT] 1. We have been closely following the developments  in the Korean Peninsula. We trust that all the parties  concerned will exercise the maximum restraint so that peace and  tranquility can be maintained in the region, and existing  tensions can be eliminated.    2. We follow with great interest the current mission being  undertaken by former president, Jimmy Carter of the U.S. and  hope that the positive first steps which have been achieved can  be further built upon.    3. India abstained on the resolution adopted by the board of  governors of the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] last  week, our view being that punitive measures adopted in the  United Nations or elsewhere could exacerbate matters at this  stage, making a resolution of the issue more difficult. We hope  that negotiations will continue through which a way will be  found to peacefully resolve this crisis.</p>

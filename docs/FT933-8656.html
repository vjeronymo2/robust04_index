			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Airlines agree Heathrow deal BRITISH MIDLAND and American Airlines are joining forces in the battle for more passengers by introducing 'code-sharing' on the UK carrier's services from Heathrow to Brussels, Amsterdam and Glasgow. The agreement, announced last night, is an important move for both airlines and is aimed at attracting passengers who might otherwise have travelled on British Airways. BA is a leading rival of American on transatlantic routes and of British Midland on routes between the UK and continental Europe. Code-sharing has become increasingly common in the airline business over the past year. US carriers are not allowed to fly passengers into London and then on to other European destinations, but listing a European airline's connecting flights under a common code or number makes passengers more confident about making connections. Under yesterday's agreement, American will use its 'AA' designator code on certain British Midland flights from Heathrow as a continuation of its own flights from six US cities - Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Miami, Chicago and Los Angeles. Mr Austin Reed, British Midland's managing director, said: 'Developing closer links with long-haul airlines is one element in our strategy to develop more business worldwide. As the second-largest user at Heathrow, we are ideally placed to transport worldwide inbound traffic to the major cities of Europe.' British Midland has a similar code-sharing agreement with United Airlines, which has worked successfully for the past year. United had no comment yesterday, but British Midland said the two arrangements would work side by side. Earlier this year big US airlines complained that they were put at a competitive disadvantage when the US government let BA enter into a code-sharing agreement with USAir. British Midland has filed an authorisation request with the US Department of Transport for the code-sharing deal.</p>

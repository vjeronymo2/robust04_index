			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Estonia protests at 'invasion threat' Mr Juri Luik, the Estonian foreign minister, yesterday accused Russia of threatening to invade his country by issuing veiled warnings that the former Soviet garrison in the Baltic republic might be reinforced. He told a meeting of the Western European Union in Luxembourg the Russian statements were 'unacceptable if not ludicrous' and said they should be denounced by the international community as open intimidation. He was referring to a statement last Friday by General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister, that Moscow could 'provide reliable security' for its bases in Estonia if political circumstances changed. Estonia was one of nine nations from the former eastern bloc admitted yesterday as 'associate partners' in the WEU, the loosely-knit defence grouping which is gradually acquiring strength. The new status will give the ex-communist countries consultation rights at the WEU but no defence guarantees. It marks an important step for the European Union as it tries to strengthen its political and military ties with eastern Europe and the Baltic states without alienating Russia. All six states - including the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania - as well as the Baltic trio are being treated as future EU members. Talks between Russia and Estonia about withdrawing the 2,600-strong garrison broke down last week and Moscow said it would not name a date for renewing them until the Baltic republic came up with more 'constructive' proposals. Earlier, the two sides had agreed in principle on a withdrawal date of August 31. Estonia says a formal agreement was ready to sign at the end of March, but Russia unexpectedly started reopening old questions. The main sticking point has been the rights of 'retired' Russian officers in Estonia, seen by the Baltic republic as a potential cover for the retention of a covert military and intelligence presence. According to Estonian estimates, the 10,600 residents of the republic who draw Russian military pensions include 1,000 people under the age of 50, and 360 who are below 45. Among the latter group are paratroopers and counterintelligence officers in their 30s. Estonia insists it will not follow the example of Latvia, which secured a troop withdrawal deal by passing up the right to vet the military pensioners on its soil and granting Russia access to an important radar station. Tallinn is resisting new Russian demands for the retention till the year 2000 of 200 military personnel at the sensitive naval and nuclear reactor base of Paldiski. The three Baltic republics have set up a joint peace-keeping battalion which uses English as a working language and is receiving help from Britain. Other providers of military knowhow to the region include Sweden and Finland, which yesterday backed away from their traditional neutrality and joined the 'Partnership for Peace' devised by Nato.</p>

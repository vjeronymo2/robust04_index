			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rezear Xhaxhiu] </F>   [Text] The Nano question was again placed at the center of  the news conference that Socialist Party [PS] leaders gave for  radio and mass media reporters today.    The statement issued by the General Steering Committee of  this party, which was read by Bashkim Zeneli, considered the  trial against Fatos Nano as a trumped-up trial that was  finalized with an unjust decision.    The statement said that this decision was a logical result  of  an antidemocratic mentality of the present power and a  consequence of the total submission of the judicial power to the  political one.    Signed by members of the PS General Steering Committee, the  statement considers Fatos Nano being locked in jail as an open  wound in the body of Albania. The more it stays so, the  statement ends, the worse it will be for Albania and the future  of democracy.    Further on, they passed onto questions posed to the trio  Pellumbi-Dokle-Zeneli, who addressed the conference.    Asked whether the Council of Europe representatives  expressed  interest on Nano's trial and the Nano question in general, Mr.  Dokle answered that their interest was very special, but he did  not prefer to give details of this stance maintained at a  meeting that a group of socialist deputies held today with the  Council of Europe envoys.    Answering another question, Dokle said that we will follow  the judicial course of the Nano question, such as the appeal and  the supreme court's verdict, though according to him, they do  not cherish any special hope regarding the latter.    Asked whether Nano will remain the PS chairman and whether  it  is possible for him to lead the party from prison, the deputy  chairman of the socialists, Servet Pellumbi, said that it is not  a preoccupation whether Fatos Nano should be substituted or not.  However, the trial showed that he has not besmirched his figure  and the party he leads. That is why, Pellumbi continued, we see  no reason to substitute him in the high post appointed by the  congress.    He continued saying that the PS has no rigid concept of  management by only one person, but in a collegial way.  According to Pellumbi, friends have taken it upon themselves to  compensate for Nano's absence.    Asked where the PS sees political elements in the Nano's  trial, at a time when the indictment, summation, and verdict  showed clearly the misappropriation of large sums and the  falsification of official documents by Fatos Nano, Namik Dokle  answered in a laconic way: The Nano question is a judicial  attempt to eliminate the opposition.    In continuation, Pellumbi, Dokle, and Zeneli answered a  series of questions from the audience that were related to early  elections, the new political steps that the PS will undertake  after the conviction of its chairman, its stance toward  Albania's acceptance into the Council of Europe, and the  existence of factions in the PS. Regarding the latter, Pellumbi  answered that this cannot happen in the PS, because this party  has been formulated as a real democratic party with free  opinions and different stances.</p>

			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> SAMARKAND, ANCIENT CITY OF AZURE AND GOLD, THRIVES ALMOST UNNOTICED;  </P> <P> MUSLIM ASIA: ALEXANDER THE GREAT, GENGHIS KHAN AND MARCO POLO ONCE ROAMED THE  NEIGHBORHOOD. RUDYARD KIPLING LABELED THE REGION 'THE BACK OF BEYOND.'  </P> <P> Under a white mulberry tree, amid the aroma of roasting kebabs, wizened men in  coats of many colors stare at chess pieces that might not have moved since  Genghis Khan went home.  </P> <P> If it's a bustling city of mainframe computers and brain surgeons, Samarkand is  also a Tower of Babel exuding mystery, an air of high intrigue from its ancient  days as a world capital.  </P> <P> At the juncture of crosscurrents washing over Muslim Asia, it is emerging from  70 years as a Soviet backwater. But authorities worry that this is a mixed  blessing.  </P> <P> "Samarkand is a living anthropology museum, unique in the world," said Sergei  Kapitza, a Soviet scientist and television personality. "It is among the most  fascinating places anywhere."  </P> <P> At the same time, he added, it is an ethnic powder keg. The city's diverse past  jostles the present, threatening a future that few venture to predict.  </P> <P> Once it was remote, two time zones southeast of Moscow near the Afghan border  in the region Rudyard Kipling called "the back of beyond." Now, in a smaller,  turbulent world, its role has changed.  </P> <P> The Russians who came as conquerors and colonizers are beginning to go home,  leaving behind economic distress and communal tension.  </P> <P> Samarkand recently declared itself 2,500 years old after historians, probing  its earlier roots, threw up their hands. It was a center of world power before  Columbus found America.  </P> <P> Camel caravans bringing Chinese silks to Europe quickened their pace on nearing  the gleaming city, a thriving oasis with all the comforts of its day, a blend  of Islamic piety and secret sin.  </P> <P> It was already a metropolis, ringed by 10 miles of ramparts, when Alexander the  Great wrecked the place in 329 BC. Genghis Khan found splendid urban renewal  900 years later, and he torched it.  </P> <P> Tamerlane, a legendary 14th-Century ruler of Turkish origin, built soaring  towers and domes, finished in azure tile and gold leaf. Scientists and scholars  gathered to explore the universe.  </P> <P> For centuries afterward, Samarkand was picky about its visitors. It was a hub  on the Silk Road, but infidels were sometimes put to death. It fell to the  czars' armies only in 1868.  </P> <P> At the height of the Cold War, Kremlin strategists sold its charms to group  tourists, who were separated from local people as assiduously as they were  separated from their hard currency.  </P> <P> Perestroika was to have brought a tourist boom. As nationalist tensions run  high in Central Asia, however, authorities fear that they may face an explosion  of another kind.  </P> <P> In the ancient center and the surrounding modern sprawl, 390,000 people of 90  ethnic backgrounds cling to old customs that blended partly as a result of the  firm hand of government.  </P> <P> Residents are largely Uzbeks, people of Mongol and Turkish roots who settled in  many centuries ago, and Tadzhiks, ethnic Persians whose ancestors built the  city.  </P> <P> There are also Russians who came as pioneers and professionals over the last  century, along with Kazakhs, Turks, Bukhara Jews, Germans and scores of others.  </P> <P> So far, Samarkand has escaped the pogroms, ethnic skirmishes and random  violence that have killed more than 1,000 people over the last year in  Uzbekistan and neighboring republics.  </P> <P> "We have been living together here for so long that we are used to each other,"  said Davlat Sittar, an Uzbek university student who speaks fluent Russian and  Tadzhik.  </P> <P> But reports of upheaval nearby have stemmed the tide of foreign tourists  expected with relaxed Soviet travel restrictions.  </P> <P> Last April, Moscow radio reported ethnic riots in Samarkand which, in fact, did  not happen. Uzbek newspapers reacted angrily but could not repair damage to the  city's image.  </P> <P> And, according to local dissidents who spoke only if promised anonymity, the  potential of sudden flare-up lies just beneath the surface.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Soviet officials say they are confident that Samarkand's stunning  beauty and exotic flavor will draw more visitors than the city can handle.  </P> <P> Even now, the Hotel Samarkand fills to capacity during the balmy months of  spring and fall. Intourist is building a large new luxury hotel nearby in a  joint venture with Indian investors.  </P> <P> Each morning, busloads of Americans, Germans and Japanese clog the mud lanes  running past monuments that have astonished visitors for centuries.  </P> <P> Ancient Samarkand sits in moldering glory at the center of the modern Soviet  urban blur that spreads from its edges. Its main plaza is a dramatic square of  arches and domes in rich colors.  </P> <P> Tamerlane, the master builder and tyrant, lies blocks away under a gracefully  shaped, fluted cupola tiled in the deep blue and gold hues that were his  trademark.  </P> <P> Across town, a complex of blue-domed mausoleums line a sunken alley 100 yards  long, each elaborately inlaid with ceramic mosaics, semiprecious stones and  hardwoods.  </P> <P> The old market sprawls from the magnificent ruins of the Bibi Khanum mosque to  the outdoor teahouse where old men spend the day chatting and picking their  toes.  </P> <P> Many visitors find it as exciting to watch the people as the architecture.  </P> <P> Men, Muslims and Jews alike, favor a white-embroidered black square skullcap.  Robe styles date back to the first draft of the Bible. But there are also calf  roper's baseball caps, faded designer jeans and Mickey Mouse T-shirts.  </P> <P> Most women dress to tradition, in cape-like garments of cotton or silk in vivid  patterns. Baggy pants reach below the ankles. Some women, mostly Russians,  venture out with low necklines and high hems.  </P> <P> All styles and colors blend in the market, a dusty sprawl of ancient brick, tin  roofing and rickety stalls. Men doze at tables laden with spices. Women hawk  fat red strawberries, mysterious grains and the Uzbeks' distinctive wheels of  tasty flat bread.  </P> <P> Samarkand is rich in legendary hospitality. On winding back streets, families  make room at dinner tables, even wedding parties, for tourists who stop to show  interest.  </P> <P> In fact, a smiling and gentle exterior masks ominous undercurrents that  outsiders must probe to fathom.  </P> <P> Newly established opposition parties, such as a grass-roots Uzbek movement  called Birlik, or Unity, agitate for sovereignty and a return to Asian roots.  Some organizations go further.  </P> <P> "We are many, and we are growing," confided one dissident, a Tadzhik  entrepreneur, who agreed to speak anonymously only after cautious  introductions. He described underground groups that seek a total break with  Moscow.  </P> <P> "Lithuania is a textbook, and we are reading it carefully," he said. But unlike  the Baltic states, he added, Uzbekistan had a high potential for sustained  violence.  </P> <P> His own group is dominated by Tadzhiks who argue that since they built  Samarkand, Soviet planners should have put it in Tadzhikistan, not Uzbekistan,  and it is never too late to change.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> France has asked Syria to extradite wanted Nazi war criminal Alois Brunner, the  French Foreign Ministry said. Nazi hunter Serge Klarsfeld, who tracked Brunner  to Syria 16 years ago, described him as the most important Nazi war criminal  still alive. Brunner has been accused of organizing the deportation of 100,000  Jews from Germany, France and Slovakia to Nazi death camps during World War II.  There have been reports that Brunner, 76, is responsible for reorganizing  Syria's secret services. Syria says it has no knowledge of him. Brunner,  sentenced to death in absentia by a French court in 1954, has been described as  the right-hand man of Adolf Eichmann, the Nazi official who masterminded the  extermination of Jews.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yerevan, April 18 (SNARK)--Armenian President's  Acting Press Secretary Levon Zurabyan declares that through  Azerbaijan's fault the chance to achieve the guaranteed  armistice was lost though such chance existed at the Moscow  meeting of the CIS members' leaders.    Speaking at today's briefing he also mentioned that  Azerbaijan's signing the Russian-sponsored agreement will bring  to profits for all the sides: Armenia will be deblockaded,  Nagorno-Karabakh will get all the security guarantees,  Azerbaijan will get the territories.    Zurabyan also mentioned that the participants of the Moscow  summit will supply Russia with the CIS mandate to realize its  peacekeeping initiatives in Karabakh.    Answering the SNARK's question on Karabakh participation in  signing the agreement, Levon Zurabyan said if Azerbaijan  expresses its readiness to sign the agreement the Karabakh  representatives' participation will be ensured.</p>

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: CME, LSE agree on futures listing THE Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the London Stock Exchange have reached an agreement to allow the CME to list futures and options on futures on the FT-SE 100, Eurotrack 100 and Eurotrack 200 share indices. The CME's move into foreign index products aims to attract more institutional investors who are seeking ways to manage the risks of their increasingly international portfolios. According to Lipper Analytical Services, which tracks mutual funds, the assets of US mutual funds that invest in Europe, for example, have more than doubled to Dollars 3.5bn at the end of 1991, from Dollars 1.3bn at the end of 1989. The number of funds increased over the same period to 28 from 15. Foreign investment by US pension funds has also soared. Intersec Research, which monitors investments by pensions funds and other tax exempt entities, said overseas assets of US tax exempt investors rose to Dollars 93bn by 1990, of which Dollars 74bn was in equities, from Dollars 27bn, with Dollars 24bn in equities, in 1985. The success of the CME's Nikkei 225 Japanese Stock Average future is a gauge of the demand for foreign index products. Launched at the end of September 1990, CME trading in the Nikkei has grown steadily, with daily average volume rising to 976 contracts in 1991 from 765 last year. The CME had long hesitated to launch the Nikkei 225 futures for fear that, with the differences in time zones, the lack of a concurrent cash market in the underlying index would inhibit futures investors and traders. But this concern has been neatly demolished with the success of the Nikkei futures. The new CME contracts, which will enjoy concurrent trading with the cash market in London for a portion of the day, will require US regulatory approval before they can be launched. But CME officials hope to begin trading them inside four months. The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) has already won regulatory approval to trade the cash market options on these indices. The CME, the leading US futures exchange for index products, is home to the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Stock Index. It also will launch soon futures and options in S&amp;P's MidCap 400 stock index of mid-sized companies. The primary market for futures on the FT-SE indexes is the London International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe). For traded options it is the London Traded Option Market (LTOM), which is due to merge with Liffe in March. The CME plans to work with the Options Clearing Corporation, which clears CBOE trades, to agree on cross-margining of FT-SE futures and options between the CME and the CBOE. The two exchanges have had an agreement on cross margining on the S&amp;P 500 index since 1989.</p>

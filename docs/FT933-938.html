			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / World Bank/IMF Meeting: IMF preparing S African loan THE International Monetary Fund is preparing an Dollars 850m (Pounds 551.9m) loan to South Africa under its compensatory and contingency financing facility, writes Peter Norman. Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, said at the weekend the Fund was already helping South Africa with policy advice. The CCFF loan, which is now the subject of preliminary discussions, would offset export losses caused by the drought in the region. He said the IMF was ready to provide further financial support. However, it was up to the South African authorities to decide how much they wished the Fund to be involved in economic transformation.</p>

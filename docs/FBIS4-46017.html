			<p>BFN     [Text] Islamabad, May 26 -- Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto  said on Thursday that Islamabad had given counter proposals in  response to U.S. suggestion that Pakistan should allow  non-intrusive inspection of its nuclear installations.    "The question of non-intrusive inspection is an American  proposal and we have given counter-proposals based on a regional  solution," Ms Bhutto said at a news conference on her return  from Nepal.    She was asked to comment on a recent statement of Foreign  Minister Sardar Assef Ahmed Ali in which he had said that  Pakistan was ready to allow non-intrusive inspection of its  nuclear installations.    Denying that the foreign ministor had made any such offer,  she said: "Pakistan will not accept any unilateral solution or  proposal."    Questioned whether President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari would  be discussing the nuclear issue with American officials during  his current visit to the United States, the Prime Minister said  though the President's visit was a private one, "we are using  this occasion to have informal talks with U.S. officials and to  explain Pakistan's position on the nuclear issue."    Ms Bhutto said she would also be visiting the United States  by the end of this year. "I hope it will be a substantive  visit."    The Prime Minister said the Pressler Amendment, which debars  Pakistan from getting U.S. military and economic aid, was a  discriminatory law, "and we want it should go." [sentence as  received]    Ms Bhutto said Pakistan shared US concern over nuclear  proliteration, "but we feel the Pressler Amendment is a veto in  the hand of India."    She said Pakistan and the United States were cooperating in  anti-narcotics campaign and defence of human rights, and added  that the two could move in the nuclear non-proliferation field  provided a regional approach on this issue was agreed upon.    Pakistan, she said, was anxious to improve its relations  with  the United States, but hastened to add that it did not want to  do so just for having F-16 fighter aircraft.    "We don't want one-dimensional relationship. It should be a  multi-dimensional one," she asserted.    Ms Bhutto said Pakistan had supported America during Soviet  invasion of Afghanistan. "We have defended freedom in  Afghanistan and we are cooperating with the United Nations in  its peacekeeping preparations in Somalia and other parts of the  world," she said, while calling for closer relationship between  the two countries.    She said her government was building Pakistan as a modern  Islamic state where rule of law would be supreme. She said a  society would be built where women would have an equal role to  play. A women's police station had already been set up and  women's courts would also be established, she said.    Answering a question, Ms Bhutto said she wanted the  opposition to cooperate with the government on three main issues  -- Pakistan-U.S. relations, Pakistan-India ties and the nuclear  issue. "On these three subjects we (the government and the  opposition) should have a unified stand," she said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Kurdistan Parliament is a  civilized accomplishment. It must remain a symbol of democracy  and accord in Kurdistan. The two years since the election of  this parliament have been rife with a series of malicious plots  and intrigues concocted by the enemies of our Kurdish people.  It succeeded in confronting all these problems through sincere  and arduous efforts and appropriate decisions.    The current stage puts historic responsibilities on  Parliament, responsibilities that require it to play an  effective role in unifying the views of the two main parties in  Kurdistan: The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK] and the  Kurdistan Democratic Party [KDP] and to do all it can to  normalize the situation.    Our final word is that the masses of Kurdistan elected the  Parliament and trust in it. Anyone who believes in the masses  and respects their aspirations will believe in the Parliament,  respect its sanctity, have recourse to it, and consider working  through it to be a civilized way of overcoming problems and  warding off dangers.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "China's Role and Responsibility"] </F>   [Text] The East Asian countries and the rest of the world  are focusing attention on China's role regarding the North Korea  nuclear issue following the sudden aggravation of North-South  relations with the rupture of the North-South working-level  contact. Having signed a friendly and cooperative agreement,  China is in a position to greatly influence North Korea.    It has been learned that while he was in Beijing, Japanese  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa met with Chinese state leaders,  including PRC President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng, and  asked them to persuade North Korea to fully accept international  nuclear inspections.    Prior to the Japanese prime minister's Beijing visit, U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher visited Beijing last week  and agreed with the Chinese side to jointly cooperate on  resolving the North Korean nuclear issue. Now, the countries  concerned have formed an international cooperation system to  check North Korean nuclear development.    As noted by Qiao Zonghuai, PRC Ambassador to the ROK, it is  the Chinese official position to oppose the international  community's strong steps against North Korea, including UN  Security Council sanctions. We would like to stress a point,  however, that the North Korean nuclear issue will have a serious  impact not only on the Korean peninsula, but also on all East  Asian countries, including countries surrounding the Korean  peninsula. Japan -- which shows the most sensitive reaction to  the North Korean nuclear issue -- has said on many occasions  that it cannot but develop nuclear weapons if North Korea's  nuclear development is not checked. Also, it is showing signs  of strengthening its military capacity, such as by forming a  regional security network, to deal with North Korea's  development of long-range missiles. If the North Korean nuclear  issue remains a factor of unrest in this area, regional economic  cooperation -- including Japanese-PRC economic cooperation,  which is to be announced following Japanese Prime Minister  Hosokawa's visit in China, and ROK-PRC economic cooperation --  will be seriously affected and this will adversely affect  China's reform and opening policy that it is now actively  carrying out.    We would like to stress the role and responsibility of  China,  which is one of the leading countries throughout the world,  rather than the regional economic cooperation in East Asia,  including the support for China's openness. As a permanent  member state of the UN Security Council, which is aimed at  global peace, China should assume international responsibility  for the North Korean nuclear issue. If the North Korean nuclear  issue is referred to the UN Security Council and, as a result,  the international community imposes sanctions on North Korea,  China -- which opposes international sanctions against North  Korea -- will be placed in a difficult situation. Therefore, it  is better for China to persuade North Korea to meet the demands  of the international community. This will also meet the demands  of China for the settlement of the North Korean nuclear issue  through peaceful methods and dialogue.    China will not use "the North Korean nuclear issue card"  multi-laterally to improve relations with foreign countries, we  urge it to persuade North Korea to accept nuclear inspections.  This is because we are concerned that the North Korean nuclear  issue may cause constant unrest in peace and stability on the  Korean peninsula, as well as East Asia, including China. To  avoid such unrest, it is imperative for China to participate in  the international cooperation system carried out by the ROK, the  United States, and Japan and to carry out its responsibility and  role as a great power in the international arena.</p>

			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRISES FIND OUR HEADS IN THE SAND;  </P> <P> IN A MODERN WORLD, OUR RESPONSES ARE WAY OUT OF DATE  </P> <P> Once again, we have been hit by a series of "seemingly unrelated" crises.  </P> <P>  -- A death threat is directed against British author Salman Rushdie by Iran's  Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, in turn endangering freedom of speech in the  United States.  </P> <P>  -- Following a telephoned threat, the federal Food and Drug Administration  imposes a ban on Chilean produce after trace amounts of a poison are found in  two grapes.  </P> <P>  -- There is widespread fear that U.S. apples in particular and fruit in  general may be widely contaminated by a broad range of cancer-causing  pesticides.  </P> <P>  -- A tanker runs aground outside the port of Valdez, Alaska, causing the  largest oil spill in American history and endangering one of the most fragile  and beautiful ecological areas in the world.  </P> <P> All are more related than they appear. And all contain some strong lessons  about all crises.  </P> <P> Lesson No. 1: All crises are now either global or have the potential to  escalate very quickly up to the global level. Before the advent of modern  telecommunications and jet travel, an incident of the magnitude of a Tylenol  product-tampering, a computer-generated stock market crash, the Rushdie  incident or the banning of Chilean grapes either would not have happened or  would have been much less significant. Today, a psychopath can hop on a jet and  contaminate foodstuffs and pharmaceutical products in multiple cities in one  day. That's why the threat of nationwide product-tampering has to be taken so  seriously. In this regard, improved telecommunications and travel are mixed  blessings, to put it mildly.  </P> <P> Lesson No. 2: Denial is still disturbingly high. Terrorism, environmental  accidents, product-tampering, etc., are still thought to be specific to certain  industries or, worse, someone else's problem. Six months or a year ago, someone  talking to the major New York book publishers about the possibility of their  industry being hit by a major incident of international terrorism would  probably have been met with laughter or shrugged shoulders.  </P> <P> Lesson No. 3: We have to bump from crisis to crisis until finally it dawns that  no industries are exempt. All are subject virtually to every known kind of  crisis.  </P> <P> Lesson No. 4: We invent and put into place complex technologies before we know  how to control them or think about controlling them. Only after they fail do we  then think of better methods of control. In the case of the oil spill in  Valdez, our preparations for reacting to a spill have proven to be as fragile  as the environment they were supposed to protect. Or consider the highly  sophisticated, computerized trading programs that speeded up the volume of  stock market transactions. Only after these systems played a significant role  in the October, 1987, stock market crash did we ask the important question:  "What organizational controls should we have put in place in case the  technology doesn't work?"  </P> <P> Lesson No. 5: Our current institutions are a major part of the problem. We have  mass media and computer systems that can spread information so quickly that  they can shut down a nationwide food system at the drop of a hat. At the same  time, we don't have sophisticated information systems (although the technology  is available) whereby as many of the affected parties as possible (i.e., the  representatives of the Chilean and U.S. governments, the FDA, the FBI,  retailers and distributors) can communicate freely to one another before,  during and after a crisis in order to weigh collectively the best courses of  action before one party, acting on its own, shuts down the whole system. It  seems to take from 30 to 70 years after a new technology has been invented to  create the appropriate institutions capable of managing it. This gap is no  longer tolerable because crises not only happen with increasing frequency, but  also because they are larger in their effects. We have to find better ways to  learn and to redesign our institutions faster.  </P> <P> Lesson No. 6: Lacking better institutions and control mechanisms leads to "all  or nothing actions," such as taking all grapes off the market. It is akin to  termite eradication before modern treatment methods: Either burn your house  down or leave it alone, thereby potentially contaminating the whole  neighborhood. When you have little or no controls, there is almost no room for  graduated responses.  </P> <P> Lesson No. 7: The worst time to invent social-control mechanisms is in the heat  of a crisis. Armies have learned long ago that soldiers need basic training  before they go into battle. While basic training may not be perfect, it lowers  substantially both the physical and the mental casualties of war.  </P> <P> Lesson No. 8: We're running 21st-Century systems of vast technological  complexity with outmoded 19th-Century thinking. In the 19th Century, it was  appropriate to think and manage by "containment and isolation" because, for the  most part, crises were confined in space and time.  </P> <P> Eventually, like we always have, our thinking (we hope) will catch up. But how  many more crises will it take before we finally realize that, in every sense,  it is no longer business as usual? Nothing less that a total redesign of our  institutions is needed so that we and they can not only react, but prevent  these crises from occurring in the first place. If we do not, then the  mega-crisis may be the only area of production in which the United States will  continue to lead the world.  </P></p>

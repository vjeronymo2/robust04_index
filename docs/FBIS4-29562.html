			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 19 (KCNA) -- The South Korean  puppets perpetrated provocations against the North by bringing  heavy weapons and armed bandits into the Demilitarized Zone  (DMZ) along the military demarcation line Friday and Saturday,  military sources said.    Armed bandits of the puppet army Friday deployed recoilless  guns in the DMZ in the central sector of the front and took a  firing posture toward a post of the North on the opposite side,  seriously threatening the safety of people's army soldiers.  Some 300 puppet army soldiers entered the DMZ and created a  terrible war atmosphere Friday and Saturday.    In the period from June 11 to 18, the South Korean puppets  illegally brought a total of 4,700 armed bandits and 1,300  vehicles intothe DMZ for war exercises, search and building of  military setups including positions.    The reckless military provocations of the South Korean  puppets in the DMZ are a deliberate and premeditated move to  artificially aggravate the situation in this region and ncite  North-South confrontation.    The South Korean puppets must refrain from rash acts,  clearly  mindful of the grave consequences of the aggravation of the  situation on the Korean peninsula.</p>

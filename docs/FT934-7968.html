			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / World News in Brief: Fan dies as British teams fail to qualify A football supporter died in Cardiff after being hit by a firework which was launched across the pitch as Wales - beaten 2-1 by Romania - failed to qualify for next year's World Cup finals. England manager Graham Taylor (left) saw his team beat San Marino 7-1, but England lost any chance of gaining a place when Holland beat Poland 3-1 in another game in their qualifying group. The Republic of Ireland secured their place by drawing 1-1 with Northern Ireland.</p>

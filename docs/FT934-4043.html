			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / UK Company News: S&amp;P drops launch of high income unit trust Doubts over the ability of high income unit trusts to offer double-digit income have been raised by the sudden decision of Save &amp; Prosper to scrap plans to launch such a trust. S&amp;P's abandonment of the high income unit trust comes just weeks before its launch in the New Year and was attributed to a lack of confidence that investors' capital would be preserved. Mr Ken Emery, S&amp;P's technical director, said yesterday: 'We have been running models with dummy portfolios for some time and in the end we were not confident such a high level of income could be achieved without eroding capital.' S&amp;P had been looking at the feasibility of a cocktail of financial products that could produce a 10 per cent income for a high income fund. Typically, such funds - which are offered by Foreign &amp; Colonial and Morgen Grenfell - employ options, shares and cash. But S&amp;P's decision to drop the new product poured doubt on the feasibility of generating high income while preserving capital. 'We found that there is a half-life, although the rate of the erosion is difficult to calculate because of variable interest rates,' said Mr Emery. However, Mr Nigel Legge, managing director of James Capel Unit Trusts, maintained that high income unit trusts were not necessarily a minefield that investors should avoid but the element of risk should be appreciated. 'The issue is how opaque they are. It is a question of how clearly products like these should be presented.' Mr Legge said that while large returns on investments in equities are proven, that message is not always understood by investors. 'Shares are by far the best asset to beat inflation and I'm not sure that is generally realised.' And he added that when derivatives enter the equation in a unit-trust product, then the task of making transparent that product to investors is exacerbated. S&amp;P has not abandoned the idea of a double-digit unit trust but prospects of offering one are slight. 'We will keep it under review but unless we see something new it is highly unlikely,' said Mr Emery.</p>

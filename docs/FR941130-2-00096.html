			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> TVA proposes to implement an alternative unescorted access control system which would eliminate the need to issue and retrieve badges at the entry point and would allow all individuals with unescorted access to keep their badges with them when departing the site. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An exemption from 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) is required to permit contractors to take their badges offsite instead of returning them when exiting the site. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The Commission has completed its evaluation of TVA's application. Under the proposed system, each individual who is authorized unescorted access would have the physical characteristics of their hand (hand geometry) registered with their badge number in the access control system. When an individual enters the badge into the card reader and places the hand on the measuring surface, the system would record the individual's hand image. The unique characteristics of the hand image would be compared with the previously stored template to verify authorization for entry. Individuals, including TVA employees and contractors, would be allowed to keep their badge with them when they depart the site. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on a Sandia report entitled ``A Performance Evaluation of Biometric Identification Devices`` (SAND91_0276&hyph;UC&hyph;906 Unlimited Release, Printed June 1991), and on its experience with the current photo-identification system, TVA demonstrated that the proposed hand geometry system would provide enhanced site access control. Since both the badge and hand geometry would be necessary for access into the protected area, the proposed system would provide a positive verification process. Potential loss of a badge by an individual, as a result of taking the badge offsite, would not enable unauthorized entry into protected areas. TVA will implement a process for periodically testing the proposed system to ensure continued overall level of performance equivalent to that specified in the regulation. The Physical Security Plans for all plants will be revised to include implementation and testing of the hand geometry access control system and to allow TVA employees and contractors to take their badges offsite. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TVA has determined that the proposed hand geometry access control process for identifying personnel meets the American National Standard ANSI/ANS&hyph;3.3, ``Security for Nuclear Power Plants'' criteria. It will provide the same high assurance objective regarding onsite physical protection as provided by the photo-identification process now in use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The access process will continue to be under the observation of security personnel. A numbered pictured badge identification system will continue to be used for all individuals who are authorized access to protected areas without escorts. Badges will continue to be displayed by all individuals while inside the protected area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Commission concludes that this proposed action would result in no significant radiological environmental impact. With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, the proposed action does not affect non-radiological plant effluents and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant non-radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Alternative to the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> As an alternative to the proposed action, the staff considered denial of the proposed action. Denial of the application would result in no change in current environmental impacts. The environmental impacts of the proposed action and the alternative action are similar. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Alternative Use of Resources <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> This action did not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statements related to operation of the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant, dated September 1, 1972; the Sequoyah Nuclear Plant, dated February 13, 1974; or the Watts Bar Nuclear Plant, dated December 1978. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Agencies and Persons Consulted <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The NRC staff consulted with the State of Tennessee and Alabama regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> Finding of No Significant Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption. Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission has concluded that the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further details with respect to this action, see the request for exemption dated October 24, 1994 which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC; at the local public document room located at the Athens Public Library, South Street, Athens, Alabama (for the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant); and at the Chattanooga-Hamilton County Library, 1101 Broad Street, Chattanooga, Tennessee 37402 (for the Sequoyah Nuclear Plant and the Watts Bar Nuclear Plant). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 22nd day of November 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=4 --> Frederick J.

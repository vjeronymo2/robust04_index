The poem is written on a scroll made of vellum paper 45 by  94  centimetres on the background of Kimchongilia.    The following explanation is attached to the poem:    The dear leader Kim Chong-il, the sun of chuche, embarked on  a glorious road in his early years with grand aspirations to  accomplish the cause of chuche through generations. This is  vividly shown in the poem "Ye, Korea, I Will Let You Shine"  recited by him earnestly in his days of Kim Il-song University.    We are widely distributing this poem out of the desire to  foster the soul of chuche and the resourcefulness of the nation.    "Reading the poem, people said, `Let Us Hold in High Esteem  the Dear Leader Kim Chong-il, the Great Sun of the Cause of  Chuche', vowing to bring earlier the day of reunification when  they will enjoy happiness, guided by him generation after  generation," the radio said.</p>

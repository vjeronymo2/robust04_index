			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Letter: Oil companies' right to fear supermarkets Sir, Guy de Jonquieres and Neil Buckley ('Supermarkets vie to fill up tanks as well as trolleys: an increase in shopping around for petrol is worrying oil companies', September 28) may have inadvertently misstated some realities. The average supermarket petrol site sells six times the volume of petrol sold by a conventional petrol station. Petrol is a significant contributor to profits for Sainsbury's and Tesco. In a price war between supermarkets and oil companies, the former would win hands down. They are not burdened by the oil companies' overheads. It was no surprise to this company, which has produced a motorist's guide to petrol, that an important oil company refused to co-operate with the production of unbiased consumer information.

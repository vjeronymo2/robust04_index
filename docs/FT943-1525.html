			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Alfred McAlpine at Pounds 3.1m for eight months Alfred McAlpine, the housebuilding and construction group, yesterday reported a rise in pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.1m for the eight months to June 30. The company has changed its year-end to December and for the six months to April 30 1994 there were pre-tax profits of Pounds 894,000 against losses of Pounds 2.74m. Turnover for the eight months was Pounds 449.7m, against Pounds 316.6m for the six months to April 1994. The dividend is held at 3p, payable from earnings per share of 3.1p. The company raised Pounds 25m from shareholders in June in order to fund its land purchasing programme. Net debt at June 30 stood at Pounds 49.5m, representing gearing of 27 per cent. Sir John Milne, the chairman said that the contracting and construction division continued to endure tough trading conditions, resulting in operating losses for the eight months of Pounds 1.95m on turnover of Pounds 291.6m. For the corresponding six months of the previous year there were operating losses of Pounds 121,000 on turnover of Pounds 148.3m. Mr Ken Lever, finance director, said it would be some time before the division returned to the black. 'There are a lot of contracts being undertaken on low margins. It may be 1996 before we see any return to profitability.' He added that the company was keeping under review all areas of its contracting business and those unable to show a potential to return to profits faced possible closure. He refused to elaborate on which areas of the business were most susceptible. The strong recovery in the housing market in the early part of the year had weakened during June and July, Mr Milne said, but higher sales reservations in August boded well for the traditionally stronger market in the autumn. Operating profits in the housing division were Pounds 7.82m on turnover of Pounds 82.7m. For the first six months last year, the figures were Pounds 2.04m and Pounds 43.04m respectively. Mr Lever said the division would remain the engine of growth for the group while the rest of the business stabilised. In the US, an operating loss of Pounds 545,000 was reported on turnover of Pounds 50.2m. Mr Lever said improvements in the contracting business would enable the US business to return to profitability in the second half, although it would not improve on 1993's contribution. Then pre-tax profits came in at Pounds 1.68m and operating profits were Pounds 1.33m.</p>

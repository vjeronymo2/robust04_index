			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Diesel submarine finishes last patrol The Royal Navy's last diesel-powered submarine, HMS Unicorn, sailed into mothballs yesterday - just 15 months after being accepted into service. The move is a result of the end of the Cold War. When Unicorn was designed the Cold War was still on and the role of the Upholder Class was to release nuclear submarines for tackling other Nato roles.</p>

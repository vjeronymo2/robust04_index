			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] The historic Farakka Day is being observed today.  Eighteen years ago on May 16, 1976 the late leader of the  suffering people, Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhasani, brought out  a huge procession comprising several hundred thousand people to  demand an equitable share of the Ganges River water. People  from all walks of life in Bangladesh from Teknaf [southernmost  tip of the country] to Tetulia [northernmost tip of the country]  joined this long march, which was led by Maulana Bhasani. This  long march started at 1000 from Dhaka on May 16. The  processionists travelled (?456) miles and made an overnight halt  at Chapainawabganj [District]. On the morning of May 17 when  this procession marched toward the border at that time the whole  path was converted into a huge sea of agitated people. The  procession stopped at a spot [name indistinct] about three miles  inside the border at 1600. On that day, the people of South Asia  and the whole world witnessed through this massive procession  the demand raised by the people of Bangladesh for a fair share  of the waters of the Ganges River. The world was amazed to see  this huge procession by the people of this country to realize  their legitimate share of the water of an international river.  The world had extended its support to this cause of the people  of Bangladesh long before this procession took place.    The adverse effect created in Bangladesh due to the  construction of the Farakka Barrage on the Ganges River is now  discernible. The situation has further deteriorated. Vast  tracts of land in Bangladesh are becoming deserts due to this  withdrawal of the Ganges water at Farakka. The part of the  Ganges River that flows into Bangladesh is known as the Padma.  This Padma was once a mighty river, and the people living along  its banks led a very affluent and prosperous life. The part of  Bangladesh through which this river flows was once lush, green,  and full of crops. At present, these coastal areas have been  turned into deserts. The vast bed of the Padma River has now  turned into a desert and has become sandy. Many parts of the  Padma River have also become grazing ground for cattle. The  river has become totally unnavigable in several areas. The level  of underground water in the areas adjoining the Padma River has  fallen tremendously due to the shortage of water in the river.  This has led to the destruction of agricultural lands and  trees. Scarcity of water in the river has also severely  affected navigation and shipping transport. This has directly  affected the life of about 30 million people living on the banks  of the Padma River and has posed a threat to their livelihood.    This situation has created a negative impact on the economy  of a least developed country like Bangladesh. Bangladesh wants  to be relieved from this unbearable situation and demands its  legitimate share of the water of the Ganges, which is an  international river. Bangladesh is making efforts at the  bilateral level for a peaceful settlement of the water sharing  issue. In this regard, several meetings were held in India and  Bangladesh at different levels. It is unfortunate that no remedy  has been found yet for this problem. [Words indistinct] This  Ganges River problem is a life and death problem for about 30  million people in Bangladesh.    Since the present democratic government came to power, it  has  been holding direct talks with the Indian Government at  different levels with a view to resolving this Ganges water  sharing problem. So far the talks have not yielded any positive  results. On the other hand, the talks have become long and  drawn out. During her visit to India, Prime Minister Khaleda  Zia held talks with the Indian prime minister, Narasimha Rao, on  the issue of resolving this Ganges water problem. India gave  its assurance that it would take active measures to resolve this  problem. After this, several rounds of talks were held between  the officials of the two countries for working out a solution to  the problem, but no progress has been made. Bangladesh has  raised this issue regarding the sharing of the Ganges River  water at the Commonwealth summit, the Nonaligned Movement, and  in various international forums. It has also held talks with  different countries of the world seeking their active  cooperation in securing an equitable share of the Ganges River  water. The world has extended its support to the demand raised  by Bangladesh for an equitable share of the Ganges River water.  Diplomatic efforts have also been made for a peaceful solution  of the Ganges River water problem but no progress has been made  in this regard.    Today is 16 May. It commemorates the historic Farakka Day.  On this day, the people of Bangladesh demand an early solution  to the water sharing problem -- which is their life and death  question. This demand was also raised at the discussion  meetings, seminars, symposia, and rallies held today in  observance of the day. The Ganges water sharing issue is solely  a humanitarian problem. It is not a political problem. It  would be inhuman to consider this problem as a political issue.  We hope that in the interest of good neighborly relations,  India will take effective measures for an early solution to this  problem.</p>

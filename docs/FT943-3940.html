			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Dairy trade launches court battle The dairy trade will this week begin its legal battle to overturn new milk marketing arrangements which it believes will force up retail prices and bring in a flood of imports. The Dairy Trade Federation, which represents milk processors, intends today to submit to the High Court its case for judicial review of the government's approval of the scheme. The hearing to decide whether it has an arguable case is expected later this week or early next week. Dairy companies are challenging the selling system introduced by Milk Marque, the farmers' voluntary co-operative, which takes over when the statutory Milk Marketing Board is abolished on November 1. They say the auction system, under which they have tendered for supplies from Milk Marque, has increased their costs by up to 24 per cent for some dairy products. Mr John Price, director-general of the federation, said its lawyers would argue that Mrs Gillian Shephard, then agriculture minister, was wrong on two counts under the 1993 Agriculture Act when she approved arrangements for opening up the Pounds 3.3bn market in England and Wales in June. 'No reasonable minister knowing what she and her officials knew at the time could possibly say this purchasing system took account of the interests of purchasers,' he said. Even if she believed that, Mrs Shephard was wrong to assume the scheme took account of consumers' and farmers' interests and would lead to competition in milk marketing, he said. The dairy trade argues that Milk Marque, which controls 65 per cent of supplies, has a monopoly of the market. Because of European Union milk quotas, British farmers can produce only 85 per cent of domestic dairy needs, and processors say they have little choice but to buy the bulk of their milk from Milk Marque at the prices it sets. Last week Tesco, the supermarket group, said UK price rises would force it to buy dairy products from continental Europe. If the federation wins leave for a judicial review, it hopes its case will be judged next month before November's planned market deregulation.</p>

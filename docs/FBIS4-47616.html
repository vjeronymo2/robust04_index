(Jerusalem AL-NAHAR  25 Mar 94)      West Bank Journalists Expect Heavy Censorship Under Self-Rule      West Bank journalists believe that the new Palestinian authority  will heavily censor the West Bank-Gaza press under self-rule.  According to Al-QUDS journalist 'Ali Jiddah, "Very regrettably, I  say that in the coming phase, the Palestinian press will not be in  better condition than its current condition.... I say this by virtue  of my full awareness of the Palestinian forces' miserable history of  democratic action.  Moreover, the incoming government will focus its  efforts on cementing and entrenching the mainstays of its rule,  which necessarily means that it will try to curb the voice and echo  of the forces that are likely to pose a threat to this government  and to its authority.... especially since the statements of some  Palestinian officials point in this direction.  I particularly note  Hakam Bal'awi's statement on how the opposition will be dealt with  in the future."      Journalist Ghazi Bani 'Awdah comments: "I don't believe that  press conditions under the self-rule government will be  fundamentally different from the current conditions.  All signs  indicate in one way or another that oppression and persecution will  be the lot of any voice or pen that writes about real issues and  that doesn't sing the praises of autonomy....Let us learn a lesson  from the recent expulsion of Hijazi, a journalist, from FILASTIN AL-  THAWRAH and from numerous other incidents."  Majid 'Aruri from  Sanabil Press Bureau in Ramallah says: "Autonomy will employ its  authority to prevent the emergence of any voices that criticize  autonomy.  This task will be easy in the absence of a press union  body capable of confronting this policy.  The union body (the  Journalists League) is controlled and dominated by the group  supporting self-rule, even though it incorporates other parties.  However, these parties' role is ineffective and not influential."  According to journalist Hani al-'Isawi from AL-QUDS, "If there is a  press under self-rule, it will be a yellow press, i.e., government  press, solely.  It is feared that whoever violates this (rule) will  be pursued.  Therefore, there will be no need for a special press  censor, because all agencies under autonomy will be in the service  of government propaganda solely."  (Jerusalem AL-BAYADIR AL-SIYASI  26 Feb 94)      National Institutes Office on Merger With PLO      Dr. Samir al-Tamimi, head of the Office of National Institutes in  Gaza and the West Bank, says that PLO institutions and those in the  West Bank and Gaza Strip will merge during the transitional period.  He listed the most difficult aspects of the merger as:      1) Determining the positions of local organization and their  leadership (personality conflicts are feared).     2) Changing institutions from personal fiefdoms (which he says is  predominant) to organizations of common concern.     3)  Financial difficulties (from which the institutions currently  suffer).     4)  Proliferation of similar institutions which provide the same  services (they must have unified national institutions).      Dr. al-Tamimi said that he is trying to get a study done on how  these institutions will be merged, and he expects that his office  will meet with the PLO to plan the merger at some point in the  future.  He pointed out that West Bank and Gaza institutions are the  foundational institutions, and that the external institutions are  its branches.  He said that the idea of forming the Office of  National Institutes sprang from the need to have a centralized  office to oversee and organize cooperation between local  institutions and PLO institutions.  Previously, al-Tamimi said,  local institutes suffered from a lack of direct contact with the  PLO.  In addition, there were many institutes doing similar work  under different names, which he considers a waste of time and money.  He divided West Bank-Gaza institutes into the following categories:  cultural, authors, journalists, arts, women, students, charitable,  teachers, clubs, youth, workers, educational, engineers, refugees,  refugee camps.  (Jerusalem AL-NAHAR 19 Mar 94)      Plan for Industrial Zone in Nabulus      Husam Hajjawi, the head of the Nabulus Chamber of Commerce,  announced at the Chamber's most recent meeting that steps are being  taken to establish an industrial zone in Nabulus.  Hajjawi said that  the need for a Nabulus industrial zone arises from the high price of  land in the area which has hindered industrial investment, and the  60 percent-plus unemployment rate among the city's workforce.  He  said that the cost of constructing the industrial zone will be  between $15 and $20 million, according to preliminary estimates, and  that contact has been made with European and American investors.  The European Union has said it will finance a portion of the zone's  expenses, and American Near East Refugee Aid (ANERA) is reportedly  prepared to offer $1 million immediately for the implementation of  the first phase of the project.      According to Hajjawi, building and engineering industries are the  most important industries for the zone in view of the anticipated  construction activity during the transitional period, when it is  expected that at least 150,000 to 180,000 housing units will be  built.  This will necessitate factories for such products as  electrical wiring, cable, aluminum, and doors.  Hajjawi acknowledged  that there will be stiff competition from Israeli industries, and  that Palestinian workers will need training.  He said that a plan is  being drawn up to create specialized training institutes in  cooperation with West Bank universities and institutions.     The Nabulus Chamber of Commerce has encountered some difficulties  with the Israeli Government regarding plans for the industrial zone:  The Israelis have required that the zone's administration be run by  the private sector and not by the public sector, thereby delaying  implementation of the project.  However, Hajjawi said, many  investors have agreed to participate, and efforts continue to  establish a zone run by the public sector.  (London AL-SHARQ AL-  AWSAT 1 Apr 94)      New Director of Palestinian Housing Council      The new director of the Palestinian Housing Council in Jerusalem  is Engineer Mahmud 'Abd-al-'Aziz, who has spent his career at the  Khatib and 'Alami Engineering Consulting Company overseeing West  Bank projects.  (Jerusalem AL-NAHAR 23 Mar 94)      Jordanian Employees Complain of Unpaid Salaries      Employees of the Jordanian Cooperation Organization in the West  Bank have sent letters to King Husayn and other Jordanian officials  complaining that their salaries have not been paid in nearly a year,  causing extreme hardship for them and their families, and asking  officials to look into their case.  Jordanian Cooperation  Organization employees remain on the job in the West Bank, and the  organization continues to task them with a substantial amount of  work, which they continue to do.  (Jerusalem AL-NAHAR 22 Mar 94)      Population Study Compares Number of 'Martyrs,' Births in Gaza      According to a study done by researcher Rishad al-Madani, there  were approximately 207,600 births in Gaza between the time the  intifadah began in 1987 up through the end of 1993.  During the same  period, there were 594 "martyrs" in Gaza.  The study concludes that  for every "martyr" who died in Gaza during this period, there were  349 births.  The distribution of births by year is as follows:  9  December to 31 December 1987--1,470 births; 1988--27,375 births;  1989--32,463 births; 1990--33,142 births; 1991--36,364 births; 1992-  -37,041 births; 1993--39,745 births.  (Jerusalem AL-NAHAR 23 Mar 94)      Jordan Turns Away Islamic University Administrator      Dr. Salah al-'Awur, head of the history department at the Islamic  University in Gaza, was turned away at the Jordanian border when he  attempted to attend an Arab universities history department  conference at Jordan University in Amman.  Dr. al-'Awur sent Dr.  Salah al-Bahth to attend the conference in his place.

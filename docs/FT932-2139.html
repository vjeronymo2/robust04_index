			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / EC agrees on road charges for hauliers THE BIGGEST liberalisation of the European Community road haulage market was agreed late on Saturday night by transport ministers of the 12, filling in one of the most gaping holes in the EC's single market. Agreement on a common system of charging trucks for using EC roads unlocked an accord by the 12 to phase in road cabotage  - allowing hauliers from one member state to pick up and deliver goods within another member state. National restrictions mean that about one in three EC trucks returns empty after delivering its load, making a mockery of the single market's proclaimed goal of free movement in goods and services and adding to transport costs and road congestion. The deal means that hauliers will increasingly be able to ply for trade throughout their trips across Europe, a right confined at the moment to those possessing scarce licences covering less than 1 per cent of the main national haulage markets. The present level of 18,530 licences will be raised to 30,000 in January next year. It will then be increased by 30 per cent annually until unrestricted cabotage comes into effect on July 1 1998. Mr John MacGregor, UK transport minister, said as the deal was about to be struck at midnight on Saturday: 'It's a bit late, but we've completed the single market in transport.' Mr Robert Coleman, head of the European Commission's transport directorate, described the road transport package as 'the most difficult harmonisation problem we have had to solve'. The deal was made possible when Germany, the Benelux countries and Denmark agreed on a common fee, or 'vignette', for trucks over 12 tonnes using their motorways and principal roads. Germany had refused to open its roads to outside competition until common charging had been agreed. Bonn's attempt unilaterally to impose a DM9,000 (Pounds 3,600) annual road charge on non-German trucks was outlawed as discriminatory by the European Court of Justice in May 1992. On Saturday, the 12 agreed on a maximum annual road user's fee of Ecu1,250  -around a quarter of the German level  - reviewable every two years. The five countries that are going ahead with the system from January 1995 will operate a regional 'vignette' to be displayed on the windscreens of trucks using their road system. Nine of the 12, including the UK, have already signalled their intention eventually to introduce road charging, and Saturday's agreement also encourages member states to bring in road user charges for cars. Mr Matthias Wissmann, the German transport minister, hailed the agreement as 'a great breakthrough for Europe', reminding his colleagues that Germany started pushing its partners on road charging in 1968. 'For the first time, we will have a fair attribution of costs for trucks in Europe,' he said. Germany will get 73 per cent of the proceeds from the vignette, with 13 per cent going to Belgium, 9 per cent to the Netherlands, 4 per cent to Denmark and 1 per cent to Luxembourg. Germany has said it intends to devote the proceeds to modernising its railway infrastructure. A daily charge of Ecu6 (Pounds 4.75) for infrequent road-users was also agreed, beaten down from Ecu8 by peripheral countries including Greece, Ireland and Portugal. A weekly and monthly rate is to be agreed later. The road charge system is part of a package aimed at making transport costs more equal, to prevent unfair competitive advantage when cabotage comes into effect.</p>

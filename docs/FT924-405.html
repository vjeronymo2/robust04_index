			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Setback for fur trade opponents THE BANK accounts of Lynx, the animal rights group that campaigned against fur farming, were yesterday ordered to be frozen by the High Court. The order came after Lynx lost a libel case and was unable to pay damages and costs. A High Court jury decided that the group, in literature circulated to MPs, had wrongly accused Swalesmoor fur farm, near Halifax, West Yorkshire. Damages of Pounds 40,000 were awarded, along with costs put at over Pounds 100,000. Mr Mark Glover, a founding director of Lynx, said it expected a winding-up order to be sought against it.</p>

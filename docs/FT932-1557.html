			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Observer: The empire bites back What must ex-Lonrho chieftain Terry Robinson be making of the decision by his present masters, the Vesteys, to look for a new chief executive as well as a chief financial officer for their empire? That's not to say the move is unwarranted. Faced with similar problems, most big family companies would have sent for outside help long ago. Moreover Robinson himself was imported 18 months ago to save the empire's biggest province, the Union International meat business. Perhaps because he is doing such a good job, the Vestey cousins Edmund and Sam have decided that what they need now is a professional top boss coupled with a financial panjandrum to head a new management company which will oversee Robinson's business, their shipping interests and any other family silver lying to hand. While Robinson's name has not been ruled out, the Vesteys intend to search high and low for the right person to take overall control. So perhaps Robinson has been too sharply critical of the family regime to be deemed a trusted retainer. Be that as it may, the summoning of headhunters seems to have killed young Tim Vestey's chances of automatically inheriting the top job on his return from Cranfield Business school. The new job has its attractions. After all, the empire has a Pounds 1.5bn turnover and any chief executive will be well rewarded. There is even a hint that the Vesteys might want to unlock some of their wealth via a stock market float one day. The downside is that the business owes its bankers much money. Running a family business is never a dream of ease, especially when the owners don't always see eye to eye. And in this case, if Robinson feels he is being undermined, it could be a nightmare.</p>

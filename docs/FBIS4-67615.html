			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Gloomy Forecast"] </F>   [Excerpts] Brasilia--About 43 million people throughout the  world will be infected with the AIDS virus by the year 2000.  That figure is from the WHO, which estimates that 90 percent of  the cases at the start of the next century will occur in the  developing countries. Brazil alone will have 87,000 new cases  over the next two years. During that period, 85,000 people will  die of HIV. [passage omitted]    Of the 43,964 cases recorded in Brazil so far, 10,198 were  detected in 1992 alone. "One feature of AIDS is its spread to  other groups. Its incidence among women and children is rising,"  Lair explained, and she also mentioned the growing use of drugs  by young people.    In an attempt to reverse the AIDS situation in our country,  the Federal Government will spend $250 million on prevention  campaigns over the next four years. Of that total, $160 million  will come from an agreement signed with the World Bank. "The  rest of it--$90 million--will be Brazil's share," says Minister  of Health Henrique Santillo.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |AIDS Cases in Brazil                                                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cases From 1980 to 1993                                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Region                                |Number                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Southeast                             |33,901                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |South                                 |4,294                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Northeast                             |3,523                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Center-West                           |1,765                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |North                                 |481                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Total                                 |43,964                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |States most affected                                                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |State                                 |Number                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Sao Paulo                             |25,617                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Rio de Janeiro                        |6,208                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Rio Grande do Sul                     |2,149                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Minas Gerais                          |1,683                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Parana                                |1,212                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Bahia                                 |970                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------    <H5>  Campaign To Alert Young People </H5>   Worried by the steadily rising incidence of AIDS among young  people between the ages of 13 and 25, the Federal Government  chose yesterday -- the World Day of Struggle Against AIDS -- to  launch a nationwide campaign targeting young people and aimed at  preventing the disease. In addition to two films that will be  shown through the 12th of this month to inform young people  about AIDS, the Ministry of Health has also begun distributing  six million condoms throughout the country.    "The main means by which the AIDS virus is transmitted to  the  young population are basically sex and the use of drugs," says  Lair Guerra de Macedo, coordinator of the National AIDS Control  Program. Showings of one of the films began yesterday on a  national network. It shows a girl putting condoms in her purse  before going out to meet her boyfriend. "You lose nothing by  using a condom. Not even pleasure," says the film at the end.  Another video that will also be shown shows a naked man taking a  shower. As he steps out of the shower, he sees a trail of  condoms leading to the bed where his girlfriend is. "The films  are suggestive and encourage people to use condoms," says Lair  Guerra.    But even though the number of drug users as a percentage of  all AIDS cases in Brazil has increased from 2 percent from 1986  to 26 percent this year, Planalto Palace vetoed a part of the  campaign showing drug users how to sterilize needles and  syringes. Considered "too strong" by President Itamar Franco's  advisers, that 30-second video explained how to wash the  syringe: twice in cold water, twice in bleach, and twice again  in cold water. At the beginning of January [1994], the Federal  Government will launch a new campaign aimed at the general  public.</p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Training success rate improves THE number of adult jobless people getting jobs or gaining qualifications has started to improve, Lisa Wood writes. The number of people leaving Employment Training last July with a qualification was 43 per cent, compared with 36 per cent the previous year, a government survey shows. The number going into jobs or further education was 39 per cent compared with 34 per cent 12 months before. Employment Training, which has been amalgamated with Employment Action, the work-experience scheme, since April, has been criticised because of its poor success record. Before it was handed over to the Training and Enterprise Councils, which have modified programmes to local needs, it was run by the Department of Employment.</p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / International Company News: Aegon plans health care merger AEGON, the second largest insurance group in the Netherlands, plans to merge its Dutch health care insurance subsidiary with Nuts, a domestic mutual health group, in a bid to increase its market share and take advantage of economies of scale. The new insurer, to be called Nuts-Aegon, will be the second-largest private health insurer in the Netherlands, after Zilveren Kruis, with annual premium income of around Fl 570m (Dollars 300m). Aegon will hold slightly less than 50 per cent of the new company's shares, with Nuts owning the rest. Together, Aegon and Nuts handle the health insurance of nearly 500,000 people in the Netherlands. The planned merger, which is due to take effect in January 1992, follows the breakdown of talks in late 1990 between Aegon, Nationale-Nederlanden and Delta Lloyd on co-operating in health insurance. The talks foundered after Nat-Ned announced plans to merge with NMB Postbank and to use its new distribution channel to sell insurance alongside its traditional links with independent insurance brokers. Delta Lloyd, a subsidiary of Commercial Union of the UK, intends to use some of Nuts-Aegon's services, starting with such areas as computer processing and the buying of health care at hospitals and clinics.</p>

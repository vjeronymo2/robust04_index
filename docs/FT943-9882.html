			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / US halves allowable levels of asbestos The US government yesterday cut by half the level of asbestos permissible in the workplace. The ruling came in the announcement of a long-awaited set of regulations affecting 4m workers in the construction, car repair and shipbuilding industries. The change, by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the US labour department, was prompted by a 1988 court ruling stemming from a 1986 union law suit which challenged the previous tolerance level as 'dangerously lax' and one which exposed workers to unsafe amounts of the carcinogen. 'With these new rules, we now have in place a regulatory structure that will result in very significant reductions in deaths due to cancer and in costs to society,' said Mr Joseph Dear, assistant secretary of labour. The labour department estimates 42 cancer deaths a year will be prevented under the new rules. The new level of permissible exposure will be 0.1 asbestos fibres per cubic centimetre of air over an eight-hour exposure period. The new regulations will cost the private sector Dollars 361m (Pounds 230m) to implement, Mr Dear said, far less than the Dollars 15bn price-tag for the mandatory government inspections the department opted against. The new rules do not require building owners to remove asbestos but instead focus on training maintenance and construction workers how to safely work around materials containing asbestos. Along with the 3.2m construction and maintenance workers, there are new standards affecting 685,000 car mechanics, who work with clutch and brake systems containing asbestos, as well as 1,000 shipbuilders.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The press secretary of the commander of the Russian  border troops, Colonel Aleksandr Suvorov, told INTERFAX that  visa control posts along the Russian-Chechen border cannot be  opened. He said this in response to the proposal made by the  Chechen Foreign Ministry to the Russian Foreign Ministry.    A Chechen diplomat referred to the fact that while crossing  the border official government delegations of the Chechen  republic "face obstacles."    According to Suvorov, under Article two of the Resolution of  the Russian Supreme Soviet of March 1, 1993 the status of the  Russian state border is given only to administrative borders  with republics of the former Soviet Union. This article does  not apply to Chechnya.    Currently, there are no Russian border troops along the  administrative border of Chechnya and the Russian-Georgian  border at its Chechen section. In this connection, no obstables  to citizens, transport or cargoes can be posed by border guards  in these parts, Suvorov said.</p>
